1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, Paul, it's great to have you back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you so much for making time.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Obviously, at the time that we're recording this, I know you're busy with some news that we'll get to later.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But nevertheless, it seems like it's about the right time for us to pick up this discussion again, because the last time we spoke, we were just on the cusp of watching a number of vaccines.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hit that first phase of early use authorization as we stand here today.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I actually can't tell you the numbers, but you know, tens of millions of people have been vaccinated.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And in some ways, there are still a lot of questions.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's start with just an update the lay of the land for people, broadly speaking, right?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Four strategies for science.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I think that's a really good question.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I think that's a really good question.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And I think that's a really good question.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can update the lay of the land for people, broadly speaking, right?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Four strategies for scientific strategies in place to create vaccines.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
One of them is an mRNA vaccine, which we'll talk about.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The second, something that's a little more tried and true, at least something that's been done a number of times before using an adenovirus to deliver DNA.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The third is delivering directly purified protein of the virus.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the fourth, probably the oldest trick in the book, is using live attenuated virus.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Can you give us just a broad overview of where each of those four are and maybe what it says about the scientific challenges of the approval process for each?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Right. So at least in the United States, the messenger RNA vaccines are the farthest along.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We approved, the FDA vaccine advisory committee approved the Pfizer messenger RNA vaccine on December 10th, the Moderna messenger RNA vaccine on December 17th.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And they then rolled off the assembly lines and into the arms of the American public, such that now you have more than 120 million people who have received at least one dose of an mRNA containing vaccine.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So that's the farthest along. It's certainly in this country.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In terms of the adenovirus vectors, the replication defective adenovirus vectors, there's the replication defective simian adenovirus vector, which is that that was put forward by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford in the UK, that it's partnered with AstraZeneca.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then the Johnson & Johnson product, which is Janssen, that is the wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. And that's a replication defective adenovirus type 26.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So the ad 26 vector had been used fairly extensively to try and slow the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. So about 200,000 doses had been administered in West Africa.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That vaccine, now we have more than 6 million doses of that that's been given in the United States.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then with regard to the AstraZeneca vaccine, tens of millions of doses have been given in the United Kingdom as well as in Europe.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Certainly more than 20 million doses overall have been given of that vaccine.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In terms of the purified protein vaccine, probably the company that's the farthest along is Novavax. They use a baculovirus expression system.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So basically you have a baculovirus into which you insert, in this case, the genocodes for the coronavirus spike protein.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And that's grown up into in butterfly cells, basically, Spedoptera, Frugi, Peridot cells. It's the exact same way we make flu block.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There's a lot of experience using that technology to make a vaccine. Those studies have been largely completed, but the Novavax has been fairly slow to gain any sort of approval yet, to my knowledge, anywhere yet.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Live attenuated viral vaccines are not, they're still in the works. I don't know of any live attenuated viral vaccine that is now being routinely given to anybody in any country in this world, but I could be wrong.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I haven't heard that. I know people were working, a number of groups were working on it. And then there's the whole killed viral vaccine, which is the product that's used by China, which has been extensively given to now, again, tens of millions of people, which is the way that we make the polio vaccine, the inactivated polio vaccine, or the hepatitis A vaccine, or the rabies vaccine.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So again, a lot of experience with that product. There's some question about how effective it is. I should also add that the Russian vaccine is also a replication effective adenovirus vaccine.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In that case, ad26, human ad26 followed by human ad5. So those are the strategies that are currently winding their way through the world.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And is it safe to say, Paul, that the either that the whole killed is probably, I actually mistakenly said that the attenuated because I tend to lump that in with whole killed, but really whole killed is the first play that's really initiated vaccination.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Is that kind of the oldest trick?

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, the oldest, oldest trick is a live non-human virus. I mean, the cowpox was the first vaccine in the late 1700s. So basically the thinking there was that not that it was thinking at all since this was the late 1700s before we actually knew what viruses were.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I mean, it was just phenomenology. But now we know that the cowpox virus is energetically related close enough to human smallpox that immunization with one can protect you against disease caused by the other.

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But you're right. The second strategy was the whole killed virus strategy. That was 100 years later in the late 1800s in France with Louis Pasteur making the whole killed rabies virus vaccine.

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I remember my mom reading me that story when I was a little boy, actually, I was I could listen to that story every single night of because it had pictures of him, you know, taking the serum from the dog and killing the virus and giving it to the boy.

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can still actually see every part of that book.

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So, you know, one of the things that I hear a lot of is, you know, that mRNA thing is crazy. This is totally sci fi. It's completely experimental. Why would anyone subject themselves to something that is so risky and so unproven?

46
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A little while ago, I wrote something on this topic, trying to make the point I don't know how convincing it was that actually it's not as experimental as people think and that this technology has been around for decades, plural.

47
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And that the only thing that's new is that this is the first time the final step has been made, which is actually taking a virus that is of concern to humans, sequencing it and then putting it into a clinical practice.

48
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But this notion of using mRNA has, you know, this didn't just come out of nowhere. This wasn't something that was developed in 12 months, as one might believe, if they weren't really following the science too closely.

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you find yourself confronted with the same type of question?

50
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes, and the reasonable question. I mean, I think, you know, it is a new era of vaccinology. I mean, we just went through that briefly, but it's arguably the fifth error.

51
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I mean, you go to initially sort of animal strains that are related to humans, then you go to the inactivated vaccines, then you go to the live attenuated viral vaccines, then you go to purified protein vaccines.

52
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What all those four strategies have in common is that you're giving the viral protein that you're interested in. I mean, in this case, we're interested in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

53
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And when you give that protein in one form or another, whole virus or in a live attenuated virus or just purified protein itself, you know, you're giving that protein, the viral protein, then the person makes an antibody response to that protein.

54
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're not doing that here. You're giving the gene that codes for the viral protein that's translated in the cytoplasm to the viral protein.

55
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So your body makes the viral protein, then your body makes an antibody response.

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And you can see why people are concerned because it's the term that is used correctly as it's a genetic strategy. You're giving a gene.

57
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And the minute you say that to people, that's often interpreted as something that could, you know, could interfere with your genes or, you know, reorient or reengineer your genes.

58
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's the way people hear that. They hear it as gene therapy. And in a sense, it is kind of gene therapy, but not in the more traditional way that it's meant.

59
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So what is the best answer you have to someone that says, look, I'm not worried about acute toxicity or even subacute toxicity because given how many tens of millions of people have received both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine.

60
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I think anybody can say unequivocally there can't be any complications in the short run that are clinically relevant.

61
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I mean, we just there's been too many people vaccinated to know that, oh, my gosh, you know, zero point zero zero one percent of people are going to suffer some horrible complication.

62
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But it's not necessarily clear that there can't be some really long term complication that doesn't show up for a year or two years or three years.

63
00:08:39,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So and therefore, I think to your point, it is a reasonable point of concern to say, well, this is still very new and we don't have 10 years of data the way we would if this strategy were deployed through a traditional non-emergency use approach for something like influenza where we didn't have to rush because we have so many other strategies.

64
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So my question is, what would you say to reassure somebody that in five years we're not going to learn something horrible about inserting coronavirus mRNA into ourselves?

65
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
All right. So there's two ways I would answer that. The first is, can the messenger RNA in any way alter our DNA?

66
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because I think that's at the heart of what people are worried about. And then that comes up later in some form or another.

67
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's not possible for three reasons. First of all, when the messenger RNA is taken up by cells in our body, it's primarily something called dendritic cells, which is the major kind of antigen presenting cell in your body that presents cells, presents antigens to the immune system, to the rest of the immune system.

68
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So it's taken up, it's in a lipid nanoparticle, the lipid nanoparticle is taken up in the cell, it's stripped away, and then that messenger RNA enters the ribosomal system, where like the other couple hundred thousand copies of messenger RNA that are in your cytoplasm, it's then translated to a protein.

69
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And that happens over days. And then the messenger RNA, like all messenger RNAs, breaks down and is no longer making that protein.

70
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So the question then is, can the messenger RNA get into the nucleus and in any way alter the DNA, which it cannot do for three reasons.

71
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
First of all, it has to be able to cross the nuclear membrane, which requires a nuclear access signal that it doesn't have.

72
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Secondly, even if it got into the nucleus, it's RNA, it's not DNA. So in order to affect DNA, it has to be converted to DNA, which means which requires an enzyme like reverse transcriptase, which it also doesn't have.

73
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Even if it was converted to DNA, which it can't, because it can't cross the nuclear membrane and it can't be basically reverse transcribed back to DNA, it still has to insert itself into the DNA, which requires an integrase enzyme that it also doesn't have.

74
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So it's not possible. You have a better chance of developing X-ray vision if you've gotten this than you have of the mRNA in any way altering your DNA.

75
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Although I never understand why people when they say that it alters your DNA doesn't think it can alter your DNA for the good, like making you Spiderman, for example, or something like that.

76
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
People never talk about that. So that's one thing. I think that's not possible. The second thing is long term effects.

77
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I guess I would challenge, we have these discussions at the CDC a lot with people who have a lot of experience with this, name that serious adverse event that's associated with vaccines that has not been picked up within two months of getting a dose.

78
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And there are. I mean, vaccines like any medical product that have a positive effect and have a negative effect, including a severe negative effect.

79
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And so, for example, the the Swalene Adjutant influenza vaccine that was used in Europe for the 2009 pandemic, one of those vaccines, so-called pandemics, could actually cause narcolepsy.

80
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I mean, it was rare, about one per 55000 people, but it was real. And it again occurred within six weeks of getting a dose.

81
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The oral polio vaccine that was created by Albert Saban to basically eliminate a polio from this country could itself cause polio.

82
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It could actually revert to essentially a neuro virulent or wild type virus and cause polio again, what happened within a few weeks of a dose.

83
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The influenza vaccine is a rare cause, roughly one per million. And for polio is about one per 2.4 million doses, but influenza about one per million doses can cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is an ascending paralysis, which can be severe and occasionally fatal.

84
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Again, occurs within six weeks of a dose. The yellow fever vaccine in roughly one per million people, depending on which strain you use, can cause something we call viscerotropic disease, which is a nice way of selling, saying yellow fever.

85
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I mean, the yellow fever vaccine can cause yellow fever, much the same way the oral polio vaccine could cause polio again within a week or so of getting the dose.

86
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, so I don't know of that serious side effect that that causes long term problems.

87
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It is true that some of these, most of these side effects, all of these side effects are so rare that when they occur, they only occur when they're in tens of millions of people. And then you can see that.

88
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But, but that's why for every vaccine you, you know, you have to wait for two months after the second dose or whatever the last dose is to make sure it's still safe.

89
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And that was true of all these vaccines going out. I mean, we're going to get to the issue, I think later in this broadcast with Johnson and Johnson vaccine. But again, that issue came up within two weeks of a dose.

90
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, I just want to make sure that for the for the listener, we really highlight the salient point here, which I think is actually the first point that you made, because I do think that for most people who are, I think, hearing a lot of misinformation.

91
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's coming through the channels of people who don't really understand enough biology to sort of explain exactly how messenger RNA is translated into protein.

92
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And of course, that's what we want here and how we don't have any of the machinery to enable the reverse.

93
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let's talk a little bit about HIV as a virus because HIV actually can undergo some of this process. So maybe use HIV as as a counterpoint. And also let's dovetail that into how failed attempts to create a virus for HIV, pardon me, to create a vaccine for HIV.

94
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why is that not possible? And what has that taught us about the current strategy here? A lot packed into that question, I realize.

95
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, I would say if I had to pick what I think is the most heinous virus that was ever created, it would be HIV because it does two things. First of all, when you're first infected with human immunodeficiency virus and it begins to reproduce itself, you make an antibody response to that virus that neutralizes and kills that virus.

96
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It does, kills it effectively, efficiently. But what happens is it continues to evolve during a single infection so that the surface protein, the so-called glycoprotein of that virus, to which you make an antibody response to prevent the virus from binding itself continues to mutate again and again and again.

97
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Here we talk about how influenza virus, for example, mutates so much from one year to the next that natural infection or immunization from the previous year does infect you, hence the need for a yearly vaccine.

98
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This virus does that during a single infection. It just continues to mutate and mutate and mutate and mutate, number one. Number two is where does it grow? It reproduces itself primarily in something called T helper cells, which is the major orchestrator of your immune system.

99
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's T helper cells that help B cells make antibodies. It's T helper cells that help stimulate cytotoxic T cells, which kill virus infected cells. So it paralyzes the orchestrator of your immune system at the same time that it continues to mutate so that your immune system never catches up to it.

100
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It is a remarkably effective virus at being able to kill us. I mean, we have, you know, in the late 90s, we finally developed a highly active antiretroviral therapy as a treatment, so we were able to do what we wanted to do, which was to make HIV a chronic disease.

101
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But that vaccine has remained elusive and it is not because of lack of money or lack of effort. I know Merka put several billion dollars into that project and was unsuccessful, again, with actually with an adenovirus vector into which they then inserted either the group antigen or the envelope protein or the glycoprotein genes.

102
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And it didn't in any sense work. In some ways, it was actually worse for those who were vaccinated.

103
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, I used to sort of explain it to people as imagine you were up against a foe that, you know, an army was up against another army and the army knew how to strategically target the general. I mean, and the general being the CD4 cell, the helper T cell.

104
00:16:43,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And all of a sudden you could just sort of abolish any chance of there being a coherent strategy to fight back. But you're right that those two things, the constant mutation and the ability to infect, again, at least if you come at this from the cellular side, the most important cell in the arsenal is pretty remarkable.

105
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What is it about those failures that maybe actually sped up the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, if anything?

106
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, I think you always learn. I mean, the replication defective adenoviruses that were used, it was an adenovirus human serotype 5 that was used in the Merck trial.

107
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think certainly we learned about replication defective adenoviruses for the Ebola vaccine, not only the J&J vaccine, but also there was a replication competent viral vector using something called the secular stomatitis virus, which is sort of a cousin in many ways of Arabia's.

108
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But obviously doesn't cause any of the symptoms or areas or symptoms at all. So, yeah, sure. I mean, we've learned as we've gone here and with HIV, it's like Jonas Salk's strategy was to try and take the whole virus and kill it. That obviously was never going to work.

109
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That was the strategy he had used. He thought it could apply to other things that clearly doesn't apply here. That vaccine has failed and failed and failed. I put that sort of in the same category as like the universal flu vaccine.

110
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean, it's not for one of money and is not for one of effort. I trained in a flu lab actually in the early 1980s at the Whistler Institute here in Philadelphia. I was working on rotaviruses, but I was trying to make monoclonal antibodies to rotavirus surface proteins.

111
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And I was learning to do it in a flu lab. And it was just these brilliant researchers, you know, people like John Udall and Walter Gerhard and Luzstout all in one place.

112
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't think I realized how lucky I was at that time to be around such amazing scientists. But the head of that lab at the time said something to me I'll never forget.

113
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And now 40 years later, it's still true. He said, quote, if you want a research career that lasts for the rest of your life, study influenza. I think that's that's a virus where it's going to take a long time to catch up to.

114
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So let's actually talk a little bit about influenza because there's something sort of strange about this coronavirus that fits in between the one and done viruses and influenza.

115
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And let's just put HIV in its own category because I think you've appropriately described it as the single worst virus that's ever been shat into the civilization of mankind.

116
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I mean, it is truly fortunately an anomaly with regard to how difficult it is. But on the one end of the spectrum, you have influenza, which has so much genetic drift that every year you have to get a new vaccine.

117
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If you want to have any chance of being vaccinated, of course, you could say, I don't want to be vaccinated because, you know, it's generally not a very lethal virus, but it's bad enough.

118
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And certainly in high risk populations, a vaccine makes a ton of sense.

119
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But, you know, we can't hold our natural immunity to it from year to year to year.

120
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:56,000
At the other end of the spectrum, you have polio, smallpox, pertussis, you know, pick your favorite of these things where they don't seem to mutate or if they do it.

121
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I shouldn't say they don't seem to mutate. Whatever mutations they have don't seem to impact our body's immune system from reacting to them.

122
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Is that so far am I correct on those two ends of the spectrum?

123
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes.

124
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay. Now we have this coronavirus, which seems to be neither of those.

125
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's not clear that it has the genetic drift of an influenza where every year it's basically a new virus.

126
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But it also appears that it ain't one of the other guys to where you're going to be one and done strategy with your vaccine.

127
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:48,000
In fact, even though B.1.1.7 looks like it is going to be managed through current vaccination strategies, it is not clear that the South African variant, the South American variant, Brazilian variant,

128
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
are going to respond in that way, given significant changes in their binding properties.

129
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What does that say about this virus, if anything, or is that simply just the luck of the biologic draw?

130
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Right. So I'm not sure I can explain why these viruses act the way they act. But your assessment was exactly right.

131
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
On the one hand, once and end of the spectrum, you have flu, which mutates. You said correctly year to year.

132
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's probably you could argue minute to minute. I mean, we I'm on the FDA's Vaccine Advisory Committee.

133
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The first week in March, we always pick flu strains.

134
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And the way that works is we the Department of Defense, the World Health Organization, the CDC, all present data about these flu strains that are circulating in all areas of the world.

135
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So we can see how these clades of influenza and subclades and sub-subclades are constantly sort of moving around so we can try and predict which strains to include.

136
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And we certainly work hard to try and get the strains right. We usually get them right. But you can it's amazing we get them right, given how much this virus mutates.

137
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And then on the other hand, you have an influenza single stranded RNA virus. Therefore, like all single stranded RNA viruses, its replication isn't highly faithful.

138
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But then you have a virus like measles, which is also a single stranded RNA virus, which also mutates, but mutates in such a confined way that the vaccines that you introduced or we introduced in the early 1960s continue to work.

139
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Now, you know, 50 plus years later, that virus has never mutated away from the vaccine, even though it is also a single stranded RNA virus.

140
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So then you have this virus, also the SARS-CoV-2 virus, also a single stranded RNA virus, and also does mutate, but much more slowly, actually, than influenza.

141
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And in many ways, in a manner that is between those two, between, say, measles and influenza.

142
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So it does mutate, and it does all for the purpose primarily of becoming more contagious.

143
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But that's really the main goal of viruses, is to continue to reproduce themselves.

144
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They don't necessarily want to make themselves more virulent, more likely to kill you, because then they can't reproduce anymore.

145
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So the goal is to be more contagious.

146
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So the bat virus, which was largely a bat virus that sort of first started in China and swept through China, was not the virus that left China.

147
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The virus that left China was the first variant, the so-called D614G variant.

148
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That was the first variant. That's the virus that swept through Europe. That's the virus that swept through the United States.

149
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's the virus that's killed 570,000 people. That's the virus to which all vaccines are made, to try and prevent the D614G strain.

150
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But now these other variants come up.

151
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The B117 UK variant, the Brazilian variant, the South African variant, now the New York variant, the California variant.

152
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So there's always going to be variants that are made as the virus tries to be more contagious.

153
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And so the critical question then is, to what extent will it drift away from immunity caused by vaccination?

154
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And the answer so far is that the B117 is close enough to that initial virus that left China, the D614G variant, that immunization with one protects against the other well.

155
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I mean, really well. They're close enough where there's not really a critical immunological distinction between those two viruses.

156
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But the South African and Brazilian strain, now the New York strain, all the so-called variants of concern are different, but not so far critically different.

157
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:15,000
In this sense, that I think natural infection or immunization still protects against severe critical disease, meaning still protects against hospitalization and ICU admission and death.

158
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That's still true.

159
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:30,000
When we've crossed the line with these variants is when you see, and we haven't seen this yet, people who are either naturally infected or fully immunized, that nonetheless are hospitalized or killed by a variant virus.

160
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That line hasn't been crossed yet.

161
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Now we're looking, because now, as people are getting hospitalized and dying of this virus, we always have to look at the virus they're getting infected with.

162
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And there's an NIH group that's specifically designed to do that, to make sure that these people aren't being infected with variants.

163
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And that they're critically different, that now you're not even protected against severe critical disease.

164
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Now, Paul, will there be one other step there?

165
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sure.

166
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
One other step there.

167
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Sorry to interject, but how do we know in the situation you just described, where someone who's been previously infected or vaccinated becomes infected with a variant of concern and goes on to have a bad adverse outcome, either ICU and or death, how do we know that it's because their existing immunity was incapable of responding versus they simply had lost immunity?

168
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Are you also checking for some quantitative or qualitative assessment of their existing immunity?

169
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Right. So I think what you can say is if you isolate a virus, sequence it, realize it is just the D614G saying or the B117 strain, something that should have been fully susceptible to immunity induced by natural infection immunization, then one of those two things is true.

170
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Either you had an adequate immune response and lost it, or you never really developed an adequate immune response.

171
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm not sure how easy those two things would be to figure out at that point.

172
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Right. It's tough to distinguish those two.

173
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think that that's the issue.

174
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But then what happens if they are confronted with the Brazilian variant?

175
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:18,000
How will we know if indeed it's the latter problem, which you just described, or frankly, the more frightening problem, which is actually no amount of current immunity, either required from D614 or through any of the vaccines, is the case.

176
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So you're saying that the D614, the D114, the D114, the D114, the D114, the D114.

177
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Right. So I think when we isolate those variants, the question is, you take it to the laboratory and see whether or not then the number of mutations that have occurred have occurred to the point that when you take sera from people who are adequately immunized or people who are naturally infected, that it doesn't neutralize that virus in the lab.

178
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That it has now escaped recognition by natural or vaccine-induced immunity.

179
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And we're confident that an in vitro assay to look at neutralizing antibodies in the presence of a new variant is pretty sufficient to give us that insight. We won't have to rely on epidemiology to give us the answer.

180
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No, I think it's pretty sufficient.

181
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I mean, it does ignore T-helper cell responses, which tend to be broader and are of value in that they do offer that sort of broader immunity, where even though there have been mutations in the receptor binding domain or the N-terminal domain, that you still would get some evidence of immunity.

182
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's why T-helper cell responses are so critical here.

183
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But I think we can figure, for the most part, figure that out.

184
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Okay. So the good news about what you're saying, Paul, is you're holding us to a higher and more conservative standard.

185
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Because what you're basically saying is, I can test in vitro what a B-cell can do through neutralizing antibodies.

186
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I can't test what a T-cell can do, but if it passes the B-cell test, I don't need to worry about it.

187
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Now, if it fails the B-cell test, we still don't know about the T-cell test, and that can only be played out in the real world.

188
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But if it's failing the B-cell test, we're going to take action.

189
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Presumably, we're not going to wait and assume that this is going to be worked out on the side of T-cells.

190
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I think that's right. I think that's right.

191
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah. I mean, if you look at the work that was done by Shane Crotty and others in La Jolla, looking at people who are naturally infected,

192
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and then, you know, if we're exposed to a virus again, we're protected.

193
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They did find that while antibody responses fade over time, and can fade over five, six, seven months later,

194
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
that memory B-cells are still there, and memory T-helper cells, or memory cytotoxic T-cells are there, and that's good.

195
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You know, you have this as a virus that has an incubation period of around six days,

196
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
meaning from the time you're first exposed to when you develop symptoms is about six days.

197
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That's between sort of the typical mucosal infection, like rotavirus or influenza, where incubation periods are very short, one to two days,

198
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and a virus like measles or German measles, or chickenpox, which have incubation periods of 10 to 14 days.

199
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
The longer incubation period diseases are better in the sense that you really can induce sterilizing immunity,

200
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and therefore you really can eliminate those viruses.

201
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We eliminated measles from this country by the year 2000. We eliminated rubella from this country by the year 2005.

202
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The only reason measles has come back is because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,

203
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,000
but those are eliminatable viruses. This is not, but because it's virus in the bloodstream is not an important part of pathogenesis.

204
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So IgG responses become a little...

205
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So when you have long incubation periods, all you need is immunological memory,

206
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
because there's plenty of time for activation and differentiation of memory B cells to become effector cells,

207
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
meaning antibody-producing cells, and therefore you're good.

208
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
For the shorter incubation periods, your hope is to modify disease, because of disease like rotavirus,

209
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
which has an incubation period of two to four days.

210
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You can stimulate, then, those memory cells, which are long-lived, to become antibody-producing cells,

211
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
but you've already started to replicate the incubation period so short,

212
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and it takes about three to five days to get activation and differentiation of memory cells.

213
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So when incubation periods are short, the best you can hope for is to modify disease associated with infection.

214
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So that's true of flu. It's true of respiratory.

215
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Insidual virus is true of rotavirus.

216
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
For measles, on the other hand, where you have this long incubation period,

217
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
as long as you have memory cells, which are generally long, you have plenty of time for activation and differentiation of those cells to become antibody-circuiting cells,

218
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and that's why you can eliminate those diseases.

219
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This is actually somewhere in between. It's about a six-day incubation period.

220
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And again, virus in the bloodstream is really not an important part of pathogenesis,

221
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
so IgG memory cells become a little less important.

222
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But I do think that we can control this infection.

223
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But I think that, like all mucosal infections, your two choices, basically, as we move forward,

224
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
are immunization or natural infection. Those are your two choices.

225
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So, Paul, that's actually an amazing insight about how the SARS-CoV-2 has that sort of gestation period that puts it into kind of an intermediate zone between the short and the long.

226
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Maybe let's take a moment to just explain to people how the cellular immune system comes into play here.

227
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So I think by this point, folks who have been paying attention to this understand how the neutralizing antibodies can work on first contact

228
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and how that can provide immunity in the weeks and months following an infection.

229
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But to your point, at some point down the line, call it six months later, 12 months later, a year later, or whatever, 18 months later,

230
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
those neutralizing antibodies may not be there in sufficiently high-enough titers.

231
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:44,000
What is the actual process by which that virus now gets presented to the cellular immune system such that we can reengage B cells to come out and make more neutralizing antibodies under the instruction of T cells?

232
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Maybe walk people through how that works through antigen presentation, et cetera.

233
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
All right. So the virus would be then picked up by major antigen-presenting cells in the body, like dendritic cells, macrophages, and to some extent B cells,

234
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
broken down into small sort of 10 to 15 mer peptides put on the surface of the cell, of these antigen-presenting cells.

235
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And then they travel to T helper cells, where they then stimulate T helper cells to do two things.

236
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
One is to stimulate B cells to make antibodies.

237
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Two is to simulate cytotoxic T cells to kill virus-infected cells.

238
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But as long as you have immunological memory, as long as you have memory B cells, memory T helper cells, memory cytotoxic T cells, and those are generally longer-lived,

239
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:38,000
then you can at least have activation and differentiation of those memory cells to become effector cells, in the case of B cells and by producing cells, in the case of cytotoxic T cells, T cells that kill virus-infected cells.

240
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So memory is what you want.

241
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And I think, I guess I was encouraged by the work of Shane Crotty and others, that memory cells here do, at least after natural infection, appear to be fairly long-lived.

242
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm also encouraged by the messenger RNA data, where after that second dose, you clearly get stimulation of T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells,

243
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
which suggest that you'll have also somewhat longer-lived responses.

244
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I mean, I'd like to think that these responses would be durable enough after natural infection or immunization to protect you for a couple years,

245
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
three years, four years. I'd like to think that's true. I mean, we'll see whether or not it ends up being true.

246
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But the good news about the mRNA strategy is it's a powerful immunogen.

247
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I mean, I'm amazed at how effective it is. And one thing that people at least can notice is that many people get shots in their arms, for a variety of vaccines.

248
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
This vaccine often causes lymph node enlargement under your arm, so-called ipsilateral lymphadenopathy.

249
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's not common. You see it with the smallpox vaccine, which is another powerful immunogen. And you see it with this vaccine.

250
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's a – it is – those antigen-presenting cells travel to the local lymph node and then stimulate that response to the extent that your lymph node actually enlarges.

251
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It is a powerful immunogen, these mRNA vaccines.

252
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's so funny that you bring that up, Paul. I was going to bring that point up later.

253
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Both my wife and I had whole-body MRIs. We do this every once in a while for sort of a cancer screening protocol.

254
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And we had them four days ago. And the radiologist said, hey, I assume you guys have been vaccinated.

255
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And, you know, we said, yep, both vaccinated, such and such a time. He said, okay, let me show you something on the MRI.

256
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The radiology is a very close friend. And he said, look at the extent of lymphadenopathy under your arms.

257
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This is normally something that, in a case of a woman, would make me think she potentially had breast cancer.

258
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's how inflammatory – how concerning these nodes are.

259
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:45,000
He said, look, I've now looked at enough of these in the past couple of months to realize that it's almost always people responding to the vaccination of this virus.

260
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And he said he is seeing it more with the RNA viruses, the Pfizer and Moderna and Pfizer.

261
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I didn't ask, and I should have asked, to what extent is he seeing it with the adenoviruses?

262
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But I think what you said is very interesting. And I only knew of it literally four or five days ago.

263
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I want to ask you another question about this, which is, why is it that the J&J virus is able to provide such a benefit after only one injection, whereas the RNA virus is needed that second injection?

264
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Right. And if you look at these replication-effective similar human adenoviruses, they appear – I'm sorry, the J&J vaccine, replication-effective Ad26, human adenovirus-26, they induce cellular immunity after a single dose.

265
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That's really not true with the mRNA vaccines. You need that second dose. I'm not sure why one is more powerful in terms of one dose versus two doses, but that is true, which is why it's all the more important to get that second dose of mRNA vaccine.

266
00:35:49,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There are a lot of people that – people who I actually really respect and are well known in the field of epidemiology or virology – who have written op-ed pieces that have gotten a lot of national play on why it is that one dose of mRNA vaccine gives you 80 percent effective protection, whereas the second dose gives you 90 percent.

267
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Or 95 percent, and that let's get as much first dose out there as we can. I think as long as people realize you need that second dose, I mean, I just worry that people are going to hear, well, 80 percent protective after one dose, 90 percent after two doses.

268
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You know, that's not that big of a deal. I know that with the second dose, there's more side effects, so I'm just going to go with one dose.

269
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And then confuse it with the fact that J&J's vaccine, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is one dose. This is a two-dose vaccine, the mRNA vaccines, and the choice not to get that second dose is a choice provided by the J&J vaccine.

270
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So, the J&J vaccine is one dose. It's a choice probably to get less durable immunity, less complete immunity, and likely less effective immunity against these variants that have drifted farther away from the original strain.

271
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You know, one other point on that, Paul, that I think is a real mistake that the press has made, and frankly I think that the vaccine companies have made, is they have not communicated clearly the difference between relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction.

272
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So, when the J&J vaccine received its emergency use authorization, I think the headline-grabbing statement was, hey, we just heard that Pfizer is 96 percent effective and Moderna 95 percent effective, but J&J looks like it's only 66 percent effective.

273
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Those numbers are probably off by a couple of percent, but directionally, they are correct.

274
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So, on the surface, you would say, why in the world would you take the J&J vaccine, even though it's only a single shot? Or you might ask another question, which is, well, what happens if you took two shots of the J&J? Wouldn't that put it on par? Et cetera.

275
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And it turns out, I actually had to go back and look at the data to actually see what the true risk reduction was. Now, I won't go into it here for people because it would take too long, but we'll link to it in the show notes.

276
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I've written an entire post about the difference between absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction, but you must talk about this in terms of absolute risk reduction.

277
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And when you look at the absolute risk reduction, it turns out that the J&J vaccine has a 1.7 percent absolute risk reduction versus a 1.2 percent absolute risk reduction for Moderna.

278
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And I believe Pfizer is actually less than 1 percent risk reduction. These are all great vaccines, but it turns out that J&J gets the most bang for its buck.

279
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Now, I wanted to talk with you about why you think there is that discordance between the lowest relative risk reduction in the mid 60s and the highest absolute risk reduction, which is the number that matters, approaching 2 percent.

280
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Do you believe that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were tested on less susceptible populations and that J&J was just tested on a sicker population that was therefore going to benefit more greatly?

281
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, so there are different strategies. So it is interesting how both MRNA strategies had very similar, at least relative risk reduction, but you're right. I mean, it is interesting how we don't talk about that way.

282
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We also don't talk about that with safety issues. So if you look, for example, I'm trying to remember the specific numbers for the Pfizer trial, but there were like 165 cases of disease in the placebo group and like eight cases in the vaccine group.

283
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So that's 165 cases per, in the case of the Pfizer trial, was a roughly 40,000 person trial. So roughly it's like 165 cases per 20,000 people that got placebo, as compared to like eight cases per 20,000 people who got the vaccine.

284
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So you actually divide that all up. You know, the absolute difference is not, is much less dramatic than is, you know, sort of the relative risk.

285
00:39:45,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The Pfizer absolute risk difference was like 0.9 percent. And you're right. The total number of cases was about 170 total cases in 20,000 or 40,000, I'm sorry.

286
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
40,000.

287
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yes, but you're right. The difference was eight versus like 165 or something like that. And which again makes me just think like these are people who were either less exposed, more healthy. There was something in these populations that differed dramatically from the J&J population where, I mean, we're talking about 500 infections versus 100 infections directionally.

288
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So the relative reduction wasn't as high, but the absolute reduction, like I said, 1.7 percent, which we're going to come back to in a moment, it's worth keeping the bag of your mind when you have a 1.7 percent absolute risk reduction.

289
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That means your number needed to treat to prevent a negative, a bad outcome is very low. I mean, we're talking about what, 60 for an NNT?

290
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You're right. It's interesting that, I mean, the way I think of it, just because it's easier for me to conceptualize it is if I walk on the street in front of my house, I have a certain risk of being hit by a car.

291
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:17,000
If I stand in the, just stand in front of my house, in the lawn in front of my house, I have another risk of being hit by a car. The risk is much greater if I cross the street than if I just stand on the grass in front of my house.

292
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But I cross the street all the time and, you know, never get hit. So still the chances of my being hit are still extremely small, even though I cross the street, even though the relative risk is much higher.

293
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
The absolute risk is still very low of being hit by a car. And I think that's that's what people don't quite understand.

294
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So let's talk about the kind of the elephant in the room today, at least, which is as of yesterday. And by the time this podcast come out, this might even be irrelevant news.

295
00:41:43,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I don't want to dwell on it too much. But as of yesterday, J&J, the news came out that J&J's vaccine, which as as as of this moment, has been given to 6.9 million people in the United States, has resulted in six serious clotting episodes, all in women, interestingly, probably not a coincidence, but it's too soon to tell.

296
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And one of whom has died. So obviously, very easy to believe that these side effects are the result of the vaccine, given what we saw in the AstraZeneca case.

297
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Not clear if it's a coincidence that it's also in an ad no virus vector. But regardless, let's just think about this for a moment through the numbers.

298
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Six out of 6.9 million people have had a side effect that is completely undesirable, one of whom has died, which is the ultimate undesirable side effect.

299
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But contrast that with the NNT. Now, the data in the JAMA paper that I looked at, which is where I saw the most robust data on the vaccine, at least I couldn't extract from it what the NNT was to save a life.

300
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Do you know that? So the NNT data that I quoted, which is about 60, based on the reciprocal of the the ARR.

301
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So if you take, you know, 100 divided by 1.7, whatever that number is, I'm doing the math in my head, it's about 60. That's for all reactions.

302
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So serious reactions, hospitalizations, death. But if you just do it on death, I don't know what that is. Do you?

303
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I think I think it's something like if you let's assume just for the purposes of this discussion that it's roughly one case of this so-called cerebral vascular sinus thrombosis or, you know, blood clot in a vein of the brain per million people who got this vaccine.

304
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:50,000
For a million people who who would get the vaccine otherwise, something like 1,850 or so would would have their would be prevented from having what I think would be prevented from dying.

305
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
OK, that's the number I'm asking for. Yeah. What's the difference? So we can do it for how how big that number is will be prevented from going to the hospital.

306
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But to actually be prevented from dying, if it's about 2000, you're talking about a trade off of 2000 to one. And that's why I've got to be honest with you.

307
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I looked at the reaction of the federal if I read it correctly, Paul, the federal government basically said we're going to stop this and let states decide.

308
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And, you know, New York and California immediately said we're going to stop it. And again, that's not the worst thing in the world if we have enough other vaccines in the pipeline to keep going.

309
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
But my thinking is that's an overreactive strategy if it's going to actually prevent people from being vaccinated, isn't it?

310
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Oh, and it's going to prevent people from being vaccinated. I mean, I just think that the minute you did that, the minute you pause that vaccine, you sent a chill through people in this country.

311
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I think that would affect not only this vaccine, but I think even it would spill over to any covid vaccine, which is, I think, what what worries me the most about this pause.

312
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I mean, I understand why they did it. I think they wanted to say to people at the very least, this is a an unusual phenomenon.

313
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And typically when you see, for example, thrombotic events, you invariably treat them with Heparin. Don't treat this with Heparin.

314
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So, you know, just, you know, thinking maybe is it intravenous immunoglobulin is the best treatment.

315
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:28,000
But if Heparin is the worst thing you could do for this. And so to alert the physicians of that, also to alert physicians of the fact that if anybody's gotten the J&J vaccine within two weeks of getting that vaccine had signs and symptoms of severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, to be to pay attention to that.

316
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I think that all makes sense. But by pausing it, you know, now the city of Philadelphia is not giving that vaccine anymore.

317
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I think in San Francisco, they've decided not to give that vaccine. And I just think that the point you made earlier is exactly right.

318
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:54,000
If it doesn't matter, meaning if we have enough of the Pfizer Moderna vaccine, that this is not going to win any sense, slow our ability to vaccinate this population and get to the level of population immunity that creates herd immunity, then it's not that big of a deal.

319
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But I think that there's two ways to look at that. One is that we have enough vaccine that makes it not a problem. But the other thing is that people may now be scared. That's what scares me the most.

320
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
If you ask me the question, what do I fear most about this whole pandemic? It's actually not the variants. It's not.

321
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It's that there would be a significant percentage of the population that is going to choose not to vaccinate, so much so that we can't get to that 80 plus percent of population immunity we need to slow this virus.

322
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And then what do we do? And we're going to know that by the middle of the summer when we have enough vaccine. And then we're going to figure out just what percentage of this population doesn't get vaccinated because it's not small.

323
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I mean, I was at the doctor's office yesterday. The nurse who checked me in told me she was not going to get a vaccine. This is a nurse.

324
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You know, these are people in the medical profession. So you can imagine what it's going to be like out there in the real world. And we already know those those numbers to some extent.

325
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
We know that, for example, 46 percent of Republican men say that they don't want to get a vaccine. Thirty percent of Christian evangelists say they don't want to get a vaccine.

326
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Fourteen percent of those in the black community say they definitely don't want to get a vaccine. So there are, you know, groups out there that are going to be making this choice. We'll see how this plays out.

327
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So let's talk about what herd immunity means, because even something that conceptually makes sense when it comes to the details, we're seeing lots of experts disagree on what it's going to take to achieve herd immunity.

328
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:24,000
What is your best explanation for not what it means conceptually? I think we understand that. But for specifically what is going to be required.

329
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And that includes both among children, adults, very susceptible populations. Like what is it? What does a world look like in which we have herd immunity?

330
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Right. So I define herd immunity from mucosal viruses like rotavirus, for example, as a thing from non-mucosal viruses, systemic viruses, where the virus spreads into the bloodstream like polio and measles and rubella, where you can eliminate that virus.

331
00:47:49,000 --> 00:48:04,000
We're not going to eliminate that virus, this virus. I think the best we can hope for is to significantly slow its spread, as we did for rotavirus. I mean, when the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the United States, there would be several million cases every year of rotavirus.

332
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
There would be about 75,000 hospitalizations and roughly 60 deaths every year from rotavirus. But no child got to H5 without being infected with that virus. That virus came into the United States in 2006.

333
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And within a few years, you started to see a dramatic drop in the spread of that virus. It's still out there, but it's much, much less. Many residents have never seen a case of rotavirus-induced diarrhea and dehydration, whereas it dominated my residency.

334
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So you can control it, but you're not going to eliminate it. So I think that's number one. Number two is if you look at sort of the contagiousness index and the efficacy of the vaccine, there's a formula for this.

335
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You would figure that you probably would need at least 80 percent of the population to be immune, either from natural infection or immunization, to slow the spread of this virus.

336
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But this virus, I think it's going to be with us forever. I don't see it going away. I think it's just going to slowly get under control, assuming we can get the 194 countries in this world to get a significant percentage of their population vaccinated.

337
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But know this, we're going to be giving a coronavirus, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine continually until it happens that other countries have gotten it under control.

338
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Because we give a polio vaccine every year to children in the United States. We haven't had a case of natural polio in this country since the 1970s. The reason we do that is polio still exists in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

339
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And so internationals travels common, so polio could always come back in this country. And I think that's going to be true here, too. We're going to see how long immunity lasts.

340
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
We're going to see whether the variants get to the point where they escape immunity from natural infection or immunization.

341
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But all that is going to play out over years. And we're going to be dealing with this for years.

342
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But I do think we can get control of this virus if we can get at least 80 percent of the population immune to the point that we can go back to the things we normally do, like going to Eagles games and screaming and booing without a mask.

343
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That is my goal.

344
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Well, as a person who really can't stand the Eagles, you'll have to forgive me that I have no interest in you going to Eagles games unless you are booing because your team is doing poorly.

345
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Now, that said, let's go back to the person like this nurse who you saw at the doctor's office the other day who says, I'm not going to get the vaccine.

346
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Now, my view is there's going to be a subset of the population that will never be convinced that that is the right strategy or or more to the point that getting a vaccine is a safe alternative to getting covid.

347
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So that's fine. You know, I think we do live in a world where medical freedom for adults exist and I support that.

348
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So I do support a person's right to choose to not get a vaccine.

349
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But can't we still get to herd immunity when enough healthy people who have refused vaccination survive the infection? Because we certainly have seen that natural infection is going to be a great way to develop immunity.

350
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So I don't know what the numbers are, but is it safe to say about 30 percent of American adults don't want to get vaccinated?

351
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I don't know. I mean, that if I had to guess, I think it's probably that about 30 percent, maybe more.

352
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And you're right in terms of natural immunity and that we know if you if you look on the reports, you know, on this covid tracker, it says 32000 people, sorry, 32 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have covid.

353
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
But that that's the only people who've been tested and found to be infected.

354
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
If you do anybody surveillance studies that that fact that number could be much higher.

355
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's probably like the CDC estimated last I saw, which was a few weeks ago, was 85 minutes, probably close to 100 million people who've been infected with this virus and are naturally immune.

356
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And then we don't know the overlap between those people and then who's been vaccinated.

357
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
There's obviously going to be a Venn diagram. You can't add these things up.

358
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I guess the way I look at it is even with a modest success of the vaccine and those let's just say those 30 percent of people who say I'm not going to be vaccinated, you know, someone's got to be able to come up with a reasonable estimate for how many people have been infected.

359
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
How many of those people were knowingly infected in the past, were unknowingly infected in the past.

360
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And and so in other words, those people you could argue don't need a vaccine.

361
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Then you've got the group who have not been infected who don't want to get vaccinated.

362
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Well, a subset of those people are going to get infected and therefore will develop natural immunity.

363
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
For those of us who choose to get vaccinated, Paul, is it really that big a concern at the number of people who don't want to get vaccinated?

364
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Well, first of all, we're also assuming that natural infection induces a durability and completeness of protection that is that is the same as vaccine.

365
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That may not be true. I mean, the vaccine, there are certainly a number of vaccines.

366
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
The human papillomavirus vaccine is one example. Tetanus is another.

367
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
The conjugate habanumococcal vaccines are another example where the vaccinations better than natural infection in terms of the immunity that's induced.

368
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
That may also be true here.

369
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, I think it's perfectly reasonable to give them a dose of vaccine dose of the mRNA containing vaccines.

370
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Sort of the booster strategy for those who are natural. That's fine.

371
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I do see you and I are going to differ on one thing, which is a person's right to choose not to be vaccinated.

372
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I think if I cut my foot on a rusty nail, for example, go to the doctor's office, get it washed out.

373
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And the doctor says I would recommend a tetanus vaccine and I choose not to get a tetanus vaccine.

374
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
That only affects me. I mean, if I get tetanus, nobody's going to catch tetanus for me.

375
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That's not true here. I mean, when you make a choice not to get a vaccine, you are making a choice potentially to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection.

376
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And see, I don't think that's your choice. I think that that should not be you're an alienable right as a U.S. citizen to affect others.

377
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I mean, if you're if you're going to stay in your in your house and the only time you ever walk outside is you're going to be really good about wearing a mask and making sure you're four to six feet away from somebody else.

378
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Great. But that's not the way it's going to play out.

379
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And and I think we're dealing with that in our hospital now is the issue of mandating a vaccine.

380
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
We, you know, we have a population of vulnerable hospitalized children.

381
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Certainly viruses like this can spread in a hospital. And is it your responsibility as someone who works in a hospital and a group of vulnerable hospitalized children to get a vaccine?

382
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
We think the answer is yes.

383
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, I would agree with you on that. So I mean, obviously, these things are new ones.

384
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'll tell you where my view is. There are going to be some people for whom there is a privilege that comes from your existence.

385
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So for me, health care is a privilege. To be a doctor or a nurse is a privilege, not a right.

386
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And so I would agree with you if you're going to work in a hospital and take care of patients, I do not believe you should have the right to refuse vaccination for exactly the reasons you've stated.

387
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Furthermore, I would agree that and this is getting way off topic, but when it comes to MMR, I don't think the parents should be able to refuse that for their child because I don't think it's fair to the children.

388
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
In other words, I don't think a parent should be able to make a decision that's going to negatively impact the child.

389
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I will go one step further. This is going to I'm sure make I'm sure every statement I'm making is making a newer and newer faction of people I rate.

390
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So the last one I'll say is I think that society may have to make decisions about who can and can't have other certain privileges, such as travel.

391
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So I think that there should be a day when if we decide, you know what, like people who haven't been vaccinated or haven't conferred natural immunity through some other means and can demonstrate it, maybe we don't want to have all those people traveling on airplanes or maybe certain countries are going to say you can't enter unless you've done those things.

392
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So I don't think I think you and I would probably be aligned on everything I just said. I think where we do differ is.

393
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:49,000
If you know John Smith, who works in, you know, whatever he does, doesn't want to get vaccinated, you know, provided he provided his society, his network is okay with that, you know, and he's not lying about it or something, which again, I think there are ways around that.

394
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I think, you know, you have to live with the consequences of your choice. When people say to me, why would you, Peter, as a healthy, you know, roughly 50 year old get vaccinated when your odds of dying are so low from a natural infection,

395
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I say, frankly, my concern is not death. I think my odds of dying from this virus are so low that, you know, I'm more I'm much more afraid of dying in a car accident.

396
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:33,000
What I'm afraid of are the long term consequences of this that don't seem trivial, even in young people. And, you know, there was an article in JAMA, maybe two months ago that talked about some of the long term neuropsychiatric complications that are being seen in up to a quarter of people, six and 12 months out.

397
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And to me, those are the things that are of grave concern. And again, when you weigh the risk of that versus the risk of vaccination, which I think you very eloquently spoke to at the outset.

398
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:54,000
To me, it's personally a no brainer. But that said, you know, there are gray areas in between. That said, of course, I agree with you about in the hospital.

399
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I think it's a tragedy that a high risk patient would be cared for by someone in a hospital who has willingly or knowingly chosen not to be vaccinated.

400
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But see, I would this is probably the one area we're going to disagree. But I think, see, I see the hospitals and microcosm of society. I mean, if I there was there probably about 500000 people or so in this country who can't be vaccinated because they're getting

401
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:38,000
biologics for their chronic disease because they're getting chemotherapy for their cancers, they depend on those around them to protect them. I mean, I remember when California suffered its measles epidemic and Richard Pan, who was a Democratic state senator out of Sacramento, basically eliminated the philosophical exemption, leaving California with only medical exemptions.

402
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:48,000
They don't have they never had a religious exemption. So they now they only had medical exemptions. If you went to school in California, you had to be vaccinated or you could homeschool.

403
00:57:48,000 --> 00:58:00,000
There was a little boy who showed up at those meetings. And certainly the anti vaccine folks were all over those meetings. They didn't want this this exemption eliminated. And he was great. I just wish there was a videotape of him because I've heard what he said.

404
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And I've seen pictures of him. But he is a little kid named Luke, who was five years old. And he was in the induction phase of his chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. And he would get up to the microphone. They have to give him a stool so he could reach the microphone. And he would say, what about me? I depend on you to protect me. Don't I count?

405
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And I think that that's how I see I see the hospital in some ways as society. You know, you don't know who you're running into when you're getting on a subway or a bus or whatever. And that could be those could be the looks out there. So I don't think if it's a contagious disease, that's that's where I sort of draw the line.

406
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So love to discuss this more over a meal. Let's talk about the implication of it, though. Do we believe because I don't think it's going to happen. Is it from a practicality standpoint, is there any chance this is going to be mandated?

407
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:59,000
At the private level, there's already is some level in a carrot, not stick sort of way where, you know, a number of universities now said, want to come back to campus? Great. Love to have you get vaccinated. If not, you're going to continue to.

408
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Sure. And just as travel restrictions may only open up to those who are vaccinated. I mean, I completely I think that's exactly the right way to do it. But my point is, we'll never do what California did, which is say you don't get to send a kid to school without vaccination, which, by the way, I think was the right thing to do 100 percent.

409
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But I don't see how you would enforce or make something like that happen in society. So assuming we don't, what do you think is the duration of time from now until we achieve herd immunity based on what you know about the speed with which the vaccines are rolling out and the limited information we have about the rates of natural infections, which are obviously challenging to comprehend.

410
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Right. So let's assume the following. Let's assume that about 20, as you said earlier, I think it's right about let's say about 25 or maybe as many as 30 percent of the population has been naturally infected.

411
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:09,000
We know that about about 22 to 23 percent of the general population has also been now fully vaccinated with the adult population. So it may be a little more than that. And you're right. There's overlap in terms of having been infected or having been vaccinated. So let's assume we're getting close to 40 percent.

412
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:19,000
To get to 80 percent, you're probably going to need to fully immunize another 120 million people were vaccinating more than three million people or three million doses of vaccine a day. These are mostly two dose vaccine.

413
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So if you just play out the math, it's possible that within if we continue to get three million doses a day out there, that within three or four months, we could have vaccinated that other 120 million people.

414
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I think by mid summer, when there's enough vaccine for everybody, that's when you're going to really find out how many percentage of the population doesn't want to get vaccinated. And then we'll see what we're going to do.

415
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And the way that you'll test, you'll know whether or not we've succeeded with herd immunity is what happens next winter. This is still at its heart, largely a winter respiratory virus. And if you look at what happened when the virus came into the U.S. in early March and started to kill people, it quickly shot up.

416
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You would have 2,000, 2,500 deaths. So just look at deaths, deaths a day. And then it started to come down. As you went to April, May, June, you started to see the number of deaths per day come down.

417
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This was in a wholly susceptible population without a vaccine. And then for the summer months, you were sort of at hundreds of deaths a day. Then once you hit November, December, it took off again. 2,000 deaths a day, 3,000 deaths a day, 4,000 deaths a day, 4,500 deaths a day.

418
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And then now it started to come down again. And I think that there's several reasons. One, because a larger percentage of the population is immune from natural infection, because a larger percentage of the population is immune now with vaccination.

419
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:41,000
But I think also the weather has something to do with this. And so it's now starting to come down. What happens then next winter, if we're at population immunity that is effective, then you will see a bump in the winter month.

420
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:53,000
If we're not, you are going to see a surge just like we saw this winter in the winter month. And that's how you'll know. But we're going to be vaccinating this population for my lifetime, because I just think this is a virus that's not going to go away.

421
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:05,000
We're going to continue to need to keep up that population that's immune. And that's also going to involve children. So now we've got an approved vaccine down to 12 years of age. I think by early next year, we'll probably have it down to six years of age.

422
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And then we're going to need to, I think, vaccinate children as well.

423
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And will that be because children are vectors or because we actually fear harm to the kids themselves?

424
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Both. But I was on service for two weeks in a row about a week ago. And it's the same thing that you mentioned earlier in terms of like fear of long term disease.

425
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You should see what MIS-C looks like up close. I mean, this so-called multi-system inflammatory disease in children, which is not uncommon. And they all tell the same story, a very similar story, which is that they had an incidental infection, something that was picked up often because a family member or friend got sick.

426
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And so then they were tested to be PCR positive, but were asymptomatic. A month later, they come now to our house with high fever, involvement of heart, liver, lung, kidney. You know, heart enzymes spilling out into the bloodstream.

427
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:06,000
With high fever and their PCR negative and their antibody positive. I mean, their immune system has been induced to make it an inflammatory response against themselves.

428
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I mean, primarily against the cells that line vessels. And so this is largely a vasculitis. And because every organ in your body has a blood supply, virtually every organ can be affected.

429
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It's pretty frightening to see. And do I think that some of these kids are going to have long term problems? I absolutely do for the same reason Kawasaki's did that.

430
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I mean, also another multi-system inflammatory disease that could cause, you know, long term heart problems. I think that is likely to be true here. We're going to learn as we go. But if a parent sat across from me in my office and asked me, why should I vaccinate my child? These are the stories I would tell, the Missy story.

431
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Yeah, I mean, I wish I had a crystal ball that would show us the data we're going to have a year from now. Like when you think about how much we have learned in 12 months, it has been a geometric outflow of knowledge.

432
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And the next 12 months will offer, I think, even more insight. Because as you said, we're going to be laying over the natural infection, the vaccine immunology.

433
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We'll also, as you basically alluded to, really have a true sense of what steady state is going to look like societally with respect to vaccine refusal. And so we will be able to incorporate that into models of how close we are going to get to that herd immunity.

434
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:31,000
But let's talk about it through the two scenarios. There's a scenario clearly where enough people refuse vaccination that we never truly achieve herd immunity. And in that sense, the real tragedy is for the vulnerable people who can't be immunized. Correct?

435
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I mean, I think that's a very clear thing to acknowledge is there's going to be a subset of people who, because of their cancer treatment or rheumatologic treatments, can't be vaccinated and the disease is still spreading like crazy.

436
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Then there's a scenario under which we get to herd immunity on the backs of people who are naturally infected and or are willing to be vaccinated, inclusive of children.

437
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And have you done the math on how far down you need to go in kids ages to almost assure that happens? In other words, if you go down to six years of age, is that pretty much a fait accompli?

438
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Oh, for sure. You may not even have to get down that far. I mean, it's something like 20 percent of the population is less than 18 years of age. So you're assuming all adults got vaccinated, which isn't going to happen. You know, you're already talking about 80 percent.

439
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:28,000
But the other reason I think that that that that's what I mean, look at Michigan, for example, clearly has been a surge of cases in Michigan, but not really a surge in deaths.

440
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:39,000
And I think the reason is, is that it's something like 55 percent or 57 percent of people over 65 now have been vaccinated fully and something 75 percent have gotten at least one dose of vaccine.

441
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So we're starting to to pull out of the group, the group that those that are most likely to die, it's something like 92 percent of those over 55 or those over 55 account for 92 percent of the deaths.

442
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So, you know, we're now pulling them out. And so that's why I think it's one of the several reasons why the deaths are clearly coming down now.

443
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Paul, how long do you think it'll be before we know the frequency with which people need to be given a booster shot?

444
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And is this going to be a single booster shot that should be more than enough to make sure that the memory T and B cells are rocking and rolling?

445
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Or do you think that and by the way, I'm putting aside for a moment mutation.

446
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So let's put that aside for one second. But just on the basis of B.

447
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:34,000
117 D 6 1 4 is it your immunologic expectation that if you've had your two RNAs, you'll need one more.

448
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
If you've had your one ad, no, you'll need one more. And that should be it.

449
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Or is it are we talking about an annual or biannual process?

450
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I think we'll know in two years. I think we'll have much better idea in two years how this plays out.

451
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:57,000
There were studies done with human coronaviruses, human challenge studies done with human coronaviruses in the early 1990s where they would, you know, someone would be infected with a serotype of one of the four serotypes of human coronavirus that circulates.

452
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And then a year later, they were experimentally challenged with that virus to see answer the question were they protected against symptoms associated with illness.

453
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And they were a year later, but they never did those studies beyond that.

454
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Certainly it's it's I'm optimistic that it would be for a few years, but I don't think that we're talking about decades.

455
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:30,000
OK, let's pivot to another question that has come up a lot. And when it first arose, which was a year ago, if not more than a year ago, the people who were raising it sounded crazy.

456
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And today it doesn't sound so crazy, which is the origin of this virus. So there are largely two competing theories.

457
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:55,000
The first is the theory that was proposed at the time of the pandemic, the pandemic's arrival, which is that this was a virus that escaped from a bat or left a species of a bat via some intermediary mammal and made its way to humans.

458
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:15,000
This originated in a wet market in China. And that's kind of the story everybody knows. But with increasing, I don't want to say veracity, but certainly with with more and more reason behind it, there are lots of people offering explanations for another.

459
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And I think that's the idea that this was actually an accidental escape of a virus in a lab that happened to be near Wuhan. So I guess there were three labs near Wuhan that would do this type of research.

460
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:41,000
This theory does not suggest biological warfare, that this was deliberately unleashed, but rather that, you know, any lab can have a breach in protocol that could result in a virus leaving. How much have you examined this theory?

461
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Certainly it is not unheard of that laboratories have done so-called gain of function studies to see what would happen if they alter a virus and then cause it to be able to do things it couldn't do before.

462
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So, for example, you could take rabies, I'm not saying you should do this or how easy it would be to do this, but you would take rabies virus, which is essentially a universally fatal virus, but not easily transmitted.

463
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I mean, in order to get rabies virus, you usually have to be bitten by a rabid animal and make it such that it is spread by the respiratory route. So now you have a contagious virus that is highly fatal, which I think was basically the story behind the movie Contagion.

464
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I think it was a Nipah virus that killed Gwyneth Paltrow in that movie and others, but because they showed an electron micrograph of it, and I think this was a Nipah virus, which is, you know, not easily transmitted, and they made it easily transmitted.

465
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's something that affects the brain, they made it easier. So certainly gain of function studies have been done. Is it possible that somebody in Wuhan was doing these kinds of gain of function studies?

466
01:09:46,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm telling you, though, this is like the world's smartest human. I honestly don't think humans were smart enough to make this virus, given all the things that it can do. The only way to really know the answer to the question, because I think this is a knowable question, is to go back and look at all the sequences of those early strains, and go back as early as you can and look at, you know, sera from people in China, you know, from well before this virus was said to have spread.

467
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I mean, think about it. We really depended on a whistleblower in Wuhan to tell us what was going on, which was China not acting like a good neighbor here. So, but and that's the way we did it with HIV. I mean, when we finally got all the sequences that we needed with HIV, we go back further and further and further to see when exactly it evolved from so-called simian immunodeficiency virus.

468
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I mean, the chimp virus. You could see that it happened in Cameroon in the 1930s, presumably when a hunter cut the chimp and then cut himself and introduced the virus into himself. So it's knowable. I just don't think we know. So now we're left with sort of postulates as to how it happened.

469
01:10:47,000 --> 01:11:00,000
My my bias is that it jumped from a bat to humans, presumably from an intermediate host that remains unidentified. You know, people have suggested maybe it's pangolins. But that's knowable. If we can just have all the sequence data we need in China has not been identified.

470
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So that's been great about opening its doors and letting us see all that information.

471
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:15,000
If you assume that it occurred naturally, it begs the question.

472
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:28,000
If versus when this occurs again, because coronaviruses have been around longer than we have. There's no reason to believe that SARS CoV-2 is the last of them.

473
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
What what is the implication for SARS CoV-3?

474
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Oh, we can assume this is going to happen. I mean, you know, we had SARS 1, which was largely a bad virus. We had MERS, which came out of Saudi Arabia, which was also at least part of that virus. And now you have, you know, SARS CoV-2.

475
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Three viruses all within roughly 20 years, right? SARS 1 was around 2002. MERS around 2012.

476
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It'll happen. I mean, I'd like to think what we've learned from this is that it will happen, that we need a level of international collaboration, that with a minute there's evidence that this is going on, that there's an international surveillance system where all countries are open to this, where we can identify it, you know, do the kinds of works we need to do, not just to make a vaccine, but to have, you know, personal protective equipment and ventilators or anything else that you're going to need so that we're not overwhelmed by this.

477
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I mean, unless you're 130 or 140 years old and live through the 1918, 1919 flu pandemic, no one has lived through this. And I'd like to think this has sobered us up as to what needs to be done moving forward.

478
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Do you think that there's a chance that if the next variant of this comes along, which is even worse than this one, so pick, so either it's more virulent, but has the same degree of transmissibility, or it's similar virulence, but an even greater transmissibility.

479
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Either of those would make for a much worse pandemic.

480
01:12:48,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Do you think that there's a chance that such a virus emerges, that a given population locally could be shut down enough to identify quickly patient zero, you know, the first 50 people and immediately quell this thing?

481
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Or do these types of things never result in a local shutdown that is effective and they will always turn into something bigger? Because the difference between SARS-1 and MERS is not so much that the response was amazing.

482
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I mean, in the case of MERS, I think the thing was just such a deadly virus that it didn't have a high enough reproductive rate because it was killing people too quickly.

483
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:34,000
So it's not like we did such a great job with those viruses. It was really the biology of the viruses, right?

484
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Right. I think both SARS-1 and MERS did not have this level of asymptomatic transmission. I think that that's what makes this virus so awful.

485
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And when you walk past somebody in the street who's perfectly fine, they could be shedding this virus.

486
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:57,000
That really wasn't true with SARS-1 and MERS, where most of that disease was either moderate or severe. So it was much easier to put a motor around those infections than you can here because everyone could be infected.

487
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It's actually in many ways reminds me of polio. I mean, I am a child of the 50s. I'm much older than you are. But I remember polio. But part of the heinousness of polio was that only about one of every 200 people who was infected with polio virus was paralyzed.

488
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And there was a lot of asymptomatic transmission of that virus.

489
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:35,000
So what does that mean, though, Paul? How confident are you that, you know, 10 years from now, we're not going to have another worldwide pandemic that, you know, the analogy I used to describe this to somebody the other day was when you're driving a race car, the worst thing you can be doing is breaking too late because then you have to break much harder than you want to.

490
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And the dynamics of the car become really unstable and you're probably going to crash.

491
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And in some ways, I sort of feel like that's what happened in the United States, which is we didn't break soon enough. And when we did break, we had to break way harder than we should have. And we crashed.

492
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And I want to believe we could learn from that.

493
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Great. So it's the process. It's a great analogy. I do think that it's at the heart of that question is is how much do I have faith in human nature that we can learn from these things that we will have the kind of heart, big heartedness that will allow us to have international collaborations

494
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:30,000
and borders regarding sort of scientific inquiry. We haven't been very good at that so far. If we don't learn our lesson here, I mean, we're never going to learn it. So I don't know. I don't have an enormous amount of faith in human nature that we're going to learn from this, but I hope you're right.

495
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Yeah, I wasn't suggesting I was right. I was just I was wondering what would need to happen, right? What would let me pose it to you this way, Paul. If someone came to you and said,

496
01:15:46,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Hey, I want to put you in charge of thinking about the next pandemic. You're doing a great job helping us with this one, but we've got a lot of people thinking about this one. I want you to go on vacation for two weeks, recharge, you know, shake the dust off a little bit.

497
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And I want you to come back. And the only thing I want you to do is think about how we're going to prepare for the next one. What would you what would be some of the ideas you put forth?

498
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Well, I think I think you you it's an international collaboration. It's an international question. So you have to get get the governments and the scientists from every nation in this world in line with what are we going to do collectively to monitor for the next pandemic potential virus.

499
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And there will be an ex pandemic potential virus in terms of surveillance. How are we going to do that? How are we going to do the sequencing? Who's going to do it? And then once in hand, when we see that that's true, how are we going to collaborate to do that?

500
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:47,000
How are we going to collaborate to do this, the the the to make sure we all have what we need because we're all dependent on each other because we're only as strong as our weakest nation out there.

501
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:56,000
How are we going to do that? But even with with the vaccine, you see a certain level of nationalism, right? There's sort of the Chinese have their vaccines, the Russians have their vaccines. We have our vaccines.

502
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It's the fact that matter is one thing that I think Dr. Fauci is amazing. I think he's a phenomenal science communicator. He is. He's a brilliant man.

503
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And the only time he's ever said anything that that bummed me out a little bit was when somebody asked him about about the the whether or not there would be another vaccine that would be submitted for licensure like the UK AstraZeneca vaccine being submitted for U.A. approval here.

504
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:33,000
And his response to that was we don't need another vaccine. We have enough vaccine for our country. But I think our country has a responsibility to all countries in this world. We're economically and technologically advanced to provide vaccine for everyone if we can.

505
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:42,000
You know, the Pfizer, look at look at these these mRNA vaccines. They're given at 30 micrograms or 100 micrograms of dose. A microgram is a millionth of I'm sorry, a millionth of a gram.

506
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:51,000
You can make that's 10 to the minus six, right? You can make kilograms. That's 10 to the third. That's a nine log difference. That's a billion fold difference.

507
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Can you make billions of doses of mRNA vaccine? Absolutely. Should you? Absolutely. And if it means restricting sort of the intellectual property and allowing that to happen, it should happen.

508
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Because because it's the right thing to do for these companies and for the world.

509
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:18,000
This is an unrelated question to where I want to go. But while we're here on the topic, do you have any idea what vaccine hesitancy rates are like outside of the United States? I actually haven't looked at those data.

510
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Right. So there's there's a woman named Heidi Larson at the London School of Public Health, who does this. She has something called a vaccine confidence project. So she goes throughout countries in this world to see sort of what she measures vaccine confidence.

511
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:43,000
She recently had a book that came out called Stuck. But interestingly, we're not the least confident country in this world. The least confident country in this world for vaccinations is France.

512
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:53,000
All right. Don't know why. Yeah. France. France is number one. So we're not actually that bad. But again, it's it's see, I sort of divide this into two categories.

513
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I think there's the skeptics and it's and I'm a skeptic. I think you should be skeptical of anything you put in your body.

514
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I think you should want to see the data to make sure that what you're being given has been adequately tested and vetted. I think skepticism at this point, certainly for the M RNA vaccine should melt away.

515
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You've got a highly effective vaccine that doesn't even appear to have a rare serious side effect problem. And it's been in one hundred and twenty million people in the United States. Skepticism should be gone.

516
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And I think largely among that group, it has. When you look at sort of percentage of people who said they would definitely get a vaccine, they'd say last September, it was about 30 percent.

517
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Then by December, it was 40 percent. The University of Washington came out with recently a survey that suggested it's about 70 percent. They said they would definitely get a vaccine.

518
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And then there's the second group, which are the vaccine cynics. And they just don't trust the government or trust pharmaceutical companies or trust the medical community.

519
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,000
They just don't believe you. They don't believe you. It's amazing to me that some of those people are also in the medical profession.

520
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But that's been the experience. So you can't convince them. Neil deGrasse Tyson has just a great quote on this, which is if people don't use reason or logic to come to a specific conclusion, reason and logic are not going to talk them out of it.

521
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So then what do you do? And then this is what we were talking about earlier. Do you compel them either with the carrot or the stick to to get vaccinated because what they do affects other.

522
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:23,000
When I think back at the looking at the past year, Paul, this is my opinion, which I'm only stating so you can contrast it with something that's probably much more much more thoughtful.

523
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:30,000
My view of the greatest single failure in the past year was how long it took to get testing up and running.

524
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:44,000
When I think about the absolute buffoonery on the part of I think it was frankly mostly on the part of the government, but but I'm sure there were others others at hand.

525
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It was the inability to make testing readily available. Now, I don't think it was at the obvious level.

526
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I mean, I think there are things that probably weren't in place. In other words, how much reagent existed for PCR to begin with, you know, you know, but but you'd like to think that in a future pandemic or in preparedness for future pandemic.

527
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:21,000
You would have enough PCR machines, you would have enough reagent, you would have enough other critical infrastructure such that the moment you had a sequence because getting the sequence of this virus virus was not the rate limiting step.

528
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
The moment you had a sequence sequence, you would be able to rapidly deploy tests to contain this thing.

529
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And I think a lot of the things that have happened since that time have been actually pretty good, like in the speed with which the virus has been developed within the sorry with which the vaccine has been developed has been remarkable.

530
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I think the evolution of insight into critical care has actually been pretty darn impressive.

531
01:21:46,000 --> 01:22:02,000
So I think a lot of things have gone kind of well. But boy, that that testing thing is really what goes back to my analogy of coming, you know, waiting way too deep in the corner to hit the brakes, and then slamming on the brakes and crashing the car.

532
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:11,000
What's your assessment of where we really lost things this time around and therefore where we'd want to really make sure we had it right the next time around.

533
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Right. I completely agree with you. I mean, we had the sequence in hand by January of 2020 the virus started to kill people in this country two months later.

534
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Was that enough time to be able to make to be able to create, produce and distribute enough tests that we could have done what South Korea did.

535
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:38,000
We're not South Korea in many ways. I think we are a much more diverse population that is much less corralable, if you will.

536
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And so, but I do think that we put all our eggs in the CDC basket. It was just CDC that was making the test was it should have been many, many groups that were making those tests initially and quality controlling for them because what happened was then CDC screwed up.

537
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
They did. They screwed up the test so that their negative control end up being positive. Therefore, those tests were useless.

538
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And so by the time that all got sorted out, South Korea had done 500,000 tests. We had done, you know, fewer than 5,000. It was pathetic, pathetic.

539
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:22,000
And by do if we had done that, and again, I just don't think we didn't have great federal leadership either. That's today's understatement in terms of this, where you could have said, let's get things in place to do the testing, do the quarantining, do the restriction of international travel that would have allowed us to be much better off.

540
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I mean, we are roughly roughly a 4% of the world's population and 20% of the world's deaths when we have a technologically and economically advanced society.

541
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So there's really no excuse for doing it as badly as we did it. But I think the testing was one big reason. I agree.

542
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Well, Paul, there are actually several things I want to talk with you about more. But I also know that given that the news of J&J's vaccine just hit, you are probably being dragged in a million different directions.

543
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So I want to let you get on with those obligations. And I'm incredibly grateful that you made time to still speak with me today, obviously far less important than speaking with all the other people that are clamoring at your door today.

544
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So thank you again for making time as it was the case last time, just a phenomenally interesting discussion to me. I learned a lot and I know that the folks watching this did as well.

545
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Well, thank you. I can tell you that you'll be the most interesting, smartest person who's clamoring at my door as I go through the rest of my day.

546
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
But no, I really appreciate this. It was a lot of fun. Thank you. Thanks, Paul.

547
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Thanks, Paul.

548
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Thank you.

549
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
