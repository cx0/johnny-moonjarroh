1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,400
Hi, everybody.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,500
Welcome to the fifth and final episode in the week of Tom.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,700
This is the Tour de Force Magnum Opus course on Lipidology.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,060
As we round this out, we talk about a number of things.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:03,260
We talk about LPa, inflammation, oxidized LDL, remnants, red blood cells and cholesterol,

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,420
a biomarker called LPPLA2 that you've often probably heard about, another biomarker that

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,860
you may have not heard of called ADMA or asymmetric dimethalarginine and SDMA, symmetric dimethalarginine.

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,980
And then we kind of bring it back to what is one of the more tragic stories in Tom's

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:27,320
life, which is a friend of his who unfortunately probably had FH, wasn't treated and in many

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,980
ways is sort of one of those patients that still kind of haunts Tom.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,660
And I think, you know, we open this back in part one by talking about Tom's passion for

23
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,340
two other things, firefighting and hockey, and how that passion is what really got him

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,340
into or basically allowed him to apply himself to this new field once he became obsessed.

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,100
But also I think most physicians listening to this will have a similar story where there

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,660
are certain patients or there are certain personal relationships where a loss of life

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,380
stays with you for a very long period of time.

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,540
And in many ways it colors what you do over time.

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:08,860
So I hope you enjoy this fifth and final installment of the Lipidology Advanced Course.

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,860
And next week we'll be back to our regular scheduled programming where we're just doing,

31
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,900
you know, one podcast a week.

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,500
So I hope you've enjoyed this and I hope you find the show notes very helpful.

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,100
I can't express how much work has gone into it.

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,100
So without further delay, here is the final episode with Dr. Tom Dastman.

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,780
This will be a nice way to dovetail niacin, statins and PCSK9 inhibitors.

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,220
What lipoprotein have we not discussed today that would tie in a discussion of those three?

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,020
Well, the astute listener realizes it's our good friend LP little a.

38
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,020
All right.

39
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,060
Why do I bring this up?

40
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,820
So LP little a, there are some people who still argue, hey, niacin makes sense because

41
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,300
it lowers LP little a.

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,060
I'm going to save everybody on this podcast the brain damage of listening to us discuss

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,900
that for the next 20 minutes and just bypass us to the more interesting question, which

44
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,500
is why don't statins lower LP little a?

45
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,500
Well, first of all, we need a better understanding of LP little a clearance and personally of

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,460
the belief that it is the L L receptor.

47
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,980
There is a plasmidogen receptor that could clear some things and there are macrophage

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,180
receptors that depending what else is going on might internalize some LP little a and

49
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
get rid of it that way.

50
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,300
But it's the L L receptor that clears it.

51
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,720
And also let's pause for one second because I realize even though we've already done an

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,120
entire podcast on what is LP little a, there's someone listening to this who hasn't heard

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
it.

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
You'll go back and listen to it.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm sure I'm going to do future podcasts where I interview the world's expert on the topic.

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,360
But Tom, can you give in two minutes a description of what LP little a is?

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, it's an LDL like particle to which is it here in another April protein?

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It shouldn't be there and it's called April protein little a and you must pronounce it

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
as little a.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
That means small case rather than capital A.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,400
Lipoprotein capital A is April protein A1.

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
That's the main April protein on an HDL particle.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,800
So if you tell me you got lipoprotein A, how do I know what are you talking about?

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,840
You got HDL particles?

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,080
Are you talking about little a, which clearly identifies to me this potentially pathogenic,

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,120
atherogenic LDL particles.

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,320
So use the correct terminology with everything.

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,080
And Peter's got that nice podcast on it.

69
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,760
Our metrics of is that present in you or not is most labs will run an LP little a mass,

70
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,320
which is the weight in a deciliter of plasma of the weight of your entire LDL particles

71
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,920
and everything that's in them.

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,200
They're triglycerides, they're cholesterol ester, they're phospholipids.

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,240
Meaning any lipoprotein that is carrying an apolipo little a and you weigh the entire

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
LDL density.

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,360
So but you're weighing everything.

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,480
You're not weighing apolittle a.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,720
You're not measuring apolittle a per se.

78
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,160
Yes, that has a molecular weight, but the molecular weight of apob is way higher than

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,040
the molecular weight of apolittle a.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,960
But you're measuring that too when you do an LP little a mass.

81
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,800
But the molecular weight of apob is known because it's pretty much the same, whereas

82
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
the molecular weight of apolittle a is very variable.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,320
So that's another reason LP little a mass becomes a useless metric.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,600
And how do I know how many cholesterol triglyceride, phospholipid, 10,000 other lipid

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,200
moieties, other proteins are on that particle?

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,400
And you have heterogeneous mixtures of particles that would have variable amounts of all of

88
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,800
those constituents.

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
So you can see there's going to be a weakness to measuring LP little a mass.

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,640
Now, if it's really high, you probably got too many LP little a particles.

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,320
But since there's almost no more debate that the best metric for our LDL particles is low

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,280
density lipoprotein particle number, there's no debate among those who will truly understand

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,520
that HDL particle number is your best metric available metric on quantifying the number.

94
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,240
And that is a better metric than guessing that using HDL cholesterol or LDL cholesterol.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,320
Wouldn't you rather have a really nice finite count if LP little a particles are dangerous?

96
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,200
Wouldn't you like to have a excellent, accurate concentration in them?

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,280
Well, the only way you can do that nowadays.

98
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,200
NMR provides those other HDL and NMR cannot assay LP little a particles because NMR assays

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,480
lipid content of particles, not protein content.

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,800
So the only way I can give you an LP little a particle count is I have to separate all

101
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,720
lipoproteins electrophoretically and they all you'll see little bumps on the electrophoretogram.

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,440
The LDLs congregate here, LDLs congregate here, HDLs congregate there.

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,080
And what's that little bump that is in this person, but it's not in that person?

104
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,560
Oh, that's LP little a because that's due to its surface charge where it migrates between

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,120
the cathode and the anode and the gel that you separate them on.

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:09,160
So if I then take that LP little a hump and I immunostain it with a antibody that binds

107
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:16,120
to ApoB, you've just counted the number of particles that are in the LP little a distribution

108
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
range.

109
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,280
I theoretically should not call that an LP little a particle count.

110
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,080
I should call it LP little a ApoB.

111
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
It's too much of a mouthful.

112
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,520
It doesn't fit on a request form.

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,680
So of course it's abbreviated LP little a dash P. And to me, the downside of that is

114
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,400
most people think it's an NMR measurement, which it absolutely is not.

115
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,840
Basically if you want that metric and we've already announced I do work for true health

116
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
diagnostics.

117
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,560
I was working with a different lab before that, the lab that actually did the development

118
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,920
of the LP little a ApoB assay, which true health absorbed and got proprietary rights

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
to when he did it.

120
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,560
So that's it.

121
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,040
And believe it or not, there are people who are going to have discordance with LP little

122
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,600
a mass, the weight of the whole kitten caboodle versus the number of LDL particle counts in

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,520
generally Carly.

124
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,760
But if you really want to know, and also I find it useful, those at least those of

125
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,400
you are doing LDL P by NMR, you have your total LDL particle count.

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
But what does that really include?

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,960
It includes LDLs that don't have a pallet a attachment includes LDLs that do have a

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
pallet attached.

129
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,240
Now I throw a statin at you and we started to talk about this.

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,480
That statin is not going to budge your LP little a particle count at all, but the statin

131
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,800
is going to dramatically lower your LDLs that don't have a pallet a attached to it.

132
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,960
So your LDL total particle will get down a little bit.

133
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,920
But part of that is your LP little a particle count.

134
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,080
But this shows you you are getting benefit when you give a statin to somebody with high

135
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
LPA.

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,160
You're going to have to go after residual risk.

137
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,600
You know, one of the best examples I saw of this was an unusual case where a guy had an

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:13,240
LDL particle of 1600 ish nanomole per liter, but he had an LDL P little a of 600 nanomole

139
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,440
per liter.

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,440
So even though it's an apples and oranges assay, directionally speaking, he's got 600

141
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:28,960
LPA particles are nanomoles of particles per liter and a thousand non LPA little A's.

142
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,080
But when you give him that statin, you're really only targeting the thousand.

143
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,920
And so you'll be surprised at the lack of response you might see because you're not

144
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,240
getting to target those.

145
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,180
But you'll still get your 3040 here, but your total LDL P may still be higher than you wish

146
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,180
it to be.

147
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,920
And unfortunately, that is LP little a particles.

148
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,440
Then you can get into the theoretical discussion right now that if I could get rid of them

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,520
and basically the only way you can do that now is the maybe try niacin, which is a weak

150
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,840
lowering of 20% or a PCSK9 inhibitor, which seems like 30 to 50%.

151
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,960
Well, it would be an individual response.

152
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,800
But it's in that range.

153
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,560
So if somebody could at least afford that drug, you can't get it covered by third party

154
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,840
because they don't have that indication to help you manage LPA little a patients.

155
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:25,520
So and that'll never come because could I ever prove to anybody that the PCSK9 inhibitor

156
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,640
because it's lowering LPA little a is reducing events.

157
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,320
No, because they're going to turn around and say, ah, all its event reduction is they're

158
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,080
just getting rid of the remnants and the LDL particles.

159
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,840
That's nothing to do with lowering.

160
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,640
And how would you argue against that?

161
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,080
We need a drug that only lowers a po little a or LP little a and does nothing to LDL particles.

162
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,360
And that drug is under investigation right now.

163
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,400
It's an APO a synthesis inhibitor where your liver is going to stop making the vast quantities

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,480
of APO a that these people who genetically inherit that propensity.

165
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,640
This is courtesy ISIS.

166
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Yeah.

167
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,280
Again, not to be confused with.

168
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,600
Let's hold our breath.

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,240
But so until then, are there people in the lipidology world who would say, Tom, until

170
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,520
then I'm going to continue to use niacin because lowering it has to work.

171
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
I've been around too long.

172
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,260
Things seeing lowers this and lowers that and they don't work.

173
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,960
So is niacin going to have the same toxicity that I think it has in other people and LP

174
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
little, I don't know.

175
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,680
But if you want to use that because you want to make a patient happy because you're improving

176
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,280
some metric, be my yes, I would not.

177
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,220
I know many lipidologists who would not.

178
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,960
But there are ones and look, Sam Samikas is probably the world authority on this.

179
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,520
Sam uses niacin in his practice too.

180
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,400
And I hope Peter has him on one day with a podcast.

181
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,000
He would tell you until we get our dad on his other drugs.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,680
I'll try and lower it a little bit.

183
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,040
If nothing else, I'm he'll hash to it.

184
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm lowering April be a little bit too.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,920
And I'm if I don't know if it matters, but I'm raising whatever HDL metric.

186
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,040
By the way, although fibrates are probably our best available drug now to raise HDL particle

187
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,120
count niacin, which blows away fibrates on raising HDL cholesterol, there's nothing to

188
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,760
HDL particle counts.

189
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,680
I didn't mention that before.

190
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,840
And because nice and makes the HDL bigger.

191
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I was just about to say that could actually suggest it's worsening LDL HDL function.

192
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Yeah, you're right.

193
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,560
But the niacin people will convince you that the big HDLs are protective.

194
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,440
It's laughable.

195
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,160
And the small HDLs are harmful, whereas the VA has really got to show you the opposite

196
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,080
because the lipid poor HDLs are the ones that can accept the most lipidation.

197
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,440
So you're never going to have definitive answers on any of that.

198
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,240
But there's a lot of BS around.

199
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,400
So what's the best explanation for why a statin, which causes the liver to upregulate

200
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,760
LDL receptors, does not lower LPa, whereas a PCSK9 inhibitor, which also net results

201
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,840
in more or longer transiency of LDL receptors, seems to lower LPa, even though that's not

202
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
its primary objective.

203
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,840
And by the way, the data certainly tells us now that the main determinant of LPa mass

204
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,840
or LPa particle concentration is APOA production in the liver, not clearance.

205
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,240
So until we can really inhibit production of APOA, who knows what you're doing.

206
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,520
Until then, let's see.

207
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,520
So how do LDL receptors clear these particles?

208
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,800
Well, earlier, I think I mentioned that LDL receptors looking for APOE or a section of

209
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,640
the APOB that it can latch onto.

210
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,080
There's a very specific area on the APOB protein on any of the APOB particles that, because

211
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,840
of surface charges, will bind to a specific part of the LDL receptor.

212
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,880
That area on APOB is called the LDL receptor binding domain.

213
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,080
So here comes an LDL particle, and that domain is sticking right out.

214
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,840
It'll stick right to any expressed LDL receptor.

215
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,720
But what if there's something camouflaging that APOA or that LDL receptor binding domain

216
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,280
on APOB, such as an interloper like apoprotein little a?

217
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,040
I could see where that would slow the clearance of an LPa particle, because it's not going

218
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,720
to bind as rapidly and as vividly to an LDL receptor.

219
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,220
So most of these people have way too many LDL particles.

220
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,680
We express whatever LDL particles we want.

221
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,880
We try and express more with the statin.

222
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,520
What are they going to grab first?

223
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,920
The LDL particles that don't have APO little a attached.

224
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,040
And only then would they maybe then start even grabbing APO little a particles or so.

225
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,560
Do we all really have enough LDL receptors?

226
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,120
Most of us, for a variety of reasons, do not.

227
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,400
Other things retard the clearance too.

228
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,440
You know, with the APOC3, I talked about other proteins that may be affecting clearance too.

229
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
So there are just other factors at play.

230
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:58,040
But right now, my guess is APOA is affecting totally efficacious binding to an LP little

231
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,280
a particle.

232
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,120
It's camouflaging the LDL receptor binding domain on APOB.

233
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,120
And therefore, I better learn how to inhibit synthesis of it.

234
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,160
So Sam will obviously, hopefully we do get Sam on the show and we'll talk about this,

235
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,040
but that any sense oligonucleotide is basically going after the jugular issue, which is you

236
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,880
inhibit the synthesis of APO little a.

237
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Yeah.

238
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
And hopefully you do that.

239
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,680
You know, the million dollar question has always been why do we even have APO little

240
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
a to begin with?

241
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,160
Did it ever serve some physiologic function or is it important in any other aspect of

242
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,560
human life?

243
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,360
I guess we'll know it if we eliminate it and there's some bad outcomes in that trial.

244
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,560
And obviously, it absolutely will be looked at for every safety aspect anybody can ever

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,200
think of right now as they're developing that drug.

246
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,000
So right now, I don't think there's anything they're worried about.

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,240
Sam would no more than I.

248
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,480
But yeah, so if we can reduce that in, I don't know that we can shut it down completely,

249
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,400
but he can drastically lower APO little a and LP little a levels too.

250
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,760
So you know, everybody thinks either or you don't, there's a lot of people who have what's

251
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:11,200
considered a physiologic or a non adversarial concentration of LP little a in your system.

252
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,600
So you don't have to make it go to zero, you know, where risk is concerned.

253
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,200
In fact, the only people that are ever going to study this drug is in people like you just

254
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,120
mentioned have an LP little a mass or particle count up in at 600 range or something.

255
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,000
They're not going to take people with borderline LP little a's and risk a clinical trial on

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,800
them.

257
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,480
Just like the first statin trials were done in sort of FH type people or so.

258
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Yeah.

259
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,120
They're enrolling for phase three on that trial, aren't they?

260
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,560
And is it secondary prevention or primary prevention?

261
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm pretty sure it's secondary prevention.

262
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Yeah.

263
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,800
And remember, there is some data in the aphorhesus world that if you pull out LP little a particles,

264
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
there is event.

265
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,720
They're not randomized by the trials because how would you do that with a phoresis that

266
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,400
aphorhesus for the non-physiologists, your it's a dialysis where you're clearing your

267
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,280
blood of you take the blood out, you get rid of the LDL particles and you give the residual

268
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,400
blood back.

269
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,040
So and for at least a week or two, they have less.

270
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,880
But there's so many other things you're clearing the regular LDLs, all sorts of rheological

271
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,520
things, all sorts of other hyperosmotic proteins and things that who knows what the why a phoresis

272
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
really works.

273
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,840
You know, I don't want to get us too far off our main theme of lipidology, but because

274
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:33,680
they're both quite recent, let's just really, really briefly talk about two other interesting

275
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,480
drug trials, which look at a completely different component of the atherosclerotic mechanism

276
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,960
pathway, which is the inflammatory pathway.

277
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,520
So there was an agonist to IL-1, I believe, or maybe it was that was it IL-1 around the

278
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
second.

279
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,320
And then there was also a trial that looked at using low dose of methotrexate.

280
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,800
But you're still ongoing.

281
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,440
There was some preliminary words that it had.

282
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,720
This is looking good, but it's not been definitively released.

283
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,040
But there is the theory this hey, reduce inflammation and you will certainly help vascular health

284
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,720
in capacities.

285
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,320
Maybe even I have nothing to do with lipids or so.

286
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,920
And so what's a great anti-inflammatory drug?

287
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,260
Well, we've been using low dose methotrexate in people with inflammatory disorders without

288
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,340
a lot of toxicity for a long time, rheumatoid arthritis, et cetera, et cetera.

289
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,780
Cultucine, very powerful anti-inflammatory.

290
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,060
There's a big outcome trial undergoing with that.

291
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,580
And I believe within the next year, we're going to have data on both of those trials.

292
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,340
So in the problem that this IL-1 inhibitor that Peter talks about, which has already

293
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,320
published nice outcome data by inhibiting that, but it's a $30,000 drug.

294
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,240
And there was downside to it because by seriously inhibiting the inflammatory system, there

295
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,080
was a slight increase in cancers in some people.

296
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,960
Your immunological system has uses in the body.

297
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,960
So you better be careful how much you knock it out.

298
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,680
Because of course, and because of that downside, it will never get an indication to, for me

299
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,560
and you to use it.

300
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,880
Again if you're some multi-billionaire, it's already been approved for certain type of

301
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
conditions you could use.

302
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,840
Yeah, no, I think the bigger issue is really as more and more of these drugs become available,

303
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,840
hopefully it leads to a more and more personalized type of intervention where look, if you got

304
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,960
somebody who's walking around with a low C-reactive protein and a low fibrinogen and their issue

305
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,000
is elevated, you know, LDL-P, I don't see why you'd want to use an IL-1 agonist on that

306
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
or antagonist rather on that patient.

307
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,960
So yeah, it comes down to basically stratification of what's the driver?

308
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Again this comes back to this idea of necessary but not sufficient, sufficient but not necessary,

309
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,960
neither necessary nor sufficient.

310
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,280
Inflammation is necessary but not sufficient.

311
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,680
You do need an inflammatory response but you can have an inflammatory response and that

312
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,080
by itself doesn't necessarily.

313
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:01,240
No, and a certain degree of inflammation is critical for you to get rid of certain pathologies

314
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,040
yourself so you never want to stop the immunological system.

315
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,680
Yeah, look, I believe like Peter does, these are multifactorial diseases.

316
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,480
We've spent a lot of time on April B. E

317
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,960
but there are many other contributors that go into this.

318
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:24,040
So I believe the better we can evaluate using biomarkers, the better we can identify many

319
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,160
of the known existing pathologies, I'm sure there's many we don't fully understand yet.

320
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,720
And then perhaps we can better individualize our therapeutic suggestions to these people

321
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,120
and know what we have to do both nutritionally and pharmacologically if that's necessary

322
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,600
to normalize whatever you're trying to normalize.

323
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,040
Yeah, it's a complex world out there and you got to look at a lot of things.

324
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,560
So we've already discussed many biomarkers on the lipid front and we've alluded to some

325
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,240
of the biomarkers on the inflammatory side, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen.

326
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,840
But what are some other biomarkers that you find helpful as far as understanding even

327
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,760
more diffusely endothelial dysfunction or other markers of oxidized states that can

328
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,120
give us more of an indication and say, look, you might have two people with the same degree

329
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,160
of dyslipidemia, but one has a greater burden of oxidation going on than the other, which

330
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,760
would be presumably worse.

331
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,080
Presumably, yes.

332
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,240
And the problem is going to be when you even start expanding and I can throw some markers

333
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,760
at you that you might want to measure it.

334
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,840
It would tell you there's a pro-oxidative state going on.

335
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,920
If your mission is to reduce atherophromatic events, trials that show, oh yeah, if we

336
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,400
improve this oxidative marker, it add oxidative matter, people do better.

337
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,060
They've never ever been adjusted for APLB or LDL particle count.

338
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,400
So even though you may show some nice data on them, if you really just normalize APLB

339
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,160
and LDL particle counts, would it even matter?

340
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,400
And don't tell me what common sense suggests.

341
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
And look, I'm all for it.

342
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,600
I use oxidative markers now mostly to try and convince people to do certain nutritional

343
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,360
therapies rather than I got a wonderful drug for you to reduce inflammation because right

344
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,960
now I really don't.

345
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,800
I know if I lower APLB, I reduce inflammation.

346
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,160
So that's one perhaps.

347
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,680
That's your first therapeutic initiative, lowering APLB by nutrition or if the risk

348
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,440
category is high enough a drug, fine.

349
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,440
But could I measure something that tells me you have a pro-oxidative state?

350
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,800
Yeah.

351
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,320
And people do ox LDL levels in the blood.

352
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
They have no idea what they're measuring.

353
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Remember an LDL part, our truly oxidized LDL particle, which is the only type that a macrophage

354
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,480
in your arterial walk can internalize is oxidized in the wall of the artery.

355
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,680
And what is oxidized?

356
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,560
It's the phospholipids on their surface.

357
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,680
Or maybe some free sterols, beta-phytosterol cholesterol.

358
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,960
That oxidized surface lipids is what the scavenger receptor on a macrophage is going to pull

359
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,640
that particle into it and then you start accumulating cholesterol and you have a sterol

360
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
laden foam cell.

361
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,080
Bingo, you got the disease.

362
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,400
But can I measure oxidized LDL in the plasma?

363
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,640
No, LDLs don't get oxidized in the plasma.

364
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,920
There's too many natural antioxidants in plasma where they don't occur.

365
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,880
So what you can measure in plasma is what's called minimally oxidized.

366
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,640
All right, there's a little bit of oxidation occurring.

367
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,880
But it's not the phospholipids.

368
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:32,800
It's some of the struck the proteins on the Apo-B segment are being changed into aldehydes,

369
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,880
which is what the monoclonal antibody picks up.

370
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,960
It picks up aldehydes on Apo-B. But those aldehydes wouldn't have formed if there wasn't

371
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
a little bit of a pro-oxidative state.

372
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:51,400
So when you're measuring ox LDL, it's really Apo-B, a measure of aldeo-Apo-B oxidation.

373
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
But where is Apo-B?

374
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,840
It's on remnants and on LDL particles.

375
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,600
So just understand what you're measuring.

376
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,280
But of all the LDL particles that are floating around, if you get an abnormal ox, you're

377
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,760
looking at maybe 5% of the total particles.

378
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,480
Now you might make the case that when they do enter the artery wall, force them by the

379
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,780
particle number, they're going to be even further enhanced.

380
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,880
So maybe they got a leg up on an oxidized LDL particle.

381
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
OK.

382
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,240
I would use that as a measure of a pro-oxidative state.

383
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,840
And I'd try and give you whatever nutritional things I believe might fight oxidative states

384
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
or so.

385
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,840
I'm not knowing that I got a drug, including a supplement, that ensures me I can do that

386
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,040
or not.

387
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,920
Other than if I had to reach for a supplement, it might be an omega-3 fatty acid.

388
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,120
But it's another story.

389
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,160
So that's what you're measuring with the ox LDL.

390
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,840
I think there are better markers of pro-oxidative states.

391
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,720
And look, a lot of oxidation is the granulocytes oxidizing a variety of tissues.

392
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,200
So myeloperoxidase is a granulis-secreted pro-oxidative enzyme.

393
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
We can measure that easily in the blood.

394
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,560
That would be a signal of a pro-oxidative state.

395
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:13,920
And I think the best of all is as fatty acids get oxidized, derivatives form.

396
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,640
They're shorter chain fatty acids.

397
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,400
And they're put in a big group called isoprostanes.

398
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,960
And you can easily assay something called F2 isoprostanes, which have clearly been linked

399
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,360
to pro-oxidative states.

400
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Now, it's a urine test.

401
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,960
It's not a serum test, but it's a small urine sample.

402
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,080
It's not a 24-hour urine.

403
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,880
So I like to do F2 isoprostanes.

404
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:43,880
So whatever you like to do, be it ox LDL, be it myeloperoxidase, or be it the F2 isoprostanes,

405
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,720
I can use that as useful information and maybe even convince you that nutrition is important

406
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,760
here.

407
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,320
And that is the best way to try and change them around or so.

408
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,120
So those are some of the pro-oxidative marks.

409
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:02,760
What I would not use is a pro-oxidative biomarker that way too many people are is lipoprotein

410
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,000
phospholipase A2.

411
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,280
First of all, the data is pretty poor.

412
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,900
Most people don't even know the only thing the FDA has given that approval for is as

413
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,700
a screening test in primary prevention never ever for anybody on a lipid modulating drug

414
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,060
or on who has known coronary atherosclerosis.

415
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,800
For the simple reason that Mendelian randomization has shown that your level of LPPLA2 activity

416
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,220
or mass has nothing to do with outcomes, sort of like the HDL cholesterol story.

417
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,860
And even more important, there have been two mega trials where pharmaceutical industry

418
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,860
has developed LPPLA2 inhibitors, gave them to patients, shut down LPPLA2 activity, drastically

419
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:53,460
reduce LPPLA2 mass, levels plummeted, no outcome reduction whatsoever.

420
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,700
And LPPLA2 is an enzyme made by the endothelium?

421
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,180
No, it's made by macrophages.

422
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,180
It's a macrophage.

423
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,100
It's just like myeloproxys is made by granulocytes.

424
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,220
The MPO data are equally unimpressive, aren't they?

425
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,500
If you want to come down, depends what you're using it for.

426
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,940
I stopped using MPO like two years ago.

427
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
So look.

428
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
And I agree with you.

429
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
I think I don't do it myself.

430
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
I do the, look, OXLDL I do it.

431
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,660
It's easy to do.

432
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,100
It's there and it's more linked to the process that I can see.

433
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,820
MPO, I don't know, you could have some other vasculitis going on or something.

434
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,380
Yeah, my take on MPO is I found it to be unhelpful and I agree with you that LPPLA2, it's one

435
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,340
of those things you only really need to check once.

436
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,620
Where I find that actually somewhat helpful, and again, I could be just diluting myself,

437
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:43,740
is you take the patient with an elevated LPPL who has an elevated LPPLA2 and not only

438
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,660
do you have a tongue twister, but you also have a patient that might be a little higher

439
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
risk.

440
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,060
And I wondered if I whispered that into Peter's ear over the years or so.

441
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,060
You may have.

442
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,300
But anyway, I tend to agree with him.

443
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,900
So here's why.

444
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,540
LPPLA2, which is an enzyme that does oxidize those phospholipids on an LDL when after that

445
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:09,460
LDL enters the arterial wall, is exposed to reactive oxygen species and some of the

446
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:17,100
fatty acids on the phospholipids start oxidizing, then LPPLA2 activity kicks in and it de-esterifies

447
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
the fatty acids from the phospholipids.

448
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,020
So now you've got oxidized phospholipids floating around and a byproduct called Lysolacetin,

449
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,860
which is a pretty pro-atrogenic molecule.

450
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,580
So LPPLA2 is involved with the production of them in the arterial wall.

451
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,620
That's not where we're measuring LPPLA2.

452
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,980
But hey, if it's on the particle when it goes in the artery wall, whose artery is wall in

453
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,260
today's nutritional environment doesn't have reactive oxygen species sitting there waiting

454
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,060
to attack something.

455
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:54,380
So boy, what particles entering the artery wall are going to have the most LPPLA2 mass

456
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,300
on it when that's where you're going to turn on LPPLA2 activity.

457
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,420
And by the way, the new assays available everywhere, they no longer measure the mass, they measure

458
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
the activity.

459
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,700
We were the last company who finally ran out of reagents, so we're going to activity now.

460
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:15,120
So across the board, the studies show either LPPLA2 mass or activity are identical in predicting

461
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,460
risk if that's what you're using it for.

462
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,900
But believe it or not, the activity assay is so much easier technically to do, less

463
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
costly.

464
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,860
That's what all labs are doing nowadays, the activity.

465
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:33,740
So back to LPPLA2 jumps on LDL, it's a little bit on HDL particles, but most of it is on

466
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
HDL particles.

467
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:42,140
But HDLs are heterogeneous species of normal size, big and small LDL particles.

468
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,420
You'll find way, way more copies of LPPLA2 on the smaller LDL.

469
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:53,420
Perhaps one of the reasons if people believe small LDLs are more atherogenic than larger

470
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,580
sizes, I don't know, once they're in the artery wall, which is driven pretty much by particle

471
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,700
number, but everybody with small LDLs has probably got too many LDL particles.

472
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,860
So they're very prone to oxidation when they do go in the artery wall, not that a big LDL

473
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,560
can't be oxidized, it could be, but it would have less LPPLA2 on it.

474
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,980
But if I really wanted to know the number of copies of that enzyme, LPPLA2, where would

475
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,740
I find it in the blood on LPPLA particles?

476
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,860
That's where it's all carried.

477
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:30,860
So I think Peter hinted on it in his LPPLA2 podcast, that there's another attribute to

478
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:36,420
LPPLA other than quantifying it or weighing its mass.

479
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,720
We do know there are people with high LPPLA who do not get out, and they may be a minority,

480
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
but they're out there.

481
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,780
Just like not everybody with FH is going to have a heart attack, some go through life

482
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
without it.

483
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,660
Most get some events, but many do not.

484
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,380
Clearly there are people without LPPLA who get heart attacks for other reasons.

485
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:00,840
So if you came to me with a very high LPPLA, whatever, do I just say life's over, get your

486
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,420
will in order, I got no drugs that can really help me with this, and you can't afford a

487
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,860
PCSK9 inhibitor, I can't even experiment there.

488
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Maybe the ones who are at most risk, part of the functionality, part of the atherogenic

489
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:22,420
potential of an LPPLA particle is one of the functions, perhaps, of APOLITTLE-A is

490
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:29,620
it's a garbage truck that scavenges oxidized lipid moieties, phospholipids, sterols, and

491
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,860
it brings them back to wherever, maybe it's macrophages that clear them and detoxify them.

492
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:41,460
So it's some sort of a little rescue truck, garbage truck of clearing it.

493
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,860
What happens if you've got way too many LPPL particles, too many LDL particles, so some

494
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:53,940
of them are going in your artery wall, now you have an LPPL that's not only got a potentially

495
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:02,220
pro-atheregenic APOLITTLE-A protein on it, but that thrombotic, if it is a pro-thrombotic

496
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,660
protein, there's plenty of evidence suggesting it is, by the way with arterial, not so much

497
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:12,340
venous thrombosis, many people have dismissed LPPL as being linked to venous thrombosis,

498
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,460
I don't know the sort of, but if you talk to Sam on it, he will tell you.

499
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
Oh, that's interesting.

500
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,260
I stand corrected because I think I was probably quoting some old data when I said that the

501
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,220
VTE hazard ratio is about two.

502
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Yeah, but it's just weak sort of data, so when you talk to Sam, talk to more about that.

503
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,740
So maybe it is, maybe it is.

504
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
Atherobut aortic stenosis.

505
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,820
You're wearing aetherro first, yeah, aetherotic stenosis, yeah.

506
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,620
And part of the pathology, maybe it's just trafficking these oxidized lipid moieties

507
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,940
into your particle, which is going to just stimulate this whole inflammatory mess that's

508
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,300
going on your arterial wall, and maybe it's a pro-thrombotic mess if that's a pro-thrombotic

509
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,780
protein too, the double whammy going in with it.

510
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,460
So, and I think Peter covered it nicely in his discussion there.

511
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,860
There are already segments on APOLITTLE-A called Kringles, and there are a couple of

512
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:08,980
Kringles that have a large essence of lysine amino acid that is like fly paper for oxidized

513
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,820
lipid moieties, so they really bind to these lysine-rich segments on APOLITTLE-A.

514
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,620
So if we could start measuring oxidized phenomenon and tying it into LpL-A-

515
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,140
Now Sam has written about this in his papers.

516
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,260
And Sam has published the data showing that's who you worry about with LpL-A.

517
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:32,060
If they have oxidized APOB phospholipids elevated, Sam's got an assay for that.

518
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
Yeah, so the OxPO-

519
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
It's not available widely.

520
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,660
Yeah, that's a shame.

521
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,180
And heaps Sam will tell you that yes, we're measuring it on APOB particles, but the APOB

522
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,180
particles that carry the vast majority of these oxidized are LpL-A particles.

523
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:51,100
Yeah, it could be a renminatory, oddball LDL particle, but mostly it's your LP.

524
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,260
So that is, again, a double whammy.

525
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,540
So I think maybe in the future we're going to be screening with whatever you want, LpL-A-

526
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,540
mass, LpL-A particle count.

527
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,580
I hopefully never LpL-A cholesterol.

528
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,700
Like all cholesterol metrics should be.

529
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,780
And the only way you can assay it is a poor assay nowadays anyway, is all right, you do

530
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,780
have excess LpL-A, whatever in your system.

531
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,340
Let me now do this follow-up test.

532
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,500
And if that's also up, let's discuss everything we can possibly do until that miracle drug,

533
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,940
hopefully miracle drug comes along and we got a cure for you.

534
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,420
And maybe it'll be covered in those people because the data will be strong because like

535
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,700
all these new antisense drugs, it's going to come with a price.

536
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
Yeah.

537
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,460
Before we leave biomarkers, anything you want to say about asymmetric or symmetric dimethylarginine?

538
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,060
It's a very interesting biomarker also where we talked about endothelial function, perhaps

539
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,260
even some of the antioxidant function is this miracle molecule every endothelial cell

540
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,260
makes extremely transiently makes and it's gone.

541
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,180
It's nitric oxide.

542
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,900
Nitric oxide is a powerful regulatory molecule that regulates vascular reactivity, bioxidation,

543
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:10,140
the thrombotic potential of an endothelial surface initiating a thrombus is highly dependent

544
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,380
on nitric oxide.

545
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,060
So when endothelial cells make nitric oxide, which is by far the most important molecule

546
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,740
they make, where does that come from?

547
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,220
Arginine, the amino acid arginine.

548
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,160
So arginine gets converted into nitric oxide.

549
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,520
So last thing I want is things that are going to screw up arginine pools, which is needed

550
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,500
to make nitric oxide.

551
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:45,060
And two proteolytic molecules we know byproducts of basically catabolism of nuclear proteins

552
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:51,900
is something one is called symmetric and the other one is called asymmetric dimethylarginine.

553
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,420
They're isoforms of one another.

554
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,260
So if you, you know, they're mirror images of one another, but they're actually different

555
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
molecules.

556
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,860
One directly and the other indirectly inhibits the synthesis of arginine.

557
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,420
So if I measured ADMA or-

558
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,140
The synthesis of nitric oxide, you mean?

559
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,140
Right, yes.

560
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,580
Well, ultimately synthesis of arginine, which results in the synthesis of nitric oxide.

561
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:19,460
Oh, see, I always thought that SDMA inhibited the synthesis of arginine, but ADMA inhibited

562
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,800
NOS directly.

563
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,340
I should correct what I said.

564
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:27,200
One inhibits the synthesis and the other enhances the catabolism of arginine.

565
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
So at the end of the day, you're going to have less arginine-

566
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,500
You're going to have less nitric oxide.

567
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,540
And less nitric oxide.

568
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:37,500
And they're both markers that we can easily measure.

569
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,900
So and if we measure them and they're high, you might presume, hey, maybe that's a blood

570
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,940
test that actually tells us something about endothelial function.

571
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,500
I don't think we have another that has anything close to at least that hypothesis.

572
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:56,780
I think the nice thing about the ADMA, SDMA is it creates a biologically plausible mechanistic

573
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:02,820
explanation for why we see an association between high homocysteine and greater disease.

574
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,020
Because homocysteine really inhibits the clearance of ADMA and SDMA.

575
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,940
That's very clear when you correct it.

576
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,660
Which would therefore screw up nitric oxide production.

577
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Correct.

578
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,380
So it brings even oxidation into the process, would disturb that process too.

579
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,900
So if pro-oxidative state, if hyperhomocysteinemia is adversarial to the vasculature, that's one

580
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,220
of the pathways in which it is.

581
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,860
So what can we do?

582
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,940
Well, we can measure it.

583
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,940
So who would I measure, ADMA?

584
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,740
So if you came to me and you're on your third bypass or fourth stent, I think it's a pretty

585
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,740
safe assumption you have screwed up endothelial function.

586
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
So I don't know.

587
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,620
And of course the bigger question is, what do we do about it?

588
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,180
So one thing is, look, if they have impaired renal function, hypertension, those are things

589
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,700
that you go after.

590
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,100
The homocysteine, especially in the MTHFR mutation patients, you give methylated B vitamins,

591
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,940
which is still controversial in sort of mainstream circles.

592
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,100
Because even though it lowers homocysteine, some will point to that and say, well, you

593
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,140
have no outcome data on lowering homocysteine.

594
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,100
But you have plenty of data that in people with hyperhomocysteineuria, lowering homocysteine

595
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,300
drastically improves their vascular outcome.

596
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,420
So it's plausible at a certain threshold of homocysteine that there's probably makes sense.

597
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,260
And if you really understood the pathway of catabolism of methionine, you'd understand

598
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
this better.

599
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,820
And remember, in that pathway is going to be the production of a lot of neurotransmitters

600
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
too.

601
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,500
It's not going on if you have the genotype that's going to screw up methylation or the

602
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,580
enzymes involved with that.

603
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,060
That's another story.

604
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:37,500
But perhaps the best use of ADMA, SDMA is in the primary prevention setting where, all

605
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:44,140
right, you got a little borderline, APLB, LDLP, you're not going to do lifestyle.

606
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,220
Do I really want to throw you on a drug or something?

607
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,860
If those markers are up, that tells me whatever is going on in you, you have endothelial

608
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
dysfunction.

609
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,940
So you're down the road towards vascular pathology.

610
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,260
So it might be a marker to kick you in the rear to at least be super aggressive nutritionally,

611
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,260
even, hey, I'm sorry, whatever nutrition we tried, you still have abnormal endothelial

612
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
function.

613
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,420
It's time for us to, here I would rather improve these markers that will take a drug to get

614
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,980
them to where I want them to be.

615
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,880
So maybe we can use it in that setting.

616
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,720
If you also want to tell it to me, Tom, you said, hey, if you've been through a bypass

617
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,560
or a stent or something, why do it?

618
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,200
But what if I have such a patient who I've maxed out on a statinazetamide, I've done

619
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,520
everything I else to homosistain or insulin resistance and they're still up?

620
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,280
Should I lower APLB even further with a PCS?

621
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,640
Because I mean, you use it for what you want to use it for, but as a marker of endothelial

622
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,720
function.

623
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,960
And very interesting of the two, you get both.

624
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,560
You also get an arginine level in the same assay and SDMA is cleared by your kidneys.

625
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,880
ADMA is catabolized in the cells.

626
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,360
So kidney function has nothing to do with ADMA.

627
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,680
But SDMA, one of the things that will elevate it is renal disease.

628
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,200
And when SDMA goes into serum, it can back flux right into the cell and decrease nitric

629
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,440
oxide production, probably part of the pathology and people are renal failure.

630
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,560
I was just about to say the thing I like about the ADMA, SDMA stuff, even though we don't

631
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,640
have all this great long-term data, is it's one biochemical pathway that provides very

632
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,800
clear evidence for two observations that are undeniable.

633
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
Elevated homosistain and renal function.

634
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,240
The SMA, not the ADMA.

635
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,440
But you get both out of the...

636
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
You get both.

637
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,880
It's not like you're ordering selectively.

638
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,440
You order, you get them all three of those markers.

639
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,360
And they're addressing both sides of that equation.

640
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,720
So it's a very interesting little biomarker there.

641
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,400
And hey, who doesn't want another renal function test?

642
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,440
You're using creatinine, that's kind of a poor, you should be using such statin C.

643
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,720
And SDMA will be further enforcement.

644
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,640
And mild degrees of renal impairment go ignored in this country.

645
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,480
And if you're even in the early stage, even stage two, but certainly by stage three, which

646
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,640
could be a clearance of 70 or something or 60, people that gets ignored, even though

647
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,000
EGFR is being reported to people, and that's a major risk factor that you ought to say

648
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,080
you're a vascular path, you're at risk for vascular disease.

649
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,600
I got to see what I can do to you therapeutically to lower your risk.

650
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,280
But it gets ignored until a creatinine clearance is 32 and you needs dialysis or something.

651
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah, this is one of those things I do talk about with a subset of my patients, especially

652
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,760
these young patients in their 40s, 50s who buy cystatin C and creatinine and maybe even

653
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
a touch of microalbumin.

654
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,960
Their GFR is 80.

655
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,760
And I say if you're 40 and your GFR is 80, there's a problem if you want to live to be

656
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,280
100, because I don't know where you're going to be at 80.

657
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
Yeah.

658
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,480
And look, if you've got albumin in your urine, you've got a serious vasculopathy someplace,

659
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,240
maybe it's just your glomerulus and you've got a kidney disease, but you probably have

660
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,160
some other vascular disease too.

661
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,520
So albumin is just asking something else about something as big as a protein's escaping in

662
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
your urine.

663
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,300
You've got some membrane problems that are aligning some either glomerulus or a blood

664
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,640
vessel someplace.

665
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,560
The other ones are, and it's interesting because Peter in his little world sees a lot

666
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,360
of these people who are well-trained athletes take care of themselves and some of them in

667
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,000
Peter probably encouraged him to build up muscle mass and which can influence creatinine

668
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,320
and makes it far less usable as a marker of renal cystatin C has not influenced by muscle

669
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
mass.

670
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,480
So that's where it picks up some of the imperfections, the weaknesses.

671
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
We check both.

672
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Yeah.

673
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,720
And if you do both, which is, by the way, if you read the kidney guidelines, they've

674
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,520
actually developed a nice equation where your clearance, and we provide this at THD and

675
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,560
I don't know any other lab that does, we give you a clearance based on creatinine.

676
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,120
We give you a clearance based on cystatin C and we give you the best clearance of all

677
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,920
based on both of those parameters.

678
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,600
And then you segregate by African American, non-African American.

679
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,260
Because creatinine is very different in African American.

680
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,080
So there's a lot more to those EGFRs if you haven't studied it lately, they might be going

681
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
on.

682
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,420
And if I'm going to do a biomarker, if there's no other restrictions and what that might

683
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:22,580
be a third party payer or somebody else, I'd rather do the most informative biomarker.

684
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:29,900
And that would be the dual EGFR and maybe some ADMA or SDMA thrown in as a renal marker

685
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,900
anyway.

686
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,180
And that SDMA ADM marker, I really wish we could take you through just be five or six

687
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,660
PowerPoint slides and you'd see these pathways and maybe I'll tweet them in the next week

688
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,660
or so individual slides.

689
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,380
Yeah, we can just attach them here easily to the show notes.

690
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,460
And you'll really, it's not a high, highly mechanized, it's staring right in the face

691
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,940
how they work and what they're doing.

692
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,100
Now we touched on something earlier that I know you wanted to come back to and we were

693
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,580
deliberately short on it, but I'm trying to kind of think about how to land this plane

694
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,700
here.

695
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,300
You want to go back and talk a little bit about what a remnant is?

696
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,780
It gets so much confusion about remnants.

697
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,380
They're talked about like they're one homogeneous entity.

698
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,980
Yeah, like there is a...

699
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,820
First of all, every known lipoprotein class, including LP little a, has remnants.

700
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:22,420
All a remnant is, is a smaller part of its sister particle that's in the same density

701
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,420
class.

702
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,380
The LDLs come in multiple sizes.

703
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,620
You got the big ones, which are only found in people with triglyceride abnormalities.

704
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:34,020
If you don't have a triglyceride disturbance, you will never have a big VLDL particle.

705
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,580
You'll have medium size and very often just small LDLs.

706
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,700
But if you look at your LDLs, there's a normal size particle.

707
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,020
There's a big LDLs and they're small LDLs.

708
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,860
Everybody has a heterogeneous mixture.

709
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,140
There's no human on the planet who has 100% exact diameter of every single sub-fraction

710
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,940
of a lipo HDLs very widely in their density, in their size, in their diameters.

711
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:04,100
Even IDLs, there's a certain diameter range or density range where here's the upper limits

712
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,380
of what you would call an IDL and here's the lower limits of when do you not call it an

713
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:14,420
IDL or it's an LDL or when does a small VLDL, I can't call it a small VLDL anymore.

714
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
It's called an IDL.

715
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,220
But wait a minute, wouldn't an IDL be a remnant of a VLDL?

716
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:27,980
If that LDL has a VLDL or IDL origin, is it an LDL or remnant of an IDL or maybe a VLDL?

717
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,580
Chylomicrons as they lose their triglycerides and phospholipids, they become smaller chylomicrons,

718
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,500
chylomicron remnants, which are for the most part, if you're lucky, cleared by APOE receptors

719
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,420
somewhere but there's chylomicron remnants floating around.

720
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,380
So what is the only particle I really care about?

721
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,300
An APOE particle, it can wind up in your artery wall, get oxidized and deliver the

722
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,060
sterols and you oxidize them and then you got plaque.

723
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,500
So what forces them in?

724
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,200
It's particle number.

725
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:05,500
Now I've also explained, all right, if that's APOE particle number, LDL-P is your first biomarker.

726
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,300
APOE is simply an LDL-P biomarker.

727
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,660
You're not counting VLDL particles because there are so few of them.

728
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,860
You're certainly not counting chylomicrons because there are even fewer of those.

729
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:21,060
So APOE is identifying to you way too many LDL particles in this person but there is

730
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,300
absolutely no doubt.

731
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:30,220
Even though you have way, way more LDL particles than you do have VLDL particles, because VLDL

732
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,700
particles are two or three times bigger than an LDL, the volume of a spear is the third

733
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:41,340
power of the radius, they do carry more cholesterol molecules per particle than an individual

734
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,020
LDL particle.

735
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,620
But of course you have so many more LDL particles than even VLDL or whatever you think a VLDL

736
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,620
remnant is.

737
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,540
Most of the cholesterol getting into your artery wall is still LDL delivered but I am

738
00:46:53,540 --> 00:47:00,540
not denying that VLDL particles cannot deliver cholesterol and get oxidized when they are

739
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,580
into the artery wall.

740
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,860
They can.

741
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,700
So what has been the classic definition of a VLDL remnant?

742
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:13,100
Well they've always said well do that conversion factor we told divide triglycerides by five,

743
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:19,180
if that's high the VLDL cholesterol is high, they have too many VLDL remnants.

744
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,540
And no doubt if we really had a VLDL remnant test that's true.

745
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,540
But it would not be true in other people.

746
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,260
So there aren't some poor man's perhaps estimate of remnants.

747
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:34,860
I'm trying to clarify what you're saying because I think it's a bit confusing to the listener.

748
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,380
You can estimate VLDL cholesterol in two ways.

749
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,260
You can take triglyceride and divide by five and the higher the triglyceride level

750
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,260
the less accurate that becomes.

751
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,100
You can take non-HDL cholesterol and subtract LDL cholesterol from it and you'll get an

752
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,620
estimate as well.

753
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,420
Those two don't often agree by the way but nevertheless you have two estimates.

754
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,780
But that still doesn't answer the question.

755
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,380
Which of those go on to become pathologic remnants?

756
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,380
Correct.

757
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,340
So all you're identifying there is you have increased cholesterol content in VLDL particles

758
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,980
and because the ones we fear the most are remnants we're just presuming oh boy there's

759
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,980
got to be remnants.

760
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,500
There's got to be remnants here.

761
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,980
So whatever therapy you're thinking of doing in this person you better get rid of some

762
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,980
remnant therapy too.

763
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:26,860
Well all of the FDA approved drugs that lower APOB, whether it's statinazetimibe, fibrates

764
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:31,420
which are approved to lower LDL cholesterol even though they don't really do it that much,

765
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,260
you see it's clear all APOB particles including remnants.

766
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,700
So your ultimate solution, now your first solution might be nutritional if it's not

767
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,260
somebody coming off their bypass who is in the nightmare risk range classification where

768
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,140
I think you need a lifestyle and pharmacology day one.

769
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,780
You just don't have too many decades have passed.

770
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,820
You shouldn't be putzing around.

771
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,780
On a real short time you know the nutritional therapy if I think you have remnants is going

772
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,780
to be.

773
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,900
I'm going to address insulin resistance in you.

774
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:08,060
So I'm being an advocate of some degree of carbohydrate restriction and certainly a clear

775
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:13,780
advocate for a lot of reasons apart from even APOB would be the fasting is part of your

776
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,860
diet and too.

777
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,980
So great if you want to use your VLDL cholesterol and it makes you think there's remnants and

778
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,620
you're going to suggest the therapy.

779
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,420
I would tell you if your total drug guy did I out of a drug then that's the person you

780
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,620
give a fibrate to with your statin because that's what the fibrates really do well.

781
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,620
But I can show you that.

782
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:37,540
At zetimite the statin clears as many remnants as that combination too but I think fibrates

783
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,300
bring other things to the table that perhaps Zetia does it in people with triglyceride

784
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,340
rich lipoproteins.

785
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,900
And one of them is going to be so it's how I really think we're going to have to identify

786
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,180
remnants.

787
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:56,300
So just even tell there's a laboratory that produces they separate VLDL particles by ultra

788
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,220
centrifugation.

789
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:04,900
The NMR people used to report total VLDLP but they would also give you large VLDLP plus

790
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,220
medium VLDLP plus small VLDLP.

791
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,940
And we used to say well the small VLDLP those are the remnants that's the mark.

792
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:20,220
Well they don't do that anymore they only give you the large VLDL-P anymore those NMR

793
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:25,580
generating labs that have the proprietary ability to release VLDL particle data and

794
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,940
that's not all in them.

795
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,580
Is that liposcience or lab core now?

796
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,660
Well there is no more liposcience it's lab core.

797
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,940
So you will get a large VLDLP and it has one reason and one reason alone.

798
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,540
It's a lipoprotein marker of an insulin resistant state.

799
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,540
That's it.

800
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,300
It's not a goal of therapy it's nothing.

801
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,300
There's no data that of what you do to VLDLP affects outcomes although I'd make the case

802
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,780
that maybe it does.

803
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,620
But it's just an IR marker.

804
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:55,500
I can measure small dense LDL cholesterol, HDL2 cholesterol, just small LDL particle

805
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,500
concentration I can do an insulin level and 10 other tests that tell me your insulin resistance.

806
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,140
So I don't need any VLDLP marker.

807
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,820
I mean they were using that as part of their IR algorithm squad.

808
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:12,020
If you don't have that and they use the effector in VLDL size here because the big triglyceride

809
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,760
rich VLDL is a marker of insulin resistance.

810
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:20,160
But if you're measuring insulin levels and other insulin biomarkers they're no better

811
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
than that.

812
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,720
I don't know is there any better than just measuring small LDL particle concentration

813
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,320
at least in a drug naive person.

814
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,420
So fine it is a marker of insulin resistance.

815
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:37,520
But this other lab the Cenofusion they tell you look at our smaller VLDL cholesterol those

816
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,520
are remnants.

817
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,400
How do they know?

818
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,560
All they know is that person has extra cholesterol in their small VLDL particles.

819
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,480
But VLDLs depending on two things.

820
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:56,280
It's APOE content and it's APOC3 content is going to be virtually instantly cleared.

821
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:03,360
So if your small VLDL particles are being rapidly cleared by your APOE, APOB100 receptors.

822
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,520
So in other words if you took a bunch of small VLDLs and some of them had lots of APOE and

823
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,240
very little APOC3 those aren't remnants.

824
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,240
They're not pathological.

825
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
They're not sticking around.

826
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,720
If they're small VLDLs that's what they are but are they disease causing VLDLs?

827
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,720
Right.

828
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,240
Look some of them probably get in but very few compared to LDL particle number.

829
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,240
And also remember.

830
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,800
And very few relative to a small VLDL that would be high in APOC3 and or low in APOE.

831
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,360
Yeah which is never going to be cleared.

832
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,620
APOC the main down there's a lot of downsides to APOC3.

833
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,320
It's a pro-inflammatory protein.

834
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,120
It really enhances VLDL production in the liver.

835
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,800
But it just retards their clearance and it probably interferes with the hydrolysis induced

836
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,720
by lipoprotein lipase.

837
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,080
So you're increasing half-lives of all triglyceride rich lipoproteins which let's CEP exchange

838
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,680
occur longer.

839
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,760
And what is CEP exchange doing?

840
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,600
Bringing more cholesterol into your VLDL particles enhancing cholesterol enrichment.

841
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,500
Those VLDLs are losing triglycerides of the other in cholesterol.

842
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,860
So these are all the pathologies that might go on if you have delayed clearance.

843
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:16,760
And C3 is going to delay the clearance for multiple reasons of these particles.

844
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,300
So I want a blood test that tells me the APOC3 content of your APOBs.

845
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,580
LDLs that have APOC3 cannot be cleared.

846
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:31,580
In one of the early Pravastatin trials, the care trial, they went back and they who would

847
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,820
have had high triglycerides gets coronary events.

848
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,960
And this is Frank Sacks up in Boston and they've been able to measure this in sophisticated

849
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,700
lipid labs for a long while.

850
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:48,620
If your LDL had CEP APOC3 on it, Pravastatin was a useless drug, didn't reduce any events.

851
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,340
It still reduced APOB but it didn't reduce events?

852
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,860
It would clear some LDL particles.

853
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,900
It didn't reduce events in people who had high triglycerides.

854
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:04,900
So the APOC3, it's not measuring triglycerides that matters, it's APOC3.

855
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,260
And a lot of people with APOC3 might only have a triglyceride of 110, 120.

856
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,820
Wait, which trial was this?

857
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,220
A care trial, cholesterol and acute.

858
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,700
It was the second secondary prevention trial.

859
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:21,100
Simbostatin 4S was first and that was Swedes with super high LDL cholesterol and heart

860
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,100
attacks.

861
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:28,140
And that was done in Boston at the Brigham where they enrolled people with unremarkable

862
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,860
at the time LDL cholesterol 130 or lower who had heart attacks.

863
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:36,220
And they gave them Pravastatin and got pretty much the same event reduction as they got

864
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,460
in the 4S trial.

865
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,580
But the ones that had high trigs didn't have the reduction?

866
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:44,900
Yeah, so they went back in a post hoc analysis and those who had high trigs, Pravicle lowers

867
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,620
triglycerides, does it matter?

868
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,660
That's one of the benefits of Pravastatin.

869
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,460
The only people that got event reduction where Pravastatin lowered triglycerides was those

870
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,700
who had APOC3 enriched LDL particles.

871
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,300
So APOC3 becomes your biomarker.

872
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,180
Is Sam's company also working on?

873
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:09,340
I believe, yeah, in production is an anti-sense molecule that's going to stop APOC3 production

874
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:14,140
because Peter, I believe you also know the Mendelian thing there is gain of function

875
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,740
loss of function of APOC3 is tied into longevity also.

876
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:23,020
Actually, I think this is of all the major longevity genes.

877
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:28,260
I do not believe, and I could stand corrected, but I'm in the process of writing for the

878
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,420
book now.

879
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:35,340
I don't think there is a longevity gene on cardiovascular disease that is a stronger

880
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:39,260
predictor of longevity than hypo-functioning APOC3.

881
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,540
Yeah.

882
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:45,500
So in very interesting, and we just got tweeted about it, I'm sure within the last week, a

883
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,900
very interesting trial that if you're going to use an omega-3 fatty acid, when they compared

884
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:57,820
DHA versus EPA, DHA is the one that lowers APOC3, not EPA.

885
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:04,900
So all of these mega advocates of EPA, I don't know if APOC3 is involved there, maybe you

886
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,900
better find some DHA.

887
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,900
Well, I got to be honest with you.

888
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,660
I used to see myself as more of an EPA guy.

889
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:16,060
And then my focus on DHA, I think became more something I saw in the mild cognitive

890
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,400
impairment literature, which was the importance of DHA in the brain.

891
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,540
But I didn't realize this DHA C3 relationship.

892
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,540
Yeah.

893
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:29,860
So there, look, from my mind for years, it's been omega-3s are not lipid drugs.

894
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,860
Ignore them.

895
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,700
Don't use them to putz around with lipids because you don't know what they're doing.

896
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,700
That's changed now.

897
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,380
Clearly, high dose prescription strength EPA can be a helpful adjunctive therapy to

898
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,380
lower APOB.

899
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:46,940
And whether it's with remnants or whatever it's doing, it's lowering APOB an additional

900
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,860
8%, 10%.

901
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,860
Great.

902
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,740
And it's a pretty innocuous therapy.

903
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:56,540
I always worried about those who might not be able to convert EPA to what I believe is

904
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,500
the necessary DHA also, especially in the brain.

905
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,540
So, but I can measure that in the plasma.

906
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:05,300
I've been thinking about, I'd like to have Bill Harris on the show as well to have a

907
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:09,460
discussion about this because at least at the time of our recording today, I would

908
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,900
say that the mainstream view of EPA and DHA is that they're useless, right?

909
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,900
That's the press for today.

910
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,900
That's the mainstream view.

911
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,900
Yeah.

912
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,380
The mainstream view is abandon all of these dumb sort of supplements.

913
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,460
But as is often the case, when the mainstream says something in a declarative fashion, they're

914
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,460
usually wrong.

915
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,980
Especially on a nutrient, you know, where they're looking about what you're eating,

916
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,460
not taking pharmacologically, where you might have a real serious trial.

917
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,460
Yeah.

918
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,740
They're confused by supplements versus pharmacologic grades.

919
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,460
Most of the trials that they would quote is Omega is being useless.

920
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,780
They're using some miniscule, not a pharmacologic dose of these things.

921
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,580
And they're not measuring even who's deficient in Omegas.

922
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:51,900
And if you're not deficient in it, why would I even give you an Omega's re-pros?

923
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,220
And measuring fatty acids in the blood, I would encourage you to measure red blood cell

924
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:02,300
Omega 3's that are like a glycohemoglobin out of a 30 or a 60, 90 day half life, rather

925
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,540
than a plasma free fatty acid Ome, which might be what did you eat for lunch?

926
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,540
Yeah.

927
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,900
And also there's other intricacies involved.

928
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,460
But nonetheless, just all things to think about there.

929
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,940
So in this DHA with APOC3 is kind of interesting.

930
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,140
Now look, some people, if you're just going to drown them in EPA, do convert it to DHA.

931
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,900
So it's not an issue.

932
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,220
But we can measure that.

933
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,220
And I think we'd know.

934
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:32,100
Oh boy, and you, you got to have some of that either eaten or supplemented.

935
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:37,580
Are you pushing patients towards closer to 10% red blood cell EPA DHA level these days?

936
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,580
Or are you?

937
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,380
Well, I don't see patients anymore.

938
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:46,100
But if you want to ask me, yeah, that would probably, you know, there's no, you know,

939
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,100
Bill Harris would tell you, why not make it 14%?

940
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,700
But we don't have any data that would show, hey, that's harmful.

941
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,900
But we don't have any data showing you can even make it that high or so.

942
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,540
Not even epistaxis and things like that.

943
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,540
Easy for using.

944
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:04,820
So far anything with it, they've never turned anything from an omega three into coagulation

945
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,820
disturbance.

946
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:10,700
I mean, I definitely have to add that, hey, some Eskimos had a bloody nose one day on

947
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,340
and what else they're eating EPA and DHA all day long.

948
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,660
So I don't know that would have to be tested.

949
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,940
By the way, Tom, I just have to take issue with that as a Canadian.

950
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,780
I think we refer to them as Inuit now.

951
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

952
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,180
Eskimos is an old New Jersey term.

953
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,580
They're culturally insensitive.

954
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,580
I'm not going to.

955
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
I'm not going to stand for that.

956
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,580
You're right.

957
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,580
I know I insulted him.

958
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:35,700
But I really do need to get Bill on the show because he's always, Bill's one of these guys

959
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,700
who is, and again, many listeners won't know who Bill Harris is, but I hope to change that.

960
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:48,260
Just this is a guy who is as devoted to understanding the entire body of literature and science of

961
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:52,420
omega fatty acids in general, especially omega three and sixes.

962
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,820
You are to lipids.

963
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,020
Way more than me.

964
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,860
And he was a colleague I worked for three or four years with.

965
00:59:58,860 --> 00:59:59,860
I love the guy.

966
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,860
We'd lunch all the time.

967
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,860
We'd go out.

968
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,300
So he has taught me so much.

969
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:09,980
And he is the guy who developed the red blood cell, phospholipid fatty acid assay.

970
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,020
So he knows what he's talking about.

971
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:16,020
And it gets so intriguing because even for those of you listening who may be taking an

972
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,900
omega three or prescribing an omega three, be it a supplement or be it a prescription

973
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,500
product, what vehicle is that?

974
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,980
It's just, is it, are you prescribing a free omega three fatty acid?

975
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:29,980
You're not.

976
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,860
There is an FDA approved product that the company who developed it is not brought to

977
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:33,940
market yet.

978
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:40,860
So you're either prescribing a starified omega three fatty acids or it's a starified to something

979
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:46,220
else or it's a starified to glycerol as a phospholipid or it's a starified to a glycerol

980
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:50,540
back bone where it has three fatty acids, but only one of them is an omega three.

981
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:55,740
Or are you buying a super enriched that all three fatty acids are starified to an omega

982
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,740
three?

983
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,740
You wouldn't need very small.

984
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:03,820
So what is the vehicle in your favorite supplement that's carrying the, all of that comes into

985
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:04,820
the pharmacodynamics.

986
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,780
You know, I just realized like I don't actually know the, cause there's only two supplements

987
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,620
over the counter that I fancy.

988
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,920
One is Carlson's, the other is Nordic Naturals, just based on some of the toxicology stuff.

989
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,220
But I don't know the answer to the question you just asked.

990
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:22,500
You can't get that information unless your brother works there and is privileged to that.

991
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:27,100
The companies won't even tell you what they are starified and look, you hear about these

992
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:33,660
krill products, they're phospholipids and that means there's one fatty acid on them.

993
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,580
So you got to prescribe a lot of krill pills to achieve a certain omega three way less

994
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:45,540
than you would if you had a die a starified or luckily enough, a triesterified triglyceride

995
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,540
my vehicle.

996
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:50,980
I'm always, I'm always happiest when I see my patients just eat enough salmon.

997
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,420
So listen, at the end of the day, that's all cool.

998
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,940
It's good to know, but at the end of the day, whatever way they're somehow getting omega

999
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:03,380
threes into your body, if you're normalizing the omega three index, does that even matter?

1000
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,460
All that other stuff.

1001
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:09,020
So it all depends, but I would implore you to follow up, please.

1002
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,340
Yeah, I want to dig into this a little bit because it never occurred.

1003
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,340
I gotta be honest with you.

1004
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,140
I'm ashamed to admit this because I hate being the guy who makes dumb assumptions and is

1005
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,700
too lazy to follow up.

1006
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:25,820
I've always assumed that the high quality EPA DHA supplements were triacylglycerides.

1007
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,820
Almost none of them are.

1008
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,140
They're mostly monoglycerols, but it's glycerol with two other fatty acids plus one omega

1009
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,820
three fatty acid.

1010
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,080
And what are those other fatty acids?

1011
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:40,900
If nothing else, they're calories that you may or may not need or they're a harmful fatty

1012
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,460
acid even or so.

1013
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,460
Interesting.

1014
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,700
We'll get to the bottom of this.

1015
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,260
And there's no pharma grade DHA to your knowledge.

1016
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,260
No.

1017
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,180
But here's what there is, and it's already FDA approved, but the company that developed

1018
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,220
the product is not brought to market, but I think they're going to, because this November

1019
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:03,980
at the American Heart Association, you are going to get the people at risk who are on

1020
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:09,620
statins and half of them are getting statins plus EPA and the other half are getting statins

1021
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,140
plus EPA placebo, no EPA.

1022
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,540
And we're going to get outcome.

1023
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,220
What dose of EPA?

1024
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,220
It's high.

1025
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,220
It's three, four grams.

1026
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,060
It's the prescription strength.

1027
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:23,580
So are we going to see cardiovascular?

1028
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,700
All indications and we're all optimists are it's going to be a positive trial.

1029
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,740
They haven't stopped it, at least for futility.

1030
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,700
They certainly haven't stopped it for toxicity.

1031
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,700
The trial is over.

1032
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,260
They're generating the data now.

1033
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,300
Wouldn't they have just stopped the fertility and gone away if it didn't work?

1034
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,860
So we're all expecting that it's EPA added to the statins going to work.

1035
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,860
Why wouldn't it?

1036
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,860
It's an EPA.

1037
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:51,300
It probably has other physiologic attributes that can reduce certain inflammatory markers

1038
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,220
here, and it's an ICA-POB additional lower.

1039
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:03,820
Now the company that has developed free omega-3 fatty acids, so they're not as terrified to

1040
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:04,820
anything.

1041
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,160
That means they're very bioavailable.

1042
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,420
You just swallow it.

1043
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,100
Remember, anytime you swallow an esterified omega-3 fatty acid, you have to secrete pancreatic

1044
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:17,340
enzymes to deesterify it because it can't be absorbed without that.

1045
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:23,540
Even phospholipids, krill oil, has to be deesterified by a specific lipase coming out of your panther.

1046
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,820
Right, but a free fatty acid is easy to use.

1047
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:28,700
A free fatty acid is going to come right in, but we don't eat them.

1048
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:32,260
You might in certain foods, but even most of the foods you eat, it's triglycerides

1049
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,260
that are delivering.

1050
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,660
Don't free fatty acids taste horrible?

1051
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,540
I don't know.

1052
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,140
Maybe that's why they're not there.

1053
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:46,340
I think most of the time they're stored as energy and as not free fatty acids, so they've

1054
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,740
got to be deesterified.

1055
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:51,660
But anyway, this company that has them, why didn't they?

1056
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:56,740
Because this is a company that manufactures a statin.

1057
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:00,900
What they were hoping was they thought that people make an EPA.

1058
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:05,860
The FDA was going to give them an indication based solely on additional LDL cholesterol

1059
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,420
lowering or APOB lowering.

1060
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:14,900
That will let you come on the market pending your outcome data because non HDL is better,

1061
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,540
whatever the FDA didn't.

1062
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,220
FDA even told me they couldn't do it.

1063
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:23,340
The company, which is Amarin, actually took the FDA to court and the Supreme Court says,

1064
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:28,260
no, even though you don't have an approval for it, you can at least go share this with doctors.

1065
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:34,780
And that Amarin EPA product, the SEPA, has skyrocketed in sales because doctors believe

1066
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,260
this, hey, additional data with the SEPA.

1067
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:45,340
So the company that, and so you would add SEPA to your favorite statin of choice and

1068
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,340
then you're taking it to trial.

1069
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,340
Which statin do they make?

1070
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,340
No, they don't make a statin.

1071
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,820
They make EPA.

1072
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,700
So they want you to add SEPA to whatever statin you're ordering.

1073
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,180
Oh, I thought they also made a statin.

1074
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,180
No, they don't.

1075
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:59,420
So you can pick your favorite statin, but now you have like a Zetimibe you might add

1076
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,420
to a statin.

1077
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,380
You can now add SEPA.

1078
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,540
If you're evidence based, you're going to follow the trial.

1079
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:05,660
I'm going to wait till November.

1080
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,660
Oh, I would too.

1081
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,660
Yeah.

1082
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:14,060
And not that I wouldn't be using EPA, DHA for perhaps other reasons, cognitive or whatever,

1083
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,980
just cell membrane health.

1084
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:21,260
But the other company that makes a statin called Resuvistatin, the pretty, and that

1085
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,940
would be called AstraZeneca is the one that owns this.

1086
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:30,300
So what they were clearly hoping that had Amarin got an indication to add it to a statin,

1087
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:36,860
they would have released a combo product called Resuvistatin, their EPA product or

1088
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,860
so.

1089
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:44,260
And you would have in one pill your statin plus your proper dose of Omega threes and

1090
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:49,060
they would be free Omega three fatty acids, which would zoom right into your body.

1091
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:54,900
I got a feeling if, and by the way, they are completing their own big outcome trial with

1092
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,900
Resuvistatin plus the non-aestarified free fatty acids.

1093
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,440
So they'll wait for their trial too.

1094
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,480
But if this first trial works, why would there's not even work better?

1095
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,540
Cause it's combining it with the most potent statin.

1096
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:16,300
So all these people who've been bad mouthing Omega three is with no trial data may have

1097
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:21,060
to change at least some of that talk come November at the American Heart Association.

1098
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:25,540
It's the biggest trial going to come out of AHA this year, at least in the lipid world.

1099
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,900
So pay strict attention.

1100
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,940
Still a month or so before.

1101
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,500
Normally they don't leak out that data cause that somehow prohibits publication in prestigious

1102
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:41,260
journals, but some companies do cause it just means so much financially to them that it'll

1103
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,180
get published somewhere.

1104
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,700
So I don't know one way or another, we're going to have it in November.

1105
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,020
Now we've danced around this idea of red blood cells for a while.

1106
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,020
They keep coming up.

1107
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:54,540
So let me redirect us to another topic, which is you've already said red blood cells per

1108
01:07:54,540 --> 01:08:01,540
molecule carry many, many more molecules of cholesterol than any lipoprotein does.

1109
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:05,280
Why don't red blood cells cause atherosclerosis?

1110
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,220
Because they're not invading your arterial wall and not subject to oxidative forces where

1111
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,820
a macrophage is going to ingest the red blood cell.

1112
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:18,220
Do they not invade the artery wall because they can't penetrate the sub endothelial space?

1113
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,220
Yeah, they're gigantic.

1114
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,620
Now, listen, can a red blood cell get into plaque?

1115
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,740
Yeah, through the vase of a serum.

1116
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:27,980
So could there be some in there that are, so the vase of a serum meaning from the other

1117
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:28,980
side?

1118
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,300
Or you remember artery walls get arterial supply.

1119
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,820
They need oxygen.

1120
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:36,400
Even plaque has little capillaries and stuff.

1121
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,740
Are there red blood cells in expanding plaques?

1122
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,740
Sure.

1123
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:45,060
So not to say they're not a tiny little part, but that's not your primary delivery of oxidized

1124
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,840
phospholipids and sterols into the artery wall.

1125
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,440
Red blood cells are not being entering the artery wall and being oxidized, you know,

1126
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,400
like the APOB particles are.

1127
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,400
Yeah.

1128
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,720
So this kind of gets back to sort of the causality issue of low density-like approaches.

1129
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:06,000
Although also red blood cells carry way more cholesterol molecules, you have bazillions

1130
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,920
more APOB particles than you have red blood cells also.

1131
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,360
So yes, quantity-wise, they're carrying a lot of cholesterol, but not red blood cell

1132
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,680
number-wise versus LDL number-wise.

1133
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:22,480
So the size of the LDL particle obviously is what enables it to easily get into and

1134
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
do that now though?

1135
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,320
Oh yeah, number and size, but as you know, I've taught you this a long time ago, any

1136
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:33,960
VLDL or under 17 nanometers can work its way into an endothelial gap or an arterial wall

1137
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,960
through a scavenger receptor, whatever.

1138
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,640
So not to say remnants aren't at their jet, they can't get in because remnants are way

1139
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,640
bigger than an LDL.

1140
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,400
No, they could.

1141
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,420
But there's just more of the LDL particles.

1142
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:52,200
So if this is a diffusion gradient for sitting an end, there's a hell of a lot more LDL troublemakers

1143
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,200
than there are remnant troublemakers.

1144
01:09:54,200 --> 01:10:00,020
Not to say some big tough guy isn't a big troublemaker by himself, he is, but he's,

1145
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,020
which would you rather have?

1146
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,020
A thousand guys coming at you?

1147
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,020
You're one guy.

1148
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,340
I take my odds that I could beat one guy rather than a thousand guys, you know?

1149
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,060
Yeah, yeah.

1150
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,740
You know, I figure it's hard to believe we've been going out this for almost seven hours

1151
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,260
and I feel like there's at least another hour or two we could go.

1152
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:21,260
But at the same time, I want to be sensitive for the listener.

1153
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:25,060
Normally I say I want to be sensitive to the guest, but I know you and I can keep talking

1154
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,840
about this for six hours and we're going to go have dinner with Jamie Underberg tonight

1155
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,900
and just continue this discussion.

1156
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,700
I wish I had a microphone for dinner because I have a feeling that's going to be equally

1157
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,700
interesting.

1158
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,120
One of the things you talked about at the very outset was a really close friend of yours

1159
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,500
who got you into hockey.

1160
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:45,340
Took you to your first game at Madison Square Garden, got you hooked.

1161
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,420
You were both obsessed with being firefighters.

1162
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:48,940
He went on to become a firefighter.

1163
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,700
You went on to become a lipid educator.

1164
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:57,660
Yeah, so let me just pick up that my, you know, if you look back in life, who are some

1165
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:03,260
of your absolute best friends, your high school buddies, who you really spend all that enjoyable,

1166
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,500
the type of enjoyment you can have at that age that you never can have at another age

1167
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,180
and you can do things.

1168
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:14,640
And especially when we grew up in, we were in high school, 59 to 63, you could get away

1169
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,660
with a lot of junk in those days.

1170
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:21,980
Whereas today we were in the expelled real quickly or so with some of the shenanigans

1171
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:22,980
we do.

1172
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:27,500
So, and look, I, I joked with Peter when I was telling this story, I think he really

1173
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,780
wanted to be my best friend because my father was a fire chief in the town of Patterson,

1174
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,740
New Jersey, where we went to high school.

1175
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,860
But even if that was true, I love firefighting.

1176
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,460
What do I care if he loved firefighters?

1177
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,740
We used to get on our bikes and write the fires all the time together and watch fires

1178
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,460
and stuff or drive the firehouses.

1179
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:47,740
So we were really tight for a million reasons and we just got along personality wise, but

1180
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:52,620
he is the guy who invited me to my first ice hockey guy, which was certainly impacted my

1181
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,020
life and my son's life in mega ways.

1182
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,380
My son's a very successful guy and he would tell you would never be half as successful

1183
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:05,220
had he not played ice hockey and developed the teamwork and the camaraderie.

1184
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,700
Speaking of a fire engine.

1185
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,540
It is perfect timing to have a fire truck going down.

1186
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:15,980
But I'm going to just keep talking about this fire truck because it's not high lipid science.

1187
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:20,140
So my buddy there, he went and became, and I knew him all my life and I went and became

1188
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,780
a doctor, but right in, in that same city or in a suburb of that city.

1189
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,500
So it's not like he didn't know where to find me.

1190
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:32,380
But at a certain point earlier in life, I knew my buddy, a, a, you're a doctor now,

1191
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,420
I got this cholesterol problem.

1192
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:39,940
They tell me my cholesterol is up in the blood and you know, I was probably at the point

1193
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:43,980
where we were really taking cholesterol serious and we could do something about it.

1194
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,820
They're all, you got to come and see me.

1195
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,820
Come on.

1196
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:52,620
You know, and I was probably even the days before I was just solely dwelling on lipoprotein

1197
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:57,260
ology and lipidology, but I was very aggressive with understanding cholesterol and knowing

1198
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,780
look who I evolved into.

1199
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:02,140
So it would have probably been a smart choice for him to come up.

1200
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,160
It's not like I was going to charge him and he couldn't afford me.

1201
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,940
He's a fireman in a big city.

1202
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:10,680
He had as good a health insurance as you could ever get.

1203
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,660
So it's not like it would have cost him 10 cents.

1204
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:17,540
A lot of firemen did pick me as their doctor because of who my father was.

1205
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,500
And they knew he was a guy who likes fire engines.

1206
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,580
We used to see him as a kid in the firehouse.

1207
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,020
I want him to be my doctor.

1208
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,820
He knows what I do.

1209
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:30,260
Earl just is one of these people who thought the farther I stay away from doctors, the

1210
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,260
better.

1211
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,780
I don't want to hear what they got to tell me.

1212
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,700
I don't want to be on a medicine.

1213
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,900
I don't want to do anything.

1214
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:43,580
And Earl got buried in his mid fifties with a sudden acute myocardial infarction sitting

1215
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,220
at home watching TV.

1216
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,340
He could have been climbing a ladder out of fire.

1217
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,540
By the way, if he did die to fire, his name would be on the Memorial Monument up in that

1218
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,580
city.

1219
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,060
But he died at home the next day.

1220
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,740
So not that I want his name on.

1221
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:00,180
I really wish it was because he's just such a debt.

1222
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:03,340
But there is such a needless death.

1223
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:10,820
And I think across America all the time, there are many young age needless deaths occurring

1224
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:16,740
with a very preventable, treatable disease that's being ignored totally because they

1225
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:22,540
don't go and get it checked or they're getting bad advice based on the wrong metrics.

1226
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,900
So my buddy there is the perfect example.

1227
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,100
But what a tragedy.

1228
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,980
Had he made the right, I like this guy.

1229
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,820
He's my best buddy.

1230
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,820
He's not going to screw me or do anything wrong.

1231
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,820
Let me go to him.

1232
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,820
He didn't.

1233
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,140
Every time I saw him, I'd remind him, Earl, come up, come up, please come up.

1234
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:41,500
Yeah, yeah, Tom.

1235
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,700
Never did.

1236
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:46,780
Well, in many ways, that's a reasonable and sad way to kind of end this discussion.

1237
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:51,500
But it also brings it kind of back to why we why do we get so animated about this topic?

1238
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,700
Well, I think, as you said, we think of this as, you know, one of the big three diseases

1239
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,820
that kills most people in the civilized world once they get out of childhood.

1240
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:02,380
And by civilized, I really mean developed.

1241
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,380
People know what I mean.

1242
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:07,980
But of the big three diseases, this is the one where I think we know the most about it.

1243
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:12,020
And therefore, by extension, it's probably the one that's most delayable.

1244
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,020
Never want to say preventable.

1245
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,020
Right.

1246
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,020
We use that term.

1247
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,020
But in reality, what does that mean?

1248
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,580
It means delay.

1249
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,980
And so if Earl died in his early 50s, maybe with the right care, he could have died in

1250
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,980
his late 60s.

1251
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:27,220
You know, again, if a guy's dying in his 50s of heart disease, he's probably got really

1252
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,220
bad disease.

1253
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:31,980
He needed therapy at a real young age, but he could have hung around for a while.

1254
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:36,660
He's got grandkids and children and stuff who really wish he was still here at a fire

1255
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,660
department.

1256
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,660
He was a beloved fireman.

1257
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,300
They all wish he was still on.

1258
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,660
He'd be retired by now.

1259
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:47,420
But he's just one of these people that God sends to earth that do nothing but good while

1260
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,100
they've been here through their whole life.

1261
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:56,740
He had saints, his parents, and he was so tragic that he left us at such a young age

1262
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:02,220
and got driven to the graveyard on the back of a fire truck with a flag on a Vietnam veteran.

1263
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:06,340
And so, but just so, so sad.

1264
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,540
And listen, I want to wrap this up myself.

1265
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,500
And I used to wrap up a lot of lectures I did with this.

1266
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:17,500
And you know, because I my lectures were all high science, no matter what group I was speaking

1267
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,540
to.

1268
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:23,140
So I always wanted that you ought to come out of this lecture that I give and maybe

1269
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:27,740
with all the things, if you really sat through everything we talk about today to say, guy's

1270
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:34,320
an idiot or he's onto something and I thought I understood this topic, but maybe I need

1271
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,820
to understand it at a higher level.

1272
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,220
So everything is study, study, study.

1273
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,460
I didn't learn this stuff overnight.

1274
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,740
My life has been sinned in this field.

1275
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,940
Yeah, well, I'll say a couple of things.

1276
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,020
I'll say a couple of things on that.

1277
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,940
So first of all, I obviously want to thank you for the influence you've had in me.

1278
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,940
And I, I don't know, I just feel really lucky.

1279
01:16:54,940 --> 01:17:00,260
I think that I got plugged into you and Alan and Ron just out of the gate to have met the

1280
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:07,260
three of you so early in my interest in this topic saved me so much time because it's one

1281
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,260
thing.

1282
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,540
I mean, no one can substitute the amount of time you have to spend obsessing over this

1283
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,660
topic and learning it.

1284
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:17,820
But boy, when you can have that curriculum curated for you, you shortcut it by, you know,

1285
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:18,820
3X I'm sure.

1286
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:23,460
It's a gift and I'll just extrapolate on that because Peter named three guys he can get

1287
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:26,600
in contact with pretty quickly and get answers.

1288
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:33,500
As I evolved in this world, I had 20 guys around the world who liked me a lot because

1289
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,960
of what way I explained things, what I could illustrate for them.

1290
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,660
So I've been blessed by, I've mentioned a few today.

1291
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,680
It would take me another 15 minutes to list them all.

1292
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:48,560
But so many of the, I call them the lipid gods out there, the people who have spent

1293
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,720
their real life in research laboratories and clinical trials and taking care of people

1294
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:59,560
in the worst clinic, lipid clinics, see, and they still are available to me.

1295
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,800
But that's who I use.

1296
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,760
I don't go on the internet and read something or make stuff up.

1297
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,260
I try and ask experts about a lot of things.

1298
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:11,840
Not that you'll ever get consensus on anything, but those of us who do have those avenues

1299
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:17,320
open, which many do not, but they're not afraid to still pontificate about something

1300
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,480
that's kind of sad.

1301
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,800
I can't remember if I made this, this'll be my final point on the topic and I can't

1302
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,280
remember if I made this point on a previous podcast or not.

1303
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,280
And if I did to the listener, I apologize.

1304
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,520
I started out in mathematics and engineering and really loved those things.

1305
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:39,440
I excelled at those things, took great pleasure in being a first principles thinker.

1306
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:46,400
One silly story at the end of my freshman course in dynamics kinematics, like Newtonian

1307
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:52,480
physics, you take a final exam and you are allowed one piece of eight by 10 paper that

1308
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:58,360
you can write on both sides as much as you want, whatever formula you want.

1309
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:04,160
Because there were just so many equations you would have to know to go in and ace one

1310
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,480
of these exams.

1311
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:11,960
Now I was cocky B on words and I was really lucky as a freshman.

1312
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:18,080
I used to study in this dark part of the stacks where I met a real upperclassman guy.

1313
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,080
His first name was JP.

1314
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,980
I don't remember his last name, but I'll never forget him.

1315
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:25,760
He was the only guy I'd ever met who decided to take two engineering disciplines and finish

1316
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,920
them both in four years.

1317
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,140
So he did electrical and mechanical engineering in four years.

1318
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:35,440
The price he had to pay for that was he studied every minute of every day, but he also had

1319
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,760
told me he didn't have the opportunity to learn everything.

1320
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,460
If you wanted to take all of electrical and mechanical in four years, you had to accept

1321
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:46,240
that there were certain things you couldn't know.

1322
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,440
All of his study focused around first principles inference.

1323
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,640
He taught me this early.

1324
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:55,400
He saw me studying for one of my exams and I was writing out something called the Coriolis

1325
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:01,680
equation which basically explains centrifugal forces under the condition of a changing radius.

1326
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,400
He said, you don't need to memorize that formula.

1327
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,600
You know how to derive it.

1328
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,520
And I was like, what are you talking about?

1329
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:13,280
He goes right out the formula for angular position and take the derivatives of it.

1330
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,600
You know calculus.

1331
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,380
So I did and sure enough, I was getting the same formulas.

1332
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:23,640
To make a long story short, I've become totally inundated by JP's reasoning.

1333
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,880
I go into my final exam and oh, you have to turn in your cheat sheet at the end of the

1334
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,880
exam.

1335
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,520
And I, this is again, I'm not saying this to brag about how cocky I was, but so I just

1336
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,560
have to stay.

1337
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,460
But the point is I wanted to show the professor how well I understood this material.

1338
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:44,660
The only thing I wrote on my cheat sheet in big block letters was the sum of the forces

1339
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:47,240
equals mass times acceleration.

1340
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:53,000
Because I was like, if you know the simplest of Newton's laws, you can actually derive

1341
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,920
everything at this level of physics.

1342
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,840
We're not talking quantum physics at this point.

1343
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,240
And I remember JP said, look, on every question, write it out.

1344
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,280
Show them how you can go from one to the other.

1345
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,480
Because if you make a mistake, at least they'll see what you're doing.

1346
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,840
I ended up acing the exam and that lesson sort of stuck with me.

1347
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,620
And it served me very well through the rest of engineering and mathematics, including

1348
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,960
when it got really, really complicated.

1349
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,960
That in the end, if you truly wanted to understand something at first principles, you could derive

1350
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,120
so much.

1351
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,120
Okay.

1352
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,160
Fast forward a few years.

1353
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,840
Now I find myself in medical school.

1354
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,080
Now I was not a pre-med.

1355
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:32,200
So I'm in medical school, not as a pre-med, but as a former engineer math guy who based

1356
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,720
barely squeaked into medical school, meaning I took the MCAT having not even taken a course

1357
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
in biology yet.

1358
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,880
I had to take my bio class after.

1359
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,880
And I'll tell you that first semester of med school was brutal for me because I learned

1360
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:53,000
the hard way that you couldn't first principles your way through biology, at least not at

1361
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,440
the level, at least not until you gained a certain amount of familiarity with the basics.

1362
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,200
I couldn't walk into my histology class, look under the microscope and on first principles,

1363
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:07,220
know the difference between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum.

1364
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,720
You just have to know that stuff.

1365
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:13,600
I couldn't go into anatomy and physiology and pathology and just first principles my

1366
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,800
way into stuff.

1367
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,040
Eventually you can, but you have to have an enormous basis.

1368
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,040
So I sort of forgot all about that pain.

1369
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,000
You know, you get through medical school and by the end it became, you know, it was very

1370
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,600
enjoyable, but it wasn't until I got to the lab to NIH where my mentor told me a great

1371
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,600
story.

1372
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,160
Now he's probably one of the most brilliant scientists I've ever known and did a PhD in

1373
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,840
biophysics specifically for the purpose of wanting to make sure he was never in his words

1374
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,960
intimidated by a differential equation, despite the fact that he was an immunologist.

1375
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,960
And he told me a story, which I need to get the details of it because I don't remember

1376
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:52,280
the physicist he's referring to, but he told me the story of a physicist turned biologist

1377
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:57,040
who lamented once that the moment he switched from physics to biology, he could never again

1378
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:03,480
take a bath in peace because as a physicist, he could sit in the bath and wax philosophically

1379
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:08,560
and think about lots of things on first principles and be very theoretical in his understanding.

1380
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,160
But as a biologist sitting in the bath, he always realized there was one more fact he

1381
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,240
needed to remember before he could draw a conclusion.

1382
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,540
And so he had to keep getting out of the bathtub to go and look up a certain fact.

1383
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,860
And that obviously disrupted the beauty of taking the bath.

1384
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,740
And I think that long rambling story is a way of saying the following.

1385
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:32,860
I find this subject matter to be as complicated as any I have ever tried to learn.

1386
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:39,260
And unfortunately, every time I have a brilliant idea, just based on first principles, I still

1387
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:44,420
have to go and check if it's grounded in the foundation of science.

1388
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:47,500
And sometimes it is, but many times it is not.

1389
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,140
I come up with an idea and I'm like, this has got to be right.

1390
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:53,260
But oh, they're physiologically impossible.

1391
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,020
And there's even an experiment that one day suggested this or it's, you know, I made an

1392
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,420
assumption but I can clearly see that it was not the case.

1393
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,820
So I understand your frustration and I share it.

1394
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:06,780
And I think unfortunately that is the nature of biology.

1395
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,100
Yep.

1396
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,180
And I remain an eternal optimist.

1397
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,740
I continue to teach lipids.

1398
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:17,700
I think clinicians know a bit more than we knew in 1995 when I started this journey

1399
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,700
teaching.

1400
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,820
And so that's all if I have to do it one at a time with people, I try and teach them what

1401
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:26,260
I know and hopefully you'll do your continuing education.

1402
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,020
And that's one of the nice things about medicine.

1403
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,020
But you got to do it.

1404
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,780
None of this comes easy.

1405
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,780
It does.

1406
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,500
And there's a lot of complexities in medicine nowadays.

1407
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:41,980
We're talking because it's a highly pathologic state and leading cause of trouble.

1408
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:47,700
But there's so many other things to boy take to the much higher level nowadays.

1409
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:52,600
Well, Tom, people I think will certainly by the end of this know where to find you.

1410
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,460
But on Twitter, which is where you spend the most of your time, you're at Dr. Lippit, correct?

1411
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,460
That's me.

1412
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,620
So, yep.

1413
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:03,620
And this will, I mean, we're generally in our brief existence as a podcast already known

1414
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:07,540
for probably producing the most thorough show notes ever.

1415
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:11,900
I'm suspecting that this episode, which will probably break into several parts, will have

1416
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,060
the most robust show notes that we've done.

1417
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,700
And I love, by the way, that there's another fire truck going down.

1418
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,700
It's perfect.

1419
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,340
It's totally appropriate.

1420
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:25,640
But also, if there's anything else that you think of, let's just talk about it where offline

1421
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,660
even we can just get to it.

1422
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:29,220
Where there are other resources you think people ought to go to.

1423
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:36,060
Again, I will steer people away from your 2000 to 2004 writings.

1424
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,700
But I think there's going to be a number of people who listen to this who say, you know

1425
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,580
what, look, I might have missed half of what those guys talked about.

1426
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:45,600
But there's something there I want to make sure I understand better because in the end,

1427
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,660
every doctor wants to do the best by their patient.

1428
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:50,460
I mean, that's just, I believe that wholeheartedly.

1429
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:54,800
I get very frustrated when I hear people say that doctors are in the pockets of pharma

1430
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,900
companies and they're just in it for the month.

1431
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,340
And that's sure there's going to be some of those people.

1432
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,820
But I haven't met those guys.

1433
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:04,180
You know, the doctors that I meet, the men and women I meet who take care of patients,

1434
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:06,620
they all want to do the best by their patients.

1435
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,540
And I think that those are people who are going to want to invest a little bit of their

1436
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,460
time in understanding this problem a little better.

1437
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,860
No, I can't say it anymore.

1438
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:21,260
As you listen to seven and a half hours, even hopefully piecemeal market, clearly for, depending

1439
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,640
on the list, there's going to be things over your head.

1440
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:28,200
Even if you are a super skilled lipidologist, there's going to be some things you said,

1441
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,200
what?

1442
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,680
Let me read about that or so.

1443
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:35,600
But it's just trying to open your mind and understand there's a lot going on here.

1444
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,960
The field is infinitely more complex than you ever imagined.

1445
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:45,320
It took me a long and I'm a, as Mike Davison calls me, Tom's a self-taught lipidologist.

1446
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:50,540
I mean, I didn't spend two years down at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,

1447
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:56,680
but I don't know the director of that NHLBI, Alan Romali, and I just authored a 70 page

1448
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:02,720
chapter in the Teats book of molecular and clinical biochemistry, all about lipids and

1449
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,880
apoproteins.

1450
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,940
So I think to be an invited author with a guy named at Magnitude.

1451
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,740
Yeah, you've sent me a preprint of that.

1452
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:09,740
That's a remarkable treat.

1453
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:12,020
So I mean, it's an expensive book.

1454
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:16,780
I don't expect you, if you're not a lipidologist or somebody seriously into this clinician,

1455
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,740
that's what you go out and buy.

1456
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,380
There is a lot of information out there.

1457
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:26,020
So just be careful on what you, that's ridiculous.

1458
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:31,620
Or my cockamamie theory based in no clinical trials or science is what I believe.

1459
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,020
Fine, believe it.

1460
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:35,140
You know, this is America here.

1461
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,620
I can't lock you up.

1462
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,140
I'm not the lipid police.

1463
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:42,700
Yeah, well, on that note, Tom, thank you very much.

1464
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:47,180
It's hard to believe this has been seven hours of discussion today, but it's been worth every

1465
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,180
minute to me.

1466
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,460
I've learned a lot in this discussion.

1467
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:53,980
So that's to me, that's always a, I mean, for selfish reasons, that's sort of my primary

1468
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,860
objective is to learn as much as I can.

1469
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:58,500
And then along the way, if others can learn too, that's a bonus.

1470
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:03,260
And without a year of my intermittent fasting and program from Peter at TIA, I could have

1471
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:06,540
never had the energy to say it.

1472
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,060
Even to use my tongue.

1473
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,060
Or brain.

1474
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,060
So thank you again, Peter.

1475
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,060
Yeah, my pleasure, Tom.

1476
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,060
Thanks.
