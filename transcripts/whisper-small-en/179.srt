00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,620
Hey, Jeremy. Thanks so much for making time. I've been looking forward to this one for

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,120
quite a while, both personally and professionally. This is a topic I've wanted to learn a lot

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,800
more about, something I've been playing with a lot myself, including this morning, particularly

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,100
painful session this morning of blood flow restriction, which I might be doing wrong.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,580
So I'm looking forward to maybe the end of our discussion when we can get into the practical

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,980
aspects of it. But I want to take a step back and get a sense about how you became interested

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,060
in exercise in general. Obviously, you've devoted your career to it. So when did that

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,660
become a passion great enough that you decided it was worth all of your study?

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:56,380
Yeah. Thanks for having me on, Peter. I wrestled early on in my life. So I wrestled from probably

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,540
the age of five through high school. But I wasn't really into training that much. I

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,300
was into wrestling, but not really lifting weights or any of the conditioning. And my

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,740
coaches would always tell me that you need to try to get in the gym. You just stay in

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,620
the gym, get stronger, get stronger, get stronger. And I didn't really listen up until towards

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,580
the end of high school. And then I started one of my friends was really into bodybuilding,

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,340
powerlifting. So I started training with him. And I do feel like it probably helped

17
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,820
me a little bit in wrestling. And then I kind of got interested in just trying to see how

18
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,860
to make a muscle get as big as possible. And I started reading, you know, muscle magazines,

19
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,180
which is kind of the, you know, the common story, training in a little bit. Then I kind

20
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:52,340
of focused on exercise science early on in my undergrad. Again, with a focus on how do

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,220
I make every lecture was I was just trying to learn how to make a muscle bigger and how

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,140
to make a muscle stronger. That's all I was trying to get out of every lecture towards

23
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:10,340
the middle of, I guess, my undergrad, you have to make a decision about, you know, obviously,

24
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,020
what do you want to try and do with your career? And I was dead set on working with athletes.

25
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,820
But then I did that and quickly realized that's not what I wanted to do. So they suggested

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,980
that I instead maybe you're really interested in research, why don't you try and do an internship

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,860
related to that. So I landed at the University of Illinois. And that's where I met Lane and a couple

28
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,860
other people. And that's where I really came across blood flow restriction. And that's where

29
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:46,020
I started to really read a lot about it and then came back and started to really focus all of my

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,860
times. That was around 2007, 2008. So just about, you know, reading blood flow restriction and how

31
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,060
I might be able to do that. So I started off with wrestling and then kind of got interested in body

32
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,460
building, powerlifting, and then came across blood flow restriction when I was up at Illinois.

33
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,500
Now, you mentioned briefly that you did a little bit of work with athletes, which was obviously

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,260
kind of a logical, at least place to look, but it sounds like you didn't find that to be what you

35
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:22,500
wanted. Why is that? You know, I, I think I'm a pretty mediocre athlete. And I think I, but I

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,820
mediocre athlete, but I always trained extremely hard. And I think I had this mindset that, you

37
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:36,020
know, everybody was going to train what I thought training was, and how everybody was going to train

38
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,100
as hard as I thought they should train. And when I was doing a little practicum work with some of

39
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,540
these athletes, I mean, they weren't world-class elite athletes, but they were fairly good

40
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,740
collegiate athletes. I didn't get the same vibe that everybody was into training. Like I was in

41
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,620
the training at the time. It doesn't mean they weren't great athletes. They obviously were. It

42
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,180
doesn't mean they didn't train hard, but I, my perception of how they should have been training

43
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,300
was, was not what I thought it was going to be. So I knew I wanted to be in the exercise world, but

44
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,940
I quickly realized that that's, that's not for me. I really kind of want to maybe do research. And

45
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,340
that's when I went to Illinois and I was doing animal research, but I didn't really like that

46
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,940
either. I knew I was, when I was there, I quickly learned that I want to do research, but definitely

47
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,340
not with animals. I wanted, so I came back and that's when I got into human research.

48
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,020
So where did you do your PhD?

49
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,220
University of Oklahoma.

50
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,700
And what was the focus of your dissertation?

51
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,780
Looking at different methods of applying blood flow restriction. So looking at, you know, different

52
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,980
exercise loads of 20%, 30% different pressures. In other words, we were trying to get at this idea

53
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,300
of, do you actually need higher pressures? So in my dissertation, we were doing a lot of acute work,

54
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,220
which has obviously a lot of limitations with applying it to adaptation, but we were trying to

55
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,540
really see kind of a short term characteristic of what that response would give acutely. What does

56
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,340
this response give? What does this response give? And then try and kind of pick out two of the more

57
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,140
promising ones and then study them head to head a little bit later on, which is kind of what we did

58
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,260
once I took a job at Ole Miss.

59
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,220
I can't wait to talk more about that. And there's no shortage of questions I have for you,

60
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,060
but I was thinking about this last night, that before we jump into a lot of the questions I have,

61
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,580
I think it will be important for people to really understand the ins and outs of muscle, what's the

62
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,700
muscle, the structure of a muscle, not the gross anatomy of a muscle, but obviously the micro

63
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:56,020
structure, the physiology of a muscle. So without worrying about going too deep, I think it's okay to

64
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:03,140
do that. Let's talk about a muscle because I don't think we can get into what we're about to talk

65
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,460
about if people don't know what a sarcomere is and what actin and myosin are and what the different

66
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:17,540
types of fibers are. So if I were to sort of take a knife and cut down on my bicep and yank it off

67
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,940
the tendon and throw it out there as a muscle, how would you explain to somebody what's actually

68
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:35,260
going on inside that thing? Yeah, that's a good question. I think when we talk about a muscle, so

69
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:43,820
like just your the whole thing, so it's like a box within a box within a box. So the smallest unit of

70
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:50,140
that is, as you said, a sarcomere, which is actin and myosin. And that's the kind of the proteins

71
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:56,100
that we're ultimately synthesizing when we exercise. So we're making more of those. And if you make

72
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,780
more of those than you break down, then obviously the muscle will get bigger. So when we actually

73
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:09,900
exercise those actin and myosin interact, and that's how we make a muscle contract. And that's

74
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,420
important because when actin and myosin interact and you have muscle contraction, that's where you

75
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:22,820
get a lot of this signaling for ultimate muscle adaptation. So I think the characteristics of

76
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,300
muscle, we have kind of two broad types is how we typically teach it. We have type one, which is

77
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,780
more endurance based type two, which is more force based. But in reality, those are probably on a

78
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:45,060
continuum. So when we exercise, we can shift them, we can shift the continuum one way or another.

79
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,900
Depending upon the type of exercise that you're doing. But in general, when we become more

80
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:58,900
physically active, the overall fiber types shift slower. So they become more oxidative, they become

81
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:08,200
more efficient. That's the general kind of response. So those are the different types of

82
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,260
fibers, the actin actin and myosin, that's the functional unit, they interact to make the muscle

83
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:20,420
contract. Let's explain to people how that works, Jeremy. So you pull out this sort of sarcomere,

84
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,180
and inside you have these fibers, and you've got these Z lines. Explain to people how the actin

85
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,780
and myosin actually interact with each other relative to the Z line, what the contraction

86
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,140
looks like. And frankly, even one of the more interesting things that I think is a bit counter

87
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,460
intuitive the first time people learn it is which part of the interaction between actin and myosin

88
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,300
requires ATP. Yeah, it's sort of it's a bit counterintuitive when you're first presented with it.

89
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:54,040
Right. So when we decide to exercise, we have a signal that goes from the nerve to the muscle,

90
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,980
basically, we have a release of calcium. And that calcium is going to expose the binding site. So

91
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,980
basically, we have these filaments, they slide past each other. That's the that's the general dogma,

92
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,620
at least with concentric actions, eccentric is a little bit more complex. I think they're still

93
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:20,140
trying to figure that out with Titan. But just in general, when a muscle contracts, so the myosin

94
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,980
is interacting with the actin and it's causing it to pull in. Now, ATP is required to break that

95
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:34,860
bond. So the ATP comes in, it breaks it off, it gets hydrolyzed, which recox it and allows it to

96
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,100
be able to reattach assuming there's more calcium on board. So that's the the general basic

97
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,660
physiology of muscle contraction. So as long as calcium is there, or as long as the signals

98
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,780
being sent, those sarcomeres, those actin and myosin will keep interacting. So they don't all

99
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,580
interact at the same time. Otherwise, you couldn't really sustain exercise. But you have them, you

100
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,660
know, in a textbook, we talk about we have kind of like an image and we have myosin head, but those

101
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,340
myosin heads are on all the way around that myosin and they're all interacting at different times.

102
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:14,460
So that's how we're able to actually move through kind of a fluid motion. And what's interesting,

103
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,340
as you said, is that the ATP is required to actually release the actin myosin complex,

104
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:28,580
which is we learned in medical school explains why a corpse is experiencing rigor mortis, right? When

105
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,620
a person is dead, and they're no longer able to produce ATP, they don't have the ability to

106
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,300
release the actin myosin filaments. That's why a body gets stiff, sort of a morbid thought,

107
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:46,020
but it explains physiologically what's happening. So let's not talk a little bit about this difference

108
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,900
in fibers, because again, I think most people have probably heard of the idea of a type one and a type

109
00:10:51,900 --> 00:11:00,540
two fiber. But as you said, it's probably more complex than that. And there's more of a continuum.

110
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,140
I think even by the time I was in med school, the teaching was really it's a type one, and then a

111
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,860
two A and a two B, and then it became a two A, a two A B, a two B, you could argue it's even more

112
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:22,540
complex now. Let's start with the term fast versus slow twitch. I've read conflicting things. So I'm

113
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,940
hoping you can clarify this for me. I've read that there's no difference in the twitch speed.

114
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,540
They all twitch at the same speed. It's the force of contraction and the speed to fatigue that's

115
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,460
being referred to. So the faster twitch muscle has a higher contractile force, but it also fatigues

116
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:48,380
quickly, hence fast twitch. Is there actually a difference in the neurologic signal that's

117
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:54,860
happening there? Or the speed of contraction for that matter? Yeah, that's a good question. I think

118
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:02,860
this is not work that I actually do. I have a lot of confusion surrounding this myself.

119
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,660
And a lot of it reading some of the work by Andy Galpin, and some others, a lot of it comes from

120
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:18,780
the old methods are still being used. And the limitations of those is that we can't do hybrids.

121
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,820
And some people say we should be using these new methods. And I think it all depends on how you're

122
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:31,020
actually identifying the fibers. What are you doing to call it a fast or a slow? How are you

123
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,740
ultimately deciding that with your methodology? So I don't honestly know the ins and outs of all of

124
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:45,660
those. The general idea, I think, as you said, the type two fibers. So for example, type 2X,

125
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,100
those typically are bigger, they're typically stronger, but they fatigue much faster. The type

126
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,460
2A, it's a little bit more oxidative, they're pretty forceful, and they can sustain it for

127
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:05,100
quite some time. So in general, when we exercise, it's thought that type 2X usually transitions to

128
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:12,460
type 2A. And you don't have a whole lot of type 2X left over. That's my general understanding.

129
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:21,180
Type 1 fibers generally a little bit slower. And they're not as forceful, but they don't fatigue,

130
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,700
it takes a lot to fatigue those fibers. So I think that's the general characteristics. I think

131
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,140
how you go about identifying that, you might get a little bit of different things, but that was the

132
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:38,620
general idea, as I understand it at least. And what accounts for the difference in contractile

133
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,380
strength between a type 1 fiber and say a type 2X, take two opposite ends of the spectrum.

134
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,980
So it's, I mean, sometimes using the extremes is helpful, right? So the type 1 fiber has lots of

135
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:57,500
mitochondria surrounding the fibrils within the sarcomere. As you said, it is readily able to

136
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,780
access glucose and fatty acid oxidative conversely the type 2X fiber. I don't even think it has

137
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,500
mitochondria surrounding it. It's purely a glycolytic tool, meaning it's going to basically have to go

138
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,980
glycogen to glucose to lactate. What accounts mechanically for the difference?

139
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:29,580
I think most people would say that perhaps the overall just size difference, whether or not there

140
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,420
are other things, whether or how it may interact and the speed of it, that might be different as

141
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,860
well. But I think the big characteristic difference, at least in young people, is that the size of the

142
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:51,020
fiber is just distinctly different. And I think when you look at fiber mechanics outside of the

143
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:59,900
body and you test a type 1 or test a type 2, they will be different. How those interact within the

144
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:07,100
body as a whole, I think, is quite a bit different. And that's always been an interest of mine with

145
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,580
respect to dynamic strength, moving the whole person, not necessarily saying, well, their fiber

146
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,500
is still nice and strong. But what about when the fiber is in the person? What's going on then?

147
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,580
So I think both of those are very important. I don't want to come across like I'm talking down

148
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,500
to that type of work. I think it's very important work, but I think they're just different.

149
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:39,740
How genetically set is this? It seems that there's clearly a difference in individuals' capacity for

150
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:47,100
work, meaning aerobic work versus explosive strength and aerobic work. But do you have a sense

151
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:56,220
of how genetically diverse the fiber distribution is? That's a good question. That's kind of a

152
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,940
question I always put forth to my class as well. I think you can look at papers and get some

153
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:10,780
percentages, but I don't feel super confident doing that, mostly because we have a lot. I mean,

154
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,380
not that those scientists don't know that, but those are mass extrapolations from small bits

155
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:24,380
of fibers. And one of the things that I'm always interested in is the athlete that's thought to

156
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,260
have some of the greatest endurance capacities or cross-country spheres. And if you were to look

157
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,540
at their fiber types, many of them may have a predominance of type one fibers. So the question

158
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,980
is, were they mostly born like that? And then they gravitated towards sports that they're good at,

159
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:49,900
or was there some sort of shift with training? If I had to pick one, it's probably both. But if I

160
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:57,260
had to pick one, I think there's a big genetic component there, probably at baseline and then

161
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:05,180
your response to exercise as well. But it seems to me that most people gravitate towards events

162
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,260
that they're pretty good at, and they don't do the things that they're not good at. So I think that

163
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,700
makes it difficult to study this anyway, but I do think that there's a big genetic component to it.

164
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,820
It doesn't mean, again, that they don't train hard. That's always the thing that I get when I

165
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,900
have a lot of athletes in my class. It's like, well, we train, it's like there's no there's no

166
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:36,380
question that you guys train extremely hard. But it's also possible that there's something

167
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,460
different about you already. So that would be my my guess. And you sort of already touched on it a

168
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:52,540
bit, but do we have data to suggest how malleable that is? We all know the extremes, right? We know

169
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,580
these sort of mesomorphic specimens that kind of look at weights and get bigger and stronger.

170
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,900
And then conversely, we know that sort of wiry person who can't put on muscle no matter what

171
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:13,340
they seemingly do, but boy, like, you get them out there on a bike and you can never catch them.

172
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,460
But when you take someone maybe who's not quite at the extremes,

173
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,500
how much can training over and over what time period impact fiber type?

174
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,740
Yeah, I think certainly some. I don't think we're going to take someone like myself,

175
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:41,740
who's athletically quite average. I don't think any amount of training was going to make me a

176
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:49,100
lead in anything. But I do think that I could improve certain aspects of that, for sure. But I

177
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:57,500
don't think it's going to myself move me to, you know, up a couple notches. Now there could be

178
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:06,540
some people who certainly can. I think that this is where there's quite a bit of confusion with

179
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,700
kind of individual response data and things like that. I think, you know, we've published a little

180
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:20,860
bit on this topic about, you know, the measurements that we have aren't typically good enough to say,

181
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,580
not only did this group increase muscle size more than this group, but this individual increased

182
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,940
more than this person, but not quite as much as this person and not quite as much as this person.

183
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:40,380
That would require a very, very good instrument. So I think people often take that to mean,

184
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,500
so you're saying that there aren't individual responders. I'm not saying that at all. I'm

185
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,380
saying that we may not have the ability to appropriately determine who's who. We can say,

186
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,620
overall, on average, doing this will increase this or that. But I think that just looking around,

187
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:04,860
it seems at least pretty clear to me that there are some people who you give them a certain

188
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,700
response and, man, do they look like world beaters a couple months later. So that does tell me

189
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,740
something is different about them. But I don't know that we could detect that with a lot of the

190
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:22,620
measurements that we have. Okay. I think the other thing that would be helpful for us to understand

191
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:29,820
before we get into the science of blood flow restriction is to understand what strength is

192
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:36,140
and to understand what hypertrophy is. Do you have a preference with which one we start with?

193
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:47,260
Either one. Okay. So if we measure the size of my bicep today, we could do it crudely with a tape

194
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:54,140
measure. We could do it more accurately with an MRI or an ultrasound. And you were to prescribe

195
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,300
exercises that we'll talk about. Whether with or without blood flow restriction, we can get into

196
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,900
load, we can get into reps, et cetera. We come back and measure. And again, let's just use the

197
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,820
gold standard. We'll use an MRI. We'll come back and measure me in six months. And demonstrably,

198
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,260
my muscle has gotten bigger. What does that mean? Did I grow more muscle fibers? Did each fiber get

199
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,060
bigger? How would you explain to somebody what happened in that cycle of hypertrophy?

200
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,900
So there's a couple of different ways that it could happen. You could have an increase in fiber size,

201
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,660
which is hypertrophy. So all the muscle cells that you have, maybe not all, but the muscle cell

202
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,580
itself has gotten bigger. The other, so that's hypertrophy. The other component would be you

203
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:50,220
have an increase in the number of cells. That's hyperplasia. In general, we don't think that

204
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:57,180
hyperplasia is playing a big role, at least in adults. And I wouldn't necessarily rule it out,

205
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,580
but it doesn't seem like we have a lot of evidence for that. So we always just look at

206
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,300
growth changes and assume that it's probably hypertrophy. So what that, when your muscle

207
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,980
was to get bigger following exercise, what that would mean is, is that the individual cells

208
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:22,700
inside that bicep have increased in size. And we typically assume that that's due to increases

209
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,500
in overall protein, actinomycin and things of that sort. You're obviously going to also have

210
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:35,180
an increase in other components to help support the cell. But that's generally what we mean,

211
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:42,460
an increase in cell size. And, you know, when you think about like an epithelial cell or something

212
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:49,020
like that, we don't really pay much attention to the size of those cells, right? Like, I don't know

213
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,860
that anybody, I don't know if the dermatologist is looking at somebody's moles when they biopsy

214
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,900
them and looking at the individual cells and talking about the size of them. There we would

215
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,900
concern ourselves much more with hyperplasia and certainly metoplasia or dysplasia. Those are the

216
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:12,700
things that really get people concerned. But in this sense, muscles are kind of unique in that

217
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:21,660
they can have not just a non-pathologic, but a healthy change in size. So is it, as you said,

218
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,500
do you think it's primarily due to an increase in the amount of actinomycin within the cell

219
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:34,860
or some other characteristic? Is it, does the actinomycin complex actually change in size or

220
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:43,740
do you just have more of it? That's a good question. I think that most people would say that

221
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,540
because they usually connect it to short-term measures of protein synthesis. So myofibrillar,

222
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,260
which is actinomycin, so synthesizing more and more of those, I think is the general

223
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,060
is the general thought that you have more overall actinomycin, along with other things, of course.

224
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:08,860
And let's talk about strength now. So we can talk about sort of, we can kind of break it down right

225
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:15,820
into kind of mechanical strength and neurologic strength. How do you think about that? So again,

226
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:22,220
let's use the same example of you measure my ability to do a bicep curl. And let's just assume

227
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,940
there'll be two measurements. You'll measure my single rep max, so the most that I can do.

228
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,540
And then you'll also do a separate test for the most that I can do 10 times or 15 times or

229
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,820
something. So you'll measure kind of two different components of strength, maybe absolute, extreme,

230
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:43,340
and sort of more of a muscular endurance test. And then you'll have me do a set of prescribed

231
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,740
exercises for six months, and we'll come back and we'll do that whole thing again. And my one rep

232
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:54,780
max went up by 20% and the amount of weight that I could move 10 times went up 15%.

233
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:03,100
What happened to me mechanically, structurally, neurologically? What explains that change in

234
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:09,180
strength? It's a good question. And that's something that it's a question that I'm extremely

235
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:21,420
interested in. And I don't know why people get stronger. I think the general thought or how we

236
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:29,420
teach people is the initial change in strength is due to neurological changes. So

237
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:38,780
and that's what that means. What does neurologic mean, I think is also up to some debate. But we

238
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,540
can think about a signal being sent from the brain through the spinal cord to the alpha motor neuron.

239
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,820
So the alpha motor neuron is the nerve that communicates with the muscle. So there could be

240
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,860
changes anywhere in between that. So you have more excitatory input, you have less inhibition,

241
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,380
you have lowering of thresholds that makes it easier to fire the type two fibers. There's a

242
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,740
lot of different things that that could be playing a role there for why someone might

243
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:16,300
get stronger with neural adaptations. So most people are okay with that part. Then the next part

244
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:22,700
is people will say after about three to four weeks, when the muscle is also getting bigger,

245
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:29,180
that that change in fiber size will also be contributing to a change in string.

246
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,540
And that's something that we have recently taken some exception to.

247
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:42,540
And there's been a lot of really good discussions about that part of it. But yes,

248
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,580
I do come back to that, Jeremy, because I've read the studies that you're referring to.

249
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:55,100
They're super fascinating. And I was actually surprised at how little evidence there was in

250
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:01,820
favor of the dogmatic view. So I look forward to diving into that a little bit more. And you can

251
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,820
see why intuitively one would say, well, size must produce strength if size comes from more

252
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,740
active in myosin, which basically means more contractile units. But but as we'll see, I think

253
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,780
when we talk about some of your more recent work, that's not necessarily settled, is it?

254
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,460
Not in my opinion, no. And I and to be fair, it's not settled one way or the other.

255
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,860
But I do think that there's a probably a neural component. But I think that there can also be

256
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,420
some changes at the local level that might explain some of those changes in strength.

257
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:44,780
And I think we can discuss that a little bit later as well. But there could be some, some, you know,

258
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,700
changes at the myosin head, or changes in calcium release and things of that sort. So

259
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:56,060
I don't have any good evidence that that is actually happening. But just some ideas behind

260
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:04,380
why someone might get stronger following exercise. All right, I think that's a pretty solid primer

261
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:11,340
for where we're about to go. So I'll start with the story. I used to swim a lot. And

262
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:21,660
oh, God, this might be circa 2010. So call it 1011 years ago. I have a friend, Steve Munet,

263
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:29,980
Munet onus, who's himself a remarkable swimmer, like truly a world class marathon swimmer.

264
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:38,220
And he was visiting San Diego from where he lived in LA. And he came to join me for a workout at the

265
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:46,220
master's club I swam at. And after the workout, he brought out these bands. They were called

266
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,060
catsu bands, which we're going to talk about. And he said, Okay, Peter, I want you I'm going to put

267
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:57,580
these bands on your thighs, upper thighs, and I'm going to put them on your arms, the upper arm.

268
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,820
And I'm going to, you know, compress to a certain level. And he had what looked like a blood pressure

269
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:11,900
cuff there that he could sort of calibrate the the the the occlusive pressure. And I want you to swim

270
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:20,380
a 50 yard butterfly all out. Now keep in mind, swimming a 50 yard butterfly all out under any

271
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,940
circumstance is quite challenging. But totally doable, right? I mean, you you would do a set of

272
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:36,540
1050s of butterfly at 90%, you know, with 45 seconds in between and be totally fine.

273
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,700
And I remember pushing off the wall. And before I got to the other wall, which is 25 yards away to

274
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,620
begin turning around to come back. I was like, this is the hardest thing I've ever done. This

275
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:58,300
feels harder than swimming 200 yards of butterfly, which is really hard. So butterfly is one of those

276
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,820
strokes where the longest distance it's ever swum is 200 yards. And even people who train to swim

277
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,620
the race at 200 yards almost never swim that distance in practice, you're swimming shorter

278
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:14,620
distances perfectly, because your form tends to fall apart so badly at 200. And here I

279
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:24,700
was at 25 yards thinking, I'm going to die. And by the end of that 50, my body felt like it would

280
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:32,220
normally feel at the end of a 200 yard individual medley, or 200 breaststroke, which would be kind

281
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:38,940
of two of the most miserable things you could ever do to yourself. And, you know, that began my kind

282
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:48,220
of curiosity with this technique. I read a couple of books about it. And, you know, unfortunately,

283
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,700
I kind of just forgot about it. I, you know, once Steve went back up to LA, and I didn't have access

284
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:59,260
to the fancy devices, I kind of sort of forgot about it. But, you know, recently, it's now become

285
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:07,180
sort of curious to me. So what's the story of, of Yoshiaka? So what was the name of the gentleman who

286
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:13,180
came up with this system? Sato. Sato, yeah. So tell me about this guy and then how he came up with

287
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:25,820
the with this idea. Yeah, so some of this is, I'll say is a legend. But I think the story that he's

288
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:32,620
told is that he was at a Buddhist ceremony was kind of kneeling. And Sato was also, from what I

289
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,700
understand, interested in bodybuilding, especially in his younger days. So he felt kind of a little

290
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:45,020
bit of numbness about or a little bit of sensation that he felt when he was doing heavy squats. So he

291
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,660
kind of thought that there could be some connection there. Because he was kneeling and he was

292
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,980
restricting blood flow. Okay. Right. And I think that that led him to start kind of experimenting

293
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:03,740
with different ways to try and restrict blood flow, you know, in his lower body, upper body, etc.

294
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:10,860
I think that there's been some stories that his initial kind of ideas, he actually harmed himself

295
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:16,300
a little bit because he was maybe applying it too tightly. But I think then he actually had a skiing

296
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,500
accident and then applied it to himself and actually rehabbed himself with blood flow restriction and

297
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:27,740
saw some what he thought was some pretty good kind of gains. And I think that he really did

298
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:34,380
probably develop a lot of the methods for at least the initial way we were doing blood flow restriction

299
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,300
and kind of made it, you know, very popular with studying and research and things of that nature.

300
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:48,540
But yeah, I think he's probably the one who made it more popular, at least initially,

301
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:56,220
because they started doing research on that in the late 90s, early 2000s, at least in the published

302
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:03,180
literature. So yeah, I think the idea is is that it mimics something that he had felt before in

303
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,700
the gym. And he wanted to see how you could try and do that. And ultimately found that you can use

304
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,260
very light weights, low loads, but make it feel like you're lifting very, very heavy weights,

305
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,380
which is obviously useful, you know, if you have a ski in accident or you don't want to lift heavy

306
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,980
weights, you'd have some sort of injury. Yeah, I had a patient the last year who was playing with

307
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:30,860
his kids and tore his bicep had a complete tear. So he underwent a surgical repair of that.

308
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,020
But we decided to have him use blood flow restriction during the rehab phase so that

309
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:44,700
he could get back to training sooner, obviously under a far less load. And although it's anecdotal,

310
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,780
I mean, it was a remarkable recovery that he made, which further kind of piqued my curiosity around

311
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:58,220
this. So this this term catsu is kind of synonymous with blood flow restriction. Is it I mean, I think

312
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,020
it's Japanese for like training with pressure or training with added pressure or something to that

313
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:09,420
effect. Correct. Yeah, it means increasing pressure. So it's just a brand. Okay, yeah. It's the one

314
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:17,580
that's, I think it's fair to say is one of the first, but it's just a brand. So we started using,

315
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,100
I think a lot of people will use the catsu as just kind of a generic name, but it probably

316
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,700
shouldn't be done unless you're using the catsu apparatus. But yeah, it's a form of blood flow

317
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,860
restriction. So I want to come back to the different types of apparatus, but let's kind

318
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:40,700
of talk through it now maybe chronologically in terms of the most insights. Like if I was to go

319
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:47,980
back in time to the 1970s and I'm Sato and I'm trying to think about how to test this hypothesis,

320
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,180
it seems like hands down the easiest way to do this would be to use individuals as their own controls

321
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:05,340
and isolate and compress one side and not do for the other and have them do the same things

322
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,060
or do different things and try to isolate the variable. So was that the first experiment that

323
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:17,580
was done? Yeah, the first experiment done on blood flow restriction, at least to my knowledge,

324
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:23,900
on how we think of blood flow restriction. So I always add a lot of caveats

325
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,500
because some people will say, well, if you look in the 30s, there were studies done where they

326
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:36,620
applied a cuff, but it wasn't done for the purposes of increasing muscle function. So

327
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:43,980
to my knowledge, with blood flow restriction, how we use it, Shina Hara published the first

328
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,860
paper in 1998, where they had individuals that all they were looking at was strength, but they had

329
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:58,620
one leg do a certain exercise with blood flow restriction. The opposite leg did the same

330
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:05,740
exercise without blood flow restriction and they saw a treatment effect, meaning the limb that

331
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:11,340
underwent blood flow restriction saw a greater change. So that's the first study was looking

332
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,660
at a change in actual function with blood flow restriction. It's kind of amazing that that didn't

333
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:22,060
happen until 1998, which is 30 years after Sato began writing about this stuff, or at least

334
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:28,540
experimenting with it, right? Yes. The other question for me that's been very difficult to

335
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:37,420
wrap my head around is what is the definition of blood flow restriction? If I were to wrap a cuff

336
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:44,780
around my arm and apply no pressure, clearly that's no restriction. If I were to create an

337
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:52,380
occlusive pressure that was twice my systolic blood pressure, almost certainly it would imply

338
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:59,260
not a drop of blood is making its way past. So there's no arterial flow and no venous return.

339
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,420
That would obviously blood flow restriction. That would be blood flow restriction,

340
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:12,060
but like everything else, you have a continuum. So how do you think about this? And maybe that's

341
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:18,780
the wrong question. Maybe the better question is in the genesis of kind of the study of this,

342
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:25,900
how was restriction defined? What methods were used and how much variability existed in the studies?

343
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:33,100
So the idea of blood flow restriction is to reduce blood flow going into the limb,

344
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:38,860
but not completely occlude blood flow. So in other words, we always want blood flow to be going in.

345
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:47,180
So there is a tremendous amount of variability in how the pressure was applied early on. That's

346
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,380
improved substantially at improvement, in my opinion, at least the early studies would take a cuff

347
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,300
and apply the same pressure to every single person independent of their blood pressure,

348
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:03,980
independent of blood pressure, independent of limb size, independent of the cuff size that you're

349
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,860
using. So all of these things are important factors that you can account for by doing this

350
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:16,940
one measurement. That's how we do it now. But obviously it's easy to look in the past and

351
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:24,700
throw stones, but there are certainly a lot of variability. So given that the idea is to

352
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:31,900
restrict blood flow, but not occlude it completely during exercise, what we started to do and others

353
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:39,020
have started to do as well is before we do exercise, let's just take the cuff up to the lowest

354
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:45,340
pressure of which there is no flow at all. So if that's a hundred millimeters of mercury means that

355
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:51,100
you no longer have flow going into your limb at all. Let's take a percentage of that. So we know

356
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,420
that you always have flow during the exercise. So now do you determine that with Doppler at

357
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:05,100
some distal point to the occlusion? Yes, you can use ultrasound. We use just a handheld Doppler

358
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:11,180
probe that's essentially detecting the pulse. So we can look at it here, we look at it at the ankle.

359
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:19,820
So before we have anybody do any exercise, we just lie them down. We slowly inflate whatever cuff

360
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:26,620
we're going to use because the cuff size matters. It's going to totally change the pressure applied.

361
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:33,660
So we slowly inflate it until we don't hear any more flow. And then we take a percentage of that.

362
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,740
So if the arterial occlusion pressure, which is the lowest pressure of which there is no flow,

363
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:45,180
if that's a hundred millimeters of mercury, then we'll typically apply anywhere between

364
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:51,020
40 and 80 millimeters of mercury in our lab at least. Yeah. So two points I want to make and

365
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,060
or 1.1 question. The point I want to make that is a very important one that you just

366
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:03,260
made is that this idea of cuff size matters, right? Because the pressure and the force are

367
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:12,700
related by the area that that cuff takes up. So is it safe to say that the wider the cuff,

368
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:20,140
the lower pressure you need to reach occlusion? Yes, that's definitely true.

369
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,940
And I think some people interpret that to mean that does that mean that a wider cuff is better

370
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:34,940
because the pressure is lower? I would say no, because it's pretty much relative. Some would

371
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,900
argue that the wider the cuff is, you might actually attenuate some of the growth beneath the cuff,

372
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:46,300
but certainly the size of the cuff will change the pressure. So as you said, the wider it is,

373
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:53,980
the lower the pressure that you need. But again, as long as you apply whatever cuff that you're

374
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:59,180
going to use to whatever limb you're looking to exercise, taking one measurement can account for

375
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:09,340
everything. So then my question is, when you say 40 to 80 percent, that is a very wide range, right?

376
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,740
That's like the difference between 40 millimeters of mercury and 80 millimeters of mercury. When

377
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,500
100 millimeters of mercury is the occlusive pressure could be the difference between comfort

378
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,780
and discomfort as an example, right? Yes. So typically we use 40 percent.

379
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:32,460
40, 40. Yeah, that's the pressure that we use when all we care about is muscle adaptations. In

380
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:40,060
other words, increasing muscle size and strength. Now you can see the same adaptation at 80 percent

381
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,900
with a little bit less work because you're going to fail sooner.

382
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:55,340
But the discomfort is going to be much higher. Now, I think the other component of that is that's

383
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:02,780
muscle adaptation. Now we have some data. It's very preliminary, but some data that suggests that

384
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:09,340
some of the vascular changes might actually require a higher pressure. So vascular changes,

385
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:17,420
meaning kind of a change in form, limb blood flow or form conductance. So that's a gross

386
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,420
measurement of basically the vascular network. So there's some indication that maybe you do

387
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,580
need higher pressure for that. But that's one study. We did observe it in both the upper and

388
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,980
lower body, which gives me a little bit of confidence, but it's one study. So but with

389
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:43,340
muscle, I feel pretty confident saying you can use a moderate pressure, 40 percent or a high

390
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:49,420
pressure, 80 to 90 percent. And the adaptation is going to be pretty much the same with respect to

391
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:56,460
muscle size and strength. The discomfort might be or will be quite different, will be much higher

392
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:03,020
with a higher pressure. How much variability is there between an individual's tolerance for

393
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:09,420
discomfort at a fixed occlusive pressure? So I love the idea of using 80 percent of

394
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,300
occlusive pressure because now it's not a given number. It's 80 percent for that individual.

395
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:21,420
So in theory, everybody is experiencing the same amount of relative occlusion. But if you took a

396
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,540
hundred people and let's even make it more homogeneous. If you took a hundred fit people

397
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:36,540
and you simultaneously applied 80 percent of occlusive pressure to bilateral upper extremities

398
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,500
and just had them sit there. So we'll do the first experiment where nobody does anything.

399
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:48,940
What is the what would the bell curve look like? How tight would it be for the time at which a

400
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:55,980
person cries uncle? And the pressure is 50 percent. You pick a number. I said 80, but but I.

401
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:03,900
Okay. 80. I mean, I don't know the the minute we have done some discomfort studies applying 40

402
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,220
percent and just having people sit. Yeah. So at 40 percent, what's the answer? It's pretty low.

403
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,500
You know, we stopped at four minutes. We didn't have anybody who couldn't do it.

404
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,100
But you are going to have some people who who do experience that as more discomforting than other

405
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:27,580
people. And but it becomes much greater when you obviously combine it with muscle contraction.

406
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:35,660
But yeah, you're right. So when we say 40 percent AOP, that doesn't necessarily mean a 40 percent

407
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,740
reduction in blood flow either. That's right. So those are those are two separate things. So

408
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:46,060
somebody when we apply 40 percent of AOP, the reduction in blood flow might be different

409
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,500
depending on how big the muscle is, a variety of other things. And the discomfort associated with

410
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:58,780
that will also vary depending on the person. There's some people who we have who, you know,

411
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,900
they perceive almost everything as extreme discomfort, whereas we have people on the

412
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,940
opposite side as well. But in general, we see I can't think of the actual numerical value,

413
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,620
but we have 40 percent is right here. And then with 80 percent, it shifts, meaning that the

414
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,980
average is certainly higher. But there are certain people who, you know, the discomfort they feel at

415
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,660
40 is not different than it is 80 because they already rated it so high. So I mean, that's the

416
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:34,060
limitation of the scale. But what is the what what is the approximate blood flow restriction that

417
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:40,220
occurs at 40 percent AOP? How much of the blood flow arterial flow is being limited and how much

418
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:47,980
Venus pooling is occurring? Yeah, I don't know the actual the percent drop off the top of my head.

419
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,180
It isn't 40 percent. It's on average is a little bit less than that,

420
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,940
depending upon the position, depending on what you're doing. But yeah, in general, I think during

421
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,460
the rest period, you probably do have Venus occlusion because it doesn't take it's not thought

422
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:12,300
to take a lot of pressure to collapse the vein. So during the exercise, you're obviously pumping

423
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:18,460
it back out with the muscle pump. But I would say at most of the pressures that we apply, at least at

424
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:25,980
rest, there is Venus point occurring. Yeah, today, I finished my workout with a set of leg press.

425
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:33,820
So did 30 reps, rest 30 seconds, 15 reps, rest 30 seconds, 15, rest 30 seconds, 15.

426
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:42,940
And I'm not sure what hurt worse, just the 30 seconds in between or the actual last two sets,

427
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,300
the 15 reps in the last two sets. I mean, the whole thing was just so wildly uncomfortable.

428
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:54,300
Again, I'm flying by the seat of my pants, not doing this based on occlusive pressure.

429
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,340
So I don't know how far off I am. It's something I'm looking forward to diving deeper into.

430
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,420
I think you've already convinced me I should be more scientific in my approach because I'm

431
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:09,420
sort of white knuckling it and putting these things on and screaming for dear life. So I'm

432
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:16,460
in pain kind of before the I'm sort of I'm very uncomfortable before I start. And even after that

433
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:22,380
first set of 30, I'm questioning my sanity. Sure. So who knows, maybe I'm going to do a

434
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,860
break. So who knows, maybe I'm applying too much. It would seem that

435
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:35,820
the directionally, would you have a nomogram of occlusive pressure versus expected number of reps

436
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:46,300
at a percentage of one rep max? Yeah, that's also tough. I think

437
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:54,540
most of the loading that we use is 30%. And to be honest, if we have somebody who's stronger,

438
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,980
they're not getting 30, 15, 15, 15. There's no there's no question they're going to be at failure.

439
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:06,060
Most of the time when we actually do experiments, we just have people exercise four sets to as many

440
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,340
as repetitions as you can. That way we can at least hold that constant so we can control for effort.

441
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:20,380
But yeah, I do think that you can use the number of repetitions as a as a as a weak

442
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:26,300
surrogate of blood flow restriction. So I would say that if you're using 20 or 30%,

443
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:35,820
you should be getting close to 30 repetitions each set. No, no, for the first set. So and then close

444
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:42,300
to 15, you may get 12. But if you can't get 30 on the first one or get close to that, the load is

445
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,060
probably too high or the wraps are too tight. I would say that if you're in pain before you're

446
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:56,060
starting, it's too tight. And you know, we've we've done a lot of work on practical restriction as

447
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:01,100
well. I would say that practical meaning, we don't really know how much pressure is being applied,

448
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,420
we're applying a knee wrap. That's what I refer to as practical blood flow restriction.

449
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,980
I think if you are rehabbing, or you're in a clinical setting, are you working in that,

450
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,620
I think you really need to know the pressure that you're applying. Yeah, I think if you're

451
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,660
a healthy person in the gym who wants to use blood flow restriction, I don't think it's all

452
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:27,580
that important to know the pressure. Assuming you have the discussion that we're having now where

453
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:35,020
I know the load is low, I apply the wraps, I'm in pain, well, then the wraps are too tight.

454
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:43,820
So I loosen them up. And then I can get close to 30 reps, and then close to 15 on the last three

455
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:50,060
sets. Now on the last one, depending on how strong you are, you might fail pretty quick in that fourth

456
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:58,780
set. That's okay. So but I do agree with you that I think that you can use goal repetitions as a way

457
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:05,260
to have some idea at the level of restriction that's being applied. So when you're at 40%

458
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:11,180
occlusive pressure, what would be the kind of maximum period of time you would let a subject

459
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:17,980
stay under that pressure, both in terms of the combined lift recovery period? Yeah, I think if

460
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,700
they're just starting out, I think it one, it depends on are they resistance training or are

461
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:28,540
they doing kind of low intensity aerobic exercise? If it's low intensity aerobic exercise, you can

462
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:35,420
probably keep it on for 30 or 40 minutes, because it doesn't feel that discomforting, because you're

463
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:40,700
exercising at a low intensity, the cuffs are not all that tight, you're not building up a tremendous

464
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,020
amount of metabolites, probably why you're not also getting a tremendous amount of adaptation.

465
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:53,180
But with resistance exercise, I think if you're just starting out, I think it's hard to have a

466
00:50:53,180 --> 00:51:00,860
minute, I think maybe seven, eight, nine minutes, 10 minutes or so. I would say one exercise is a

467
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:07,180
good place to start. We've done it early on, we did multiple exercises for people who are untrained,

468
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:13,100
and that's pretty tough. But I would say, you know, start off with four sets of an exercise and then

469
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,860
take the cuffs off or take the wrap off. And then you might be able to eventually work up to a couple.

470
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:24,140
But I wouldn't with resistance training, I don't think that, you know, you should leave it on

471
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,020
continuously for probably more than a few exercises. But if you've never done it, I wouldn't go beyond

472
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:35,500
one, just so you can start to kind of see what it feels like. And so if 40 to 80% of occlusive

473
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:45,260
pressure is the technical way to do it. What other metric do you, would people use if they don't

474
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:53,020
have access to a Doppler? Yeah, I think, for example, if somebody knew their blood pressure,

475
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,460
I can see why that would not necessarily be, I can see why systolic blood pressure would not

476
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:07,420
be the same as occlusive pressure. Is it a reasonable proxy? Not always. It really depends

477
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:13,420
upon if the size of the cuff that you're using is very similar in size, then you could you could do

478
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:23,180
that and base the pressure as a percentage of your systolic pressure. I think the average gymgoer,

479
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:30,620
I think one of the things that you could do is, you know, apply the wrap as a percentage of your

480
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:37,740
resting limb size. So there's some data that's done that's used that one of the ways that we've

481
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:47,740
tried to work with is condition people to feel what 40% supposed to feel like. So you would have

482
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:54,620
to have the device one day. So we're doing this because there are some places that are applying

483
00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:01,420
this to clinical populations, where they have only a small amount of time with the patient,

484
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:08,300
and then they send them home to do exercises. So the idea being is that you could be with the

485
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:15,420
patient, have them feel what 40% supposed to feel like, and then say when you get home, try to mimic

486
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:24,380
this pressure. So we've had some success with that. We are able to get people to on average rate

487
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:34,460
around 40%, but the individual level is anywhere between 20% and 60% of AOP. So it's not terrible,

488
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:41,500
but it's not very good yet. One of the things that led us to that is that initially,

489
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:48,540
I was on a paper a long time ago that said you should rate the pressure based on 7 out of 10,

490
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:55,180
because that can make sure that the pressure will be sub-inclusive. And that's overall pretty much

491
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:03,260
true. The issue is, is that you have a tremendously wide range, and it's not reliable, meaning that

492
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:12,300
on day one, you might say 7 out of 10 is 90% AOP. The next day, it might be 10%. So we don't really

493
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:18,620
recommend that scale anymore. We're interested in this idea of conditioning and or using a percentage

494
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:24,780
of a resting circumference, and or what we talked about earlier, we use repetitions as kind of a goal.

495
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,740
Yeah, that's, I mean, the cups I have are super cheapo cups, I feel like I want to invest in

496
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:37,580
sort of nice ones. But the one thing they have on them is numbers. So I've got a sense of like,

497
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:45,900
on arms, I need to be between 7 and 8, and on legs between 11 and 12.

498
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:53,420
And sometimes I just overcook it. And after the first set, I have to loosen them if I want to

499
00:54:53,420 --> 00:55:03,580
have any hope of completing the exercises. And then going back to weight, 20 to 40% of One Rep Max

500
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:12,460
is about the place you like people to be. Yeah, I generally prefer lower, meaning around 20 or 30%.

501
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:19,580
There are some people who creep up to 40. And so I just think that the real utility of using

502
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:25,580
blood flow restriction is the fact that you can use it with very low loads. So I think that's the

503
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:31,900
benefit. We have we've tried to combine it with high loads and different aspects. And other people

504
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:37,820
have run training studies with it, but it's not additive. So it doesn't add anything more to

505
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:43,660
high load training. And it's probably because, you know, high load normal exercise is a maximal

506
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:49,180
stimulus. So it's hard to maximize something that's probably already pretty much maximal.

507
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:54,460
In a given training session. So that's why I'm like, if you want to lift with heavy weights,

508
00:55:54,460 --> 00:56:00,540
then just do that. I think the utility of using blood flow restriction is with that you can use

509
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:08,780
lower loads. Any playing with the speed, either concentrically or eccentrically? And does that

510
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:15,020
matter? I think if the slower you go, the less repetitions you're obviously going to be able to

511
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:22,620
do. I don't think that it probably matters overall too much, especially for growth. The pace that we

512
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:28,940
typically use is about one second up, one second down. So relatively quick pace. Some people use a

513
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:35,420
second and a half. So if you use a second to a second and a half, it's usually a nice controlled

514
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:43,580
movement. So we haven't messed with too much in the lab. But I don't think it would matter too

515
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:47,580
much. I think it would alter how much work you were able to do and a load that you would be able

516
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:53,420
to use more than anything. And do you think that ultimately time under tension is all that's going

517
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,980
to matter? So if you do it slower, but you get fewer reps, it's still okay if you have the same

518
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:04,220
time under tension? Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, I think because when we think about muscle growing,

519
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:10,860
at least when I think about a muscle growing where it requires a muscle to be activated for a

520
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:16,460
sufficient duration of time for all those signaling pathways to be turned on. So from my

521
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,420
perspective, there's a lot of different ways for that to occur. You know, you can use really,

522
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,780
really heavy weights, you know, repeatedly, and that will do it. Or you can use low loads,

523
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:33,740
or you can use very slow pace as well. I think all of those are kind of doing similar things. You're

524
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:40,700
recruiting these more and more and more fibers, activating them and signaling them to grow. So

525
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:46,220
yeah, I think it would be very similar. Then how much rest are you prescribing?

526
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:53,500
I did 30 seconds today. Sometimes I do like a super set where I'll do, you know, one muscle,

527
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,780
another muscle, another muscle, and just go back and forth with two different muscles

528
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:04,060
and not take an act or take a passive rest. What do you what do you think about those approaches?

529
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:11,820
Yeah, I think in general, we use about 30 seconds. That's the standard one that we use in our lab.

530
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:19,580
I think when I've experimented in the gym, I think that super setting works really well,

531
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:26,220
especially if you are working out of muscle that's not necessarily directly under blood flow

532
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:33,420
restriction. So for example, the chest, you know, there is some idea that just doing a standard

533
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:39,180
bench press exercise with blood flow restriction around the around the arms would augment the size

534
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:45,820
of the chest. There's some data that indicates that to me, I think a lot of that is driven by

535
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:51,260
the fact that the muscles distal to the cuff, the triceps are fatiguing, and the chest is picking

536
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:57,180
up the load. So in the gym, I like to experiment with that. So do is do some chest and then super

537
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:02,780
set with some tricep extension or something like that. But we haven't studied that in the lab,

538
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:07,020
but that's those are things that I've messed around with in the past. That's interesting. You

539
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:13,660
know, I've never thought to do something like a bench press with it, frankly, mostly out of fear

540
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,980
is this. But I guess if you adjust the weight low enough, it shouldn't really be that much of an

541
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:29,180
issue. What about is I mean, once I did deadlifts restricted, and I wasn't sure if it was a great

542
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,420
idea, I mean, I was it was very lightweight. It was probably like 135 pounds. So it was not,

543
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,780
you know, the type of weight I felt like I could ever hurt myself with. But I was like,

544
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:43,980
okay, well, let's do 30 reps here of 135 pound deadlift under restriction. Truthfully, I thought

545
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,300
it was pretty freaking cool. I think in the end, I didn't keep doing it because I was like, well,

546
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:54,300
look, I don't want to develop bad habits deadlifting under such fatigue. Is there what's your thought

547
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:02,780
on doing complex, you know, multi joint movements? There is data looking at bench press squat.

548
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:11,660
And they have seen some benefits. I generally agree with you. I think that you can do those,

549
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:18,140
assuming that you're using lightweight, I tend to prefer kind of isolation movements, especially if

550
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:24,620
the goal is growth. But you could you could do them. I think that you'd have varying success

551
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:29,900
depending on the movement, the deadlift. I mean, if it's a Romanian type deadlift, maybe I could

552
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:37,900
see that having maybe some sort of benefit. But I think I'd have a similar thought as you it's like,

553
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:44,380
am I going to change my mechanics somehow and then put myself at risk and then really require

554
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:50,220
blood flow restriction in order to train because I'm hurt. So yeah, you can do compounds that

555
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:55,260
there's certainly evidence that suggests that it can help with the squat, help with the barbell

556
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:03,020
bench press. We tend to use isolation movements and for research purposes, obviously. But I tend

557
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:09,420
to feel that a little bit better. And I feel a little bit safer doing those types of exercises.

558
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,180
Well, let's talk about risks because I know that when people think about blood flow restriction,

559
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:21,580
I've had people ask me, you know, are you worried about RABDO? Are you worried about nerve damage?

560
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:29,820
You know, are you basically what are the risks of this? And what's what's the safety profile?

561
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:40,140
Sure. So I think that's a completely reasonable kind of response when you're telling people that,

562
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:45,500
hey, I'm restricting blood flow. And I think you should might consider it. I think the first

563
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:53,820
response that I would hope a person would say is, what's the safety of that? I think a couple things.

564
01:01:53,820 --> 01:02:00,620
One, it helps to understand that this is a very acute response. In other words,

565
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:07,580
we're restricting blood flow for minutes, not for hours. So I think that that's important. I think

566
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:14,140
the safety profile overall is comparable to that of high load exercise or traditional exercise.

567
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:22,780
There are two concerns that people generally bring up. First is blood clotting. Second is muscle

568
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:27,740
damage. In other words, does it increase the risk of blood clots? Does it increase the risk

569
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:33,740
of muscle damage? And I think those are the way I stated that is how it should probably be stated.

570
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:40,300
So any time we exercise or any time we wake up and live, as you know, there's a risk. There's

571
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:45,900
always a risk for something to occur. In my mind, the question, the important question is,

572
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:52,860
not is there a risk, but when we add blood flow restriction, does it increase the risk?

573
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:59,580
And it doesn't appear to at least at the group level and mostly healthy individuals.

574
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:04,780
So it doesn't increase the risk of blood clots. And that has been looked at in some clinical

575
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:11,340
populations as well, which is good. It doesn't increase the risk of muscle damage. You will get

576
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:18,060
sore, but when we look at the fiber, it appears to be intact. So it doesn't appear to be some

577
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:24,940
structural damages at all. And have there been studies where they've measured CK levels and

578
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:29,100
contrast them with and without restriction? And does there appear to be more breakdown,

579
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:34,780
at least measured by CK? Now, generally when they look at most of those, there's not a whole lot of

580
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:40,300
difference between the same exercise without blood flow restriction. There's certainly soreness

581
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:46,780
that I feel confident about, but not necessarily structural damage.

582
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:55,900
Another one that's been kind of brought up is the blood pressure response to this exercise.

583
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:01,420
So it's true. So proximal to the cuff, is blood pressure going up centrally in the heart,

584
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:08,220
the aorta, the brain? Yeah. And compared to the same exercise without it, it usually is higher.

585
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:13,180
But it's usually comparable to that. It's not a little bit lower than high load exercise.

586
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:19,100
So I think the key component of that is, of course, it's probably going to be higher. You're

587
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:24,780
restricting blood flow, but how high does it get and how quickly does it return back to baseline?

588
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:30,620
So I think that those are kind of two important components. Now, when we've compared it to high

589
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:36,060
load exercise, it's usually pretty similar. And it usually comes back down to baseline within five

590
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:44,780
minutes, that those are healthy individuals. Now, there was a paper written on it suggesting that

591
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:52,060
that's great, but there are certain populations where they may hyper respond to that. And

592
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:59,100
I think that's a good point. So I do think that it might be something to consider if you have

593
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:04,860
some sort of clinical element you might want to, you know, if you might be hypersensitive

594
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:11,820
to that reflex, that might be something to really think about. In myself, I would, when I think about

595
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:20,620
doing unrestricted heavy movements, so, you know, five to eight reps of deadlifts or, you know,

596
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:26,940
something where I'm really going for it, that feels like I have a much higher blood pressure

597
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:33,100
than the blood pressure I feel like I'm under doing blood flow restriction, even though

598
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,740
there's a much greater discomfort with the blood flow restriction.

599
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,300
I never really get the feeling like my head's going to pop off my shoulders, which I

600
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:48,140
commonly feel when I'm doing a heavy deadlift. Right. Yeah, I agree. And I think that's,

601
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:53,180
you know, a lot of the intramuscular pressure all over, you know, a systemic restriction.

602
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:57,660
Well, yeah, because I think when you're really lifting heavily, the intra-abdominal pressure

603
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:03,980
is what allows you to do it. And, you know, that's actually compressing the aorta. So it'd be

604
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:10,140
interesting if you really think about where the pressure matters the most. But I would say that

605
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:14,540
overall, it does appear to be very safe. You know, that's something that we're, we've been interested

606
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:23,100
in for a long time. I do think that, you know, as you, as with anything, when you give a drug and a

607
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:30,780
large, you know, clinical trial, you start to see, you know, some side effects that you've never

608
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:37,100
seen before. So my guess is, is that it, when it becomes more and more and more popular, we will

609
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:43,900
find there will be certain rare events that we've never seen before. But I think in the actual

610
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:49,740
studies that have been done, we see it to be overall relatively safe. It doesn't increase

611
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,300
the risk at least, assuming it's done appropriately.

612
01:06:55,580 --> 01:07:03,580
Has the following experiment ever been done where you take, well, in an ideal world, I guess you

613
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:12,380
take the same subject, right? So you have them do the exact same exercises for the same number of

614
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:20,060
reps. So you take, let's say 30% of one rep max and do the 30, 15, 15, 15. But one of the arms is

615
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:27,660
occluded, the other is not. So the one that's not is not hurting at all. That should be pretty easy

616
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:33,260
to do that in the un-occluded side, correct? Correct. So you're exercising one arm under

617
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,700
blood flow restriction, the other arm is not? Correct. But you're using the same weight,

618
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:43,260
the same reps, the same rest, everything. Yes. I think, yes, that the

619
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:51,020
Shinohara, for example, same workload, one had blood flow restriction, the other one didn't,

620
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:57,500
that was within subject. I think that those studies have been done. I think the criticism

621
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:03,900
on within subject studies is with respect to strength, not necessarily muscle growth,

622
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:10,460
because some people think that, not some people, I mean, it is an observable fact that when you

623
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:16,940
train one side, but not the other, the other arm oftentimes can increase in strength. But I'm not

624
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:24,460
sure that that happens when both limbs train. I think the limb actually responds to the local,

625
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:29,740
what it's been trained to do. So I don't know that it's that big of a limitation with strength,

626
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:34,140
but yeah, those studies have been done. And what are they finding typically when they're

627
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:39,260
under the same load, one side is restricted, one side is not, is the restricted side still making

628
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:44,540
gains in strength and or size? Yeah, generally the blood flow restriction will be better

629
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:53,500
than a work-matched control, even if it's the same person with the caveat that it's not to failure.

630
01:08:53,500 --> 01:09:00,140
And that's the difficult thing if you're using 30%, because 30% for some people,

631
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:07,260
you know, that you'll be reaching failure almost on four sets in the non-included arm. So I think

632
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:17,260
that should be stated. I think when we have one limb trained to failure, the other limb

633
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:20,380
trained with blood flow restriction to failure, we've done those studies lots.

634
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:26,380
The adaptation is usually pretty similar, but the volume, the exercise volume needed

635
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:29,100
is much lower with the blood flow restriction limb.

636
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,620
Yeah, that's what I was sort of going to get at, which is,

637
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:42,700
is blood flow restriction mostly just a tool to increase or decrease the time to failure

638
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:50,540
and therefore act as a more efficient means to fatigue the various fibers.

639
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:59,820
I think that's fair to say with a couple of potential things to consider. I think

640
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:06,780
blood flow restriction by itself, so just the application of restriction and deflation

641
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:14,780
and some ACL reconstruction, post-surgery environment has shown to have some sort of

642
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:20,460
benefit. So that suggests to me that there could be something to the restriction of blood flow.

643
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:27,660
Same thing when we have people walk very slowly. In other words, they're not really walking to

644
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:33,420
failure or even close to failure, but there does appear to be some adaptation. It's not close to

645
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:39,260
what you see with resistance exercise, but there's something that's a little bit more there.

646
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:46,780
So I think with resistance exercise, that might be a very fair statement to say that you're just

647
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:54,860
causing the muscle to have to activate more of the muscle sooner and fatigue sooner than a

648
01:10:54,860 --> 01:11:01,500
non-included condition. I think that's fair, but to say that that's the only thing, the only benefit

649
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:08,460
of blood flow restriction, I don't know that we can say, especially considering the vascular

650
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:15,820
response I talked about earlier, that the vascular network, the blood flow, the resting blood flow

651
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:22,300
to the forearm or calf, it does appear to respond with a higher pressure, but not a lower pressure,

652
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,860
despite that both of them are doing a tremendous amount of work. So I think it might be fair to

653
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:34,300
say with muscle, with respect to resistance exercise, but I have some remaining questions

654
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:41,900
before I would go all in. So let's get back to something that we touched on earlier, but we'll

655
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:48,780
get to it in more depth, which is the relationship between strength and hypertrophy. It's very clear

656
01:11:48,780 --> 01:12:00,940
that they're correlated. It's not clear which way the arrow of causation runs, if it necessarily,

657
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:06,220
if there is a causal relationship between them. What's the conventional thinking on this?

658
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:13,820
The conventional wisdom or the conventional thinking is that once muscle growth is there,

659
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:21,660
that it's probably contributing to changes in strength. And I think that's the textbook

660
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:27,420
definition. Neural first, followed by large contributions from muscle hypertrophy.

661
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:37,900
And I think doing a lot of research in the low load realm, as we've done, I started to really see that

662
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:47,420
maybe that's actually not the case, because we almost always see muscle growth, which is similar

663
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:53,020
to or equivalent to that of high load exercise. But the strength, assuming that we're not

664
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:59,980
practicing the test repeatedly, is almost always less. And in my mind, I had a hard time

665
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:09,420
coming up with a lot of excuses. I did for several years. But at some point, I just,

666
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,900
you know, talk and talking with my students, we just started to ask the question about,

667
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:22,460
well, where did this story come from about muscle growth, playing a role? And why do we even think

668
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:27,420
it in the first place? Because I'm trying really, really hard to make excuses for why we aren't

669
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:34,060
seeing it. But maybe we should go back to the beginning and see why do we ever think it in the

670
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:39,260
first place. And that's where I think it really becomes difficult for people to have this

671
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:44,780
conversation, because everybody has learned the same thing that I learned. It's neural,

672
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:52,780
then hypertrophy, neural, then hypertrophy. And they have a hard time kind of going, you know,

673
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:59,740
taking a step back and going, okay, but were those studies ever able to actually make that claim?

674
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:04,460
Yeah. So what where did that hypothesis come from? What is the evidence in support of the

675
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:10,460
null hypothesis? I think if you were to get a bunch of people together, so and we measured

676
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:18,860
muscle size, and we measured strength, on average, people who are bigger will be stronger. People who

677
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:25,660
are smaller will be weaker. And that's, that's true. And we've seen that we've documented that

678
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:33,260
ourselves. But that's not an effective exercise, because we see the same relationships and people

679
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:38,940
who have never exercised in their life. So the question that sorry, just to make sure understand

680
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:44,300
that, Jeremy, you're saying that the correlation or association between strength and size is equally

681
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:51,820
strong in the untrained as it is the trained? Correct. Yeah. So the question that's being

682
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:59,180
asked by or the question that we're discussing is when a person begins to exercise,

683
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:08,940
and then they get stronger, is that due to changes in muscle size? And that's where I have the

684
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:13,340
question. I don't question whether or not they're related. I completely agree that they are.

685
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:21,740
But when we exercise, does a change in one result in a change in the other? So I think

686
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:32,220
people I think it obviously makes a lot of sense that it could, for all the reasons that we said

687
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:38,140
earlier, we're increasing actinimized, we're increasing this protein, why would they not then

688
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:44,620
produce greater strength? But there's numerous times in the literature where we have shown

689
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:52,460
greater changes in muscle size, but strength doesn't even change. So that leads me to believe

690
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:59,100
that there could be quite a bit of disconnect with respect to muscle growth and the change in string.

691
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:10,620
Now you wrote a paper basically trying to go back to the root of this dogma. And I think you

692
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:15,580
basically found that there were sort of three papers that formulated this viewpoint. Two of them,

693
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:21,020
I think, were from the 70s. And then one was kind of a review paper of one of those papers. Am I

694
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:27,980
remembering this correctly? Yeah. So the one that's commonly cited as more tiny and diverse or

695
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:37,980
derived. And they had five individuals, one arm lifted weights, the other arm did not lift weights.

696
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:47,580
And they were basically inferring muscle growth of changes in service EMG. So they did measure

697
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:54,140
arm circumference, but that wasn't the variable they were using to quantify growth.

698
01:16:54,140 --> 01:17:01,180
They were looking at changes in the slope of this integrated EMG. So if they saw a change in the

699
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:07,740
slope, they inferred that to mean muscle growth. If they didn't see a change in that slope,

700
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:12,140
then they said that was neural. So that's where this can you explain to me how that were. I don't

701
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:18,860
I don't know enough about EMG to understand that inference. One, I think, at least in my opinion,

702
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:24,460
you cannot infer growth off the change in EMG. But what they were doing is is that, let's say,

703
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:31,900
let's pick a variety of weights. So let's say 10 pounds, 20 pounds, 30 pounds and up. So what is the

704
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:39,100
EMG amplitude? So but EMG amplitude is essentially an estimate of muscle action potential. So how

705
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:46,860
much signal do you get when you lift 10 pounds at baseline versus 20, 30, 40, then they would do that

706
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:55,660
every couple of weeks. So if they lifted 10 pounds and the and the basically the amplitude

707
01:17:55,660 --> 01:18:00,540
was a little bit less, they would infer that that was being picked up by muscle growth.

708
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:06,940
That's kind of the idea. So the amplitude they're using to assess the neurologic signal.

709
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:15,900
And over time, they're saying if the neurologic signal is going down, and the and the effort is

710
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:23,500
the same hypertrophy makes up the difference. Or, for example, yeah, I got it. And I think one of the

711
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:32,780
the points that we're always trying to make is that guarantees that at some point hypertrophy

712
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:37,500
is going to be a mechanism. You're not actually testing a mechanism. You're just assuming that

713
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:43,740
at some point, it will be a mechanism. So that was the same thing with the kai and Fukunaga,

714
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:49,420
which is the other the other study. So they actually did measure muscle size. And to my

715
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:55,100
knowledge, that's actually the first study to actually document changes in muscle size

716
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:02,220
in response to resistance exercise. So what I would call a landmark paper, I really enjoy the paper.

717
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:08,940
But what they infer is is that if muscle growth changes, then it must be playing a role.

718
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:15,340
And if it doesn't change, and they got stronger, then it must be neural. And that's kind of the

719
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:22,380
where we've been at for, you know, ever since. In other words, that when we run a training study,

720
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:28,220
if you get stronger, but we don't document a change in muscle size, it's neural. If you get

721
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:36,540
stronger, and we measure changes in muscle size, well, then it was neural and hypertrophy. So to me,

722
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:42,860
I don't think we can make that claim. Because you're just assuming that the ability to document

723
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:48,380
it means it's actually doing something with respect to strength, I, I would like to see a little bit

724
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:54,700
more kind of rigor in that I understand why people would think it, I get all of that and make that

725
01:19:54,700 --> 01:20:02,700
makes sense to me as well. But my question is, is that does it actually and we've approached this

726
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:07,260
through a variety of different ways, but I think it does help to think about this historically,

727
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:13,660
where did this come from, and it really does seemingly come from those two studies. And then

728
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:20,860
Digby sale had a very really great paper reviewing kind of all the work that had been done,

729
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:28,940
where he suggested that most training studies are only documenting a certain aspect of an actual

730
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:34,460
person's training age. So they're never going to be able to actually answer this question,

731
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:41,740
because the studies are too short. But I don't know that that's fair to say, because more time

732
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:47,020
degrees is eight weeks, which is the same duration as a lot of other studies that have basically

733
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:53,580
contradicted it. So kind of rambled there a little bit. But yeah, you're right. Those are the three

734
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:59,660
papers that are commonly cited for this neural first, followed by hypertrophy.

735
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:06,300
Even outside of BFR, which seems to provide a very elegant tool to test the hypothesis,

736
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:09,260
as you've explained, and we'll get into in a little bit more detail.

737
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:15,420
It seems that you could do other experiments to test this even without blood flow restriction.

738
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:25,900
For example, couldn't you have somebody do workouts where they only do one to five reps

739
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:30,620
of exercises, and they're basically always functioning, and each of those is to failure.

740
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:36,460
If you're doing one rep, it's a one rep max. If you're doing two reps, it's 95% of one rep max.

741
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:42,140
If it's three reps, it's probably 90%. If it's five reps, it's probably 85% of one rep max.

742
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:49,020
And so you cycle through those workouts where you increase strength. In fact,

743
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:55,420
put a very practical example to this. I know specifically athletes who train this way,

744
01:21:55,420 --> 01:22:03,580
and they train with a trap bar, and they do not do the eccentric motion. So they lift the weight

745
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:09,100
up and drop it, lift the weight up and drop it, and they're never going above five reps.

746
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:15,500
So they're really trying to maximize strength, which comes more from the concentric movement,

747
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:21,020
and they're trying to minimize any hypertrophy because they're athletes for whom strength to

748
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:25,100
weight is the most important ratio. So it's very typical workout for runners.

749
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:33,500
So they'll dramatically increase their strength without adding size. And then you could compare

750
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:39,500
that to the opposite type of workout where you do more of a bodybuilding workout. You're probably

751
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:45,020
never going below eight reps, and you'll get bigger. And I could imagine a scenario where you

752
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:50,700
don't even get as strong as that other person. I mean, wouldn't that demonstrate how uncoupled

753
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:57,340
these two metrics can be? Yes, I agree with you. And we've done this several times now.

754
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:03,500
We've tried to address this question via study design, doing something very similar to what you

755
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:10,700
said, where we have one group that's training just doing the one RM test. That's it. They come in,

756
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:17,420
they work up to about five total reps, and then they go home because we're trying to maximize

757
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,700
the strength signal that not get growth. Because essentially, to answer this question, we have to

758
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:31,100
know if the muscle did get bigger and stronger, what would strength look like if muscle growth

759
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:36,620
had not occurred? So when we look at the traditional training group, we have them doing

760
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:43,500
about eight to 12 reps. And this is a very simple movement, the bicep curl. In that group, we see

761
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:52,220
muscle growth, and we see a change in strength. Now, what previous or what a majority of articles

762
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:59,020
would do is say, given that muscle growth is there, that muscle growth must be contributing

763
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:04,380
to strength. In our mind, we have to say, well, what would strength look like if growth

764
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:09,260
hadn't been there? And when we look at the other group that was just doing one RM,

765
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:16,460
the strength is the same. Now, it's not greater, but it is the same. I do think that the more

766
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:22,140
complex the movement becomes, the greater that separation starts to happen. So we were doing

767
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:29,180
a barbell bench press. My guess is that the group doing one RM or close to a one RM would be far

768
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:34,540
better than an eight to 12. But it's just the fact that the movement is very, very simple. So

769
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:44,380
similar to what you said, in our mind, this does provide some method of trying to address this,

770
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:51,180
because we see a group with no growth compared to a group with growth, but the strength is the same,

771
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:58,300
suggesting that that change in muscle size is not necessary for a change in strength,

772
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:03,340
nor does it appear to be contributing given that the strength is the same. Now,

773
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:13,340
there are limitations with that. One of the big ones is that in order to get that differential

774
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:19,180
in growth, we had to apply slightly different exercise patterns. So one group was doing eight

775
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:26,300
to 12. Still a high load, but not 100 percent where we had another group training at 100 percent.

776
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:33,740
So some suggested that, well, that's not really that fair of a comparison. There's more things

777
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:39,500
that are different than just the muscle growth. And that's that's true. And they suggested that

778
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:47,660
instead that we should follow that up with some mediation analysis where we look at how much of

779
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:53,820
this change relative to a control is driven by muscle size within each group individually.

780
01:25:54,380 --> 01:26:01,020
And when we did that, we did not see any mediation, meaning that none of the change in strength could

781
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:07,740
be explained by that change in muscle size in either one of the groups. Explain that more for

782
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:17,500
me. I'm not sure I follow how you would determine that. So there are some statistical kind of a

783
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:22,140
approach is where you can do some causal mediation. In other words, you can look at the

784
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:28,540
relationship between let's say we have these two exercise groups. So instead of looking at them

785
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:33,740
head to head, let's look at them individually compared to a group that's not doing any exercise

786
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:39,260
at all. That way we can kind of really control for the random error across time. So measurement

787
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:45,660
noise, random biological variability, etc. Essentially, what mediation is doing is saying,

788
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:55,900
okay, we have this group here. How much strength did they gain? So they got stronger. So that's a

789
01:26:55,900 --> 01:27:03,500
direct relationship. So when this group exercises, they got stronger. Now mediation says, okay, let's

790
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:09,980
add in a variable here to see if we can remove this relationship either partially or completely.

791
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:17,100
So if we add in muscle growth to the model, and then this group no longer correlates with

792
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:22,540
strength, then we'll know that that relationship is completely driven by this, this other variable.

793
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:27,420
Now we wouldn't expect for it to be completely right, but if you respect for it partially,

794
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:34,380
but that's we didn't see that in either one of the groups is the contra positive then that it's not

795
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:41,740
at all coupled. Because if you were to ask me what my intuition is, which is worth maybe a warm

796
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:48,540
bucket of hamster vomit, my intuition would be there is an association, but it's not a, it's not,

797
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:55,980
it's not a hundred percent causal. So, you know, like the R squared might be 0.5, not 0.99.

798
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:02,300
So in other words, I would not guess that there is no association. I certainly wouldn't guess a

799
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:10,300
negative association, but I wouldn't guess that it's one to one causal. Can the mediation tease

800
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:16,460
that out? Yes, because it would be a partial mediation and that's, and you did not see a partial

801
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:22,540
mediation. No, we didn't see any effect at all. Now there are other potential reasons. I mean,

802
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:27,900
we have to think about random error across time with our measurement and things of that. I don't

803
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:34,780
think that any of the work that we have done so far can conclusively say that it plays no role.

804
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:42,780
But I do think that we're having an accumulating amount of evidence that's suggesting that

805
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:50,300
if it does play a role, it is so small that we aren't able to ever detect it. So

806
01:28:50,300 --> 01:29:00,460
I am not sure that muscle growth in response to exercise is a mechanism. I've seen no experimental

807
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:06,620
evidence that suggests that that's the case. Now for a practical pragmatic person, what would that

808
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:14,060
mean for them? Well, I think what it can mean is, is that if you are interested in maximal strength

809
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:19,580
and getting as strong as possible, you probably don't care whether it's a mechanism or not. You

810
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:25,660
just want to know how do I get strong? I think we can learn a couple of things from some of these

811
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:32,940
experiments. One, that there's a huge specificity component, meaning that if you want to be a very

812
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:37,900
good squatter, a very good deadlifter, and being very good squatter or being a very good deadlifter

813
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:43,260
means you're able to lift as heavy as possible one time, then that means you should be training

814
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:52,780
at least a good portion of the time at or close to that one RM. Now, if you really believe that

815
01:29:52,780 --> 01:30:00,780
growth might be playing some role, what that might mean for you is to say, well, if it is playing a

816
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:06,860
role, it might be pretty small. So maybe I can allocate less overall time to it, which would be

817
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:12,380
good for most strength athletes, because that's typically what requires a lot of recovery. Because

818
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:19,740
you're doing a lot of volume to see to make a muscle grow. So I become more skeptical of muscle

819
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:25,500
growth as a mechanism every year that goes by. We're still doing more experiments to try and

820
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:33,820
address this. But there certainly is no evidence right now that suggests that it is a mechanism.

821
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:38,940
We have a lot of evidence that suggests that it isn't. But I do think it'd be premature to say,

822
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,780
well, we've completely ruled it out. I don't think that's fair to say at all.

823
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:48,140
So what are some other explanations? I mean, I guess nobody's disputing the neurologic component

824
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:54,300
to this. Is one hypothesis that that is the entirety of it? Or do you think that there is

825
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:59,900
another mechanism that isn't fully clear? Yes, I think some people would say that

826
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:05,260
some people are of the opinion that the exercise induced changes are probably predominantly neural.

827
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:11,980
I'm not there yet. I think that there could be some local changes at the muscle.

828
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:22,140
And that might be able to explain why some groups get stronger. That's not just neural. In other

829
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:31,180
words, maybe the muscle at the local level is actually getting better at responding to

830
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:36,700
forceful contractions. So maybe it's how it deals with calcium or how the myosin head binds.

831
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:41,740
Maybe there's some alterations there qualitatively that aren't due to muscle size.

832
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:52,300
But I don't know what those would be necessarily. I can only offer potential reasons. And I think

833
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:57,820
that's usually the argument that's brought up mostly against our point is, well, if muscle

834
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:04,620
growth is not a mechanism, then what exactly is it? And I don't think that that's a fair argument,

835
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:09,020
honestly, because I don't know that you have to know for sure what something is to say,

836
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:13,180
we don't have a lot of evidence for this. And there's a lot of evidence against this.

837
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:21,660
But that's just my kind of thinking. But I do think that there probably is a huge neural component.

838
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:27,420
But I don't know that there there isn't something going on at the local level

839
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:33,900
that is independent of a change in muscle size. But but it is still muscular, perhaps.

840
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:40,860
So how common is BFR with athletes today?

841
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:48,220
I think it's becoming more and more common. I know at Ole Miss, for example, as well as a lot

842
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:54,620
of other Division One schools in the athletic department, I would say a large portion of them

843
01:32:54,620 --> 01:33:02,860
do have blood flow restriction devices. So they are using it for rehab. And I know that I've seen,

844
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:10,540
you know, players on ESPN, and the NBA NFL using blood flow restriction as well. So I do think it's

845
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:14,700
rehab, exclusively, or do you see them using it when they're not injured as well?

846
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:20,380
I think there's a couple NBA players just looking at some of the stories where they were using it,

847
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:26,540
not for rehab, but just as an everyday kind of way to train where they were able to recover just a

848
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:31,500
little bit faster. And they don't have to have a as they've aged, you know, they want to make sure

849
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:36,380
that they're ready to play on the actual court instead of just spending all their time recovering

850
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:43,420
from their workout. So I think that they they perceive this as one option to use, where they're

851
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:49,180
able to get some kind of workout in but maybe recover quite a bit faster than they might doing

852
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:57,740
normal exercise. Is the is the speed of the recovery a function of less trauma to the muscle

853
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:06,140
during the workout? Or why is their recovery quicker? That's a good question. I think I don't

854
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:14,380
know that we know that. But I it does appear that when they're able to when they when they are

855
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:20,380
injured, and they're working out with blood flow restriction, they're able to usually to get a

856
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:24,380
little bit more out of that compared to high load exercise, or at least very similar to that, but

857
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:29,180
they have less pain during the movement. So maybe they're able to get a little bit more out of the

858
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:35,340
rehabilitation than they normally are. Because maybe they're before they're inhibited to a greater

859
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:40,460
degree with by pain that's reduced a little bit through the application of blood flow restriction.

860
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:50,940
But I don't I don't really know, to be honest. If let's take an extreme bodybuilder, right,

861
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:55,660
where they're not being judged at all on strength. I mean, I've yet to see a bodybuilder who's not

862
01:34:55,660 --> 01:35:02,300
very strong, but presumably due to that just the overwhelming amount of volume in their training.

863
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:07,580
But you know, I even talked about this with Lane on the podcast. And he was explaining how, look,

864
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:11,100
at the end of the day, the volume is what's going to matter. And you know, you can do that with

865
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:17,900
isolated movements, you can do that with compound movements, but you just need to get lots and lots

866
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:26,140
and lots of volume across these kind of ranges. So if the goal is purely hypertrophy, which at

867
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:32,300
least during part of the bodybuilder, but the bodybuilder cycle is the case, how would how would

868
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:37,340
they utilize BFR? First of all, would it be a valuable tool above traditional training? And if

869
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:43,980
so, what would be the optimal way to use it? Yeah, I think it could be. It could be a tool if that's

870
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:52,060
how they choose to use it. I think for muscle growth, I think I agree with Lane that it really

871
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:57,580
comes down to personal preference, because even without blood flow restriction, we've seen from 30%

872
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:04,860
up to 80% or even higher can produce the same amount of muscle growth. So I think that allows

873
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:10,780
you to have some level of preference on based on how you feel that day or what you enjoy.

874
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:19,340
I think that there are days where if you have a heavy day, for example,

875
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:24,700
and you're going to the gym, but you don't feel good, or you're not psychologically have it.

876
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:30,940
And it could be potentially dangerous for you to use a heavy weight, because you're not focused,

877
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,860
then maybe that's a time where you might be able to implement some blood flow restriction.

878
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,540
Because you can use light weights, it doesn't require as much focus.

879
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:43,740
And you could probably see a lot of the same response, at least with growth.

880
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:50,460
So another component could be is that it just helps with some variety. You know, I don't think

881
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:57,420
that variety is necessary, per se, for muscle growth to be optimal. But I think if you're

882
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:02,140
training for an extended period of time across your life, things can get pretty boring if you're

883
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:09,500
just doing the same thing all the time. So it could be a way to try and spice it up a little bit.

884
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:14,940
And then obviously, if you're hurt, it could be a great tool to use, because there is a lot of,

885
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:21,980
or becoming to be more and more evidence that it's helpful in the rehabilitation world.

886
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:25,900
So I think there's a variety of ways that it can be used. But I do think that it's probably

887
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:31,660
important to note that if a person is not comfortable with it, they don't have to do

888
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:38,940
blood flow restriction in order to optimize how much muscle that they can grow. But it is a tool

889
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:44,460
that could be potentially quite effective for them. Yeah, actually, the example you gave

890
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:50,860
is exactly what happened today, which was today's main set for me was a five by five deadlift. So

891
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:58,940
obviously, that's, you know, a heavy day. And I took five sets to warm up to get to the starting

892
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:04,940
weight. That first set of five, I was like, Yeah, this I just I'm struggling. Second set,

893
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:09,820
still struggling. Third set struggled more. Fourth set, I was like, boy,

894
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:15,820
and I'm supposed to be escalating the weight. And on the fifth set, two reps in, I thought,

895
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:21,260
this is the day you hurt yourself, because I'm going to break my form to get number three,

896
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:26,220
four and five. So I actually just stopped. And that's why I went and did the leg press

897
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:31,980
with blood flow restriction, which was a very lightweight. I mean, I don't even remember how

898
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:36,300
many pounds it was, but it was the type of weight that if I wasn't restricted would have, you know,

899
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:42,860
I could have done 100 reps, I'm sure. So but it was a great way to mix up the training. And

900
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:49,260
then that's the kind of stuff I'm interested in exploring. I also kind of think of this as a tool

901
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:59,340
for people who maybe don't have some of the the technique to do heavier lifts, much in the same

902
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:05,260
way I've sort of thought of the super slow lifting protocols as reasonable protocols for people who

903
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:14,460
just don't have either the, you know, desire to train at higher volume and frequency and or

904
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:20,460
don't have the technical chops. Now, that said, I've always felt that the problem with super slow

905
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:28,060
training is unless it's done to failure, which is upsettingly painful if you've tried those workouts,

906
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:35,020
it's probably not nearly as beneficial as traditional training. You know, the sort of super

907
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:41,820
slow advocates will say it's on par with traditional training, right? You could do 20 minutes once or

908
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:47,500
twice a week and have the benefits of six hours per week. I'm not sure that that's true, even from

909
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:53,980
a hypertrophy standpoint. But if it is true, it's probably limited to the few people who truly can

910
01:39:54,060 --> 01:40:01,740
fail. And I don't know if you've ever tried these super slow workouts, but it's it's very difficult

911
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:10,300
to truly fail. I think, you know, it's very hard for I think most people. Yeah, a long time ago,

912
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:16,700
but I never did much with it. There was somebody in my that I worked with in my PhD who was very

913
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:23,100
interested in it for a while. But yeah, I was never really a fan for sure. How come for the same reason

914
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:28,220
or it just I never felt like I was going to get very strong from doing something like that.

915
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:35,260
I'm just moving so slow and the weight is usually, you know, so light that I don't know how much that

916
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:39,420
would be transferring over to something that I was interested in at the time, which was, you know,

917
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:46,540
to to get as strong as possible. But it's definitely hard. There's no question. But

918
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:54,220
yeah, I didn't enjoy that form of training. So it's safe to say that the one place I think you

919
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:59,020
really talked about this already, but I just want to make sure we we put a dot on it. The one place

920
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:05,980
where it's unambiguous that you need to be doing a traditional lift without restriction is if you're

921
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:11,660
training for maximum strength of that lift, which again, I don't think most people are doing maximum

922
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:15,340
strength bicep curls. I don't think that's but but when you start to talk about a bench press,

923
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:19,980
a squat, a deadlift, a leg press for that matter, if you're if you care so much,

924
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:27,900
there's probably no substitute for being in that 80 percent to 100 percent one RM.

925
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:35,660
Is that kind of a safe takeaway? Yeah. And, you know, if you do blood flow shifted exercise with

926
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:41,660
low loads, assuming it's not extremely low, if you're around 20 or 30 percent, you will get

927
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:48,860
stronger that it will be much to a much lighter to a much smaller degree than you would with

928
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:58,220
traditional exercise. I completely agree. Now, now sometimes and I'll just add to that we get this

929
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:03,100
a lot where it's like, well, you're doing, you know, bicep curls in your study because we're using

930
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:09,260
bicep curl. It's a it's a it's a research model to answer a particular question. We're not training.

931
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:15,900
We're not personally training people. So I think sometimes people lose the the reason why certain

932
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:23,260
things are done. But sometimes people will look at low load literature with blood flow restriction

933
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:27,980
or even low load literature without blood flow restriction and say, yeah, but look at this study.

934
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:33,100
They found very similar changes in the strength of high load exercise. And some of those studies

935
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:39,500
do exist. But the majority of those that that do find that effect, if you look at the methods,

936
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:46,300
what they're doing is the low load BFR group is doing the one RM every two weeks or every three

937
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:54,460
weeks. And they're doing it in an effect to try and reset the load so they can assume that they're

938
01:42:54,460 --> 01:43:00,060
progressing. But what they end up doing is practicing lifting a heavy weight. So you're

939
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:07,100
not actually studying low loads of BFR. You're studying low loads with BFR plus one RM training.

940
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:12,700
And I think that that's a very important point. And we actually reviewed this.

941
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:20,700
We published a paper on this topic where we show that when you only look at the studies with low

942
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:27,820
loads that don't practice doing the one RM test repeatedly, almost all of them lose the high load

943
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:35,100
exercise. Just again, illustrating the point that it's about lifting heavy weight is the best way

944
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:40,220
to get better at lifting heavy weight. It doesn't mean that you won't get stronger lifting lighter

945
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:48,860
weight, but you won't be as strong as you were. So how do we think? Well, let's let me summarize

946
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:54,460
what you just said, because I think in terms of big picture, there are really two areas where

947
01:43:55,420 --> 01:44:03,580
BFR shines. One of them is in an individual who for some reason can't lift heavy weight,

948
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:09,420
but still needs to get stronger and potentially bigger. And the obvious example is the person

949
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:14,540
who's recovering from an injury and then potentially the person who just, you know,

950
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:20,060
has a concern about lifting heavy weight, either from a technical standpoint or injury avoidance

951
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:26,380
or things like that. The second place where BFR seems to really stand out is in hypertrophy.

952
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:34,860
Most of these studies are demonstrating slightly superior hypertrophy response

953
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:43,820
despite less total volume and certainly lower load. Is that it's at least as good in hypertrophy

954
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:48,460
and in some cases better is my reading of the literature. When it's compared to,

955
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:55,420
if you have a low load with BFR compared to a work matched low load group without BFR,

956
01:44:55,420 --> 01:45:02,940
hypertrophy is better almost always. And to make them equal, you will just have to go more on the

957
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:09,180
you'll have to go to a greater degree of reps on the unrestricted side to failure, basically.

958
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:15,100
Correct. Yep. And therefore it takes more time to get the same effect. So it's a more efficient

959
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:19,100
way potentially to generate hypertrophy is probably more accurate than what I said. Right.

960
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:26,860
And correct. Now the vascular adaptations, again, I keep putting that caveat in because it's always

961
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:33,100
in my mind because I really expected that to be kind of the same across the board as well,

962
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:36,460
meaning that as long as you're doing a lot of repetitions, it shouldn't matter whether there's

963
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:43,580
BFR or not. That's not what we found. Now, whether or not that can be repeated, I'm not sure.

964
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:49,580
Hopefully we can do that in the future. But because my thinking for a long time was similar

965
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:53,740
to what you were saying earlier, doesn't really matter whether there's BFR or not. If you do

966
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:58,300
enough, it'll be very similar. The workload would just be less. And I think that again,

967
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:01,660
it's true for muscle, but I don't know if that's true for every single variable.

968
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:11,020
Yeah. So let's let's talk about the mechanism by which this is happening. My assumption,

969
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:18,540
which I don't know if it's right or wrong, is that at least one of the reasons that BFR can produce

970
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:28,700
so much hypertrophy at such low load is in response to the metabolic challenge that's posed.

971
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:34,940
And so one of the things I was doing quite a bit was testing lactate levels with and without BFR.

972
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:41,740
And it's very easy to demonstrate that when you occlude your arm, for example,

973
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:46,940
will distal to that occlusion lactate is going through the roof because you're exercising that

974
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:52,620
arm and you're not letting the lactate clear out of circulation. So I'm pinpricking my finger and

975
01:46:52,620 --> 01:47:00,780
getting very, very high lactate levels. And so that's obviously a metabolic byproduct of

976
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:06,540
any time you're exercising and then especially when you're doing this type of exercise.

977
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:14,540
And so, yeah, I could demonstrate that I had a higher level of lactate doing blood flow restriction

978
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:19,660
than not, even when I was lifting slightly more weight and doing something traditional.

979
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:26,060
Do we think that that matters in this equation? Do we think that that's partially driving this?

980
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:31,180
Or what? And that's just one of the metabolites that we can measure easily. There's plenty that

981
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:39,100
we can't. Yes, I would agree. I think that there's kind of two schools of thought. One is that the

982
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:45,500
pooling of these metabolites in and of themselves is turning on some of these anabolic signaling

983
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:51,660
pathways, meaning just the fact that you're pooling lactate around the fibers, that that's able to

984
01:47:51,660 --> 01:48:00,140
activate growth. I used to be interested in that idea. We tried to test this using a different,

985
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:07,580
a couple of different ways. We didn't find an advantage to doing that. So we kind of started

986
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:13,740
to say, well, maybe there's nothing to metabolize in and of themselves, but maybe it's what they're

987
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:20,300
causing the muscle to do. So in other words, maybe the way we think about it now is, is that, as you

988
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:25,660
said, you're exercising with blood flow restriction, the metabolites are being trapped. What we think

989
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:31,020
is, is that they're augmenting muscle activation. So they're causing the muscle to have to work

990
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:38,620
a lot harder than it normally would because you're pulling this lactate around it. And, you know,

991
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:44,300
you might fatigue some of these cross bridges. So we have to recruit more and more and more and more

992
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:50,620
fibers. So that's where we think the benefit of metabolites is, is that they're basically

993
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:58,380
inducing fatigue, which then leads to further muscle activation. And muscle activation for

994
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:04,780
a sufficient duration of time is the name of the game, at least in my opinion, for making a muscle

995
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:13,980
grow. So one of the big kind of questions always is, are the mechanisms themselves different?

996
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:20,380
From traditional exercise. If I do high load exercise, is that going to be a different

997
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:27,180
mechanism than when I do low load exercise with blood flow restriction? And I don't think so. And

998
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:35,180
I'll tell you why. I think that the mechanism involved in activation is different.

999
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:41,740
But once the fiber is activated, all the signaling pathways, from what I understand,

1000
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:49,660
are going to be very similar. So when we lift a heavy weight, it requires a tremendous and muscle

1001
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:56,620
activation to even lift one rep. If you are trying to do a bicep curl, and you're only activating a

1002
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:02,300
small portion of your fibers, and you're trying to lift 70 pounds if your one or m is 100 pounds.

1003
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:08,380
Right. That's an enormous bias. I was about to say I really feel pretty pathetic here. Yep.

1004
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:18,220
Go ahead. So choose choose any left. Right. In order to lift that heavy weight, you need to

1005
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:23,020
activate a large portion of your musculature. Otherwise, the weight isn't going to move.

1006
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:27,980
Compared to low loads, where you don't need to activate the same amount of muscle fibers

1007
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:36,060
initially, because the weight is extremely low. So when we exercise with low lows in BFR,

1008
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:41,100
we're activating only a small amount initially. But those metabolize, as you discussed,

1009
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:47,020
start to become trapped. And we activate more fibers, more fibers, more fibers, and more fibers.

1010
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:51,980
And then by the end, we've activated a similar amount of fibers as we did with high load exercise.

1011
01:50:52,940 --> 01:51:01,820
By the way, is there an order in that? So if you're one RM bicep curl is 100 pounds,

1012
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:12,140
and then without. So with no blood flow restriction, you pick up 80 pounds and bang out,

1013
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:22,220
I don't know, 10 reps, eight reps. Compare that with if you picked up 40 pounds and banged out

1014
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:30,540
40 reps. What is happening from a fiber fatigue standpoint under those two scenarios?

1015
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:39,580
In general, we have what we call the Henneman size principle, where you recruit type one motor units

1016
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:47,100
first. And then as you as you require, based on the exercise, you recruit type two in addition

1017
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:52,380
to type one. So when you lift a heavy weight, you're getting to the type two is very quickly,

1018
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:59,100
because you need them. Whereas with lower weight, you probably are taking a little bit of time,

1019
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:02,460
but then you are eventually getting to those type two motor units.

1020
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:10,540
So if the person in my example fails at eight reps with 80 pounds and 40 reps with 40 pounds,

1021
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:19,420
it's just that the 40 reps took a lot longer to burn through the type one fibers and then the

1022
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:27,100
type two A's and the two A B's. And then finally at the very end, the two X failed. Whereas the

1023
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:33,500
when he did the same exercise, you know, 20 minutes later at 80 pounds and failed at eight reps,

1024
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:40,060
he just got he did the same sequence, but he just got to the two X much sooner. Is that

1025
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:46,780
what you're saying? Yeah. And I and the reason why I say that is if you look at if you pull out

1026
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:52,860
fibers following training, type one and type two fibers have both been shown to grow in both high

1027
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:59,340
load exercise as well as low load exercise with and without blood flow. So they both respond.

1028
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:06,140
Some people have suggested that type one might grow a little bit more with low low training,

1029
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:11,900
but I'm not I'm not convinced on that yet. I think that it's probably very similar to

1030
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:18,540
high load exercise, although I see the thinking, but but yeah, both of them will grow in response

1031
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:25,580
to both types of exercise in general at the extreme level is a bodybuilder's hypertrophy

1032
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:32,140
more explained by type one or type two fibers, or are they both massive relative to anybody else?

1033
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:40,780
Yeah, I would say probably the increase in both, although I don't I'm not there's not one thing I

1034
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:46,460
can point to that would suggest that for me. But I I think that

1035
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:53,900
in response to training, my guess is that both of them would increase.

1036
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:59,900
I think you might be able to make an argument that people who might again go back to our argument

1037
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:05,500
earlier, who start lifting weights and realize, man, I'm actually able to grow quite a bit.

1038
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:09,980
Maybe they already had, you know, more type two fibers to begin with, which is

1039
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:18,140
some think that is more responsive to to loading. So maybe you can make that argument. But I think

1040
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:23,900
in response to extra when a bodybuilder exercises, I would probably guess that both of them are going

1041
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:30,940
to grow both types of fibers. You mentioned very briefly passive BFR. What's the application for

1042
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:38,780
that? Is that in a highly injured person? Yeah, I. And again, there's only a small number of studies

1043
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:44,060
that have shown this. And that could be for a variety of reasons. One, it could be because

1044
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:50,140
those are hard to do, where you have somebody who had ACL surgery, and then we apply blood

1045
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:55,740
flow restriction to their limb. We inflate and then we deflate for a period of time a couple

1046
01:54:55,740 --> 01:55:00,460
times a day. And that's been shown to slow muscle loss. But there's only a few studies that have

1047
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:08,220
shown that now the again, you don't see growth. You only see a slowing attenuation of loss, which

1048
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:14,940
is a big, big deal when people undergo surgery. Now that that's my kind of I'm very interested

1049
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:20,060
in whether or not that's true. One of the things that gives me a little bit of pause

1050
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:27,420
is that there's not more of those studies. So in my mind, I always wonder, is that because

1051
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:33,180
those are again hard to do? Or is it because those studies do exist, but they didn't see

1052
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:42,540
anything? They didn't publish it. So I'm cautiously optimistic that that could be useful. But I do

1053
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:48,620
think that as soon as a person can exercise, you know, and we kind of published a paper on this

1054
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:54,300
idea a long time ago, kind of what we view as a progression of blood flow restriction. In other

1055
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:59,100
words, someone who wants to who can't do anything, how do we give them back to doing something?

1056
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:05,980
So we start off with if they can't even walk, we apply this restriction to slow down muscle loss.

1057
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:10,860
Once they can maybe walk on a treadmill or walk very slowly, but they can't lift weights,

1058
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:15,500
we start to transition them to that phase where they're able to increase muscle size

1059
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:18,940
and strength just a little bit, and if nothing else, maintain what they have.

1060
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:24,700
But then once they can transition to resistance exercise, I think that's where

1061
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:29,740
they're going to see the biggest bang for their buck, and then they can go to high

1062
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:37,100
level exercise if they choose. But I do feel like that's a very potential useful progression to this

1063
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:44,060
technique. I mean, this is such an important question. It's a real shame this isn't being studied.

1064
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:51,260
Like again, if I were Czar for a day and I was in charge of where research dollars would be spent,

1065
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:56,060
because I don't think it would take that much money, by the way, but I would

1066
01:56:56,060 --> 01:57:03,900
absolutely prioritize this question when you consider the extent of muscle loss that occurs

1067
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:08,780
in sedentary individuals following elective surgery, emergent surgery, and injuries.

1068
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:14,620
So those are three very big buckets of people, disproportionately, by the way, affected

1069
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:20,380
in the elderly, where the effects are devastating. I'm sure you're familiar with the literature of

1070
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:27,340
you take somebody in their seventh decade of life, and you train them very hard for a year,

1071
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:34,700
they'll put on expounds of muscle and then put them in a hospital bed for 10 days. They will lose

1072
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:40,300
all of it. They will lose every ounce that they spent a year diligently gaining to think that

1073
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:45,980
there could be a tool that could slow that. And we don't know the answer definitively,

1074
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:55,340
strikes me as just an unbelievable unwise decision that's been made. So I would hope somebody

1075
01:57:56,060 --> 01:58:01,020
who has the authority over where those dollars go is listening to this and realizing that the

1076
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:08,860
morbidity and mortality associated with muscle loss, especially in the elderly, is so significant.

1077
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:13,820
And one of the things we talk about a lot with our patients is, once you get to be 70 and certainly

1078
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:19,580
80 years old, you're kind of one fall away from the end of your life, even if you don't die

1079
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:24,460
directly. So there's the catastrophic fall where you hit your head, you have a cerebral

1080
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:31,740
hemorrhage, and you die. That's not the majority of them. The real fall you are away from the end

1081
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:39,820
of your life is the injury that basically never permits you to get back on your feet. Because

1082
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:45,580
even when you recover from the direct injury, maybe a broken hip, which is common, you never

1083
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:54,300
get back the strength and stamina you once had. And again, I just think BFR should be

1084
01:58:54,300 --> 01:59:01,180
explored much more in this population. That should be standard of care if indeed it is effective in

1085
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:07,980
both the passive and then the, as you described, the progression, right? So passive, low end aerobic,

1086
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:13,820
you know, low load resistance. And ultimately, if you can get back to high load resistance, great.

1087
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:22,060
Right. So if you had unlimited resources right now, what experiment would you want to do? What's

1088
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:27,820
the, what are the burning questions that if, you know, Francis Collins called you tomorrow and said,

1089
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:32,380
Jeremy, I've got this extra hundred million bucks. We just, we've got to get rid of it. What can you do?

1090
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:41,900
Huh? That's a good question. I think, you know, I would do something with blood flow restriction,

1091
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:49,100
of course. But, you know, if I had to, kind of my interest right now is related to trying to figure

1092
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:54,220
out why people get stronger. And I think I can always tie that back into, you know, blood flow

1093
01:59:54,220 --> 02:00:02,780
restriction and be able to, to, to do things of that sort. But I'm interested in what that means

1094
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:09,180
and what a change in strength from resistance training, what that means for overall function

1095
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:15,100
of a person. So when I get stronger with resistance training, does that actually carry over to

1096
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:20,780
improvements in my walking ability and things of that sort? So those are some things that I'm

1097
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:26,300
interested in. With blood flow restriction, I'd obviously do kind of what you just stated. I'd

1098
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:32,460
have to, you know, probably connect with our med school in order to do a study like that. But I

1099
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:39,900
would be interested in the application of blood flow restriction by itself. I think that that

1100
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:44,060
is something that I've been interested in for a long time. Again, I think it'd have to be not

1101
02:00:44,060 --> 02:00:48,300
something we could do right out of my lab. We'd have to work with a hospital, of course,

1102
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:53,740
but I'd be interested in that. And I'd be interested in doing it on a large scale

1103
02:00:56,060 --> 02:01:02,300
because all of those studies that currently exist are extremely small sample size. So for, of course,

1104
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:08,620
for a variety of reasons, but I'd want to see it. I want, I'd want to start answering a lot of these

1105
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:14,460
questions with large sample sizes. That would be kind of my dream studies, you know, whatever it

1106
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:23,260
would be, whether it's strength, whether it's this, bigger studies, longer studies. And I think that

1107
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:30,860
a hundred million dollars I could do a lot for sure. Well, amazingly, that's a fraction of a penny

1108
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:35,180
compared to the amount of research that goes into the fact the fraction of dollars that goes into

1109
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:39,980
biomedical research, but that's not necessarily always allocated wisely. Nevertheless, this has

1110
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:43,260
been, this has been a super interesting discussion. Again, you can tell personally, I just want to

1111
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:49,100
understand this for myself, for my patients. And ultimately I think this is a very important topic

1112
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:54,060
for, for anybody who's interested in any aspect of that continuum we discussed. So Jeremy, thank

1113
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:59,100
you very much. And I'm really so glad that Lane connected us. I'm sorry. I didn't have a little

1114
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:03,900
extra alcohol. I know Lane mentioned you always like to have a drink when we start a talk and I

1115
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:08,140
should have thought to have sent out a nice bottle of tequila for you. Or is it Scotch? What

1116
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:14,140
did Lane say is your favorite? It's Scotch, 100%. So, you know, I'll forgive you. You know, maybe we

1117
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:20,780
can do it again and we can maybe have scotch next time. Perfect. A single malt, I assume. Of course.

1118
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:26,380
Yeah. Do you add, do you drink it neat or do you add like the one spoon of water to it?

1119
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:32,620
I drink it neat generally. Okay. I have a friend from residency. So I don't, I'm personally not a

1120
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:40,460
huge Scotch guy. I love tequila and Japanese whiskey. But I love talking to people who love,

1121
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:46,620
who love scotch and can walk me through the ins and outs of it. But this friend of mine,

1122
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:53,340
obviously a single malt guy, would import water from Scotland from a very specific lake. And

1123
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:57,740
he explained to me why you could, the scotch would get a little better and it would open up a little

1124
02:02:57,820 --> 02:03:03,260
bit more and be a little less anesthetizing to the tongue. If you would add just this one spoon

1125
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:11,500
of lukewarm water to it. I don't remember the exact reason, but it somehow had to do with

1126
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:18,140
diluting it just a little bit to prevent some of the anesthetic effect. But you're a neat guy,

1127
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:24,860
which I like tequila neat and Japanese whiskey neat as well. So I can, yeah, I'm not quite on

1128
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:32,620
that level of drinking where I'm importing specific water, but I do appreciate a good drink

1129
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:36,300
for sure. I find it interesting, by the way, you know, on the topic of sort of genetics,

1130
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:43,100
I really do think people just genetically can like the taste of scotch or not. And I don't possess

1131
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:49,900
the gene, I think, because I've, I've sampled very fancy scotches and I've never found it palatable.

1132
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:56,540
But I don't doubt for a moment that you or someone who does finds just as much enjoyment in the

1133
02:03:56,540 --> 02:04:01,340
actual taste of it that I would, for example, in some of these other things I like. It's interesting

1134
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:08,380
because my students make fun of me for this, but I can't, I can't drink beer unless it's like a

1135
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:16,220
fruity type of beer. So they obviously mock me for that. But I can't drink beer, but I can drink

1136
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:22,220
hard liquor for sure all day. But the beer stuff I can't do unless it tastes like

1137
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:29,260
apple pie or something else. Then I'm all about, I'm on board, but just standard beer can't do it.

1138
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:35,500
I'm with you. I think standard beer is about on par with urine in terms of palatability. So

1139
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:41,340
I've never understood how Budweiser stays in business, but yeah, I can't do really any of that.

1140
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:46,220
All right, gentlemen. Well, thanks so much. This was a super interesting discussion. I

1141
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:48,620
really appreciate it. Thanks for having me on through there.

1142
02:04:50,380 --> 02:04:54,460
