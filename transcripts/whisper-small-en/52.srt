00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,600
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is my good friend, Dr. Ethan

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,760
Weiss. Ethan and I have known each other for a few years. We both sit on the advisory board of a

47
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,120
company called Virta Health, and we've always found ourselves sitting around the table at these

48
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,720
meetings or elsewhere, just having super nerdy discussions. And we just decided we got to at

49
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,160
least put some of these discussions on the podcast. So what follows is a really deep and for me

50
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,760
certainly interesting discussion about two topics that at the surface seem completely unrelated,

51
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,800
cardiovascular disease and the role of growth hormone and IGF in disease. Now, it won't be

52
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,280
clear from what I just said why one guy would be an expert on both of those things, but as the story

53
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,480
unfolds, you'll see that Ethan is quite a unique individual. By training, he's a cardiologist. He

54
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,200
specializes in preventative cardiology at UCSF, trained at Hopkins in both medical school and in

55
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,440
his residency and then completed his fellowship at UCSF where he has since remained. And his interests

56
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,200
are wide ranging from prevention in all aspects of it, which includes lipids and the management

57
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,440
of blood pressure and the endocrine system, et cetera. But what I found most interesting in this

58
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,440
discussion, in addition to just the master's class in understanding everything from acute coronary

59
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:37,160
syndrome to all of the complex nuances around stent placement, which is something that I think

60
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,200
anybody listening to this knows at least somebody who's had a stent placed and to sort of go through

61
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,160
all of that literature in detail and understand who are the ideal candidates versus who is not.

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,800
All of that, I don't want to say paled in comparison because I would minimize it, but

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,000
it was nothing compared to at least for me diving into what led him to pursue this field of

64
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,120
endocrinology and specifically what he found with respect to growth hormone and IGF. And this is

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,280
something I only knew about Ethan maybe six to nine months ago. It was really quite recent that

66
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,440
this came onto my radar about his level of expertise in this. And so we just spent a great

67
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,200
deal of time talking about this and you could almost think of this as two separate podcasts,

68
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,640
one that really deals with cardiovascular disease, specifically interventional radiology

69
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,480
and diagnostic techniques. We talk extensively about calcium scores and CT angiograms and things

70
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,400
like that that we get asked about all the time. And then there's basically a second podcast here,

71
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,880
which is a really interesting discussion around growth hormone, its effect on the liver,

72
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,160
the brain, et cetera. Finally, we touch really briefly at the end on a company that Ethan has

73
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,120
started quite recently called Keto or Key2, depending on how you pronounce it, which is a

74
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,400
breath analyzer for acetone. So again, nothing that novel there, but what is novel is the way

75
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,280
this device works and socially kind of provides feedback and allows you to get great feedback

76
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,880
when you're fasting or on a ketogenic diet or something like that. So I hope you enjoy this

77
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,640
podcast. This is one of those ones where the show notes are really going to be helpful, especially

78
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,080
for people who actually want to go back and look through all of the literature in all the clinical

79
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,720
trials we talk about and even just some of the diagrams, frankly, to even understand when we're

80
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,040
talking about EKG changes and things like that. Sometimes the diagrams help. So without further

81
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,480
delay, please welcome my guest, Dr. Ethan Weiss. Ethan, thanks so much for making time today.

82
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,560
Thank you, Peter. Thanks for coming over, Randy San Francisco. I can't believe this is the first

83
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,240
time I've been to your office, which I must say, anyone who knows me knows how much I love white

84
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,000
boards, but the glass white board is just next level stuff. We got a little bit of flack when we

85
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,160
picked these out. The architects, this is actually super fancy Italian glass and the architects sort

86
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,520
of convinced us you'll really appreciate it. And I love it. Actually, my kids love it too. They've

87
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,160
daked out their own territory on this. I actually like that the kids have their drawings adjacent

88
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,720
to the drawing of mTOR. Yeah. Perfect. I think you should always be able to mix those. The other

89
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,040
thing that I don't know, I guess it's because I've never been to your office that I don't know how

90
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,680
we have never discussed is our mutual appreciation for Wayne Gretzky. You have in front of me

91
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:25,480
a home Jersey circa 1986, Edmund Tenoylers signed by none other than the great one.

92
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,120
Yeah. Look, I grew up in Baltimore, which was not really a hotbed of hockey. I think they were the

93
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,600
skip Jack, my early hockey team, triple-a team, I guess. I don't know if they call him that in

94
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,000
hockey. Anyway, we had the skip Jacks and the Clippers and I never really was too into hockey.

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,960
I was a baseball fan and a football fan, but my dad had grown up in Chicago and really did like

96
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,000
hockey. And one year we were back there visiting my grandparents for Christmas. I think it was the

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,560
winter of 1979. He said, let's go to a Black Hawks game. So we went to the old Chicago stadium.

98
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,160
It was my first introduction to this game that, you know, I basically fell in love with

99
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,800
instantly. And at that time in the late seventies, early eighties, it was, you know, the birth of

100
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,640
these dynasties, I think first the Islanders and then they had been to the Oilers and

101
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,800
you couldn't be a sports fan, but you couldn't be a hockey fan and not appreciate Gretzky. So I

102
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,760
eventually developed into being like Washington capitalist fan, which was sheer torture until last

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,640
June, which was super fun. But in the process of being a fan, of course, I always remained true to

104
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,600
Gretzky. Anyway, a couple of years ago, my mom said, Hey, look, I'm coming to California. We're

105
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,280
going to go to LA. My uncle, my brother, my uncle is an oncologist down there. He's being honored by

106
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,600
the sarcoma foundation. I said, sure, it's an hour flood. I can hop on. I'll come down. I'll join

107
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,960
you. So we go to one of these LA galas and there's like a big series of tables with, with a bunch of

108
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,560
silent auction items. And I walked by this Jersey a couple of times and on the third or fourth time

109
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,080
I walked by the guy who was manning the table, stopped me and he said, Hey, you know, buddy,

110
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,400
I see you walked by that a few times. You have any interest in it? I said, yeah, I've got interest

111
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,120
in it, but there's, I can't, I can't afford that. And he said, no, listen, I'm pretty sure if you

112
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,000
bid the minimum, you'll get it. And the minimum, minimum bid was a hundred dollars. And I said,

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,240
you gotta be kidding me. Gretzky played here in LA and how can that's impossible? It's a signed

114
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,120
Jersey. It's beautiful. The frame alone is worth more than a hundred dollars. So he finally convinced

115
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,040
me to do it. I put down the bid and I walked out with this Jersey, which my wife instantly told me

116
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,080
she loved, but she loved it anywhere but our home. So I brought it here. And it's,

117
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,720
it's awesome as a conversation starter when people come visit. What I immediately loved about it was

118
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:42,760
when I was 10, so 1983. So just as the, it was kind of the year that the Oilers lost their first

119
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:49,640
Stanley cup to the Islanders who were winning their fourth. And I wanted that Jersey for my birthday.

120
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,960
And I got that Jersey. It took a lot because the Jersey cost $50. And I just asked my mom if I could

121
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:05,480
ask all the kids at my birthday for money instead of gifts. And I remember everyone showed up with

122
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,840
five to $10 and it added up to 50. And we went, I still remember it. Like it's really one of those

123
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,600
amazing early memories to go and be able to buy it. And I was really torn between the home and the

124
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,720
away Jersey. I went with the home Jersey, which is the one you have. And it was so big. Like I just

125
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,200
couldn't, you know, I just wanted to make sure I never grew out of it. And I probably wore it

126
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,840
for like every day for three years. The sad thing is I don't have it anymore. I, I, it really bums

127
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,960
me out that it somehow got lost because it would be such a cool thing to show my kids and have them

128
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,920
roll their eyes at one day. That one's amazing. So wait, you grew up in Toronto. Yeah. And you were

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,680
in a leather stand. I was. I mean, the Leafs were not Toronto, such a great hockey town that, you know,

130
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:55,080
going to games was, I mean, just the greatest highlight of my life. And I even got to see a

131
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,000
few oiler games, you know, always in the cheapest seats in the house. Maple Leaf Gardens had, you

132
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,640
know, sort of this color system. So the gray is up at the very top is where I usually sat. But back

133
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,760
then it was so unsophisticated that if the game was a blowout by the third period, you could sneak

134
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,560
down into the golds and you could, you know, be like right there. You know, I actually had dinner

135
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,000
with Mark Messier a few months ago, who I just met. And he's just the most amazing guy. And we,

136
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,640
I mean, I'm sure he's so tired of doing that, but we just rehashed all of the oiler glory days. And

137
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,680
you know, it's sort of hard to believe that you could have Gretzky Messier, Curry,

138
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,880
coffee, Kevin Lowe, Grant Fuhrer, all on the ice at one point in time. It was hard to believe before

139
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,440
I went to Edmonton, but I took my daughter four years ago now to go to the Women's World Cup. And

140
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,800
we went, we decided to go to Edmonton for some reason. I can't remember. It was just like the

141
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,440
best chance of seeing the American women's team play. So we spent three days in Edmonton in July

142
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,120
and we walked by the old whatever it was. I think they built a new one. In any case, I thought,

143
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,080
wow, it was pretty amazing that these guys would all be here. But then you see Edmonton and you

144
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,640
think, oh my God, like I cannot believe they kept them here as long as they did. It's really

145
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,720
remarkably, I don't want to be harsh about Edmonton. I mean, I'm sure there are great things

146
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,200
about it, but it's not glamorous. It's certainly not like LA.

147
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,520
Yeah. It's not like that was the New York Rangers.

148
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:12,840
No.

149
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,160
Yeah.

150
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,640
No.

151
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,600
Or even Vancouver.

152
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,080
Or Toronto.

153
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,480
Or Toronto.

154
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,040
Or Montreal.

155
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,520
Yeah.

156
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,160
Yeah. We share something in common, which I guess is this Hopkins thing. You were a few years

157
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,360
ahead of me. So you did med school and residency there, didn't you?

158
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,720
I tell people I kind of grew up in the hospital. I wasn't born in Baltimore, but my dad moved.

159
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,040
So I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where my dad had done his internship. And like a lot of

160
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:41,240
people at that time of his age, in an effort to avoid going to Vietnam, he picked up from

161
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,200
Ann Arbor and moved to Bethesda where he worked at the NIH for a few years. It's actually a pretty

162
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,480
funny side story, which is I didn't really understand what my dad was doing. I was young.

163
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,560
I was only two. And I found a bunch of marijuana cultivation books in his office when I was a kid.

164
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,040
And I said, dad, is there something I don't know about you? Because you don't strike me as the kind

165
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,520
of person who would be, he said, no, this is what I was working on in the lab. We were working on

166
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,040
marijuana. He was working in Julie Axelrod's lab. So we ended up living in Bethesda for a couple

167
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,280
of years. And eventually he finished and he went back to, he went to Baltimore where he finished

168
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,400
his residency and then did his fellowship and joined the faculty at Hopkins in cardiology.

169
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,560
And he had remains on the faculty there has been there, you know, been on the faculty for over,

170
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,280
over 40 years. So I grew up going to the hospital as a kid to visit my dad at work. And then

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,800
my very first summer job was to work in that hospital. So it was sort of a second home for

172
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,440
me. And then I went away to college and came back and I did medical school there

173
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,800
and stayed around for residency and then moved to San Francisco in 1998, 20, 21 years ago.

174
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,880
Did you always want to do medicine? No, never. Uh-uh. It was a combination of sort of, I think,

175
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,560
not really wanting to do exactly what my dad had done, but also not having the aptitude for it.

176
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,720
And I was a pretty bad, I was a very average student in high school, but particularly an

177
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,520
average or mediocre science student. And so I went off to college, I went to Vassar, which is a

178
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,240
liberal arts school and intended to study music. Actually, I really kind of was going to study

179
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:10,600
music and realized I didn't have the talent to do that either. And just sort of on a whim decided

180
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,160
to take a science course. And it was a, one of these sort of freak accidents that I happened to

181
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,920
be in a place where science was friendly and presented in a way that was appetizing to me.

182
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,320
And non-threatening. And I think if I'd gone to a place like Harvard, there's no way in the world

183
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,080
I'd be sitting here right now doing what I'm doing. So I really enjoyed science at that stage in life.

184
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,200
And eventually when I figured I wasn't going to be able to do music, I said, you know, maybe I can

185
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,360
go off and do medicine, but I'll do something very different. I had no intention of doing science. I

186
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,760
had less than the bare minimum science requirements for medical school. So when I got to Hopkins in

187
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,160
the fall of 1991, I was probably one of 10 non-hard science majors. And at that time, there were

188
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,080
as many biochemistry majors as there were biology majors. It was really unusual to have

189
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,040
us humanities people. And we were ranked in the class, you know, one to 120. And we all ended up

190
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,920
in the bottom. We were 110, 111 through 120 and struggled mightily with science, especially with

191
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,000
the first year. It was tough. It was a tough sledding for me. I can't imagine what Hopkins was

192
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,160
like then. So I'm obviously a few years behind you. And I got into Hopkins for medical school in 96

193
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,400
or 97. I would have matriculated in 97. I remember even at the time you'd now interviewed

194
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,800
at a bunch of schools. So you sort of saw the way it was here versus there. And I was like, wow,

195
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,840
this place is going to be rough sledding. I mean, it still had letter grades when most schools had

196
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,760
gone to pass fail or high pass pass fail. And you just got the sense like this place was,

197
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,440
if it didn't kill you, it would make you stronger. But there was a non-trivial chance it would kill

198
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,760
you. It was interesting because of course, you know, from the outside you have people come,

199
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,000
I was a student member on the admissions committee. And so you got to hear firsthand what people would

200
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,320
think. And there was this story that you probably heard, because this is probably around the same

201
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,480
time when I was doing it, that Hopkins was this like super intense pressure cooker and everybody

202
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,880
was a gunner and you'd never survive. And it was just a miserable place to be a student. It was

203
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,040
actually a beautiful place to be a student. And my fellow classmates were really supportive.

204
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,000
Everybody was just an incredibly strong achiever on their own. They didn't care how I did. They

205
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,360
just wanted to do the best for them. So it was really inspirational. I think after I got over

206
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,640
the shock of not being able to keep up, because really the disparity information was tremendous.

207
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,120
Right. I had had one semester of biology and I'm hanging out with guys who, you know, had been

208
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,720
working in a lab since they were seven and understood things that like I still today don't

209
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,960
understand. And I mean, it was guys like David Sabatini and Dave Brett and, you know, my high

210
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,680
school classmate, Andy Cameron, I mean, a bunch of people who were, you know, just so far ahead of me

211
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,600
and where, where I'd ever be. It was a fun place to be once I got over the idea, like, Hey, look,

212
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,280
I was used to being a pretty good student. And by definition, most of us probably came in here

213
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,400
because we were at or near the top of our class. And it ain't gonna happen that way now. Right.

214
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,760
There are 120 of us and not all 120 of us can get an A. And once I got over that and kind of

215
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,240
decided that I was okay with not having all A's unless I wanted to die, it was great.

216
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,320
I think I forgot that you were in the same class as David, which of course would put you in the

217
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,080
same class as Andy Cameron. And there's an obviously interesting story there is Andy

218
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,640
Cameron being the son of John Cameron, who was the chairman of surgery. And one of the main reasons

219
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,600
I ultimately did go to Hopkins for my residency, his father, of course, being a luminary in the

220
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,520
field. And of course, David Sapatini is no stranger to anybody listening to this. So yeah,

221
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,040
it was sort of like, I guess going to med school at Hopkins in that era was like playing for the

222
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,520
Yankees. In the end, I agree with you after I interviewed there and I made a point to stay an

223
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,920
extra two days, I came away way more bullish on the idea that it would, it could be a great

224
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,560
experience. And in the end, it really came down to, I wouldn't say a coin toss. I mean, I think in

225
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,640
the end Stanford won out for a number of reasons. I don't think it was as good a medical school as

226
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,280
Hopkins, at least not according to the rankings. Hopkins was the best, but I think just living in

227
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,080
California as a kid coming from Toronto seemed like a great opportunity. Well, and I did it the

228
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,320
opposite way. I mean, I knew I had to get out after having been there for seven years and having

229
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,920
grown up in that environment. And you know, my dad being there made things complicated. So I

230
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,440
knew I had to leave. And it's funny because when I got here, lifestyle is much more central to

231
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,080
people here in California. And I didn't appreciate that. And you know, of course now I do,

232
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,800
but I wouldn't trade that experience. It was an amazing experience and all those people. I mean,

233
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,480
I remember operating, I did as a medical student, I did GI gold. That was back when Cameron Yeo,

234
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,960
and when was Kurt Campbell, the other attending on at that time? No, he, I think he was a chief

235
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,280
resident. I'm pretty sure he was. Oh wow. Yeah. So why I spent a lot of time in the operating room

236
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,880
with Dr. Cameron and wow. I mean, what an entertaining human being and you know, master

237
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,520
surgeon. I don't know, were they still doing Sunday school when you were there? Oh yes. In fact,

238
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,360
Ted Schafer and I did an interview a while ago where we talked about our fondness for Sunday

239
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,920
school. It was one of the highlights of internship. It was incredible. As a student, you were

240
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,960
terrified because you knew they told you, you know, residents would tell you they're like,

241
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,560
you're going to go in there. You're going to present a case. You'll get through seven words,

242
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,240
maybe if you're lucky and he's going to cut you off and then he's going to start asking you

243
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,280
questions. So I mean, this is Sunday morning sitting around this huge boardroom table and

244
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,840
you're a little puny medical student in front of, you know, the entire surgical house staff and

245
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,480
a lot of them and the most famous surgeon in the United States. Yeah. But of course,

246
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,080
he had a wonderful way of not humiliating people. I mean, he was rough, but it was an amazing

247
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,000
experience. I, it was really one of my favorite things that I remember about being a medical

248
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,240
student back there. I have nothing but fond memories from my time there, despite the challenges.

249
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,480
Now, what was a medicine residency like in the nineties? It still must have been pretty freaking

250
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,440
rough, especially at Hopkins. So I was an intern in 1996. I think it was the first year they switched

251
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,480
from Q3 to Q4 call. And it had been not that long since they switched from Q2 to Q3, but there

252
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,240
were still a few rotations where you did every other night call. So as an intern in the medical

253
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,280
ICU and the CCU, we did every other night call. And that that's a, again, it's one of these things

254
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,040
that you look back on and you think, I don't know how I survived it, but in retrospect,

255
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,120
it was really fun. But I mean, just imagine what you're doing. You're going in, you start rounds

256
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,760
at whatever eight o'clock in the morning, you go all day. At that time you never left the unit. So

257
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,560
people would bring you food. There was a bathroom and a call room adjacent to the unit. You never

258
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,520
left the unit. And then you'd stay up all night, taking care of patients. You'd get to rounds the

259
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,840
next day, you'd finish by 11 o'clock. And we had this tradition of going out to have breakfast and

260
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,520
beer with the ICU nurses. And then you'd go home, you'd take a little nap, you wake up, you'd have

261
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,400
some dinner, you'd go back to sleep, you do the whole thing all over again. So for 30 straight

262
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,040
days, you basically did nothing but sleep or be in the hospital. But it was fun. It was an

263
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,720
incredible experience. I mean, there was still a lot of active HIV disease. And one of my favorite

264
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,720
inpatient rotations was doing what they used to call the OSA rate rotation, which is the inpatient

265
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,240
HIV ward. And I mean, you did that as a junior resident with two other junior residents and

266
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,240
there was no one else around. And it's basically ICU level care. I mean, these were some of the

267
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,880
sickest people in the world. This is pre-protease inhibitors. So sick, sick, sick people,

268
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,600
but amazing. I mean, I remember doing procedures on people who are still my dear friends,

269
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,760
fellow residents, really an amazing experience. So how did you pick cardiology?

270
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,080
Well, again, so the background is I'm a second generation cardiologist. So my intention was to

271
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,760
avoid it for a lot of reasons, but I also just wasn't really drawn to it. But actually, I did a

272
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,920
CCU rotation as a medical student. And I'll never forget, we had a series of people, patients come in

273
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,480
who were kind of in their late thirties, early forties who had myocardial infarction,

274
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,280
had a heart attack and had relatively absent any obvious risk factors. So our assessment of risk

275
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,960
factors for coronary disease hasn't changed a lot in the past 20, 25 years. But what I'm saying is

276
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,240
that they had normal lipids, normal blood pressure, nothing identifiable. And I thought, wow, this is

277
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,160
really kind of fascinating. So I worked the summer between first and second year, I worked in a lab,

278
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,560
I worked in a neurosciences lab, I was working on the genetics of trinucleotide repeat diseases,

279
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,120
and so it hadn't been proven yet. But there was a strong suspicion that some of these psychiatric

280
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:23,080
diseases like schizophrenia and bipolar depression were mediated by trinucleotide repeats. And it was

281
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,240
my first time in a lab and I loved it. So I knew I wanted to go back and do that. I ended up

282
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,760
basically asking a bunch of people, I said, you know, is anybody here doing work on the pathogenesis

283
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,320
of, it wasn't called ACS or key coronary syndrome back then, but the pathogenesis of unstable

284
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,920
angina or MI and young people without risk factors. So I got pointed to this guy who was a young,

285
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,480
at that time, assistant professor, Belgian guy, who went on later to be the dean of the medical

286
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,120
school at the University of Miami. And he had a illustrious academic career. His name is Pascal

287
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,760
Goldschmidt. And so I met with Pascal and I said, Pascal, I'd love to come spend a year working in

288
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,000
your lab. And he said, great. So that sort of was my next introduction to science. And it was really

289
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,280
that experience, which was phenomenal and career defining for me that drove my clinical interest

290
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,120
more than the other way around. So I kind of at that point had thought, well, this is kind of fun,

291
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,440
but maybe I'll do adult cardiology or maybe I'll do pediatric cardiology. And I'm not entirely

292
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,440
convinced that I know the answer yet, but ended up eventually deciding that I didn't like parents.

293
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,760
And so I went down the path of doing adult cardiology. I want to touch on all the stuff

294
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,800
you just brought up because you and I have had so many discussions about this over the past couple

295
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,720
of years. And I've always found you to be one of the most lucid people at describing these

296
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,760
distinctions and sort of synthesizing this. And for someone like me, who is not really on the

297
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:51,000
front lines of acute cardiology problems, it can be an overwhelming body of literature. So let's

298
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,040
just start with some of the semantics, acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, stable

299
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,640
angina. How would you define all these terms for folks? And what's the framework in which

300
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,240
you anchor these things? This is what's amazing is if you go back in time, it was relatively recent

301
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,520
in history that there was a debate about the cause of most myocardial infarctions. 99% of

302
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,760
heart attacks in this country happened because of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. So,

303
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,880
and that's worth even pausing on for a moment because I don't even think that most people

304
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,600
realize that. I think most people think that a heart attack occurs when the pipe narrows,

305
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,360
narrows, narrows, narrows, and finally closes so that when you hear about so and so who has a

306
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:39,160
95% occlusion in the artery on the angiogram, my God, that's just 5% away from killing them.

307
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,160
And they sort of don't understand what I think you just said. So can you double click on that point?

308
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Yeah. Well, this is what's so amazing is that if you go back not that far in the literature,

309
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,760
you'll find articles where people are having a debate about whether the, so they did autopsies

310
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,080
on people who presented with sudden cardiac death. Somebody would show up dead from a heart attack.

311
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,480
They do an autopsy. They'd open up the heart, open up the artery, and they'd find a clot there. And

312
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,840
there was a debate about whether that clot was primary or secondary. Was it there before or

313
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,400
after the person died? Was it the basis? And it really was the work of Michael Davies in the late

314
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:15,400
1970s and early 1980s that kind of demonstrated, proved the idea that this was actually causal.

315
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,480
And then early 1980s, I think it was, I can't remember the exact trial, they went in and

316
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,760
actually aspirated out clots and people who showed up in the emergency department with a heart attack.

317
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,800
And those people got better. So this was pre-angioplasty, but they were able to aspirate out

318
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,840
the clot using a suction catheter and people got better. And so that was the first demonstration

319
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,400
that this clot event was the primary cause of most heart attacks. So again, the pathologist leading

320
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,240
the discussion on how that happened and what you could see in anybody was you'd see a lot of these

321
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,640
plaques. And Davies described, I think, I can't remember which paper it was, I'll have to go back

322
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,800
and find it for you. But he described something that stuck with me, which was that if you look

323
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,040
at an autopsy, somebody who presents with a heart attack and dies, you'll find you can tell by

324
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,600
looking at the histology how many times the plaque is actually ruptured, much like you'd look at the

325
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,000
age of a tree. So you can see that there's plaque rupture and then there's healing. And actually

326
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,680
now other pathologists like Reno Verami and others have said that a lot of the progression

327
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,600
of coronary disease, so getting narrower and narrower is probably that event happening

328
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,000
sequentially. So plaque rupture, healing, and then as you do that, you're laying down more

329
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,520
fibrous tissue. So he could see how many times, and on average, these people in that first series

330
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,760
had had seven plaque ruptures in their culprit artery before they died.

331
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,160
At the same point in the artery or along different points?

332
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,200
In the same plaque. So in the same plaque. And so that told-

333
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,800
So basically a seven ringed tree. On the cover of Starry's pathology book, which is,

334
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,560
I've talked about this before, it's sort of one of the most important books I have to explain

335
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,040
atherosclerosis to patients. There's actually a picture on the cover that shows a very comparable

336
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,480
lesion to that, which is just these concentric rings where the final one, you have this big,

337
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,600
dark, bloody clot in there, which was obviously the fatal one.

338
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,200
That was what lit the fire for me scientifically back when I went to Pascal. I was struck with

339
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,280
this idea, well, gosh, if it, like, why didn't somebody die at the first one? Why don't they

340
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,720
die after the first one? Like if the reaction is, so just for listeners, the contents of that plaque,

341
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,840
what we're calling this atherosclerotic plaque, it's rich with lipids and inflammatory cells,

342
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,720
but the thing that causes the heart attack is none of that stuff. It's that the macrophages,

343
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,200
which are these white blood cells, carry around this protein called tissue factor,

344
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,400
which is then basically the instigator or the trigger for the clotting cascade.

345
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,960
What you're doing is exposing blood, flowing blood to tissue factor, which is basically a,

346
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,600
you know, a wound healing signal. So if you cut yourself, we have tissue factor underneath

347
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,080
the anathelium, which is that interlying of our blood vessel, and that's there to sense injury.

348
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,640
And when the blood sees tissue factor, the blood, there's a biochemical reaction that

349
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,560
we've been described for decades that ends up resulting in a blood clot.

350
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,240
It's sort of an epoxy, you know, those epoxies that come in two separate tubes,

351
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,960
taken alone, they're not sticky, but when the tube combines them, it becomes like rock solid

352
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,080
glue. So the macrophage exposes the tissue factor. Now the blood passing through becomes the other

353
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,280
tube of the epoxy and boom, you get this acute brick. I've been describing it as substrate and

354
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,560
trigger, but I think that's a much better, I like your description. So, and that was again, a debate

355
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,000
not that long ago about what, what the cause of these things was eventually within a 10 year

356
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
period. We learned so much because it was, I think 1988 that ISIS two was published and ISIS

357
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,480
two was the, this is off the top of my head, but I think it was a comparison of aspirin and

358
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,040
streptokinase versus aspirin alone in patients who presented with heart attack.

359
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
You know, it tell folks what streptokinase does.

360
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:48,360
Streptokinase is a, what's called a thrombolytic. So streptokinase is a natural substance that we

361
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,720
make or we make something similar that dissolves clots. So clotting is sort of this balance, this,

362
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,680
this battle between pro forces and anti-forces because if you think about it, if you're a

363
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,240
mammal and you have a circulatory system, you have to be able to sense injury so you can keep

364
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,440
your blood from flowing out of you. So the system has to be incredibly tuned and you as an engineer

365
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,520
will appreciate how you must be able to respond incredibly quickly, but it has to be specific.

366
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,760
So you can't get clots happening. We all know what happens.

367
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,720
That's such a great point to make, right? So let's go back and think about this with the lens of

368
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,640
evolution. You get a scratch across you as bad as that scratch or cut is, it still represents

369
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,720
a fraction of the surface area of your vascular system. So to your point, you have to have a

370
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,800
system in place that can identify the area that needs to be fixed. Hence the two check system

371
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,920
where I have to have the tissue factor, which allows for the local aggregation. And then very

372
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,640
quickly you have to respond. And yeah, if it was just a diffuse response, well, you'd kill the

373
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,720
organism by clotting everything within the circulatory system. Well, that's right. And we

374
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,840
really appreciated that through human genetics and then later mouse genetics. So if you knock out

375
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,160
any of the pro-coagulant coagulation factors, say, you know, any of the one, you know, factor two

376
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,120
prothrombin, you'll get a sick mouse, but the mouse will survive through development. So they will,

377
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,440
they will survive. And then what kills them is the process of being born. So they'll die right after

378
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,360
birth. If you knock out one of the anticoagulants and knock out, say protein C protein S, any of the

379
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,560
anticoagulant, the mouse won't make it through half of the embryonic, basically day seven or day eight,

380
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,880
they die. And then there's the whole other interesting layer, which we won't have time to

381
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,920
get into today, which is the role of the placenta and how placentas don't clot off. And there's just

382
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,520
unbelievable fascinating evolutionary biology that we can send to power. Unless someone has

383
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,960
help syndrome, that becomes this awful exception to that rule where you get these infarcted,

384
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,720
clotted placentas and then the fetus is usually underdeveloped. So... Well, I'm not an expert,

385
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,520
but I think that one of the most common causes of fetal loss of idiopathic fetal loss, so women

386
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,880
who end up losing multiple pregnancies again and again and again, is an undiagnosed hypercoagulable

387
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,240
state, I think, because basically the placenta ends up clotting off.

388
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah. You're saying in the case where you don't have an obvious aneuploidy that or a

389
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,200
chromosomal abnormality, you know? So is it easier to talk about where we were 10 years ago,

390
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,320
where we are today, or do you want to just define today? So you've talked about what

391
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,760
a myocardial infarction is.

392
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,360
Yeah, we got sidetracked. So...

393
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,640
Yeah, that's what I do here. I sidetracked.

394
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,280
That's all right. That's fun. So myocardial infarction was defined clinically as most things

395
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,640
were and not pathophysiologically until recently. It was defined by the constellation of things that

396
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,960
still, I think, make up most of the definition, which is chest pain changes in the electrocardiogram

397
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,640
and presence of biomarkers.

398
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,400
Let's explain what those three things are. So everybody understands what chest pain is.

399
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,480
You have these classic symptoms that people understand. Elephants sitting on chest,

400
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,680
radiating into left arm, nausea, that sort of stuff up into the neck. You mentioned the

401
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,720
changes in the electrocardiogram. We'll obviously link to photos of this sort of stuff, but it's

402
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,360
hard to do this because we're going to try to do it for the listener. But every time the heart beats,

403
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,040
there's a signature that can be measured electronically when you put leads on the

404
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,080
chest. And you have a little wave that symbolizes when the atrium is doing its contraction. That's

405
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,800
called the P wave. Then you have the big signal, which is this QRS spike, and that's this ventricular

406
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,440
contraction. And then you have another little wave called the T wave. And I can't even remember. Is

407
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,400
that the repolarization?

408
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,880
That's the repolarization.

409
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:17,960
Yeah.

410
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,840
Ventricular repolarization.

411
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,200
Ventricular repolarization. And then it goes again. So what are the signs on that that you

412
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,320
are looking at when you're in the ER and somebody comes in to help you decide if this person is

413
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,440
having a heart attack or maybe even has had one in the past?

414
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,600
Yeah. It's important that we cover this now because actually,

415
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,120
after it was agreed upon that a ruptured plaque led to a clot, the clot led to basically the

416
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,840
absence of any blood flow distal to that clot. So beyond the clot, so then any tissue beyond

417
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,640
that blockage would then be starved of oxygen. And after some period of time, a few minutes,

418
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,440
five minutes would die. And it wasn't that long ago that the treatment of MI, of heart attack,

419
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,520
was to put somebody in bed. And then there was the advent of beta blockers, a couple other blood

420
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,320
pressure medicines, which were basically pharmacological bed rest, and then aspirin,

421
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,480
and then streptokinase, which we talked about, which is basically a clot dissolving medicine.

422
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,520
That trial demonstrated that if you dissolve the clot pharmacologically, you could rescue people.

423
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,280
And then we got into actually going and doing these things with balloons and later with stents.

424
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,080
But the nomenclature at the time that I was a medical student was you defined myocardial infarction,

425
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,000
so MI, by the presence or absence of the Q wave. So you mentioned on the EKG,

426
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,320
there was this big deflection that happens early on, and that represents depolarization

427
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,680
of the ventricles. So the biggest largest mass in the heart is your left ventricle. So that's the

428
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:45,640
pumping chamber that pumps blood out to the body. And that has a very strong electrical signal.

429
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,840
And if in certain areas, regions on the EKG, so we do 12 leads and it creates a vector,

430
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,320
and we can basically recreate the heart in three dimensions. And so you're doing that by putting

431
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,680
these leads, these electrodes across the chest and on the arms and the legs. And if after somebody

432
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:09,800
had a heart attack, they developed a Q wave in certain leads that signaled to us clinicians

433
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,520
that they had what we at that time called a Q wave myocardial infarction. And what that meant was that

434
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,160
there was transmural or all the way through cell death. So the entire wall, there had been an actual

435
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,520
necrotic, basically what had become necrotic and died. Whereas there was another version of heart

436
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,040
attack at that time that we called non-Q wave heart attack. And those people presented with

437
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:39,400
the same clinical picture. So they had chest pain. They also had positive biomarkers. At that time,

438
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,840
we were measuring CK or cretin kinase. And that's an enzyme that's leaked out of the site is all of

439
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,760
a muscle cell when there's damage to it. And so people have heart attacks. There are a bunch of

440
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,320
these enzymes, myoglobin and others that go up. And that's one of the ways that we define heart

441
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,600
attacks. So people would come in, they'd have a positive biomarker that have chest pain,

442
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,600
but they didn't have this Q wave. And so they were called non-Q wave myocardial infarction.

443
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,440
So basically the diagnosis was based on the chest pain and the leaking of the enzymes. So I'll say

444
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,600
a little bit more about that, because we're going to come back to it. But basically when a muscle

445
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:18,520
dies, you can pick up signs of muscle death in the blood and CK being one of them. In fact,

446
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,600
if someone goes out and runs a marathon, it's not uncommon that the next day, if you draw their CK

447
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,480
level, it's very elevated. They've broken down muscle. My recollection, because it's been so long

448
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,240
since I've looked at CK, is they used to even look at a fraction called the MB fraction, which would

449
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,440
try to be more specific for cardiac muscle than say the muscles in your quads or something like

450
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,840
that. So if you had those two things, the pain and the enzyme findings you were having at MI,

451
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,400
the EKG was simply used to determine if it was Q wave completely through or non-Q wave. Is that

452
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,120
right? Mostly, I mean, the EKG is fundamental. I mean, it's really the first thing that gets done

453
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,920
when somebody shows up, they're actually doing them in the field now. And it does today define

454
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,680
how we treat people. It defined it as well back then, but things have changed significantly in the

455
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,360
past 20 years. And we can touch on that a little bit, but the EKG is a fundamental tool. We can't

456
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,720
get away without it. So that was the way it was described. And then there was this other thing

457
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,280
called unstable angina. And unstable angina was thought to be the same pathophysiology,

458
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,160
so ruptured plaque, but it was thought to be incomplete cessation of blood. So maybe the

459
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,000
clot didn't completely block the arteries. There was still a little bit of blood flow getting

460
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,480
through. So in that case, back then, and again, it's changed now, but back then, if you had chest

461
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,640
pain and the EKG changes, but you didn't have a prize in the biomarker, you were said to have

462
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,560
unstable angina. And that was differentiated from stable angina based on what? Yes. So stable

463
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:53,160
angina has been described forever, which is you walk and you get these symptoms that people

464
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,680
describe, and we can come back and talk about what people, we call it chest pain. That's a garbage

465
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,960
basket term that comprises a lot of different things ranging from exercise intolerance to

466
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,680
actually that feeling of Fred Sanford talking about him having the big one or an elephant sitting on

467
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,920
your chest. That is a clinical term of art, basically the way I think about it. So chest pain,

468
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,680
presence or absence of the biomarker and the EKG, and that would define the symptoms. Stable angina

469
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,920
was defined as you're exercising, you're increasing demand. So again, what we're talking about is an

470
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:33,240
imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. So what used to be called stable angina,

471
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,960
and still mostly called stable angina, was thought to be a demand issue. So there would be a lesion

472
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,600
that would narrow the artery and you'd only get chest pain when you increase demand. Sometimes

473
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,920
people call it demand ischemia. And so the idea was that if you have this blockage that's 75,

474
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,520
80% of the diameter of your artery, and you go out and you do something that causes you to increase

475
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,720
your demand. So you go walk up a flight of stairs or a hill here in San Francisco, you need to be

476
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,000
able to deliver more oxygen to the tissue and you can't do that. So the way the coronaries work

477
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,200
physiologically is that they augment blood flow by dilating. So it's a different physiology than

478
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,160
most other vascular beds. So it's part of the reason these drugs like adenosine work is that

479
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,800
they dilate the coronary. That's why people are told to take nitroglycerin if they're having chest

480
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,240
pain. That's right. But the problem is if you've got a fixed lesion there, that's full of a

481
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,320
calcified plaque with a bunch of different lipids and stuff in there, you can't really dilate.

482
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,320
You can dilate the proximal segment before the blockage or you can dilate the distal segment

483
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,120
after, but you can't really deliver more. And so you end up getting an increase in blood flow to

484
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,480
all the other segments. And then you get a little bit more of what probably a little bit of

485
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,160
coronary steel. So in other words, you're getting more blood is even being taken away.

486
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,240
And so that syndrome is considered to be stable. And so you're walking up a hill,

487
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,120
you get chest pain, shortness of breath, whatever the symptom is, you sit down and you rest and it

488
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,840
goes away. Or like you mentioned, you take a nitroglycerin and it goes away and that's stable.

489
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,200
That's actually the best explanation I've ever heard for it. Understanding the fact that I'm

490
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,880
not a cardiologist. And even when I was learning this stuff in medical school,

491
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,160
maybe I just wasn't paying close enough attention, but I think the way you just explained it is great.

492
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,000
It's not just that in the unstable case, you may have some actual plaque rupture.

493
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,920
It's this idea that in the stable case, it's the inability to dilate the target lesion and the

494
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:24,600
plausible steel of blood. So morphologically, it's a totally reversible process. Nothing has changed.

495
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,880
There hasn't been a new injury, but under a certain period of stress, you're able to

496
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,680
basically see this area that otherwise can't function fully.

497
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:08,200
So just to put this in a little bit of reference for you, so having coronary disease, which most

498
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:14,280
Western adults will have by the time they get to be 50, meaning if you looked by CT at me or you,

499
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,160
maybe not you, but I'll probably have a little bit of plaque. But it's very unlikely that plaque,

500
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,320
the amount of plaque is obstructing blood flow, either significantly arrest or with exertion.

501
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,000
Over time, if that plaque gets bigger, at some point, it'll start to become apparent to me

502
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,280
that when I'm walking, increasing my demand, that I'm not able to deliver oxygen. So I'll become

503
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,880
symptomatic. And that the point at which we say most people become symptomatic is when the

504
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,880
percent diameter stenosis or blockage is about 70%. Conveniently, it's also the point when stress

505
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,320
tests, whatever flavor you like, also begin to be able to detect coronary disease. So we have

506
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:01,000
focused, I think, a lot of energy on this 70% number because it's what we can measure clinically,

507
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,680
either through symptoms or through our testing. But there's nothing to suggest that there's a magic

508
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,080
in that number that would put somebody at a greater risk as opposed to somebody who had a 50%. In fact,

509
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,960
if you go back over time and again to the work of Michael Davies, I think, and I don't want to

510
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,720
misspeak here, but I think a lot of the fatal plaque rupture events that happened in this series

511
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,680
of people who came in and died happened in arteries that had only 30% or 40%.

512
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,320
I think that's actually correct. I mean, that's sort of one of the things I remember from that

513
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:39,240
literature that was very surprising, which was it was very difficult, a priority to predict which

514
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,800
one of these things was going to be the fatal one. You could have these 90% occlusions that

515
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,520
were highly symptomatic, but just incredibly stable and they were never going to rupture and

516
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,800
they were never going to be the things that killed you. And in fact, there's almost a paradox,

517
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:58,440
which is the more the stenosis increases, the more likely it tells you that the downstream

518
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,400
musculature has either found some other way to acquire it. So someone who's walking around with

519
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:11,720
a 95% stenosis is very likely to suffer death in the case of that plaque rupturing. Of course,

520
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,480
that's still a harbinger for what's going on elsewhere in the heart. So there are obviously,

521
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,040
very few people are walking around with a single point of this injury. It's telling you that

522
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,320
there's probably injury throughout the heart and that they could die from another one, but

523
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,680
that to me, which I want to come back to, right? Because I want to talk in depth about some of the

524
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,800
diagnostic tools that we have, especially to predict who's at risk, who's not at risk. And

525
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,880
this is becoming increasingly more important as we have to decide both on the risks and costs of

526
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,960
treatment as the treatments get more and more elaborate. And this ability to predict who's

527
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,920
going to have a fatal MI versus who's not, I'm not convinced we're that much better at it today

528
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,600
than 20 years ago, are we? I don't think so. I mean, I think we should definitely come back to that.

529
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,120
That's a fascinating discussion. We could spend eight hours talking about that.

530
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,320
Yeah. Let's go to where we are today. So we've talked about Q wave, non-Q wave. Talk to me about

531
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,520
what is the nomenclature today?

532
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,640
The nomenclature evolved over the past 15 or 20 years. And the reason it did was that it was

533
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,000
sort of the advent of interventional cardiology and what people realized was in the acute setting

534
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,040
of a heart attack. So I was talking about that Q wave before that appears days after a heart attack,

535
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,920
but in the acute setting of a heart attack, there was a defining feature that seemed to predict

536
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,400
whether there was a complete loss of blood flow. And that was something that we described as called

537
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,200
ST elevation. So you described beautifully the different waves. And so it's the QRS complex,

538
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,200
so the end of that big squiggly complex, the seg, there's then a line, a direct line, a flat line

539
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,680
that connects the end of the S wave to the beginning of the T wave. And that we call the

540
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:52,040
ST segment. And that is usually isoelectric with the rest of the EKG. In other words,

541
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,640
it's at the same level as the PR segment and everything else. What people realized was that

542
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,960
if that segment gets increased above a couple of millimeters and it does so in more than one lead,

543
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,560
that that signaled that there was a block, a complete blockage of an artery. And that then

544
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:15,240
evolved into this term that we use today still, which is called ST elevation, MI or STEMI. And that

545
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,640
is a medical emergency immediately signal, we need to open this artery. And that's work that was done

546
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,200
by Gene Ralwald and other people in the Timmy group. And he was done with a combination of

547
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,160
pharmacology, so striptokines, but then also TPA and other thrombolytic agents. And then

548
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,760
people realized you could actually go in there and open the artery manually with a balloon catheter.

549
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,640
So the standard of care in this country today is that if you show up with ST elevation and a

550
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,480
clinical picture that looks like MI, you end up going to a cath lab within an hour and you get

551
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,720
that artery opened up. What is the overlap between ST elevation and if you go back and

552
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,640
look at all the EKGs that define Q wave and non-Q wave, I'm guessing the non-Q waves rarely had ST

553
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,280
elevation and some of the Q waves, but not all of them did. Yeah, I think that's the right thing. So

554
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,200
the way to think about it is the Q wave and the ST elevation MI are probably the same. It's just

555
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,400
you're seeing a later manifestation of the Q wave. If somebody had showed up and if at that time they

556
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,840
did EKGs on everybody who walked into the emergency room with chest pain like they do now,

557
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,240
you probably would have seen the ST elevation. They probably just missed it. So they saw the Q

558
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:27,880
wave because that was what came later. The non-Q wave MI is probably now what we call non-ST elevation

559
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,080
MI and it's actually evolved to a different term, which is I don't love, which is called non-ST elevation

560
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,680
acute coronary syndrome. Which is just not as easy to say as non-STEM. No, so acute coronary syndrome,

561
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,720
I think the way I tell the teach the students is acute coronary syndrome is the entire collection.

562
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,400
It's everything and it includes STEMIs, non-STEMIs, everything. And it includes what we used to call

563
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,720
unstable angina. Unstable angina doesn't really exist anymore. So we now have ST elevation ACS or

564
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,960
ST elevation MI and we have non-ST elevation ACS. And that's very simply defined by the presence or

565
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,760
absence of ST elevation. It turns out that people who don't have ST elevation often have other ST

566
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,800
segment abnormalities. Most commonly their ST segments are actually depressed and that has to

567
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,640
do with changes in the repolarization. I'm not an electrophysiologist, but changes in the

568
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,200
repolarization that happen when the muscle is completely started with oxygen versus only

569
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,520
partially started. It's a super interesting thing that I've never understood. I probably should go

570
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,320
learn why that is. So clinically, if somebody shows up in the emergency room with ST elevation,

571
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,600
it triggers 911, activate the cath lab. This patient goes straight in, they get heparin,

572
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,120
they get aspirin, they get all the other things, clopidogrel. And just to be clear,

573
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,000
do we even check enzymes in those patients or we don't care?

574
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,400
No. So it's an immediate thing. And in fact, when this change happened during the time I was a

575
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,520
cardiology fellow. So when I was a cardiology fellow, if somebody showed up in the emergency

576
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,160
department with ST elevation, they'd call me and I'd come down there, I'd look at the EKG and then

577
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,280
I would make the decision to activate or not activate the cath lab. But since Gene Brownwell

578
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,720
coined this term, time is myocardium. Since we understand that the longer that the heart is

579
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,040
deprived of oxygen, the less chance it's going to actually recover. There's been a push to

580
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,640
speed things up. And so now there's-

581
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,640
So the ER can now make that call.

582
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,080
Yeah. It's actually often made in the field. So the ER makes the call and the page goes directly

583
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,000
to the interventional cardiology team and the cardiology fellow and the attending. So when

584
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,320
I'm on service, I often learn about, I'm the last one to hear about a patient of ours who's come in

585
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,440
with a STEMI.

586
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,400
You hear about it when they're in the cath lab or maybe on the way out.

587
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,400
Yeah. I hear about it when the student or the intern calls and says, what do you want this dose

588
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,760
of this to be? In the old days, wasn't that long ago, 15 years ago, this cardiology fellow had to

589
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,400
make that call.

590
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,840
How much time has that saved? If you think about where we are today versus 10 years ago,

591
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,080
is that a half an hour savings potentially?

592
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,160
Maybe. I mean, every hospital now in this country is measuring their, what's called door to balloon

593
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,840
time or door to open artery time. It's a quality metric. And like every quality metric, they're

594
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:00,040
a trade-offs, right? So there are more people taken to the cath lab who probably don't belong there.

595
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,440
There are some people taken there who are maybe, you know, DNR, DNI, or have metastatic cancer,

596
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,600
or there are other things that you don't have the time to have a nuanced conversation and you're

597
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,960
not having a conversation with an expert. So there is a trade-off, but the overall net net,

598
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,840
I think there's our society of people, citizens and cardiologists and other people and emergency

599
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,000
room doctors, all I think all agree that this is better than it used to be. The dilly-dallying

600
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,800
that would happen and delays are gone. So the most important thing is get somebody up there.

601
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,320
If it's a mistake, it's a mistake. It's not the end of the world. It's a little bit of radiation.

602
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,280
And since we're-

603
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,440
So which trial, was it courage that made this case? Which is the trial that told us

604
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
that what you just said was really the right way to do things, that opening the artery in the

605
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,600
STEMI patients is going to save lives?

606
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,520
I'd have to go back. It was probably one of the early Timmy trials. I don't remember which one.

607
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,760
I'd have to go back and look about which one. There were a series of trials down in the 1990s

608
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,960
comparing what used to be called primary angioplasty. So angioplasty is the Greek

609
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,520
way of saying opening an artery with a balloon.

610
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,000
Can you explain just, I mean, there's going to be a lot of people listening to this who

611
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,280
won't necessarily know exactly what we mean. So when a patient goes into a cath lab,

612
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,800
what actually happens?

613
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,880
So again, a little bit different today than it was in the old days, because in the old days,

614
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,080
almost everybody had basically a needle put into the femorhoidy. So the femorhoidy is a major

615
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,120
offshoot of the aortic, feeds your leg oxygen.

616
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,600
You go into the crease in the groin and you can, anybody can feel their pulse there.

617
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,080
So if you feel that that's your femoral artery, that's about the size of your,

618
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,960
you know, somewhere between your pinky and your middle finger. I mean, that's a monster artery

619
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,640
and you're putting a catheter in there.

620
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,240
There's a technique called the modified cell gender technique, which allows you to put a catheter

621
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,560
into that artery. So that catheter then allows you to have access to the artery.

622
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,880
At the tip of that catheter is a one-way valve. You put things in, but blood can't come back out.

623
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,680
So through the tip of that catheter, there's a little plastic one-way valve and you can thread

624
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,800
things in. You can thread in other plastic catheters. So in this case, you thread in a regular

625
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,360
coronary catheter, which I think is like two millimeters. You thread that in, you can then

626
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,480
under x-ray guidance with a wire to make it a little stiffer, guide it all the way up

627
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,800
around the arch of the aorta and back down.

628
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,760
We'll have a figure of this for sure. So people can see what that does.

629
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,800
Back down to the base of the heart where the coronary osteoar. So they're normal human beings.

630
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,280
There's a left coronary osteoam and a right coronary osteoam. And you can put that catheter

631
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:28,840
and engage it. And then that allows you to inject contrast dye, which under x-ray will allow you to

632
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,400
actually see the artery or see at least the inverse of what the artery looks like. And then

633
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,120
what people realized was you can deliver other things through these catheters too. You can deliver

634
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:43,080
another smaller catheter. And on the tip of that catheter, you could wrap a balloon and then

635
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:49,800
basically you could use a syringe to blow up that balloon. And that would basically crush open the

636
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,480
blockage or clot or combination of whatever else it is that's there and reestablish blood flow.

637
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,960
So it's just, it's a very mechanical process. I mean, when people, I don't think necessarily

638
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,440
people appreciate just how mechanical and in some ways crude this is at the, you know, you described

639
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:13,000
an incredibly complex chemical reaction that is taking place. And one of our solutions is chemical,

640
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,760
right? We can inject something that can break apart the epoxy, but also we can put a balloon in

641
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,960
and use that balloon to inflate open and try to crack it open. And as you'll mention in a

642
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,440
moment, I'm sure you can put in these metallic things that spring open called stents.

643
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,640
It's such a good point, Peter. I mean, it's really, it's as if you went to a stream and there were a

644
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,520
beaver dam there and you just take a bulldozer or you take a shovel and just shove all of it

645
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,080
downstream. And so, you know, one of the questions I've always asked is, well, why is this

646
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,960
therapy not more effective? And we'll get into where it's effective and not effective, but is

647
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,360
there potentially a downside to elaborating all of that crap downstream? And does that have an

648
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:57,400
effect on smaller blood vessels or smaller areas of muscle that end up getting occluded by all this

649
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,600
stuff that you elaborate downstream when you're blowing open this artery? And actually goes back

650
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,800
to the question of sort of when people were doing these trials to compare the efficacy of what's

651
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,160
called primary angioplasty versus thrombolytics, TPA or streptokinase, these chemical drugs.

652
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,240
So the mechanical versus the chemical.

653
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:20,200
That's right. The reason that those drugs are not more effective is not that they're not

654
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,720
great at dissolving blood clots, although they're not perfect at it, but that by doing so,

655
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,720
you're increasing the risk of dislodging a blood clot somewhere else that might be really important.

656
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,600
So let's just say you had an injury in your head and there was a blood clot somewhere in your

657
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,400
subdural area. And so if you go in and you blow in this TPA, you're basically dissolving all blood

658
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,920
clots and it's not precise. It's sort of an imprecise, just every blood clot. So if you have one

659
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,960
somewhere in your GI tract, you'll start bleeding out there. And so the consequences of doing that,

660
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,720
I think we're great. And that's part of the reason why primary angioplasty again became standard of

661
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,400
care in this country. Because while the epoxy process requires two things and therefore is

662
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:05,560
highly specific and be localized, the clot busting is not. You have to put that solution

663
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:11,080
into the circulation. And even though you apply it locally, every time that heart beats, it gets

664
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,080
dissipated. So every part of the body is going to see it. So there are certain circumstances

665
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:20,120
where people try to deliver TPA or cousins of TPA locally. Like I think even in stroke,

666
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:25,320
they're still injecting TPA and trying to keep it relatively local. But it's a very difficult

667
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,520
process because as you say, circulation is circulation, right? I mean, it doesn't take

668
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,520
that long for something that's this part of your circulation to get around your whole body and come

669
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:40,440
back again. So that's why I think, well, I should say when I was a cardiology fellow in 2001, 2002,

670
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,400
we were still doing using TPA as a way of treating people who showed up with a heart attack at San

671
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:51,240
Francisco General Hospital. That's not the case anymore. I think most almost all US hospitals now

672
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:57,240
it's primary angioplasty. And so after you mentioned these stents, these little metal scaffolds,

673
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:03,160
they developed back in the 1990s as a means of treating stable angina. So if somebody came in

674
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,160
and they were having stable angina, they said, God, you know, doc, I'm walking up the hill and I get

675
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,440
this burning in my chest and I sit down and it goes away and I can't now I'm just not able to

676
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,320
walk anywhere. So what can we do? Well, people realize that if you went in there, you blow up

677
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,760
the balloon, this angioplasty thing, but if you wrap a metal scaffold around, it's almost like a

678
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,560
slinky around the balloon, when you blow up the balloon, you leave that behind and that helps to

679
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,840
keep the artery from recoiling back down. And so that was more of a physical barrier to the artery

680
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,480
coming back down. So people found that if you just did the balloon, this is back in the 1990s,

681
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:43,080
again, and people with stable angina, a certain percentage of them, probably 40, 50, 60% of people

682
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:48,440
would show up with what was called restenosis. And restenosis just meant that the artery would

683
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,040
narrow back down again. Some of that was thought to be physical. Some of it was thought to be

684
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,120
secondary to the injury you caused when you blow up the balloon. So people thought, well, gosh,

685
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,280
if you could believe this metal scaffold behind, you can actually improve the likelihood that it's

686
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:07,080
not going to restenose. So stents completely cured the physical recoil problem, which I think,

687
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:12,600
again, I don't know the exact number, but it was some nonzero number, but they left behind this

688
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,840
other problem, which was the injury problem. And so what people realized was that in the act of

689
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,920
blowing up the stent, you created a lot of injury on the vessel wall. And so the body's reaction to

690
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,240
that was to create scar tissue. And so then you'd get what now was called instant restenosis or ISR,

691
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,480
instant restenosis, which was basically the formation of a bunch of fibrous scar tissue

692
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,080
inside the stent. So before the era of what are now called drug eluting stents, this is back in

693
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,840
the 1990s. If you did a stent on somebody, again, stable angina, you'd see that there was some

694
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:48,440
likelihood that they'd come back within three to six months with recurrent symptoms. And you'd do

695
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,880
a stress test. You'd see that there was looked like there was a ischemia. You'd come back in,

696
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,200
you angiogram, you'd look at the artery, and there was narrowing again within the stent.

697
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,600
And that was called instant restenosis. We went through this entire period of five or seven years

698
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,720
of trying to find ways to solve restenosis, including radiating the inside of the vessel wall.

699
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,720
So, but when I was a cardiologist, we'd have the radiation oncologist come into the cath lab with

700
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,000
us. And we would put these radioactive beads up like in one of these balloon catheters into

701
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,040
somebody's artery and basically try to almost kill the fibroblasts and other cells that were going to

702
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,680
make the scar tissue. And God knows what we were doing to each other and to the patients. But that

703
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,000
went away in the early 2000s with the advent of what are called drug eluding stents. And we can

704
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,560
talk about those, but you probably already talked about them a bunch.

705
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:37,000
Well, no, no, I was just going to make the point, right? Which is we've sure talked a lot about my

706
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,440
favorite drugs that end up in these drug eluding stents, but why don't you take a moment to explain

707
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,680
why a drug that inhibits mTOR would find its way onto the coating of a metal stent?

708
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,360
I can't remember the exact story. I think it involved a guy who used to be a Columbia

709
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,760
named Andy Marks. I think he actually figured this stuff out, but we'll have to go back and do

710
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,840
a deep dive on that. But basically these drugs, these rapamycin and other drugs, these mTOR

711
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,960
inhibitors were known to be, I think first before even they were modulators of the immune system,

712
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,040
they were known to be anti-proliferative drugs that people use to treat cancer. And so again,

713
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,880
what I described in a simple way that I think about it is that it's a proliferation problem.

714
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,960
So these cells that are making in response to an injury, a real injury, they're making

715
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,360
they're making scar tissue. And so somebody realized, gosh, if you apply this drug,

716
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,200
you can block that proliferative process. So you can block the smooth muscle cells and

717
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,800
fibroblasts and other cells that are making this scar tissue. And what they realized was that you

718
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:43,800
could paint the outside of a stent with this drug. And so it would basically be there locally and it

719
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,080
wouldn't cause any systemic toxicity or any other problems. And it would just act on the cells that

720
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,920
you wanted it to. So that mostly got rid of that problem that we used to call instant

721
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,000
rheostenosis. For the most part now, that problem is no longer.

722
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,920
And there was a bit of a hiccup in oh, oh, five, oh, six, oh, seven, when they drug

723
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:11,480
eluding stents were briefly taken off the market. And my recollection is you had Medtronic still

724
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:17,480
had a bare metal stent that was basically getting all the market share while Boston Scientific and

725
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,360
Abbott were sitting their time out waiting for these drug eluding stents to come back. And I

726
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,440
recall that they even at one point, even Boston Scientific and Abbott had the same stent,

727
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,520
identical, but branded under different names. I mean, it was such an interesting time in the

728
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,760
cardiology world. I don't remember all the details. I remember that a lot of these reps from these

729
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,240
companies were in the cath lab and there was a big battle to get market share in these different

730
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,320
stents. And there were other things besides which drugs were on the stents. There were issues

731
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,880
around deliverability and how stiff they were and how long, you know, all these other things.

732
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,920
And so it was a, you know, as a general cardiology fellow and somebody who was interested in basic

733
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,000
science, I wasn't paying attention to the nitty gritty of kind of what was going on in this war

734
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,240
for market share. But there definitely was a lot going on. The biggest problem with these drug

735
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,120
eluding stents was, so if you back up to the early 1990s, when stents first started getting

736
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,240
used in coronaries, one of the biggest problems that happened was that you'd put the stent in

737
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:16,520
there and then within a period of a few weeks, a non-trivial amount of people would come back with

738
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:22,760
effectively was a STEMI. The stent would clot off. That was happening and that was bad. So there were

739
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,680
series of trials where people tried aspirin. I believe they tried warfarin. They tried everything

740
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,520
and they actually couldn't. So aspirin and warfarin are both blood thinners through different

741
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:35,720
mechanisms. That's right. So aspirin acts on platelets, warfarin blocks that coagulation cascade,

742
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,360
you know, downstream tissue factor. But people couldn't use these stents for a while. And then

743
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:45,320
in 1996, and I know this because I as a medical student had the ridiculously good fortune of being

744
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,720
the first author on a paper that was published in the knowing the journal of medicine and that same

745
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:56,200
issue. So our paper was forgotten mostly except for me. But in that same issue, and I looked at

746
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,560
it the other day, was a trial that demonstrated that you could do stenting of coronary arteries

747
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:06,040
safely with the addition of this drug that's no longer used because it had toxicity called

748
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,760
tyclopidine, Ticlid. And so Ticlid was the first generation of these what we call thienopyridines.

749
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,080
Thienopyridines act to block at the time we didn't notice, but they block a receptor on the surface

750
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:20,920
of a platelet that's called the ADP receptor. And it basically renders the platelet a little bit less

751
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:26,200
sticky or less prone to be activated and become sticky. And what these guys demonstrated, which

752
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,480
was transformational for interventional cardiology is if you gave people this drug Ticlid at the time

753
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,840
they got their stent, the chance of the stent clotting off went to almost zero. And eventually

754
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:42,840
that drug had some toxicity and was replaced with the drug that's used in most cases still today

755
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,000
called clopidogrel, which is acting on the same receptor. It's the same biology.

756
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,040
And patients might know that drug by a different name.

757
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,480
Plavix, right.

758
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,840
So today when a patient gets their stent, they also get a year supply of plavix. How long do we

759
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,320
keep it on?

760
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,400
Yeah. So where I was going with that was that there was this thing called subacute stent

761
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,000
thrombosis. So thrombosis is the word for blood clotting. Subacute means within a few weeks.

762
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,600
So back in the day, if somebody stopped taking their plavix or didn't get their plavix, there

763
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,040
was a likelihood that they would get this condition called subacute stent thrombosis.

764
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,600
Again, for all intents and purposes, it's like a STEMI because it's a complete stoppage of blood

765
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,680
flow and it's critical and people can die.

766
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,760
Which is kind of ironic, right? You can show up with a stable problem

767
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:32,120
that's chronic and through the intervention end up having an acute fatal complication.

768
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:32,200
That's right.

769
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,960
I mean, the stakes are so high.

770
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:39,480
Huge. And people did and it was bad. And there were lots of questions about why and all that

771
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,240
was happening. That problem mostly got solved for them. Again, 95 plus percent of people,

772
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,240
there was some discussion about plavix resistance and other things, but mostly that problem got

773
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,320
solved with plavix and people realized if you take plavix for a month after a bare metal stent,

774
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:58,200
you're good to go. So then people fast forward and you were in the drug looting stent era and

775
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,840
we've solved the restenosis problem, but people are showing up now. They've taken their plavix

776
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:08,200
for a month, but now they're showing up at three months, six months, nine months with not subacute,

777
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,960
but whatever the after subacute is stent thrombosis, late stent thrombosis and having again,

778
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:20,440
the same life threatening STEMI like experience. And what people realized was in the process of

779
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,840
inhibiting these cells, these smooth muscle cells and other cells that make the scar tissue,

780
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,680
we're also inhibiting the endothelial cells. So one of the things that happens,

781
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:33,480
if you take a patient who has a stent and that patient say dies in a car accident, you look

782
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,280
under the microscope pathologically, you'll see that that stent is now covered with endothelial

783
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:43,080
cells after about three weeks and it's the endothelial cells that prevent the blood clotting.

784
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:48,120
So the stent struts themselves are probably pro thrombotic. So they probably trigger some

785
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,360
clotting. So what we realized was that your own body would basically wall out the stent.

786
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:57,960
Which is exactly what you want in a good way to reproduce the endothelium that is this beautiful,

787
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,960
you know, I try to explain to patients that, you know, atherosclerosis is complicated.

788
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,440
And the reason that there's no one single causal factor is you have to have this sort of perfect

789
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:11,240
storm of endothelial injury. And that can be anything from smoking cigarettes will do that

790
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,960
to high blood pressure will do that. You have to have a lipoprotein that can actually carry

791
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,920
cholesterol through that injury. So you have that injury, you can carry through that has to

792
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,480
get oxidized and create an immune response that then has to lead to the formation of this plaque,

793
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,440
which for reasons that aren't entirely clear, some rupture, some don't and kick off the epoxy

794
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:37,000
problem. So what you just described is the body will reproduce that beautiful endothelium around

795
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,240
the metal stent again. And if that's what happens, you end up in the good camp. And if instead of

796
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:48,360
that happening, you kick off this inflammatory cascade again, you can get into a very bad

797
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,600
situation very quickly. Basically, the way to think about it is that most people with a bare

798
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:57,080
metal stent will re endothelialize the inside of the stem within, you know, like three weeks,

799
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:01,560
four weeks. So the standard of care in 2002, 2003, but before drug-leading stents was take

800
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:06,360
plavix for one month and you're done. And people did great. And then drug-leading stents come along,

801
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,520
they solve this one problem, but they create a new problem. The problem was that in addition to

802
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,320
inhibiting the proliferation of these smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts.

803
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,280
You inhibit the endothelium.

804
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,960
Exactly. So people were coming back with this stent thrombosis problem now, you know, months later,

805
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:26,280
then it became unclear about what the correct amount of time to take your plavix or other drug

806
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:31,400
was after a stent. And I think now there's some great work being done by people. I think for the

807
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:37,160
most part with these newest generation drug-alluding stents that have the right mixture and cocktail

808
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:42,520
of drug on them, and they're really easy to deliver and cause less injury, it's six months.

809
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,160
If something's complicated, if the patient has diabetes or other risk factors,

810
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:52,280
then you may extend the time. But again, what you're doing is you're buying bleeding risk

811
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:56,840
by inhibiting this risk of stent thrombosis. Obviously stent thrombosis is the worst. You

812
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:01,000
don't want, you can't have that. So when I have a patient who leaves the hospital and they say,

813
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,800
what do I take? I say, listen, if you're going to an island and you can only bring one thing with

814
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,560
you for the first, you know, whatever it is, few months, all that matters is your plavix. You've

815
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,680
got to take it every day. Right. At this point, whether you remember to take your statin or your

816
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,680
blood pressure drug, those are important. But yeah, that's a great way to put it.

817
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,840
If the ship is sinking, the highest priority is the lifeboat. This is your lifeboat.

818
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,120
It didn't get communicated clearly enough, I think, for a while. So when people would

819
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,800
shop in the hospital with stent thrombosis, it was often because they hadn't been told

820
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,080
appropriately strongly enough that they had to take plavix.

821
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,960
So you've done a great job of explaining the unambiguous part of interventional cardiology,

822
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:49,320
which is the case where I think most people agree interventional cardiology through the stent has

823
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,720
provided a survival benefit. There are a whole bunch of other areas where that is quite gray.

824
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,480
You and I have had some really interesting discussions about that going through

825
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,800
some of the really important trials in the past decade that have tried to ask

826
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,320
a question. So let's begin with the case that you described a while ago, which is

827
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,400
patient comes to see you in clinic says, you know, Dr. Weiss, God, it's just,

828
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,160
every time I get on that treadmill, I just get a tightness in my chest. And the other day I was

829
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,480
walking up the street and it was really steep and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So they've got

830
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,480
stable angina. Let's assume you decide it's worth doing an angiogram in that person you do. And you

831
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:32,120
see low and behold, there is a 60 or 70% occlusion smack in the middle of their left interior

832
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:37,320
descending artery that runs right down the front of their left ventricle. What should you do? Maybe

833
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,280
another way to say it is what would people have normally said and what have the data now suggested?

834
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,600
I mean, this is one of the most controversial areas, I think, and least well understood areas

835
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:52,040
of medicine. I'm not even going to say cardiology. So in the 1980s, that patient gets a prescription

836
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:56,600
for nitroglycerin and beta blocker. So beta blocker helped reduce the demand. So basically,

837
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:01,240
it's like putting a governor on a car or golf cart. So you can't rev the engine as high. So you're

838
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:06,200
going to be less likely to get symptoms. And nitroglycerin, as we described, helps relax the

839
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:11,640
blood vessels and maybe also decreases demand by decreasing blood pressure. So it's basically

840
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:17,080
a couple of not great tools in the 1980s. And then people would go to a point where they

841
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,080
couldn't walk anymore. And eventually they'd get bypassed because there was no other option for

842
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:27,080
what we now call revascularization. Eventually, when stents became viable in the mid 1990s,

843
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:31,880
people realized, well, gosh, that person, if you open that artery and put a stent in there,

844
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,160
you can give somebody a really durable response and they won't have to take any of these medicines.

845
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:42,760
And just to be clear, at this point in time, we only had one sort of plumbing solution that had

846
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:48,920
been demonstrated to impact survival. And that, if I'm correct, it was Lima to LAD Cabbage. So I'll

847
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:54,520
explain what that is. So everything as you can tell in cardiology is an acronym. So Lima stands

848
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:01,880
for left internal mammary artery. So when you open up the sternum, you have these arteries on the

849
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:09,320
inside of the sternum. And the left and right version of these turn out to be the most important

850
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:16,360
conduits that you can use to bypass because they're already attached on one end and they're

851
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,160
beautiful blood sources. And you used to attach it what we call distally, so past the lesion.

852
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:29,720
And by the way, if my memory is correct, it was only Lima to LAD. It wasn't Lima to CERC. It wasn't

853
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:35,320
Lima to right man. There was nothing else. They did sham surgeries, if I recall, to demonstrate

854
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,640
that. I don't know if they did sham surgeries back then, but you're absolutely right. It was only

855
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,800
Lima to LAD. It was only a subset, right? So I think it was, you had to have multivessel disease,

856
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,560
blephentricular dysfunction, diabetes. I mean, there were a subset of people,

857
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,920
as not everybody got a mortality benefit. I'd have to go back and look at the...

858
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,080
Maybe those weren't the shams, but I know there were some sham surgeries that involved sternotomies,

859
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:59,080
which when you think about that, I mean, imagine signing that consent form. Golly.

860
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:05,640
So in defense of the cardiology community in the mid-90s, it wasn't an unreasonable hypothesis

861
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:12,360
that, hey, if taking the Lima and attaching it to the LAD, effectively bypassing this thing works,

862
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,240
at least in a subset of patients, shouldn't we be able to rotor rooter this thing and open it up

863
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:22,360
and get the same benefit, right? Right. And I think the important thing to remember is to define the

864
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:27,320
benefit you're interested in. So we need to talk about the two things that matter. And when a patient

865
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,920
comes to see me in the office or you in the office, we often end up talking about two things. One is,

866
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:36,040
how do I feel? So presence or absence of symptoms. And the second is, is this going to impact how

867
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:41,880
long I live? Mortality. And those are the two variables we think about every day in cardiology

868
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:47,320
and as you mentioned, there was evidence that this one procedure or a subset of these procedures

869
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:52,120
could confer a mortality benefit. But most of the time when we're talking about revascularizing or

870
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:56,760
treating stable angina, we're talking about treating symptoms. That remains true today.

871
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,080
And people sometimes poo-poo that, but I think it's important, at least for me, I like to dispel

872
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:07,320
that because there's certainly, I find a heavy dose of people in the peanut gallery who think

873
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:12,360
if it doesn't impact all-cause mortality, it's never worth talking about. And I suspect these

874
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,440
people have never taken care of patients. Of course not. No. I mean, look, if you can't walk

875
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:21,800
up your stairs, you can't garden, you can't hike with your wife, you can't go skiing with your

876
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:26,120
children. I mean, there are a lot of things that were- You can't have sex. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And all

877
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,080
that stuff I think is incredibly important and it shouldn't just because you're not conferring a

878
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,160
mortality benefit, all-cause mortality benefit, doesn't mean that there's not benefit. So I think

879
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:40,120
that the advent of the statin era was remarkable. It happened to coincide with the advent of the

880
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:44,120
statin era, right? So the first statin, lowest statin was approved in 1988, I believe. So

881
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,600
remember I had said that we were treating people with angina with basically beta blockers and

882
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:53,240
nitrates. And so then statins got added to the mix. They weren't initially added for treatment

883
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,560
of stable disease. They were there for, they were initially tested in people who were having

884
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,280
unstable disease, but it quickly became obvious that they were going to become an important

885
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,880
mainstay of treatment of people with stable coronary disease as well. So this idea that

886
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,600
even if there's an intervention that doesn't extend life by one day, if it improves the quality of

887
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:16,200
life, it should still be on the table. So walk us through a little bit of the trial architecture

888
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:22,760
and how it navigated how we ought to treat these patients with stable angina, or you can even

889
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:27,720
define it as the, if you want to do it through the ACS language, feel free as well. So let's back up

890
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,080
and just make sure we reemphasize, because I don't think this point cannot be emphasized too many

891
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,920
times. So if you show up in the hospital or in the emergency room or anywhere in the world with

892
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:41,320
this ST elevation, MI a STEMI, in other words, that ST segment is increased above baseline

893
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,240
and you're having a heart attack. Yeah. It's a do not pass. Go do not collect $200. You're

894
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,760
going straight to the Catholic. That's right. If you show up and you have a non STEMI, so chest

895
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,640
pain, let's say you have positive biomarker. So now modern day we use another biomarker called

896
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,280
troponin, which is just a component of the architecture that allows muscles to contract.

897
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:05,720
And there's an isoform of flavor of it that's specific to cardiac muscle. So if you show up

898
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:11,720
with some of that in your blood, it signals that your heart has suffered cell death muscles have.

899
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,880
And so that's part of the diagnosis. So you show up with chest pain, positive troponin,

900
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:21,480
and any KG change that is not ST elevation, anything other than ST elevation, it could be normal.

901
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:27,320
That puts you into a different category. And mostly in the United States, the management of

902
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,680
depending on a couple of factors, but most people are managed either what's called medically. So

903
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:37,560
with a bunch of medicines or they go down a path of interventional cardiology. So now let me ask you

904
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,440
a question, even we didn't distinguish this, but it's worth adding in the STEMI patient. You don't

905
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:50,680
care if they're hemodynamically stable or not. In other words, if their blood pressure is stable,

906
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:55,320
they're having chest pain, but they're not in extreme distress, they're still going to the

907
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:02,520
cath lab. In the non STEMI patient has chest pain, patient has the enzymes, EKG looks normal,

908
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,920
but presumably there are still cases where those patients are not hemodynamically stable.

909
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:12,200
So if you have what we would call complicated non STEMI, so hemodynamic instability, I mean,

910
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,680
your blood pressure is very low or you have heart failure, you fluid in your lungs,

911
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,440
something else that makes it complicated or you can't treat people can't make their chest pain go

912
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,840
away with medicines, something that makes it complicated or ongoing concerning KG changes,

913
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:30,600
or just you don't feel right. That patient also can go to the cath lab. It isn't an emergency

914
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:36,040
unless there's hemodynamic instability, but oftentimes people will go along the same timeline.

915
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:41,000
It won't may not be within 60 minutes, but it'll be quickly. Again, depending on how complicated,

916
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,160
if you have uncomplicated non STEMI, so the blood pressure is fine. You don't have any evidence of

917
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:49,400
congestive heart failure. There's nothing else that makes this look scary. Those patients can

918
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:54,120
be managed either non-invasively with medicines or invasively. And we can talk a little bit about

919
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,760
how that happens. There was a period of time, I think in this country where most of those people

920
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,280
went into the interventional arm where they went and got, and they went to the cath lab and they

921
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:07,560
would get a stand. And I think in the past few years there have been questions about the sort of

922
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,880
value of that. And there's debate about that, but just to be clear, there's one area of medicine

923
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:17,080
where there's no debate, which is there's a more clear mortality benefit by opening up the artery.

924
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,720
Again, if you're in Uganda and you don't have a cath lab, then TPA is the best you can do,

925
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:27,480
but opening the artery saves lives. In the non STEMI situation, if you're hemodynamically unstable,

926
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:32,040
again, same thing, opening the artery saves lives. If you're hemodynamically stable,

927
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,360
things start to become a little bit more gray and then stable angina, which is the last thing we'll

928
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:41,720
come back to, there's a huge amount of gray area. Again, about mortality, not symptoms.

929
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:46,760
So let's talk about Orbida. What did that trial look at? What question did it try to answer?

930
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:53,160
This trial was published in November of 2017, I believe. And it was done by a group in London

931
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:58,920
who I had never heard of before this trial came out. I guess Darryl Francis was the PI and I think

932
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,520
he was well known in the interventional cardiology community, but not to those of us who are not in

933
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:07,480
in that world. This trial shook the world. Actually, we should probably talk about courage

934
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,920
before we talk about it. Let's do that. Yeah, thank you. Let's go. Because I alluded to courage and

935
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,640
then we got off topic. Tell me about courage. So courage was published in 2007. And if anybody

936
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,400
asks me what courage stands for, I don't remember. I don't remember either. Yeah, but it's an

937
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:24,120
acronym that is put together to explain what the trial was about. And I also can't remember who the

938
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:29,880
PI was, but that study, so again, we're talking at this point back about stable angina. So people

939
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:35,880
who are not showing up in the hospital with new symptoms or new EEG changes, this is a totally

940
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,560
different animal. This is somebody who's been out living in their home and they have symptoms that

941
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:45,320
have been going on for some period of time. So courage was designed to ask the question and

942
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,680
answer the question of is there in addition to a symptom relief that you'd get from putting a

943
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,280
stent in an artery of somebody who's got a blocked artery and has stable angina? By the way,

944
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,120
I'm just going to interject. So I'm going to make a plug for one of my favorite apps, which is

945
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:03,480
incredibly dorky. It's called trials. I don't know if you've seen this app, but let me show it to you

946
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:07,720
and we'll make sure we link to it. So the, I'm sorry, the app is called journal club. It's either

947
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:13,480
free or very cheap. So if you go into journal club, you can search every single clinical trial

948
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:20,040
in the history of mankind. So I just went courage and it pulled it up and it's, it gives you just a

949
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,640
treatise on the topic, right? It gives you the bottom line and then it tells you what it stands

950
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:29,080
for. Okay. So major points. So it's called clinical outcomes utilizing revascularation and aggressive

951
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:34,920
drug evaluation, parentheses courage. And then it goes through and explains everything about it. So

952
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,080
if you're listening to this and you're a physician and you don't have this app, get it.

953
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:45,320
And truthfully, even if you just have a tincture of interest in clinical trials, this is a great app

954
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:52,280
to have. I must look at this like once every two or three days and you can screen and search by,

955
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:56,920
like sometimes if I'm just sitting around and I've got 20 minutes to kill and I'm kind of bored and

956
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:01,080
it's, you know, I'm in the, I'm on the runway and it's taken a while to take off. I'll just open it

957
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,640
up and search by subjects. Like I wonder what's going on in oncology in the last two months,

958
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,120
what new trials have come out. So anyway, journal club is awesome. Well, now you can read it and see

959
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:15,240
how close I am. So I'll try to be, I will be intentionally less detailed about what have I,

960
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,240
how I described these trials since everyone's going to be reading along. So anyway, this trial

961
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,400
was designed with one purpose. And the purpose of this was to compare maximum medical therapy to

962
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:28,440
stenting in patients with stable coronary disease. And the idea was, is there a benefit in terms of

963
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:33,560
reducing the risk of heart attack or some other heart outcome like death in patients when you

964
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:39,800
randomly assign them in a non-blinded manner to be treated with maximum medicines or stents.

965
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:45,160
Non-blinded meaning they did not do sham procedures in the people who randomized to no stent.

966
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:49,720
That's right. So obviously you as a patient or you as a doctor knows if you're going to go get a

967
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:54,440
stent or not. So you, you were told you've been assigned to this category, you're going to get

968
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,520
medical therapy and then they got medicines. And this is something I have to go back and look at,

969
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:02,440
but I believe the people randomized to the interventional arm also got aggressive medical

970
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:06,360
therapy. I don't think there were huge differences, but that may be one of the areas where the,

971
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:11,320
there was debate. But the net of this whole thing was that this trial was organized and run by

972
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:15,800
interventional cardiologists. And the purpose of it was to demonstrate that there's a benefit in

973
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:21,080
heart outcomes by stenting that this, we were going to prove finally that opening the arteries

974
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,880
did more than just relieve symptoms. And it was negative, completely negative. So there was no

975
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,440
difference between the two arms. I can't remember the details cause it's been over 10 years, but

976
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:35,160
there may have been, I remember that because like I said, I just saw that it was 2007. I was going

977
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:42,760
to guess 2006, but I kind of remember where I was when that study came out. And boy, that was like

978
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:49,480
a big hit in an industry where it was pretty much the wild West at that point in terms of the number

979
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:54,040
of stents people were getting. I mean, we used to joke about it kind of teasing these guys,

980
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:58,120
which is like, God, if somebody looks at you wrong in the parking lot, you're going to put a stent in

981
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,880
them. Well, it was. And this was the era again, where there were people, like there was this

982
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,880
hospital up North, I think it was like a tenant hospital where there was this guy who was stent,

983
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,600
you'd show up there with like too much farting or something. And then he'd do a calcium scan on you

984
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,920
and you'd see like a, you know, calcium score of 20. And he'd say, we got to take you to the cath lab.

985
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,120
And then he'd put stents in you. And there was really no way to argue against that.

986
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,800
Even in asymptomatic people, it was just a crazy time. So this, this definitely was a big result

987
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,440
in cardiology, particularly in interventional cardiology. It was not met without criticism,

988
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,800
as you can imagine. And I can't remember all the details, but there were definitely some

989
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,440
big questions raised. But the net of it was, Hey, look, the other way to look at this is that we've

990
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:43,880
been doing trials of stenting for a long time now. And no one outside of the STEMI situation has

991
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:49,960
demonstrated any benefit in hard outcomes that to date. So, you know, you could say the burden

992
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,160
of proof, the onus is on the interventional cardiology community to prove it. So they tried

993
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:58,040
and they failed. So I think that was a big practice changer. I think what that told you was, look,

994
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,280
again, back to what we were talking about earlier, this is a symptom management problem.

995
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,000
We're not doing this to extend life. Doesn't mean that it's not important. It doesn't mean

996
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,080
that you still don't use it as a tool, but it, maybe it shouldn't be the primary tool.

997
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:15,080
Maybe the primary tool should be, Hey, look, let's try and use these medicines,

998
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:19,720
which are really effective and we'll optimize them as best we can. And if that doesn't work,

999
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,920
then we'll go down the path of trying to open the artery. And so it really did change. I think the

1000
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,880
way we managed people, again, mostly outpatients, mostly stable, legitimate patients.

1001
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,280
So then what was the impetus for orbiter 10 years later?

1002
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,360
Well, I would have to ask the Daryl and I hope someday you could ask him because he's a

1003
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,800
phenomenally entertaining guy.

1004
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,640
You got me on to him and his work and I follow him on Twitter now and I think he's in the UK and

1005
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,520
I can't, I can't wait to hopefully meet him at some point.

1006
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:51,800
He made this like tremendous appearance and splash on Twitter that year and a half ago and like

1007
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:56,600
set the world on fire because he was fearless and obnoxious and just everything you'd love about him.

1008
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,560
And, and I guess he pissed a lot of people off and somebody basically pulled his plug. So he's

1009
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,640
been really quiet, if not completely absent from Twitter for the past, I want to say six months,

1010
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,520
but anyway, he was the PI on this study orbiter and the impetus there was, okay, well, courage

1011
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,720
kind of established that there's not going to be a benefit in terms of heart outcomes. So we're

1012
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:18,520
really, we've sort of settled on this idea that stents are there and they're useful for treating

1013
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,920
symptoms in patients who fail medical therapy, but orbiter was our stents actually even doing

1014
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,920
what they're supposed to do in terms of reducing symptoms. So orbiter, you mentioned sham trials.

1015
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:33,080
This was the first sham trial that I, interventional cardiology that I knew of.

1016
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:39,160
So orbiter stands for objective randomized blinded investigation with optimal medical

1017
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:45,080
therapy of angioplasty in stable angina. And one of the beauties of naming clinical trials

1018
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:50,840
is you can use a sentence with as many words in it as you want, as long as you capitalize

1019
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:56,040
the beginning of the words that you want in your acronym, you get it. So if you just heard me read

1020
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:01,560
that and said, how the hell does that work out to orbiter? You only capitalize the objective

1021
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,680
randomized blinded investigation therapy angioplasty. Yeah. Well, that app would have

1022
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,520
been fun as a medical student because you used to get pimped on kind of what were the key trials

1023
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,560
and stuff. So anyway, the key differentiator of this trial is blinded, which meant there were sham

1024
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:21,160
procedures done. So what they did was they took people who had demonstrated documented angina

1025
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:26,520
and lesions. So they all had catheterizations, whereas I think in courage, they were randomized

1026
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,600
after a stress test. I don't think everybody had an angiogram before they got randomized. In this

1027
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,680
case, they got randomized after the angiogram showing that they had a blockage.

1028
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:39,000
They could not have three vessel disease or left main disease. I think there were a few

1029
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
other exclusions, but these were people who could have one, two advanced disease

1030
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:49,880
and they could be tight lesions. They could be 95, 98% lesions. Then they were randomly assigned

1031
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:55,400
to get either optimized medical therapy or stent. And that was done blind to the patient

1032
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,120
and blind to the, not the obviously the interventional cardiologist, but to the

1033
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:04,600
treating referring physician. So if I sent you in to be randomized in this trial, you and I would

1034
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,400
not know what you got because they would take you to the cat lab. They'd put a catheter in your leg.

1035
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:14,120
They'd wind a catheter up into your corner or osteo and they would pretend to blow up a balloon

1036
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:19,480
and you wouldn't know what you got. And it was a small trial, which was one of the major criticisms,

1037
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:24,040
I think, because it was such a small trial and I'm not a trialist. So I don't get into the nitty

1038
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:30,360
gritty on kind of what makes trials more or less robust. Well, I mean, from a size perspective,

1039
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:35,240
the issue comes down to power. I think this is the biggest challenge of trial design.

1040
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:40,200
People talk a lot about significance, which is what the P value tells you, but people don't talk

1041
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:47,560
a lot about power, which is beta. And the idea here is you have to have some sense, a priority

1042
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,520
of how much of a difference you will see to design your trial because you have to know how

1043
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:58,680
many people to put in it. Because if the trial comes out and there is a significant difference,

1044
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:02,760
a statistically significant difference, which is usually defined as a P value less than 0.05,

1045
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:08,840
meaning there is a less than 5% chance that the difference you have observed is due to chance,

1046
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,720
then power becomes irrelevant. It's just that power becomes so important when the opposite

1047
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:19,880
happens, when you don't see a difference. And it's your ability to say, we don't see a difference

1048
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,440
and we believe that a difference is not there versus we don't see a difference, but we didn't

1049
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:29,400
have enough people to look at it. So for example, if I was going to design a trial with me and Ethan,

1050
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:34,760
just as the two of us, it's quite likely that I would never find a statistically significant

1051
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:39,800
distinction. But that doesn't mean that the metric I'm looking at doesn't exist. It's just with two

1052
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:45,160
people in a trial, the probability that I'm going to find it is incredibly low unless the difference

1053
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:50,760
is egregious. So I've always found this to be the biggest challenge of clinical trials,

1054
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:57,800
is that you have to have some sense of your expected outcome to select beta to power the

1055
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:02,920
study appropriately. And this was the obviously the core place that people argued because it was

1056
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:07,400
a small trial and people said it's an underpowered study and there's, you couldn't see a difference.

1057
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,960
Study was interesting because they, they both asked people sort of how do you feel in terms of your

1058
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,600
angina? So how, every one of these patients had some frequency of anginal episodes. They'd get

1059
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,080
chest pain if they walked or did something, but then they did some objective things too. So they

1060
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:26,200
did stress testing. I believe they did like the obedience stress test. So basically they,

1061
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:31,960
it's a way of looking to see objectively was there more or less ischemia and they also did

1062
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,800
treadmill tests. So they looked at their exercise capacity and how long they could exercise before

1063
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:43,640
they got symptoms. And I don't want to get misspeak and piss off all my interventional friends,

1064
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,560
but for the most part, the thing was pretty negative. And I think there might've been a

1065
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,400
slight difference in the treadmill time. There was something very slight, but for the most part,

1066
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,480
it was a negative study. And so the result, which ended up splashed all over the New York

1067
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:01,480
Times, the wall street journal and every other news organization you could think of the conclusion

1068
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:07,160
that was sort of reported to the general public was stents. Not only did they not reduce your

1069
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,920
risk of having a heart attack or dying, they don't even reduce your symptoms. And so it became a

1070
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:19,000
sort of firestorm of conversation. And this was not long after former president George W. Bush

1071
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,000
had a stent placed after what I don't believe was a STEMI. That's right. He had stable angina,

1072
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,480
same thing. And this goes back to the old days of when people would do routine sort of

1073
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:34,680
surveillance stress testing in people to look for these 70% blockages and then they'd go and

1074
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:40,360
stent them. This was the way things operated until relatively recently. So what we learned

1075
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:45,240
from that trial was, look, this may have been underpowered, but at the very least it tells

1076
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:50,200
you again and again and again that medical therapy is really good. So modern medical optimized

1077
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:56,280
therapy is great. And so the way I, what I took home from this trial and what I convey to my

1078
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:01,720
patients today, along with the important caveat that what I convey to you today is very likely to

1079
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:07,320
be a lot different from what I convey to you tomorrow. But I say what I can be today is that

1080
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:13,000
while stents may or may not be useful in some circumstances at reducing your symptoms, if you

1081
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,680
have bad symptoms, it's very unlikely that in stable angina they're going to do anything else.

1082
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:22,680
But either way, it's our job to try to manage you as best we can with medicines before we go down

1083
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:26,520
that path, because there are going to be consequences of putting a stent in you. And we've

1084
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,000
all seen these patients who end up with 20 and 30 stent, you know, tons and tons of stents. And

1085
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,360
again, taking a stent is not just an isolated experience. It means going on one of these

1086
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:42,200
powerful blood thinning medicines like Plavix or a more powerful one. And it means a lot of other

1087
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:47,560
things that we do and don't understand. So what I say is, look, our job, our obligation is to try as

1088
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:52,840
best we can to use medicines to optimize you. If we fail at that, we're going to keep that stenting

1089
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:57,240
procedure in our back pocket. If you come back to me in three months and you say either one of two

1090
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:01,320
things, either these medicines are not working and I'm still having a lot of chest pain,

1091
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,960
then we go down, then we can say, let's go look at opening the artery with a stent. Or if you say to

1092
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:10,360
me, these medicines are making me feel miserable. Like I just, I don't like the way I feel. I want

1093
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:15,000
to take fewer medicines. I also believe it's reasonable at that point to say, all right,

1094
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,600
let's go see what we can do with a stent. So I have not stopped referring people

1095
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:24,120
to interventional cardiology. In fact, I probably haven't changed dramatically how many people get

1096
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,800
stent. Courage probably did change it a little bit, but for the most part, I'm sending the same

1097
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:33,400
number of people. I'm sending the same people to the cath lab as I did before or whatever.

1098
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:37,400
Yeah, it's probably just the composition of those patients is probably migrating constantly.

1099
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,280
And that's, I think some people, you know, you said something sort of interesting that I think

1100
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:45,560
for some people is frustrating to hear, which is what do you mean what you're telling me today

1101
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:49,480
could be different tomorrow? But that's unfortunately the nature of science. I,

1102
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,840
one of the things I like to say, and I wish I knew who said it first because I,

1103
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:57,480
I feel like I'm plagiarizing it though. I don't actually recall is that all facts have a half

1104
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:02,760
life. And in some ways that's the single most exciting thing about science. I mean,

1105
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:09,000
it would be kind of boring if all of the natural universe and the, and its laws were known. And

1106
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,240
this was just a game of memorizing all those facts. I mean, I just don't think science would

1107
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:18,680
be nearly as interesting as the fact that we're constantly in the dark trying to refine our

1108
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,240
knowledge. You can say that on a micro level and a macro level. I mean, I always tell people that

1109
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:27,640
work with me in our, in my lab, in our lab that, you know, if you know the answer to the experiment

1110
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:31,960
before you do them, we don't need to, we don't need to experiment. Just stop. We can write it up,

1111
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,480
right? What are we going to learn? And the other thing is that the results of these experiments,

1112
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:39,560
whether they're experiments in a lab, cells and tissues or animals, or whether they're clinical

1113
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,280
experiments that are done on lots of human beings, there is some likelihood that that result is

1114
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:50,520
quote unquote wrong. Even a P value of 0.05 means that there's a 95% chance that it didn't

1115
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,560
happen by chance, but there's a 5% chance that it, that result did happen by chance. So there is

1116
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,280
a constant refining of what is truth or what is as close as what we can call to truth. And so I

1117
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:05,240
think we have to stay humble. I love it when I'm wrong. And there have been a few examples this

1118
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:11,160
year where I've been wrong, brutally wrong. And it, it brings me joy. Like I, it's a great, I love

1119
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:16,120
it when something defies my expectation. I don't know that I can say I enjoyed as much as you do,

1120
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:21,080
but if I just look at constantly being challenged, I mean, you know, at the time of this recording,

1121
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:26,920
there is just such a gauntlet being thrown down to challenge the dogma around utility of vitamin

1122
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,680
D and sunscreen. That's something that I've been spending a lot of time reading about in the past

1123
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:36,840
two months. And I have to tell you, I don't know that I would say I love the fact that I probably

1124
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:41,320
know nothing about this now based on all of this new information that is emerging,

1125
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:47,160
but it's certainly exciting. I mean, it is so great to say, wow, I get to go back and learn

1126
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:51,560
this whole thing all over again. And you sort of have to hope that there hasn't been damage done

1127
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,000
in a previous paradigm that's being turned over. You know, you brought up your labs,

1128
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,800
so I want to talk about that, but I'm not ready to leave this topic yet because I want you to

1129
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:06,600
give us a quick or reasonably quick primer on other things that tend to confuse patients, such as

1130
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,200
calcium scores versus CT angiograms. And I even want to touch on heart flow in a minute because

1131
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:16,440
that comes back to it. So I think the listeners know what a calcium score is in a CT angiogram is,

1132
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:20,840
but so just give this the quickest sense of that because what I'm much more interested in is,

1133
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:26,520
what do the results tell us? As a cardiologist practicing in 2019, I struggle with the question

1134
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:32,280
of whether I'm going to help you or hurt you, that I feel this tremendous sense of uncertainty about

1135
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:37,320
whether I should be as aggressive as I can picking up every rock and looking under everything

1136
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:45,800
and trying to optimize to the best of my extent, my ability versus whether that may be the best

1137
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:49,960
thing I can do is leave you alone. And you've probably seen examples too where, I mean,

1138
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,960
I remember again as a cardiology fellow, maybe even as a resident where somebody would come in

1139
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:58,520
from an outside hospital sick as shit, just absolutely on death's door. And all we did was

1140
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:03,160
turn off everything and the patient got better because they were just overmanaged. And I think

1141
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:09,480
I struggle a little bit with this sort of where I want to be in that spectrum and how aggressive I

1142
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:14,360
should be in looking for say a cult coronary disease, which I think is a question you get

1143
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,440
a lot and I get a lot. One of the major reasons somebody comes to see me as a preventive

1144
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:23,160
cardiologist is they say, am I going to die of a heart attack? And what's my risk of dying from a

1145
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:29,960
heart attack? Or my brother died of a heart attack at 44, what should I do? And I still don't have an

1146
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:35,320
answer about how aggressive I should be in trying to understand it. But a lot of these tests we'll

1147
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:40,280
talk about, I think feed into that. And I think ultimately what we're missing, and I hope we can

1148
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:46,600
eventually refine it and make it better, is a good way to predict disease risk in these chronic

1149
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:50,440
diseases, these common chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, that

1150
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:58,680
we just don't now yet have the tools to be able to say, Peter, well, your risk is X, Y, or Z. And so

1151
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:03,240
therefore we should do this or this or this in terms of prevention. Understanding that there's

1152
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:07,080
going to be risk in each one of these things that we do and there may be risk in even part of the

1153
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:11,480
process of getting from here to here, point A to point B. So I'm glad you brought that up because

1154
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:19,240
it illustrates the challenge that frankly can't be explained or rationalized or described on Twitter,

1155
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:23,880
not to pick on Twitter, but just to... So there's this idea which you've said, which is,

1156
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:28,760
I don't know sometimes how aggressive to be or not to be. And what you're really saying is at the

1157
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:34,200
individual level with you as my patient sitting in front of me, I don't know how aggressive to be or

1158
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:40,360
not to be. You're not asking the question on average. And yet what tool are you given to guide

1159
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:47,160
you? You are given a tool called a clinical trial, which is by its very nature all about averages.

1160
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:53,800
And so therein lies the mismatch of what I've described as Medicine 2.0. When I say described,

1161
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,080
meaning I'm writing about it in this book I'm working on that hopefully I'll have finished

1162
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:03,880
by the time I'm alive or not alive. And the idea is it's not the poo poo clinical trials,

1163
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:08,200
it's just to acknowledge that clinical trials give us great information on averages and the

1164
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:14,760
larger and more robust the trial, generally the more heterogeneous the data. But you've asked

1165
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,640
a question that comes down to judgment. You know what it means to be aggressive and you know what

1166
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:25,480
it means to be conservative and you know what the corners of that box look like. What you're asking

1167
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:31,400
is I could have two people in front of me that superficially look similar, but actually one of

1168
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:35,480
them is probably going to have a better outcome if I behave aggressively and the other one might have

1169
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:40,600
a better outcome if I behave conservatively. It's the challenge to figure out which one's which.

1170
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:46,040
If you're a hammer and everything's a nail, even if you're acting as a hammer and nail in

1171
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:51,400
accordance with clinical trials, I suspect you are still acting in a very blunt manner.

1172
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:56,840
A hundred percent, but I'm also talking about these areas and I think prevention is a great

1173
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:02,200
example that are sort of outside the boundary of what's been studied or is likely to be studied

1174
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:06,440
in the context of a clinical trial. I mean there's not going to be a clinical trial to answer a lot

1175
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:11,400
of the questions that I have about how to manage my patients. I feel the same way. I mean prevention

1176
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:18,840
is not really amenable to this idea of medicine 2.0, which is clinical trial, average outcome,

1177
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:25,320
short duration, simple intervention, easy to measure outcome. It's the economic thing. I mean

1178
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:30,280
you're a company and you want to get your product to market whether that product is a stent or a

1179
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,760
drug or whatever it is and the best way to do that economically is the shortest amount of time and so

1180
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,160
you want to take the sickest people. So these trials, I mean I joke that like a prevention

1181
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:43,480
trial, all kinds of trials that I want to do would take 50 or 60 years. How do you convince somebody

1182
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:48,280
I'm about to be 50? I wouldn't want to start a trial that I'm not going to see the answer from,

1183
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:53,880
the result from. So it's unsettling to me and again I think you just have to remain humble as

1184
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:58,520
I've tried to and hope that your patients, your human patients have some patients that were going

1185
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:03,800
to be wrong. Their litany of examples like LPLAA was something I didn't pay attention to until

1186
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,960
the past few years. Coronary calcium scan, if somebody came to see me with a coronary calcium

1187
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:13,160
scan 10 years ago, I would say I wish I didn't have this information but I never ordered one

1188
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,560
before seven to eight years ago. So there are lots of examples of things that I didn't use to do that

1189
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:24,280
I've now incorporated into my practice and I'm doing so without that like safety belt of evidence

1190
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:30,200
basis that we're used to, right? There's not going to be a orbit like trial to help me decide whether

1191
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:35,560
I should be aggressive with lipid lowering in a 35 year old. That's not going to happen with primary

1192
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:40,360
prevention. So we have a mutual patient in whom that's exactly the type of question that's being

1193
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:45,240
asked, right? Yeah. And there's a term and I know all these cute little terms and I never know who to

1194
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:50,840
attribute them to but we talk about evidence-based medicine versus evidence-informed medicine. And to

1195
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:56,920
me the latter just makes much more sense because these decisions that you have to make virtually

1196
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:03,160
every day and I feel like I'm in the same situation, virtually nothing that I do can I

1197
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:09,640
point to the orbiter or courage equivalent. I mean it just doesn't exist and certainly not if you

1198
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:15,800
really wanted to scrutinize it, every single thing is a variation on a theme that stems from some

1199
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,440
clinical trial. But if you really wanted to be a skeptic you would say nope that's not the exact

1200
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,480
same patient and that's not the exact same situation and therefore you can talk yourself

1201
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:31,800
out of doing anything. And I'm super fond of saying that being a preventive cardiologist is

1202
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:36,280
no one should feel sorry for me. I have the best job in the world but it's difficult in that we

1203
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:41,880
only know success by the absence of failure. So there's no one who's going to come to me tomorrow

1204
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:47,720
and say gosh Ethan, thank you for the fact that I'm 46 that I did not have a heart attack again

1205
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:52,280
this year. It just doesn't happen. That's a great way to explain it. Whereas the other way around

1206
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:56,840
like I've had a few patients. But as an orthopedic surgeon for example, you break your leg,

1207
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,520
you fix it. Or an interventional cardiologist, right? You show up in the cath lab with that

1208
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:05,400
STEMI, you know what you did. The outcome is clear. The outcome is not that clear in prevention unless

1209
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,840
there's failure. So those examples and I've had a few recently that I've been public about them

1210
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:17,240
on Twitter that are treatment failures but maybe not personal failures. In fact, I don't think I

1211
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:23,000
managed the patients incorrectly. But the fact is they had events while they were under my care.

1212
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,080
Those live with you for a long time. So then the question is, I know you're a race card driver,

1213
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:31,080
the question is, is your reaction to that to then have a tendency to want to oversteer?

1214
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:36,200
So because I have these anecdotes, these very profound anecdotes of young people who've had

1215
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:43,080
terrifyingly scary outcomes and I was not as aggressive as I could have been but probably

1216
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:47,400
still following the sort of guidelines, is that going to guide me as a physician to be more

1217
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:52,120
aggressive in the future? And again, we're not going to have clinical trial data to help us here.

1218
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:57,560
This is all art and judgment. The subtitle of my book, I'm hoping if the publisher lets me,

1219
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:01,960
is going to be called The Science and Art of Longevity. There's a title to it, but that's

1220
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:06,120
the subtitle and I'm insistent upon that order because normally you say it in the reverse,

1221
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:11,000
the art and science of whatever. But it's the science and art. You're informed by science,

1222
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,320
but in the end, this still comes down to an art.

1223
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:17,480
Well, it's the art of the science too, as you said. It is sort of how do you put this and then

1224
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:21,960
there's the whole other layer, which is how do you communicate it with your patients and how do you

1225
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:26,040
include them as a partner in making these decisions? I mean, that's where things get

1226
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,480
really interesting. And there are other physicians because typically these are not just discussions

1227
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:33,800
between two people. So what's a CAC, what's a CTA and how do you use them?

1228
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:38,600
The way I break this down is there's anatomy, so anatomic tests and their physiologic tests. So

1229
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,920
physiologic tests, it'd be like a stress test, a treadmill test. So you get up on the treadmill,

1230
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:48,440
you walk and then you have one of a few different ways to kind of determine in addition to whether

1231
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:52,280
you have symptoms, determine whether there's ischemia, meaning there's a difference in the supply and

1232
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:57,080
demand of oxygen. So you can use an EKG or you can use an ECHO or you can use what's called nuclear,

1233
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:03,320
which is basically a radio labeled potassium analog that lights up living cells. So that's one

1234
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:09,320
way, that's the physiology. And that's been the standard of care in this field for 40 years.

1235
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:16,040
In the past 20 years or so, people have started to explore whether there's a role for anatomy. So

1236
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:20,600
one anatomic test is an angiogram. So you can take somebody to the cath lab and you can

1237
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:24,200
put a catheter up there and inject some dye into the artery and you can see if it looks like there

1238
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:29,400
are blockages. That's not something that you would apply broadly to a population. You wouldn't use

1239
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:33,640
that as a screening test. And patients often ask me, in fact, sometimes people will come in the

1240
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,720
office and they'll say, I should have an angiogram. No symptoms, just I want to have an angiogram. I

1241
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,800
want to know that I don't have any. Right. Just to preventative, get a baseline. Yes. Which is very

1242
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:48,040
much like I want to make sure I don't have colon cancer or breast cancer. And the same things that

1243
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:53,000
come up as being difficult and controversial in any screening, whether it's prostate cancer

1244
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,600
screening, breast cancer screening, any of these screening areas are going to be super controversial

1245
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:01,480
here. But I think the community agrees mostly that screening angiography is not appropriate. But

1246
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:05,080
the question is, are there other things that could be appropriate in the right people?

1247
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:10,200
And in general, the population of people that we're talking about are people in this intermediate

1248
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:13,880
risk category. So if you're low risk, for the most part, there's not going to be much benefit to

1249
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:17,720
adding one of these tests. We're talking about asymptomatic people here. So if you're symptomatic,

1250
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:22,440
you fall into a different category altogether. So asymptomatic people, and if you're high risk,

1251
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:27,720
you probably fall into a different category as well. And what I tell people is that the results

1252
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:33,720
of these anatomic tests that we might do are really about answering one question, which is

1253
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:39,480
how aggressive should we be with our medical therapy? And what they are, they are triggers

1254
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:45,880
for basically saying yes or no to statins or yes or no to statins and PCS-canine inhibitors.

1255
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,240
Basically, it's a way of gauging how aggressive we want to be. So again, low risk, you're probably

1256
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:53,960
not going to use a statin anyway, except in sort of unusual circumstances. Say somebody has like a

1257
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:58,280
very early and extreme family history or something else is funny, but if somebody falls into a low

1258
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,320
risk category, they probably get left alone. So it's these intermediate risk people. So

1259
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:07,880
there was a doctor, I believe he was from Houston named Agustin, and he came up with this idea so

1260
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:15,240
people could see on chest x-rays back a hundred years that if somebody had a blocked artery,

1261
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:19,160
that there was a likelihood that you could see the outline of the artery on the chest x-ray,

1262
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:25,080
that's because calcium is radio opaque. So people realize that these arteries, again by autopsies

1263
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:31,160
and other conventional imaging, that these arteries get calcified as they develop more plaque. And so

1264
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:36,440
this radiologist in Houston figured out that there was a linear relationship between the amount of

1265
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:40,520
plaque that you have and the degree of calcium that you have in your arteries. And so he developed a

1266
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:46,280
quantitative measure and that's called the coronary artery calcium scan or SCORE. And that

1267
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:52,600
is a low dose radiation screening test that basically just looks for this one thing,

1268
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:56,760
which is calcium. And then it quantitatively tells you how much you have and it then gives you

1269
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,320
on a percentile basis what you are, what you should be based on your age and sex.

1270
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:06,120
So that's a calcium scan. It's worth pausing for a moment to make sure, because this is a discussion

1271
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:10,520
I tend to have with patients a lot, which is what does it mean if it shows nothing, meaning your

1272
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:15,720
score is zero? What does it mean if it shows anything that's not zero? And to explain this

1273
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:21,240
to patients, I usually have to again pull out the pathology textbook and explain all of the things

1274
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:26,840
that happen before you would see calcification. So when you look at the stages of lesions,

1275
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:31,640
calcification is a very late process. You described it earlier as basically the repair

1276
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:38,520
of damage. So if you have a calcium score of zero, does it mean you have perfect coronary

1277
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:45,320
arteries? You can't conclude. Yeah, this is a really important point. And to me, there's been

1278
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:48,920
a lot of work on sort of what people call the power of zero. So what does a calcium score of zero

1279
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:56,280
mean? To me, it's all about the context. So in a 25 year old or my 15 year old daughter is going to

1280
01:44:56,280 --> 01:45:01,000
have a calcium score of zero. It's meaningless. It gives you absolutely no additional risk

1281
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:07,240
stratification. Conversely, when a 90 year old shows up and has a calcium score of zero,

1282
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:12,520
it's quite informative. Informative. And in fact, I have some patients in their 70s and 80s

1283
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:18,040
who I've taken off of statins because they had a calcium score of zero. And in those patients,

1284
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:22,840
their risk of having a heart attack is not zero, but it's low one percent. I mean, again, let's

1285
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:28,280
remember that the biggest risk factor for having a heart attack is your age. So age supersedes

1286
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:32,840
everything else that supersedes all the other known risk factors that we use every day. Your

1287
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,960
lipids, your blood pressure, the presence or absence of diabetes. Although I will throw in my

1288
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:41,560
rant here. Why is age the greatest risk factor? I don't know. It's a good question. I mean, I would

1289
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:46,600
argue as Alan Snyderman has argued that it's an area under the curve issue. It's an exposure

1290
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:53,640
question. So age is the greatest risk factor for a number of diseases in which it's not entirely

1291
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:59,640
clear why, but I think in atherosclerosis, you would have to argue that this area under the curve

1292
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:04,760
shows a monotonic progression in an individual just as we see progression of polyptych cancer

1293
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:11,880
in the colon. So that's exactly why I think the older you are, the more interesting it is to have

1294
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:17,400
a zero calcium score. It's Bayes theorem at its finest. You are acquiring more and more information

1295
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:22,600
as somebody goes on. So, you know, when I see 35 year olds with zero calcium scores saying, see,

1296
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:28,360
I'm totally fine. I say, I have no goddamn clue. How do you know that? But the contrast is that if

1297
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:32,440
you see a 35 year old who does have calcium. That's exactly right. That's informative. So there you

1298
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:37,560
have the way I describe it is it's a two by two and there's only two quadrants that are interesting

1299
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:45,720
to me. Young people, meaning someone under say 45 or 50 who has calcification and old people,

1300
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:51,960
and I'm sorry to use the term old, but older folks call it someone over 70 who has no calcification.

1301
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:57,000
If you're in those categories, Bayes theorem is lighting up like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,

1302
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,360
ding, ding. If you're in the other two quadrants, I don't think I've learned anything mostly. So I

1303
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:06,920
started again, I frame this as I started off thinking there was no value calcium scans.

1304
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,120
I evolved to think, all right, well, there's going to be value in these two

1305
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:15,160
quadrants you describe. I also think there's probably some value in the extremes in say,

1306
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:21,160
I saw a patient recently who was in his fifties, early fifties who had a calcium score of 1300,

1307
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:26,680
asymptomatic primary prevention. I have a 49 year old who just scored 4500.

1308
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:32,280
So that, I mean, that to me is useful, right? So that takes us again, not going to ever be

1309
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:35,720
supported by clinical trials, but that takes us from, okay, well now we all agree that you should

1310
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:41,000
be on at least statin for primary prevention, but maybe we want to be even more aggressive,

1311
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,920
right? And so that's when you start thinking, this is actually going to change what we do

1312
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:49,960
or change at least in my head, the risk benefit ratio. Anecdotally, I want to tell you about that

1313
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:54,120
patient because this is just getting off in the weeds a little bit. This is a patient who's

1314
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:59,720
family history. If I shared it with you, you would say, oh, he's going to have an elevated LP little

1315
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:07,080
A. Father had first MI at 42, dead by 49, brother had MI in forties, et cetera, et cetera. When you

1316
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:12,520
hear these stories, you say, well, it's elevated LP little A for sure. You do an advanced blood

1317
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:17,400
test on him, normal LP little A, and you want to know something else? Lip bits aren't even that

1318
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:24,360
crazy. It's not like he's got FH. It's not like he's got an Apo B in the 99th percentile. Yeah,

1319
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:29,960
he's probably in the 70th percentile, but it's like these are the patients that keep you up at

1320
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,400
night. And it's like when I was talking to Richard Isaacson about Alzheimer's disease,

1321
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:39,320
he's way more afraid of the patients with a ravaging family history of Alzheimer's disease

1322
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:44,360
who have normal Apo E because there's clearly something going on and I don't even know what

1323
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:50,040
it is. And that's sort of how we feel about these patients of which we have many where it's not even

1324
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:55,640
like, you know, they're at the 70th or 80th percentile of risk by lipids and by other metrics,

1325
01:48:55,640 --> 01:49:01,960
but by story and now by calcium and other tests. I mean, they're at the 99th percentile. I had a

1326
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:05,640
patient I talked about a lot on Twitter a couple of weeks ago who ended up in his early fifties,

1327
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:09,800
they ended up having like a very, very tight proximal left main, like just the kind of thing

1328
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:13,240
that you're the so-called widow maker. You look at this thing and you think there's no way in the

1329
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:19,320
world this guy should have walked into my office and he did. And his first past lipids were all

1330
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:24,360
completely normal. You know, his regular fasting lip. He had no obvious risk factors. And then

1331
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:29,000
we got his LPA back and it was high and I was relieved and I was relieved because on the one

1332
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
hand I knew I understood what was going on. On the other hand, we're still left with this.

1333
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:37,800
Well, we still don't really have a direct therapy to offer.

1334
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,960
But at least we've got a couple of indirect things till Sam Tameka says ASOs are around.

1335
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,600
Did you look at his aortic valve yet? It's normal.

1336
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,480
It is. Yeah.

1337
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,160
That's so interesting. I would have guessed someone that young with such aggressive

1338
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:54,520
athera would also have something abnormal in his aortic valve. Interesting. All right. So that's

1339
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:59,800
the calcium score. I've always found it very difficult to interpret the data on this because

1340
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:05,720
they tend to report it without clearly specifying the age cohort. So for example, everybody loves

1341
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:11,320
to quote a study that would say a zero calcium score means your 10 year risk is 1.9% or something

1342
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,080
to that effect. But you can't actually say that without knowing the age of the cohort

1343
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:20,040
because a zero calcium score in a group of 30 year olds probably has a 10 year risk of less than 1%.

1344
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:26,600
A zero calcium score in a cohort of 70 year olds would clearly be 5 to 10% still. So that's another

1345
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,600
thing that I just find very sloppy. But I don't have these discussions too much in social media

1346
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:34,200
because I find it so frustrating. But it's that you just don't have the time to explain that nuance

1347
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,680
to folks. It's a great point. And I use the Mesa calculator because it's a nice, you know, it has

1348
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:42,920
the traditional risk factors and then you can add in the calcium score if you have it.

1349
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:48,440
So Mesa, multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, one of the two largest cohorts we have

1350
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:53,160
ever to study atherosclerosis along with Framingham. And then they'll give you the 10 year risk

1351
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:56,440
plus or minus. So they'll say, well, this is what the 10 year risk would have been without the

1352
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,600
calcium. And that's somewhat helpful. But again, it comes back to this being way more

1353
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:04,200
art than science. I mean, this is at this point in primary prevention, this is still

1354
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:08,120
very much art and not science and probably will be for our lifetime. So we'll have to get used to that.

1355
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:12,680
So then CT angiograms basically said, look, we're going to do more or less what the angiogram did

1356
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:16,360
in terms of providing anatomic detail because the calcium score doesn't really give you anatomic

1357
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:21,160
detail of the artery. It's basically just showing you show me every place where there was a disaster

1358
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:26,200
that's been repaired. The CTA says, well, now I'm going to actually show you both the negative and

1359
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:29,880
positive image of the artery. So you'll see everything that's going on. But it's in many

1360
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:34,920
ways even a better test than the angiogram because you get to see the wall and you can look for soft

1361
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:40,440
plaque or other forms of injury to the artery that haven't yet reached the point of calcification.

1362
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:43,240
Assuming somebody doesn't have a lot of calcium, if somebody has a lot of calcium, then you can't

1363
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:47,320
really do it. And assuming that you can block the heart down, the scanners have gotten fast enough

1364
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:51,480
now that the quality of the data we get back from these is spectacular. And we get this information

1365
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:56,040
we never used to have unless you did Ivas. So I was as intrasculine ultrasound. So when you do an

1366
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:01,400
angiogram, you don't get to see what's underneath the endothelium. You have to infer it. So now you

1367
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:06,280
can see it. So you can see not just the plaque. So I'm fond, I have a strong family history of

1368
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:12,680
melanoma and I'm told by my dermatology colleagues that nevi melanoma grows down before it grows up.

1369
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:16,840
So what's happening underneath the surface you can't see. And then when it starts to grow,

1370
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:22,120
you start to see on the surface. That's right. Luminal narrowing is a very, very late consequence

1371
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:27,160
of atherosclerosis. So that's why I said if we did a CTA on us or an average 50 year old, you'd see

1372
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:31,960
plaque. It may not narrow the lumen more than a couple percent if at all. It may just look like

1373
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:37,000
a normal variation and sort of lumpy bumpiness. But you'll see plaque and that plaque grows down

1374
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,320
before it grows up. There's a ton of information. The question of course is what is the value of

1375
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:45,160
that information and how does it change our management? That's odd. To me it just adds color

1376
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:50,440
to the discussion we already had. It adds great benefit on the negative and on the positive

1377
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:56,200
depending on the age. But you take that patient with a zero calcium score whose CT angiogram

1378
01:52:56,200 --> 01:53:00,840
is pristine. Their arteries are enormously patent and there's not a shred of evidence of soft plaque.

1379
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:07,000
It's still not a guarantee. I mean we know that right. Even IVUS could miss plaque or vulnerability.

1380
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:12,200
But it makes you feel a bit more comfortable that your level of aggression can be lower and the

1381
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:17,640
converse then is true as well. So then what's the cost right? So other than the theoretical cost of

1382
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:22,200
the radiation which is probably something. Yeah right now they're going so fast. These things are

1383
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:28,520
at a really good scanner so that the top shelf scanners here are doing CT angiograms at about

1384
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:33,800
two milli sieverts of radiation. So for the listener milli sieverts the unit in which we

1385
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:41,320
measure radiation. The NRC limits people or suggests an upper limit of 50 milli sieverts for a year.

1386
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:48,600
We want our patients to be below 20 milli sieverts for a year. Living at sea level exposes you to

1387
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:54,200
maybe one milli sievert over the course of a year. Living in Denver probably exposes you to four or

1388
01:53:54,200 --> 01:54:00,840
five milli sieverts for a year. So that puts the two milli sieverts in context. The first generations

1389
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:06,520
of these Ethan 20 milli sieverts just for a CT angiogram. What's a chest x-ray? Incredibly low.

1390
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:11,400
It's less than one milli sievert. So we can sort of dismiss that. There's very little risk of the

1391
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:15,240
contrast in most people. Obviously if you're older you have kidney disease something else that it

1392
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:18,600
becomes a different issue. One of the greatest costs is the economic cost. It's rarely covered

1393
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:22,680
and it's a, I don't remember exact cost, but it's not trivial. It's probably, you know, $2,000,

1394
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:28,520
$2,500. So it's a quite expensive study relative to the CT, the calcium score, which I got to put

1395
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:33,800
a plug in by the way. Your institution here needs to get its head out of its ass. I mean, jeez us.

1396
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:38,600
I send patients to Stanford. Stanford. Stanford's doing CT angiograms for like a hundred bucks.

1397
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:42,760
And you coconuts here are charging like thousands of dollars. Don't get me started. Well, I think

1398
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,880
it'll change now with the new guidelines. I think the price has to come down, but it's such an

1399
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:49,160
interesting. I have to send patients from San Francisco to drive down to Stanford. They're

1400
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:53,320
pissed off, but I'm like, you know, I tell my patients, this is the one example of they're

1401
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:57,720
actually being an efficient market in medicine, right? Because third party payers don't pay for

1402
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:01,800
it up until recently. They haven't paid for it. You have to pay for it out of pocket. So these

1403
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,560
guys realize the only way they're going to get it, no one's going to pay $3,000 to get it. It's the

1404
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:10,200
same basic machine, same everything else. It's just that there there's a market. It's a fixed

1405
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:14,280
cost is already sunk and there's no variable cost. It's just, yeah, it's comical. The question

1406
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:19,960
then is sort of what is the risk of the CTA? And so from my perspective, the risk is with the right

1407
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,720
patient, the right doctor is zero. The wrong patient, the wrong doctor, it could be high.

1408
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:28,600
And so the example I use is I've got patients and I'm sure you have a lot too who are anxious and

1409
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:33,160
they can't, even though they don't anticipate that they're going to be this way, they can't live with

1410
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:38,360
this sort of thing growing inside of them. I'm sure you had patients when you were doing cancer

1411
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:42,920
surgery who just basically said, get this tumor, the hell out of me. I don't want cancer anymore.

1412
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:46,520
Get it out. And even though prostate cancer is a great example, right? There are lots of ways to

1413
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:50,360
treat prostate cancer today. And some of them involve cutting the tumor out. Others that are

1414
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:55,800
equally as effective probably are close don't, but some people mentally can't get their head around

1415
01:55:55,800 --> 01:56:00,120
living with cancer. And I think I have patients of mine who, when they get a CTA and they see

1416
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:04,680
there's plaque there, they just can't sleep because they think this thing is going, I'm going to die

1417
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:10,200
from a heart attack. And no matter what we say, no matter what I say, I can't dissuade them of that.

1418
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:14,760
That to me is the one cause. So that's where I would sort of say, this is why I'm not going to,

1419
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:18,600
that in the economic thing is sort of why I'm not going to widely do this in everybody.

1420
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:24,200
But in certain people it's spectacular. So before we leave this, let's just talk about what heart

1421
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:27,880
flow is, because that's something that's come on the scene and about the past. I want to say it's

1422
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:32,600
about three years ago, maybe four years ago. It's a company here in the Bay area, correct? And

1423
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:39,880
they're layering on an analysis to the CTN diagram. Can you explain a little bit about what that is

1424
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:44,360
and where it came about? I'm going to try and keep it brief. Cause I got quoted in an article

1425
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:47,960
over the summer about heart flow. And I think I said something like, I don't wake up in the middle

1426
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:52,280
of the night dreaming about which patient I want to use heart flow in. So I don't want to be too

1427
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:58,600
harsh on them. This is basically based on the idea that you can use physics to measure the

1428
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:05,320
percent narrowing of an artery by measuring the velocity across the lesion. So as you, anyone who

1429
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:08,680
puts their finger on the end of a garden hose knows that the velocity of the water that comes

1430
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:13,240
out of the garden hose goes up as you narrow the opening of the garden hose. So the same thing is

1431
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:18,600
true in an artery. If you have a narrowing, then the velocity across that is going to be faster.

1432
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:22,760
And there will be a pressure gradient. So you can actually measure pressure using a catheter

1433
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:27,160
with a pressure sensor on it. And you can measure pressure before and after the blockage. And you

1434
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:32,360
can basically then infer how severe the blockage is. And that technique was first developed

1435
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:37,640
invasively in people who were going into the cath lab. And there were patients where you'd

1436
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:41,480
look at the artery and you'd think, yeah, we're looking at this in two dimensions and we can't

1437
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:45,720
really see it doesn't, it's hard to see exactly how severe this is. So there were a couple of

1438
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:49,880
these tools that were developed. One of them is this intravascular ultrasound, Ivas. And then

1439
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:54,680
the other one was this FFR, which is a way of measuring pressure and basically inferring the

1440
01:57:54,680 --> 01:58:01,640
degree of blockage that way. So fractional flow reserve is the calculation of P2, which is the

1441
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:06,840
pressure beyond the occlusion over P1. Right. And they do it before and after

1442
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:11,560
administering a vasodilator. So they'll give a patient a vasodilator and they can measure

1443
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:15,880
sort of maximal blood flow. And you can do that in a normal artery, in a normal artery, you'll see

1444
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:22,280
it augment in a diseased artery, it doesn't, it'll go down. And there are two big trials that looked

1445
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:27,560
at the use of invasive fractional flow reserve. One was called FAME, the other was called FAME2.

1446
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:32,440
I'll spare everybody me looking up exactly what FAME stood for again. What did those studies show?

1447
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,080
The take home, and again, there's controversy as with almost anything in cardiology, there's

1448
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:41,320
controversy. But the take home was that if you had an FFR that was less than 0.8, so you use a

1449
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:46,200
mathematical format to basically calculate. And if it was less than 0.8, if you then put a stint in

1450
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:51,800
that artery, people did better. So it suggested that this could be a useful tool to help stratify

1451
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,440
who should be getting stents and who shouldn't be getting stents. And I think a lot of our

1452
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:58,120
interventional cardiology colleagues have been using it that way for the past few years.

1453
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:01,640
Again, there are questions, I don't want to get into the controversy, but there are questions

1454
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:06,680
about the technique and about how they did it. And there are some questions about the validity of it,

1455
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:11,880
but it's mostly a useful tool and people do use it, but it's invasive. So you have to be having

1456
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,560
an angiogram to do it. So somebody came up with this idea that you could do the same thing

1457
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:22,360
using just a non-invasive CT scan. And you could basically measure the velocity and infer the

1458
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:28,040
pressure using Ohm's law. So they did the same thing. They gave it to basically dilate or not.

1459
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,200
And they can do this. And the oil's law. Sorry.

1460
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:35,160
Boils. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. You're the engineer. It's been a major.

1461
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:39,800
So they did this and lo and behold, they were able to measure this thing non-invasively. You

1462
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:45,160
don't have to have a catheterization. You can do it all through CT. And then heart flow basically

1463
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:50,120
is selling the software as an add-on package to the CTA and they'll give you what's called a

1464
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:55,160
CTFFR, which is their like calculated FFR. Is this changing your practice? Because I've,

1465
01:59:55,160 --> 02:00:00,840
you know, when it came out, I started doing it and then I realized, especially just based on

1466
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:05,640
orbita, that wasn't really going to change my management. So I have not done a heart flow study

1467
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:10,840
and probably over a year on anybody. That's the point. Whereas the anatomy of sort of whether

1468
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:14,600
there's plaque there does help guide you about how aggressive to be with your medical therapy.

1469
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:19,480
It's not clear to me that we're learning anything from adding the heart flow on. So I have never

1470
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:22,760
ordered one. It doesn't mean that I won't order one in the future. I've done a lot of this where

1471
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:27,000
I've said I've never ordered one. And then 10 years later I've ordered one. I've ordered a lot.

1472
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,680
So I reserved the right to be wrong on this one. But my instinct is like you say,

1473
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:35,160
we have the information from these two other big trials that tell us that this is probably not

1474
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:41,160
going to be a huge game changer because what information is it adding and how are we going

1475
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:45,560
to react to it? So their pitch from a business standpoint is that it saves unnecessary

1476
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:50,520
catheterizations. That's a business discussion that I think I generally don't believe right now,

1477
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:55,400
but that's their case. And if you're an individual patient, what value is it going to bring to you?

1478
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,960
Or you as a doctor, what value does it bring to you? I can't think of a big value today,

1479
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:04,120
unless you had somebody who you were going to send to the Catholic and you thought this would

1480
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:09,320
help sort of make you feel comfortable about not doing it. Let's pivot for a second. Because

1481
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:16,200
we're sitting here in your office. We've been nerding out for two hours on preventative

1482
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:22,120
cardiology, but I'm looking at your very, very beautiful whiteboard. And not only do I have

1483
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:27,480
tremendous whiteboard envy, but there's not a single thing on here that looks like it's about

1484
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:35,960
cardiology. If I didn't know better, I would think I was in the lab of David Sabatini or one of my

1485
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:43,080
other friends, you know, Luke Hantley. I mean, we've got insulin receptors, PI 3K. We've got

1486
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:49,880
mTOR. You've even delineated between mTOR complex one, two pathways to autophagy, lots of growth

1487
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:57,880
hormone, IGF pathways, pancreas, liver. Are we in your office? Whose office is this?

1488
02:01:57,880 --> 02:02:03,240
I came here to San Francisco 21 years ago to study in the lab. The person who became my mentor was

1489
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:07,320
my boss until he left to go work in Novartis a couple of years ago, a year ago, two years ago,

1490
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:10,840
Sean Coughlin. And I came here because I was interested in the biology of blood clotting.

1491
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:14,600
And so when I left his lab and decided that I want to stay here in San Francisco, I had to find

1492
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:18,680
something that I wanted to do that would be not what he was doing because that would be dumb.

1493
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:24,920
And so at that time I got very interested in the biology of sex differences. And I don't want to

1494
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:30,200
spend seven hours describing it, but it's a really interesting literature. And so I did a deep dive

1495
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:34,120
on it and thought, gosh, there's a lot of reasons to think that there may be significant differences

1496
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:40,280
in the way men and women behave clinically and biologically with regard to the clotting system.

1497
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:43,880
And there may be reasons to expect why that would be right. We talked a little bit before about the

1498
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:51,320
placenta and pregnancy. Men don't have to have this other thing living inside of them and therefore

1499
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:56,920
could afford maybe to optimize more towards a sort of wound healing defense strategy, right?

1500
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:01,480
Men, there's a difference in sort of the way you might, if you were to design a system, if you were

1501
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:05,880
to create evolution there, you may be able to optimize it. This system for the two sexes

1502
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:10,280
differently. That is the most interesting idea I've ever heard because one of the questions

1503
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:15,640
I've always batted about in my mind is all things equal, why are women less susceptible to

1504
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:20,040
cardiovascular disease? Or at least I wouldn't say it that way. Why do women experience a phase shift?

1505
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:25,320
They get it later. And you look at blood pressure differences. Maybe women have lower blood pressure.

1506
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:31,080
Another one is iron. Women have less iron for 30, 40 years of their life. They're basically

1507
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:37,160
doing a blood donation every month. I never once considered what you just said, which as you say,

1508
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:43,720
it actually makes a lot of sense. Men would in theory evolve to heal from a wound much quicker,

1509
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:49,800
even at greater cost down the line because of their role in a hunter-gatherer society.

1510
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:56,200
Whereas the woman must evolve to protect the offspring much more. And you could see how that

1511
02:03:56,200 --> 02:04:01,560
would be a lower immune response, a lower inflammatory response, a lower pro-thrombotic

1512
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:06,360
response. That's it. I can't believe I didn't even know that. Well, if you want to get really crazy,

1513
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:12,120
you can start to imagine, well, maybe women evolved to be the less sort of masculine of the

1514
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:16,200
sexes. In other words, maybe they're the ones not going out and throwing spears and fighting

1515
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:22,440
because they have to carry pregnancy. And so they're a little bit more susceptible to bleeding.

1516
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:27,320
There's the added sort of complication of menstruation, all these other things. So

1517
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:31,160
anyway, I thought, wow, this is a really interesting area. And the reason it was

1518
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:35,080
particularly interesting was that in the work that we had done primarily in mouse genetic models,

1519
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:39,640
it looked like there was a pretty significant difference in the rate of clotting between male

1520
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:43,320
and female mice. So I thought, well, this would be a really fun thing to study. And of course,

1521
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:48,440
I did exactly what you did, which was I immediately kind of latched onto what must be sex hormones

1522
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:53,480
and did some early kind of pilot studies looking at the role of estrogen, estrogen receptor

1523
02:04:53,480 --> 02:05:00,840
different. And it didn't pan out. And so I did more reading about sex dimorphism in general.

1524
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:06,280
And it turns out that mammals have this remarkable sexually dimorphic liver. So if you take the liver

1525
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:11,880
out of a, of a mammal, human or mouse, there's a set of genes that are expressed dramatically

1526
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:16,280
different, even up to a hundred fold different males and females. And a lot of these genes are

1527
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:21,480
genes that regulate sex hormone, sex hormone binding or modification. Others are sexually

1528
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:25,800
dimorphic for reasons we don't understand. But if you do a sort of array of gene expression,

1529
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:31,400
whether you're using an old fashioned chipper or whether you're doing RNA-seq, you see this

1530
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:36,200
tremendous signature difference between the genes that are turned on in the liver of females and

1531
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:41,720
males. Well, where clotting factors made the liver. So I thought, well, this is what we're

1532
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:48,120
going to do. And so I set off to like basically try and understand of how this happens. So what

1533
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:54,440
regulates the dimorphism of liver gene expression in mammals, it turns out it's not sex hormones.

1534
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:59,800
That's actually secondary. It turns out that it's a dimorphic pattern of growth hormone secretion. So

1535
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:04,520
it was described back in the fifties and sixties that there was a factor from the pituitary called

1536
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:09,640
feminizing factor, but it wasn't known what it was. If you just ground up the extract of the pituitary

1537
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:14,520
and injected it into a male or female mouse, you could basically drive the expression of these

1538
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:20,360
genes. And ultimately it was found in a beautiful paper. I think it was published in 1982 in cell

1539
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:24,920
by Richard Palmer's group. It was found that that factor is growth hormone. And that if you-

1540
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:28,360
Which by the way is the last one I would have predicted. Like I would have said, oh, it's

1541
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:32,360
probably luteinizing hormone or follicle stimulating hormone. I wouldn't have guessed growth hormone.

1542
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:36,040
No, it's growth hormone. So, you know, males have a more pulsatile pattern of growth hormone

1543
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:39,960
secretion. So they have longer intervals between the pulses. Females are more continuous. And so

1544
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:45,480
they have, they have very short- So the guys have these spikes that are less frequent and the women

1545
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:49,800
are putting now area under the curve about the same. Mean is the same. So what's cool is you

1546
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:55,800
can actually take an intact normal wild type male rodent and put a pump in and deliver continuous

1547
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:00,360
growth hormone. And you can completely reverse the signature of their gene expression in the liver.

1548
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:04,600
And you can do the opposite with a female mouse. Take a female mouse and it, because if you give

1549
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:07,960
exogenous growth hormone, you basically suppress endogenous growth hormone secretion from the

1550
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:12,920
pituitary. You can give a couple of injections. I think it's just one or two a day to a female

1551
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:17,160
mouse and you masculinize the liver. We live in a world where a lot of people have decided it's a

1552
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:22,040
good idea to prescribe growth hormone to reduce the effects of aging. I talked about this very

1553
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:28,680
briefly with Nier Barzilai on our podcast. And I would say that Nier's view from that was that

1554
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:33,400
there might be some benefit in men in certain circumstances and women less so. But is it safe

1555
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,840
to say that if a man and a woman are both receiving the same dose and same dosing pattern

1556
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:44,920
of exogenous growth hormone, you would evaporate that difference of gene expression in the liver?

1557
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:49,080
Because you would have suppressed the pituitary secretion? Yes, you should. Have you done that

1558
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:54,200
experiment? In people? No, in mice? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We did that experience. So I got into

1559
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:57,960
this because I was interested in clotting and that makes sense as a cardiologist. I just,

1560
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:01,480
we just spent two hours talking about why clotting is interesting to a cardiologist. So

1561
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:04,680
starting off my lab as a junior assistant professor, I thought, well, this is what I'm

1562
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:08,600
going to do. I'll understand the biological basis of sex differences of clotting, get into this

1563
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:13,560
growth hormone pattern. And so we started to do that. And we, as a lot of people of my generation

1564
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:18,920
do, science is a little bit of a game of you do whatever else does and see what comes out. And so

1565
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:22,760
we started knocking out different components of the growth hormone signaling pathway in mouse.

1566
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:28,440
And we got to this protein called Jack two, which is a kinase, which basically adds a phosphate

1567
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:33,080
group to proteins. And it's important for other areas of medicine and science, but it's

1568
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:38,040
obligate signal transducer of growth hormones. So downstream of the receptor growth hormone binds,

1569
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:43,000
Jack two basically allows this signal to be transduced. Is there a different receptor

1570
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:49,000
for growth hormone in the liver versus outside of the liver? No, GHR is the same everywhere.

1571
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,360
There are different isoforms. I think there's a soluble one, which is basically a GH binding

1572
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:58,520
protein, but the GHR is the same and that signal is transduced because growth hormone receptor

1573
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:02,440
itself is a type one psychoreceptor. It doesn't have any intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.

1574
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:08,520
It has to partner with this other non-receptor tyrosine kinase Jack two to transduce the signal.

1575
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:14,200
So we eventually knocked out Jack two in the liver and hepatocytes. And I'll never forget that I had

1576
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:18,280
a technician working in the lab at the time. He actually, he was the only person working in the

1577
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:21,960
lab at the time. It was just the two of us. And he came to me, he said, Ethan, there's something

1578
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:26,040
wrong with these livers. I don't even need to genotype them. And I'll show you a picture,

1579
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:31,480
but it turns out that the livers in the animals where we had selectively deleted Jack two in

1580
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:35,960
hepatocytes were basically turned into adipose tissue. It was the most-

1581
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:37,560
So you were creating NAFLD? Yes.

1582
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:43,320
So just to make sure I understand what you're saying. If you knock out Jack two in a liver,

1583
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:49,240
you prevent growth hormone from exerting its transduction in the liver because you need Jack

1584
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:55,320
two as that second tyrosine kinase. So it's basically like taking away growth hormone from

1585
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:59,960
the liver. That's right. And if you do that, you accumulate fat in the liver.

1586
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:01,480
25 fold increase in-

1587
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:06,200
25 fold. So it becomes clinically grotesque. I mean, you just basically create foie gras.

1588
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:09,400
In fact, there was a moment in time where I thought, well, this would be a fun side business.

1589
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,960
I'll just make foie gras because we can engineer it.

1590
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:15,320
Quick question. Did the triglycerides go up or stay the same?

1591
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:16,040
Zero.

1592
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:16,600
Yes.

1593
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:17,640
No, they were the same.

1594
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:22,760
So in other words, you shut off export, it seems like significantly, right? There was no flux.

1595
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:26,680
There's no outward. You were basically not getting any VLDL or triglyceride out of those livers.

1596
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:30,280
Well, so we didn't know what we did at the beginning. We had no idea. In fact, I took

1597
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:33,960
the liver to a pathologist because I said, I don't know what this is because I didn't know what it

1598
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:37,320
was. And he said, Ethan, I'll look at another microscope for you, but I know what this is.

1599
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:40,040
And I said, what's that? He said, it's NAFLD. I said, what's NAFLD? And he said,

1600
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:45,080
it's non-alcoholic fatty liver. And I said, okay. And so then of course, I started with the very

1601
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:48,840
basic, like, all right, well, what are the causes of NAFLD? It's an increase in synthesis,

1602
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:53,160
so increase in DNL, the decrease in export, increase in uptake, or it's decrease in oxidation.

1603
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:58,040
So we started to go through this whole list. And to make a very long story short, what we settled on

1604
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:03,320
and published, we published a model that I think mostly we've validated to be true,

1605
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:06,680
although there's a little bit of controversy about it. And it comes back to what you said.

1606
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:11,880
So growth-errant signals and one of the products of growth-errant signaling in the hepatocyte and

1607
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:18,360
other cells is this protein called IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor one. And 95% of circulating,

1608
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:23,240
if not more of circulating IGF-1 in the plasma. So if you take blood of you or mate comes from

1609
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:27,800
the liver, so it's liver derived. So if you knock out growth hormone signaling in hepatocytes,

1610
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:34,200
you completely shut off and shut down circulating IGF-1. There's still local IGF-1 in cells and

1611
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:39,720
tissues, but circulating IGF-1 goes to zero. And circulating IGF-1 is the plasma biosensor for

1612
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:44,280
growth hormones. Growth hormones half-life is extremely short. So we evolved a system to

1613
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:48,120
measure growth hormone levels, not by measuring growth hormone itself, but by measuring IGF-1.

1614
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:53,240
So when IGF-1 levels fall, the hypothalamus pituitary sense that, and then they turn on

1615
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:57,560
a growth hormone. That is so brilliant. Just as an engineer, I have to sort of reflect on that

1616
02:11:57,560 --> 02:12:03,160
for a moment. Every time I hear something like what you just said, I'm so glad that I was not

1617
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:08,040
in charge of evolution. Because I would have screwed that one up. I would have said, make

1618
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:15,880
the growth hormone sensor sense growth hormone. And of course you would get into a cyclic amplified

1619
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:21,320
response because of how short it sticks around. But instead, luckily evolution was in charge and

1620
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:26,600
not me, it said, no, no, no, no, dude, that's going to be way too fluctuating. Let's look at something

1621
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:31,320
that's much more stable. That's a readout of growth hormone. Oh, hey, how about IGF? And have

1622
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:37,640
that be the feedback loop. Goodness gracious. I love when nature is so smart. The fascinating thing

1623
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:43,000
is that circulating IGF-1, I won't say it's all it does because it does a few other things,

1624
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,480
but the vast majority of its role is as a plasma biosensor for growth hormone. So it regulates

1625
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:51,480
growth hormone secretion. So what happens if you knock down IGF-1, you get this huge increase in

1626
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:54,840
growth hormone secretion. You basically get acromegaly, but you get selective growth hormone

1627
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:59,880
resistance in the hepatocyte. So you probably remember the growth hormone has been described

1628
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:05,000
for a long time forever and ever to be pro-lipolytic. So it's actually one of two hormones. It's both

1629
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:10,120
catabolic and anabolic, but it turns on, it's a way to mobilize fat from adipose tissue stores.

1630
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:14,360
Testosterone being the other where you can be anabolic to muscle, catabolic to fat.

1631
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:16,760
And thyroid hormone, I think is another one where you can be both.

1632
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:21,160
Unlike insulin, for example, which would be anabolic to both or cortisol, which would be,

1633
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:25,640
actually cortisol is the reverse. It's catabolic to muscle, anabolic to fat.

1634
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:29,560
That's right. So in any case, if you give an animal growth hormone, if you have a patient

1635
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:34,360
who has a tumor that secretes growth hormone, what disease called acromegaly or gigantism,

1636
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:39,160
Andre the giant had gigantism. Those people have a decrease in lean body mass,

1637
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:43,240
increase in muscle mass. That's basically because growth hormone mobilizes fat from

1638
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:48,200
adipose tissue stores. So we reasoned that what was happening was that growth hormone was turning

1639
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:52,280
on lipolysis and mobilizing all this fat and that that fat was getting taken up by the liver.

1640
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:57,000
What was interesting was we did a relatively deep analysis of all the mouse models that have been

1641
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:02,760
made involving the receptor, GHR downstream signaling components, including JAK2 and another

1642
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:06,680
one called STAT5. And we looked at animals that have been engineered to be missing any of those

1643
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:10,920
components in the whole animal versus just in the liver. And what was interesting was that the

1644
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:17,000
animals where you knock out the pathway in the whole animal had a one to two fold increase in

1645
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:23,160
lipid in their liver, very modest, if hardly noticeable. Whereas if you knock out the receptor

1646
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:28,840
or this other molecule STAT5 or JAK2 selectively just in hepatocytes, you get this 20 to 25 fold

1647
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:33,880
increase. And so that told us it's not just about having high growth hormone levels. It's about high

1648
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:39,160
growth hormone levels and those growth hormone levels acting on the periphery. There must be

1649
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:44,840
some other factor that is important here. And so we reasoned, we did what people do is we did a

1650
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:50,040
gene expression array. We saw there's a molecule called CD36, which is also known as fatty acid

1651
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:55,560
translocase. And we saw that it was increased by 20 fold in these animals where we knocked out JAK2

1652
02:14:55,640 --> 02:15:01,080
in the liver. And we thought, well, gosh, this could be facilitating uptake. And so we did a

1653
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:05,080
series of following experiments after that where we knocked out CD36 just in hepatocytes and showed

1654
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:09,240
that we could make that get better. So we put together this model where growth hormone basically

1655
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:14,120
growth hormone secretion is disinhibited at the level of the hypothalamus pituitary. You get an

1656
02:15:14,120 --> 02:15:21,080
increase in activity in peripheral tissues. It's then mobilizing all this fat and then the fat is

1657
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:26,840
being taken up sort of preferentially or augmented rate of uptake by the upregulation of this

1658
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:34,680
molecule. Now, if you block JAK2 and block the expression of CD36, do you eliminate the fat

1659
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:38,040
accumulation in the liver? Yeah, that's experiment we did. It wasn't a hundred percent, but we

1660
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:43,480
basically brought it back down to almost, instead of it being a hundred grams per milligram of

1661
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:49,320
tissue or something, it was like 20 where normal mouse would be 11 or 12. So it's near normalized.

1662
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:53,800
We also then did an experiment where we said, well, what happens if we block this pathway,

1663
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:58,120
the growth hormone signaling pathway in adipocytes, since we're presuming that this must be

1664
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:01,880
a product of lipolysis? So what happens if we block this pathway in adipocytes?

1665
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:07,000
So we went and made an animal where we knocked out JAK2 in adipocytes selectively. And then we

1666
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,920
crossed the two together and asked what would happen basically, can you reduce the amount of

1667
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:17,480
lipid in the liver by knocking out both at the same time? And we did. And that experiment we did

1668
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:21,720
almost 10 years ago. And what was so fascinating about that experiment was we never intended to

1669
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:26,760
get into any of the insulin glucose homostasis stuff at all. But when you're doing these

1670
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:30,600
experiments, they're expensive. And so we did a bunch of things measured. I think we did an

1671
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:34,840
insulin tolerance test for some reason on these mice. And we saw that the mice where we knocked

1672
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:39,640
out JAK2 just in the adipocytes had the most profound insulin sensitivity. We actually killed

1673
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:43,640
our mice because they died from hypoglycemia. We gave them the same amount of insulin that you gave

1674
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:48,520
a normal mouse and they bottomed out and we couldn't rescue them. And they were super

1675
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:51,960
insulin sensitive. And this was mostly glucose being disposed into the muscle?

1676
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:56,120
No, it turns out. So we thought that was interesting. So we then went on to kind of

1677
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:02,200
dig deeper on what was going on. Again, here we knocked out this pathway just in adipocytes.

1678
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:06,760
And we saw that if you knock out the pathway in adipocytes. But I'm confused. So you knock out

1679
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:12,200
the pathway in adipocytes, when they're hypoglycemic, you're putting that glucose

1680
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:16,920
very easily into muscle or into liver. I mean, you'd have to put it into one of those two,

1681
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:21,480
wouldn't you? Even if you wanted to then put it into fat into the fat cell.

1682
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:25,240
Yeah. So, and what you're asking is a phenomenal question. And we had initially,

1683
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:30,440
I think naively thought that this was an adipocyte autonomous effect that we thought must be the

1684
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:34,760
adipocyte. But then there's not that much glucose that's actually disposed into the adipocyte on a

1685
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:38,360
per mass basis. So we thought that doesn't make sense. So we ended up doing what you do,

1686
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:44,440
which is to clamp the animals. And it turns out that the defect is almost entirely in turning off

1687
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:49,880
EGP. So basically what we do is we completely turn off endogenous glucose production from the liver.

1688
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:54,520
Which is really not an insulin sensitivity issue at all. It just masquerades as profound

1689
02:17:54,520 --> 02:18:00,840
insulin sensitivity, but you basically clamped the portal vein metaphorically and you kill an

1690
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:04,920
organism in five minutes if you stop hepatic glucose output. How quickly did you see these

1691
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:11,560
animals die? It was within 30 minutes. Oh my God. Yeah. It was really profound. And so this then

1692
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:15,880
sent us off in this long, what's now been a 10 year journey to try and understand how growth

1693
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:21,880
one regulates insulin sensitivity or insulin glucose homeostasis and how that happens through

1694
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:24,600
the adipocyte. We won't get into all of it now, but it turned me onto the

1695
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:31,560
kind of remarkable figure, one of these figures in history that I didn't know before I got into this,

1696
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:36,120
that I'm surprised he, this guy, Bernardo Hussai, who was an Argentinian physician scientist who

1697
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:40,520
won the Nobel prize. First Latin American to win the Nobel prize, right? I mean,

1698
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:44,920
this guy was unbelievable. I'll send you a link. There was a period of time in the 1930s,

1699
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:54,200
I think it was 1936, where he was the first or only author on 14 articles in the New England

1700
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:58,920
Journal of Medicine over five weeks. At one point he had, it was the most unbelievably

1701
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:02,760
productive period of time ever seen. And he ended up with the Nobel prize. He shared the

1702
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:07,880
Nobel prize with the Corey's of the Corey cycle, which I didn't know until recently. I was reviewing

1703
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:11,800
some of this stuff for our talk today. And I didn't realize that they had collaborated on

1704
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:18,520
some stuff back in the 1930s, but he defined the diabetic nature of growth hormone. So he did these

1705
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:22,200
experiments that I think were really cool and basically got left behind because no one really

1706
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:26,760
paid attention to any of this stuff for a long time. But he defined that if you take an animal,

1707
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:33,240
the first set of experiments he did was we took an animal and took the pituitary out and then gave

1708
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:38,520
the animal insulin and saw that the animal he described it as they were more susceptible to

1709
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:43,160
being to the toxic effects of insulin. So they bottom their blood sugar out. He then did the

1710
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:48,120
opposite experiment where he took an animal, he loped out the pancreas and then saw that if he

1711
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:52,280
got rid of the pituitary gland, that they were less susceptible to the hyperglycemia, that they

1712
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:57,560
basically had improved diabetes. And those experiments continued on for 60 years.

1713
02:19:57,560 --> 02:20:04,520
So let me just make sure I understood. Take away growth hormone and you're going to become much

1714
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:10,040
more theoretically or appear insulin sensitive, but in reality, much more hypoglycemic. Take away

1715
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:16,360
growth hormone in the absence of the pancreas and you actually tolerate hyperglycemia better.

1716
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:20,920
That's right. And in fact, there were people in the 60s, I believe, who were doing

1717
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:24,920
hypophysectomies in people with very brittle type two diabetes.

1718
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:27,960
So severing the link between the hypothalamus and the pituitary?

1719
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:28,760
They were taking the pituitary out.

1720
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,600
They were taking the pituitary right out. Wow.

1721
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:34,760
And it was a very effective treatment, actually, except that it had significant

1722
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:39,160
morbidity and mortality of the surgery. So at that time they had perfected the art of taking

1723
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:39,880
the pituitary out.

1724
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:43,880
But even when they did, you're saying even now that they'd have to replace all of the thyroid

1725
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:49,880
and sex hormone and ACTH, the cortisol related stuff, it still turned out to be better off.

1726
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:52,680
All things considered in how well it managed their diabetes.

1727
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:59,400
The ultimate killer experiment happened in 1983 ish or so. And so they took patients with type

1728
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:04,120
one diabetes who had an insulin pump. So they were getting a fixed dose of insulin and then

1729
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:09,800
they gave them, I believe, one or two injections of growth hormone. And you could see the insulin

1730
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:16,680
level go like this straight up. Basically, their insulin use within a day spikes and stays up

1731
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:20,840
until they stop the GH injections and it comes back down. And in fact, three out of the seven

1732
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:25,480
people in this one study got profoundly hypoglycemic when they stopped the growth hormone.

1733
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:29,400
So it turns out that there's a drug that blocks the growth hormone receptor that's used as a

1734
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:35,320
second line treatment for acromegaly. It's called somoverter, pygvissimont. It's an analog of

1735
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:40,280
native wild type GH. It just has a few mutations in it that renders it basically as a dominant

1736
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:46,120
negative. So it doesn't allow, basically shuts off the receptor. And it's used, again, clinically.

1737
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:51,160
And if you look at the package insert, the black box warning is if you take any diabetes

1738
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:55,640
drugs, let your doctor know because your risk of hypoglycemia is so high. So it actually reminds

1739
02:21:55,640 --> 02:22:01,560
me a lot of the sort of low carb ketogenic diet in the sense that it has that same effect. And in

1740
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:06,920
that 1983 New England Journal paper, they actually talked about growth hormone secretion being as much

1741
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:13,800
the cause of brittle type two diabetes as the effect. And for reasons that I don't understand,

1742
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:18,520
people just forgot about it. And so we set out to kind of try and understand at least at the

1743
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:23,320
beginning at a cellular level, how is this regulated? And we're trying to dig down. It turns

1744
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:28,120
out that it all comes back to your favorite molecule, mTOR. And it looks like it converges

1745
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:33,480
in this intersection between these two signaling pathways that evolved actually only, I mean,

1746
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:39,320
growth hormone doesn't exist pre-TELIOS. So there's no growth hormone in flies or worms. It's only in

1747
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:44,760
invertebrates and TELIOS. And it co-evolved basically from insulin, which is not that

1748
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:51,240
surprising, right? IGF-1 is basically the target molecule of GH. It's not surprising that GH and

1749
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:56,040
insulin would have evolved in a similar way, even though they look very different, they act very

1750
02:22:56,040 --> 02:23:00,200
different. So the way I think about it is that growth hormones kind of retained a lot of the

1751
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:04,520
sort of metabolic effects of insulin. And insulin obviously has retained a lot of the growth

1752
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:10,280
promoting effects that used to be with growth hormone when they were all one molecule. And so

1753
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:15,080
the point is that I think that these two molecules act in concert and from our experiments, it looks

1754
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:20,200
like that's happening in the adipocyte and that basically growth hormone is acting as a break

1755
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:24,840
on insulin signaling and that that's controlling metabolism in the whole body at a distance. And

1756
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:29,080
so that's what we've been working on. And again, we could probably talk about that for three hours,

1757
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:34,200
but it's been keeping us busy. So let me kind of think through this a little bit,

1758
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:39,800
because it's so interesting. Let's go back for a second to, you didn't mention IGF binding proteins,

1759
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:46,280
but where do they fit into this? The IGF-BPs as they're called are also made by the liver, correct?

1760
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:53,720
So IGF is mostly made by the liver, IGF-BP2, BP3 also made by the liver. These are interesting to

1761
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:58,760
most people listening to this because if they pay attention to any of the sort of epidemiology

1762
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:05,080
around longevity, there's so much controversy around this idea of IGF and its association with

1763
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:09,800
mortality. And you have such conflicting information, that's what makes this so challenging, right? So

1764
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:18,600
you have these people that have mutations in either the GHR or low GH secretion and or low IGF

1765
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:25,240
due to a deficient GHR on the liver and they seem to live longer or at least get less cancer,

1766
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:29,160
but then they also seem to get a bunch of other diseases that are kind of weird. But when you look

1767
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:37,720
at all cause mortality, it seems to nadir at the 60th or 70th percentile for everything. But when

1768
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:43,320
you do it by disease, certain diseases seem to get better with higher IGF like Alzheimer's disease.

1769
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:47,960
And I believe cardiovascular disease, you would know this, but others get worse, like cancer starts

1770
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:55,000
to go up. So how does all of that make sense in terms of what you're learning at this level?

1771
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:00,040
Well, I'll say that the GHR meetings are fascinating because they're basically the room

1772
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:04,840
aligns in these two camps. There's one side of the room that believes that GHR is the elixir that

1773
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:09,640
will promote longevity. And there's the other side of the room that believes that too much GHR

1774
02:25:09,640 --> 02:25:14,040
signaling will negatively impact longevity. It's really interesting the way these two things. I

1775
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:21,480
think for me, if you start with what we know from human genetics and animal genetics, it's incontrovertible

1776
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:27,080
that excess GHR signaling, at least at the levels that you see with transgenic animals or

1777
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:32,200
acromegaly is one of the most potent ways to die. I mean, people with acromegaly, untreated

1778
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:35,480
acromegaly die in their thirties and twenties and they die of cardiovascular disease. So I think

1779
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:40,920
that's gain of function. And again, the animal is the same thing. It's a great way to shorten

1780
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:46,200
lifespan in any animal, whether it's a worm or a fly or increased signaling through this pathway

1781
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:50,360
and you'll shorten lifespan. And then the flip sides, he mentioned the LaRone patients, those

1782
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:57,640
patients don't have increased longevity per se, but they sure do have a decrease in their risk of

1783
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:02,040
metabolic disease. It's a much decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes,

1784
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:09,960
despite an increase in body fat. So they have this body composition where they have a 50% body fat,

1785
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:13,880
which you'd think would be dangerous. It turns out that they and the mice, so there's a mouse model

1786
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:18,200
of LaRone syndrome and that's actually the longest lived mouse that's ever been engineered. There was

1787
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:22,120
a prize that I don't know if it still exists, but it's called the Methuselah prize. And they used to

1788
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:27,000
give out, it was $5 million to an investigator. You could engineer the longest living mouse that's

1789
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:33,160
ever been made. And so this guy, Andre Barkie at Southern Illinois engineered the mouse that's

1790
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:37,240
missing. Actually, he and John Copchick did it together, this experiment where they engineered

1791
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:42,040
the mouse that's missing GHR and that mouse lived to be 1819 days, which is basically the equivalent

1792
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:47,880
of like 207 human years. It's still to this day, the longest living mouse that's ever been made.

1793
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:50,840
And that meant it was without GHR in the liver.

1794
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:51,960
No, anywhere.

1795
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:52,440
Anywhere.

1796
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:52,840
Anywhere.

1797
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:54,200
And that means for its entire life.

1798
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:59,640
The whole life. So these are short and fat mice and they live forever. But they have all the other

1799
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:04,280
problems that you'd have if you're missing growth or congenitally. So they're short and they're

1800
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:06,840
pretty fat. What's interesting is that that fat-

1801
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:08,920
Are they cognitively the same?

1802
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:09,880
The mice or the people?

1803
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:12,920
The mice. Well, I guess both, but I was asking specifically about the mice.

1804
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:15,560
I think they are. It's a great question. I don't know how much has been done on their

1805
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:21,000
cognitive abilities late in life, but they clearly are very resistant to these diseases that kill

1806
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:26,600
mice in labs. They're healthy by every stretch. They're extraordinarily insulin sensitive. I mean,

1807
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:30,440
again, same thing that was described before we ever did these experiments. What we demonstrated

1808
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:35,240
was that the insulin sensitivity is conferred by the absence of the signaling pathway in the

1809
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:38,520
adipose tissue, which is acting at a distance, mostly on the liver.

1810
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:41,960
So what do you think confers the protection to the La Ronze patients?

1811
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:45,240
I don't know. That's one of the things I think about every day, but at a very simple level,

1812
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:49,560
I think of it as an improvement in insulin sensitivity, a decrease in insulin and decrease

1813
02:27:49,560 --> 02:27:56,040
in IGF-1. I can't get better than that right now, but I think the circulating insulin levels

1814
02:27:56,040 --> 02:28:02,920
are nearly undetectable and mice in labs die of cancer. I think there's probably just less

1815
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:05,560
insulin, less IGF-1, and they just don't get cancer.

1816
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:12,920
Because this relationship between hyperinsulinemia and high glucose, you and I both are on an advisory

1817
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:16,440
board of a company called Virta Health, and that's how we actually met a few years ago.

1818
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:22,600
I remember in one of the meetings, we were discussing this idea that people need to

1819
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:27,720
understand the difference between managing glucose and managing insulin. If you manage

1820
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:33,480
glucose levels, if you keep glucose levels in the ideal range, by any means you control

1821
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:38,520
microvascular disease. You're less likely to go blind and less likely to have kidney failure and

1822
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:44,360
have an amputation. But if you do that with a strategy of high insulin, you trade it for

1823
02:28:44,360 --> 02:28:50,600
macrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease throughout the body, obviously,

1824
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:56,520
the coronary arteries and cerebral arteries, even the aorta, the large vessels, suggesting that even

1825
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:02,840
high insulin by itself can be problematic. These patients are walking around with very low insulin,

1826
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:08,280
which you could see would protect them at the macrovascular level. Because of this,

1827
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:12,040
I still think of it as a paradox because I'm still struggling to wrap my head around their insulin

1828
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:17,400
sensitivity, how they can be so insulin sensitive, but they also obviously have normal glucose levels,

1829
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:25,160
so their microvascular stuff is okay. Then on top of that, you're saying if insulin and IGF are pro,

1830
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:31,800
from a metabolic standpoint, pro-oncologic or pro tumor, you also get that benefit.

1831
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:36,920
The one I've never understood is aren't these things important neurotrophically? I mean,

1832
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:42,680
isn't IGF and GH important in the brain and how are they avoiding those consequences?

1833
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:46,520
One of the foibles of doing what we do is that we look at what we look at and don't look at

1834
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:51,000
anything else. So again, I set out to do these experiments originally because I was interested

1835
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,360
in the clotting. It was only an accident that we noticed that the liver looked like fogra.

1836
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:59,080
We've never looked at the brain and I don't know how much others have looked at the brain.

1837
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:05,000
I'm not sure what happens in a mouse brain would guide us, but it's a great question. I think if

1838
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,680
you're just asking about the things that I can measure, so metabolic disease, cardiovascular

1839
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:16,840
disease, cancer, and lifespan, it seems like everything aligns towards too much GH being

1840
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:22,920
bad and less GH being better, but I can't tell you about the neuro stuff. It could be the opposite

1841
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:28,680
there. Why is it that if the patients with Laurent syndrome are less likely to die or they get to

1842
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:34,040
phase shift and delay the onset of cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer,

1843
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:37,320
they don't have a survival advantage? Well, the story that I, I mean, again,

1844
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:40,360
you're talking about pockets of a few hundred people. I think the one that's gotten the most

1845
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:44,520
attention is this one in Ecuador and there are 300 patients there. I think what's amazing is that

1846
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:49,960
the 30 year follow up of that cohort of people, there was not one single case of cancer or diabetes

1847
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:56,680
over 30 years and 300 people compared to like 15% in their age matched relatives. What I heard was

1848
02:30:56,680 --> 02:31:01,800
that they were depressed and had an increased risk of alcoholism because they were basically

1849
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:06,440
ostracized for being fat dwarfs. I hate to be harsh, but I think that was the other thing.

1850
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:10,200
Yeah. And I also heard there was a higher incidence of accidental death and other things,

1851
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:14,920
which you could argue, well, you have to die of something. So if accidental death explains it,

1852
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:19,480
that should still show a survival advantage. I think we're getting into the sort of trouble

1853
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:23,320
of trying to- Yeah. Epidemiology just makes this very difficult. Especially in these small,

1854
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:27,560
inbred communities, I think it just becomes almost impossible. So we talked about experiments,

1855
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:30,920
we're never going to have answers to. We're never going to have a human longevity lifespan

1856
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:35,400
study that you or I will see the results of. And we just have to understand that. So,

1857
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:39,480
but in the meantime, we can talk about the other stuff. And I mean, the insulin thing to me is

1858
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:44,120
interesting because I think there are some people out there in the Twitter sphere who are sort of

1859
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:49,480
fall into the category of statin denialists. I think there's this narrative that's developed

1860
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:52,920
out there that statins don't treat the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, that the underlying

1861
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:58,440
cause of cardiovascular disease is insulin. And while I'm firmly in the camp and will ever

1862
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:01,880
expect to remain in the camp, that lipids are fundamental and probably the most important

1863
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:06,920
driver of cardiovascular disease, of atherosclerotic disease and events, I do think there's good

1864
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:10,760
evidence that insulin actually does play a role. And in fact, there were some studies that were

1865
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,880
published over the years that showed that fasting insulin was an independent risk factor for

1866
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:19,960
cardiovascular disease. And it makes sense. Don't we also see this borne out in the type

1867
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:24,680
one literature that stratifies patients by insulin use? Yeah. I think James O'Keefe published a

1868
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:29,000
paper on this about two years ago. Do you know James? No. Provincial cardiologist in Kansas,

1869
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:34,040
mostly his work is an exercise and the role of too much exercise actually, but actually published

1870
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:38,920
a paper in this a while ago. So yeah, super interesting. This is clearly top 10 questions

1871
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:43,720
I get asked all the time is, should I be on growth hormone? My general answer is no,

1872
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:50,120
mostly through the lens of, I'm not convinced by any data that growth hormone will promote

1873
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:55,880
longevity, but on the flip side, I've also softened my tone. I used to just think on first

1874
02:32:55,880 --> 02:33:01,000
principles, it made no sense because of, if nothing else, the cancer risk. But of course,

1875
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,960
the other thing that's odd is there's so many people taking growth hormone, especially athletes.

1876
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:13,080
And if there is a negative consequence of it, it's probably not as big as I would have guessed

1877
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:17,960
and, or it takes a lot longer to show up than I would have guessed because we just don't see the

1878
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:22,440
trail of body bags that you would expect. I mean, that's the thing is you have Barry Bonds at 25 or

1879
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:26,520
28 taking a bunch of growth hormone. What do you expect? So maybe his risk of having an MI

1880
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:31,080
is increased twofold or threefold. Would that be enough to see, don't you think? Wouldn't a

1881
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:36,920
twofold increase show up in a non-randomized cohort of athletes taking in a legal drug? I don't think

1882
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:41,880
we have the data. I don't feel confident. What I've learned in this work is that these hormones are

1883
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:46,280
regulated in ways that we can't even begin to understand. I mean, that it's so complicated. And

1884
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:52,680
so I'm nervous to go in there and start perturbing it or replacing it if it's deficient. Because I

1885
02:33:53,480 --> 02:33:58,200
see all the different things that can happen and how complicated that can be. So I'm a little bit

1886
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:02,040
more of a minimalist, I guess, when it comes to these kinds of interventions. But my answer to

1887
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:07,560
my patients is every line of evidence I can see about GH at least is that if you're worried,

1888
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:12,280
if you're optimizing for longevity, it's hard to tell a story that that's going to help you. Now,

1889
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:16,520
if you're optimizing for, I want to feel better. I want to increase my lean muscle mass. I want to

1890
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:21,800
decrease my fat mass. I want to look better. Go for it. If that's what you want. And so that's what

1891
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:25,400
I tell people is if this is something that you're willing to understand that we have no evidence

1892
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:29,560
that it's probably going to increase your lifespan, it may more likely even decrease it, but you like

1893
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:34,120
how it makes you feel and look then, then sure. So I would agree with all of that. I think the

1894
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:40,440
one area where I would love to see more investigation, and this is certainly amenable to a clinical trial,

1895
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:48,040
is does increasing IGF in patients with either very high risk for or early cognitive impairment

1896
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:53,320
improve outcomes? I think the literature makes a plausible case that that could be the case.

1897
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:58,840
And that strikes me as a subset in patients, at least for me clinically, that I am most interested

1898
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:04,280
in knowing the answer to that question. If we take our high risk dementia patients or worse yet,

1899
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:10,520
patients who are already in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment and take the ones who are at

1900
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:19,080
lower levels, the bottom quartile of IGF levels, will GH provide benefit? Yeah, it's a great trial.

1901
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:23,640
What happens to your IGF-1 when you fast? Oh, it plummets. And the numbers are kind of irrelevant

1902
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:27,880
because it's all a function of your scale. So when I was on a ketogenic diet for three years

1903
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:33,960
with no fluctuation, my IGF level resided at the 40th or 50th percentile for my age. So the lab that

1904
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:39,640
I use gives me not only my IGF level, but in five-year increments, it gives me the distribution of it.

1905
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:45,480
So you can very accurately peg where you are. So for me, constantly being on a ketogenic diet,

1906
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:49,480
put me at about the 40th to 50th percentile for IGF level, which is not really surprising when

1907
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:55,160
you consider that a ketogenic diet minimizes insulin and also for most people actually keeps

1908
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:59,400
protein lower than you would otherwise normally have it. So methionine plays such an important

1909
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:04,760
role in this, of course. When I'm not on a ketogenic diet, which I'm not these days, except for in the

1910
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:11,800
peri fasting period, my IGF probably lives closer to the 70th percentile. On our scale, that's about

1911
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:18,040
200. When I do a fast, so I'll do a blood draw right before the fast, and then usually on day six

1912
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:25,880
or day seven of a complete water only fast, that IGF will be in the 80s, 90s, which is more than two

1913
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:31,640
standard deviations below the mean. What I find most interesting is how long it takes to rebound,

1914
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:36,600
and it takes about six weeks to come back to normal. So, and have you ever, measuring

1915
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:39,800
growth hormone is one of the hardest things to do because it's so- I've never measured it for that

1916
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:46,120
reason. I just, I, yeah. I mean, it might be so high that you would be able to, to see something.

1917
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:49,800
Let's talk about it because I'd love to figure out, the problem is I only fast in New York and

1918
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:54,280
ever in San Francisco, but maybe I'll do a fast up here and swing by the lab and we'll do daily

1919
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:58,600
blood draws or something. I guess we have to get an IRB these days. We can't do anything for fun,

1920
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:03,640
but it's very interesting to see how much you can manipulate GH nutritionally.

1921
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:07,080
Well, that's what, one of the things that we're really interested in understanding,

1922
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:11,400
like in the future is understanding its role in this fasting feeding transition. It goes up in

1923
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:18,120
fasting, but as you say, IGF-1 levels go down. So you get this selective GH resistance in the liver,

1924
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:22,200
at least the question of is whether you're getting GH resistance in other tissues as well,

1925
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:27,080
but why would you have this hormone go up and then lose its activity? It's kind of a funny thing,

1926
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:31,320
right? And you see this in people with anorexia too. Yeah, I've never actually understood it as

1927
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:37,080
well as I feel like I do now based on the way you've told this story of, that's a great way to

1928
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:43,400
describe it, right? Selective GH resistance in the liver, IGF is plummeting, GH is skyrocketing.

1929
02:37:43,400 --> 02:37:47,800
Then the question, and we should know this and eventually we will, what is GH activity in adipocytes?

1930
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:52,680
Is it actually maintained? And so are you basically trying to mobilize fat as a way of

1931
02:37:53,400 --> 02:37:57,960
avoiding starvation? Is it basically you're trying to direct GH to act only on the periphery and not

1932
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:03,400
on the liver? By the way, if you believe that periodic fasting improves longevity, and I

1933
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:08,680
certainly do, Valter Longo does, we might come at it from different ways. It also begs the question,

1934
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:13,320
is the benefit conferred by the reduction in IGF or the transient rise in GH?

1935
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:14,840
Yeah, or something completely different.

1936
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:19,560
I never even really considered that the benefit could be conferred from the GH rise, although

1937
02:38:19,560 --> 02:38:24,600
that seems less likely given that it's hard to imagine you, I mean, who knows though? Maybe

1938
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:28,760
there's something, I mean, if biology teaches us anything, it's to stop acting like we know what

1939
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:33,240
we're talking about. Exactly, exactly. Ethan, I want to go back to something because I know

1940
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:38,200
we've got to wrap up, you've got to get back to stuff. You talked about something at the

1941
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:44,120
beginning that I didn't know, which was you went off to Vassar to get as far away from science as

1942
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:50,680
you could, and yet you had an experience there that presented science in the right way. And I

1943
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:55,000
would argue the world is actually a better place for you doing what you're doing now, which is not

1944
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:00,680
to say that you being the drummer of a band wouldn't have been equally impactful, but maybe I'm biased.

1945
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:06,840
This is an interesting topic to me because my biggest fear, certainly one of my biggest fears

1946
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:14,600
in education is a retreat from science. What could a parent think about out there as they think about

1947
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:18,760
their son or daughter? And I'm actually even more afraid of it in the case of girls where there's

1948
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:24,360
this ridiculous, stupid, and I really think it is stupid and incorrect, that girls are just not

1949
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:29,320
going to be as good at science or math. I think that most of that is actually a feed forward

1950
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:33,320
mechanism that's built into an expectation. I mean, how do you think about this with your kids,

1951
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:37,080
or how could I think about it with my kids or anybody else thinking about this? What can we do

1952
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:43,560
to make science as exciting as it can possibly be? And if for no other reason, I even say this to

1953
02:39:43,560 --> 02:39:48,280
people, it's not because everyone has to become a scientist. It's an inability to understand science

1954
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:53,400
makes you a victim for the rest of your life, whether you want to admit it or not. If you can't

1955
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:57,880
at least have some understanding of science and think critically, you are going to be overrun

1956
02:39:57,880 --> 02:40:03,240
with propaganda and nonsense. And the consequence of that is enormous and we see it. I don't think

1957
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:09,080
this fact is necessarily correct today, but it was at the time that I knew it and it won't be

1958
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:15,560
directionally off. At the time of the statistic, there was what, 565 members in the House of

1959
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:22,520
Representatives in the Senate. Five of them had degrees in science. So less than 1% of the

1960
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:28,200
lawmakers of this country are trained scientifically. That just doesn't strike me as an appropriate

1961
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:33,400
balance. So what happened at Vassar and how can we reproduce it? So those are two things that I

1962
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:37,800
think about a lot. One is obviously we as a group of scientists need to do a better job of communicating

1963
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:41,960
what we do in an interesting and exciting way to people without dumbing it down. And I think,

1964
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:46,280
honestly, I'm not just saying this to shove sunshine up your ass, but I've had so many calls

1965
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:50,840
from people, either people I do know or people I don't know who've said, I just heard this great

1966
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:56,040
podcast. And I think what you're doing here is bold because you're not shying away from getting

1967
02:40:56,040 --> 02:41:00,040
into the depth. It may be that a lot of the conversation that we had around the science

1968
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:04,520
was over the head of the average layperson who hasn't had science, but I still think it's valuable

1969
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:08,200
and they're going to go off and get literate about something and they're finding it interesting. So I

1970
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:13,000
think we as a community need to do that. And whether it's you or it's Ron Vale and iBiology

1971
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,800
or other things, which if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend he's making these videos. In fact,

1972
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:22,040
they did one with Dave Sabatini, a series on mTOR. Yeah, I saw that one. Yeah. And if we're going

1973
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:27,320
to get more people interested in science, we got to make it more interesting. The second thing is

1974
02:41:27,320 --> 02:41:32,520
there's this trend and you know this because you've got kids of hyper specialization earlier and

1975
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:37,880
earlier in life. I could afford to go to medical school and making the decision as a sophomore in

1976
02:41:37,880 --> 02:41:42,760
college. That's almost impossible to believe that that could happen today. I mean, it could happen.

1977
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:46,600
You'd have to take time off. But what I find with our trainees is that people who don't

1978
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:51,880
do things happen. One is people who get into science at a young age get burned out and don't

1979
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:57,720
like it by the time they get to be a fellow or a resident or attending. And the second thing is the

1980
02:41:57,720 --> 02:42:03,640
people who don't get into science like me, the Ethan Weisses who go to Vassar in 2019 and not

1981
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:11,240
1991 find it way too much of an obstacle to get in now. It's just too complicated and too many

1982
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:15,160
barriers. So one of the things that I'm passionate about and I'm actually working on it, I can't

1983
02:42:15,160 --> 02:42:18,920
really talk about it now, but we're going to talk about it soon. We're working on some ways to help

1984
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:26,440
MD only medical students and beyond get exposed to like real intensive two and three year

1985
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:30,360
experiences in the lab. So the kind of thing that used to happen routinely where people would go and

1986
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:35,480
work at NIH like you did or other things where they can get exposed to science in a meaningful

1987
02:42:35,480 --> 02:42:40,360
way, even if their career is not going to be as a PI running a lab, it will help increase the

1988
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:44,200
scientific literacy, being able to speak both these languages. So that's something I'm super

1989
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:48,120
passionate about. Because traditional medical school is actually not scientific training.

1990
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:51,400
That means it's gone now. So, you know, I've heard this saying, I don't know who this one gets

1991
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:54,920
attributed to, but the gist of it is that we've taken the science out of medical school and the

1992
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:59,640
medicine out of graduate school, right? So our graduate students are craving more understanding

1993
02:42:59,640 --> 02:43:03,400
of physiology and medicine. Our medical students are not really missing what they're not getting,

1994
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:08,280
but they're not learning science anymore. And so once that happens, then the likelihood that that

1995
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:13,240
student who's not done a PhD, who's never worked in a lab is going to have the courage or the

1996
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:18,760
ability to go work in a lab later on in life is close to zero. And the thing is what was great

1997
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:22,920
about the way it happened for me was that I came to it without much preconceived notion in dogma.

1998
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:29,480
So I came to it with just native curiosity and sort of like, how should things work? And look,

1999
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:35,480
I wish my basis of scientific knowledge was greater than it is. I'm jealous of people,

2000
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:40,600
like, you know, my MD, PhD friends from Hopkins, like Dave Sabatine, those guys, I'm totally jealous

2001
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:45,560
of how deep their knowledge is. But I have a different perspective and I bring the clinical

2002
02:43:45,560 --> 02:43:49,640
work that I do and the things that I think about when I'm seeing patients that have thought about.

2003
02:43:49,640 --> 02:43:53,240
So it's a different way. We didn't get a chance to talk about it, but you've been

2004
02:43:53,880 --> 02:43:57,800
really, I mean, as though everything we've described your entire clinical career,

2005
02:43:57,800 --> 02:44:02,040
you're in amazing stuff you're doing in the lab isn't enough to keep you busy. And oh, by the way,

2006
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:07,000
you also have a family. You decided like, I mean, I feel like you did it in a week because I remember

2007
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:10,920
when you called me and told me about it. And then a week later you had a prototype. And then

2008
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:15,720
two weeks later you had your next, you started a company last year. Yeah. So can you tell us a

2009
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:20,040
little bit about that? Cause half my patients now are using this device. We could do an entire

2010
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:24,200
podcast on this. And maybe I'll have a podcast and bring you on. Cause I do think there's some

2011
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:27,240
of this stuff. Like when I first called you, I remember calling you, it was like a Saturday or

2012
02:44:27,240 --> 02:44:31,400
Sunday and you were generous to take the time to help me think about this. And we talked a lot about

2013
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:35,320
the behavioral science, which and the behavioral economics, which is something we've talked about

2014
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:39,480
a lot at our time on the Virta advisory board. And I think it's to me, it's the most interesting

2015
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:45,640
part of this whole obesity story, right? Is that we're talking about a behavior at its core and

2016
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:52,760
a change in behavior. And how do we at the absolute most basic level, how do we use technology to help

2017
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:56,680
people change their behavior? And that's something that I've been thinking about for a long time.

2018
02:44:56,680 --> 02:45:03,000
And to make a really, really, really long story short, I got together with an amazing team of

2019
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:07,320
people who'd been doing work in weight loss. And actually when I told them what I wanted to do,

2020
02:45:07,320 --> 02:45:11,080
they both told me to get lost. They said, they're never going to do a weight loss startup again.

2021
02:45:11,080 --> 02:45:15,080
They had started and sold a company to Weight Watchers and said, it's too hard. People say

2022
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:18,440
they want to lose weight, but they actually don't. They don't have the tools to do it. So

2023
02:45:19,400 --> 02:45:24,920
short version of a long story. We, we thought, well, gosh, you know, one thing that is true,

2024
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:29,560
I think about weight loss in general for people who struggle is that we're not giving them the

2025
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:33,880
information they need to be able to make the change in behavior. The only information that

2026
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:37,880
we give people is the information they get from stepping on their scale. That's an incredibly

2027
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:42,120
lagging indicator. I mean, you could have entire gallon of ice cream tonight at 11 o'clock and

2028
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:45,880
step on the scale tomorrow and you may not have any difference in your weight. So it's relatively

2029
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:50,760
useless on a day to day level. And by the time you actually get information, it's not actionable.

2030
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:56,200
I would add one more thing, which is the amount of movement in water alone makes it almost

2031
02:45:56,200 --> 02:46:02,120
impossible. For example, the average woman who is still experiencing a menstrual cycle

2032
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:08,120
can easily fluctuate by eight pounds in a month. It's a four kilogram average fluctuation in

2033
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:14,840
water weight. So can you imagine if a woman says, I want to lose 10 pounds in, and she's using her

2034
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:19,960
scale, it's just impossible. And you know, you can build in, you know, moving averages and other

2035
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:22,760
things, but again, you're not giving them the information they need to be able to make the

2036
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:27,160
changes if they want to make a change. So what's interesting and unique about, so when I came to

2037
02:46:27,160 --> 02:46:31,240
the Virta Advisory Board, I'd never done keto before. And frankly, I kind of thought it was a

2038
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:34,680
little bit weird. I don't know if you remember that first advisory board meeting we had at the

2039
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:38,040
Mexican restaurant down there. And I still joke about this. In fact, I think I've joked about it

2040
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:42,360
with Sami and Steve that I show up at this thing and like there's bowls of guacamole there with

2041
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:47,960
spoons in them and like, you know, fajita dishes without wraps and like, there was no

2042
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:51,560
carbohydrate to be found on the table. I thought this is like a cult. Like this is,

2043
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:55,800
this is weird. And I never really had any curiosity about doing it. Then I tried it myself.

2044
02:46:55,800 --> 02:47:00,920
And I realized that the one unique fact about this diet that's different from all other diets that I

2045
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:06,440
know of other than fasting for a week is it allows you to follow biomarker. And that if you use that

2046
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:11,720
biomarker as a guide to help your own adherence, it can help reinforce some of these behaviors.

2047
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:18,520
And maybe that would be sufficient. So we finally decided to try this thing. And one of the issues

2048
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:22,040
as you know better than anybody testing your ketone level, whether it's through blood or breath or

2049
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:27,560
urine has all kinds of issues and there's imperfection. But we figured if we could build

2050
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:32,280
a good sensor, I'm not talking about like a lab level sensor, but a good sensor that people could

2051
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:38,120
use, they could carry around that would be portable and accurate enough to help guide these

2052
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:44,760
behavioral changes that we could use that as the basis of basically replacing a lot of the human

2053
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:50,680
intervention that goes into programs like Virta. So Virta is successful at what they do in a

2054
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:54,360
different population, the population of people not really primarily trying to lose weight,

2055
02:47:54,360 --> 02:48:00,040
but more trying to manage their diabetes. But that takes a lot of human capital. So could this

2056
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:05,960
information help replace that and kind of make it more economically feasible? And so basically

2057
02:48:05,960 --> 02:48:11,800
through just a series of incredibly fortunate accidents and beyond hard work from this team,

2058
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:17,560
we were able to get the sensor, swap out an alcohol sensor for an acetone specific sensor

2059
02:48:18,360 --> 02:48:22,360
and got this thing to market quickly. It didn't feel like a day, but it was fast. I mean, we

2060
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:28,760
basically, I think you and I spoke in August. I feel like I had a prototype in October because

2061
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:33,080
I'd managed my calendar through my fasts, which are always being a quarter. And then of course,

2062
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:38,440
my December had the version I have now, which is great. And that's the one a number of my patients

2063
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:42,440
have. I think it was November. And so yeah, we are doing this kind of slow. So tell people,

2064
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:44,920
I don't even think we've mentioned the name of the company. So what's the name of the company?

2065
02:48:44,920 --> 02:48:50,680
It's called, well, it's spelled K-E-Y-T-O and most people pronounce it keto as you would pronounce

2066
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:55,160
ketogenic diet, but we were sort of intentional in being vague about whether you could call it

2067
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:59,320
key two if you wanted to, and that leaves it open to the idea that it could be more than just

2068
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:04,680
ketogenic diet. And so the company is organized around one is giving people the information they

2069
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:08,760
need through this sensor, which, you know, links up to an app to giving people information they need

2070
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:13,480
to be able to succeed at whatever they're doing. So you know how to do keto. You've done Ted talks

2071
02:49:13,480 --> 02:49:17,320
on keto, but an average person hears about ketogenic diet and they're like, well, I don't know. I don't

2072
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:20,440
know how to do that. So we give people the information they need to be able to do the diet.

2073
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:24,920
And then at some point, and it won't be now, but at some point we're going to help people get to,

2074
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:29,080
you know what to do. You're measuring how well you're doing it, but how do you actually enact,

2075
02:49:29,080 --> 02:49:34,280
how can you enable that? How can you get people the food? So I cook 90% of the meals. I've got my

2076
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:38,920
lunch that I brought with me over there in a bag, but a lot of people don't have that luxury. And so

2077
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:43,880
they'll go out here to this food court and want to get lunch. And so can we help deliver that food to

2078
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:47,720
them at some point? So that's sort of the big picture of what we're doing. And it's been

2079
02:49:47,720 --> 02:49:54,120
incredibly fun. I mean, I've been at UCSF now, I've been in this office for almost 10 years.

2080
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:58,520
And I do think I'm like one of the luckiest people in the world to be able to do the things I do,

2081
02:49:58,520 --> 02:50:03,880
both combining this clinical work, which is just a gift with this lab work, which is basically like

2082
02:50:03,880 --> 02:50:08,760
a game. It's like a glorified living, breathing video game that we get to try and solve puzzles

2083
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:13,480
every day. And I get paid to do it. But this thing has been fun to do. And it happens at a different

2084
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:18,280
pace. As you said, it's like a normal cycle for me in the lab is like five years. This thing

2085
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:23,480
happened in three months. And so it's fun to kind of exercise different muscles and think about

2086
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:26,920
business for the first time in my life. I mean, I haven't really thought about business before.

2087
02:50:27,400 --> 02:50:32,360
I actually enjoy it. I love thinking about the human psychology and the behavior. So it's been

2088
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:35,560
kind of a fun adventure. We'll see how it goes. Awesome. And you've got one for me to take back

2089
02:50:35,560 --> 02:50:41,080
to one of my, I'm seeing one of my patients next week who I was with the other day and I was

2090
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:44,760
talking about it with him, like I had already given him one. And he's like, well, what are you

2091
02:50:44,760 --> 02:50:47,960
talking about? And I was like, well, I'm going to see Ethan. So I'll get you one. You're someone

2092
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:52,120
that I follow on Twitter because I always enjoy, I mean, you know, for me, Twitter is just a great

2093
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:57,240
way to curate reading and stuff. And I love following your stuff. So where can people find

2094
02:50:57,240 --> 02:51:02,760
you? That's probably my biggest place that I spend time social media wise. And my Twitter handles

2095
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:08,120
at Ethan J wise, I have to say I probably had a significant problem. And my wife would say that

2096
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:11,720
I had a more than significant problem with the amount of time I spent on there. I'm not there as

2097
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:18,360
much anymore just because I can't keep up that and my job and my family and this startup thing. So,

2098
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:21,880
but I do try to respond. You know, somebody sends me a message. I'll try to respond.

2099
02:51:21,880 --> 02:51:25,800
Even if once a week there's a great study that you're highlighting, I find that super helpful.

2100
02:51:26,360 --> 02:51:30,840
Yeah, it's fun. Look, Twitter actually went down there and visited a friend of mine as the CFO at

2101
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:34,600
the company, Ned Siegel. And he invited me to, he said, you're so active, like you're a power user

2102
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:37,880
in science and medicine. You should come visit. And it was really sweet. He brought, he invited

2103
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:40,920
me to come down and we toured through the facility. I'd never been there before, but I think they have

2104
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:46,040
something going there that talk about increasing scientific literacy. It's, it's, and I know I've,

2105
02:51:46,040 --> 02:51:50,520
my own patients who follow me and they tell me they learn a lot. They learn a lot about medicine

2106
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:54,200
and science. They learn a lot from you. You don't have to be a stranger to, unless you've been in the

2107
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:58,280
Himalayas hunting Yeti for the past five years. You certainly realize that right now Twitter is

2108
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:03,400
under attack and I feel bad every time Jack Dorsey has to go on a podcast. It's just basically to get

2109
02:52:03,400 --> 02:52:07,560
skewered. I understand why people are upset about the role of Twitter in politics and fake news and

2110
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:13,240
stuff. And I think that's a super upsetting problem. Fortunately, in the world that we play in Twitter,

2111
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:18,840
I still find it more positive than negative. In the end, I've got a bunch of people I follow

2112
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:23,000
who basically curate some of the research I just wouldn't be able to keep up with. Because I'm,

2113
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:27,560
you know, I'm really narrow in what I do, but I need to know what's going on in these

2114
02:52:27,560 --> 02:52:32,120
fields that are adjacent and that's a great way to do it. So Ethan, I can't think enough has been

2115
02:52:32,120 --> 02:52:37,720
awesome. And I suspect this won't be the last time we have to sit down and have a formal discussion.

2116
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:41,720
And we'll obviously have many more informal ones. Awesome, Peter. Thank you so much for coming up.
