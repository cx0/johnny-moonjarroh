00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,960
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,000
to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,000
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. I guess this week is Jaco and like Madonna, Sting,

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,400
or Cher, he's one of those rare individuals that only needs to go by one name. For those not

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,120
familiar with Jaco, he spent 20 years in the SEAL teams where he was a commander of SEAL Team

48
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,880
3's task unit, Bruiser, I believe, which led the battle of Ramadi becoming one of the more

49
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,520
decorated special operations units of the Iraq War. Jaco returned from the Iraq War, served as

50
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,240
an officer in charge of training SEALs on the West Coast, and ultimately when he stepped down

51
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,560
from that role, he co-founded Eshlon Front, a leadership consulting company. Along the way,

52
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,880
he's become a New York Times bestselling author on leadership and has also written a number of,

53
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,160
frankly, fantastic kids' books, which my kids adore. He hosts the Jaco podcast, which is an

54
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,680
amazing podcast, and of all the podcasts I've ever been on, that episode that I did with Jaco

55
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,040
is certainly one of my favorites. He's a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu and the co-founder of Victory MMA

56
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,360
in San Diego. I met Jaco maybe four years ago through and another mutual friend,

57
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,280
Kirk Parsley himself, a SEAL. This podcast was a ton of fun. It also took a while. We sort of lost

58
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,440
track of time, and before you knew it, I realized this was going to have to be released over two

59
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,280
weeks and not just one. In this second installment, Jaco and I discuss 9-11 and the war in Iraq,

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,040
the future of machines in war as well as medicine, raising kids. We talk about one thing that I get

61
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,920
pinged about constantly to talk about with Jaco, which is sleep. We talk about giving up. We talk

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,960
about free will, mindset. We talk about his indulgences, fasting, and we end up with a quick

63
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,560
guest Q&A with my daughter, Olivia, who was waiting all day to meet Jaco and couldn't wait

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,240
to poke her head in when she got home from school. Without further delay,

65
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,760
please enjoy the second installment of my discussion with Jaco.

66
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,160
Where were you on 9-11 physically, like the moment you heard?

67
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,200
So I was in college at the time. So I was in the Navy. I had got my commission. In order to have

68
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,920
your commission in the military, you have to go to college. I hadn't been to college yet.

69
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,360
Meaning because you were enlisted, you couldn't get above a certain level.

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,640
No, I literally had to go. They told me I had to go because I tried to not go.

71
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,560
Okay. They said, you've got to go to college. And I said, I'll just stay in. I don't need to go to

72
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,280
college. Don't worry about me. You don't have to pay for it. We're all good. And they said, no,

73
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,440
idiot, you have to go to college. I said, okay, fine. So I was going to college at the University

74
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,280
of San Diego. I think I was waiting in my car for class and heard about in the morning, like when I

75
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,160
woke up, meaning you heard a plane, a plane hit the tower. Okay, cool. I figured it was a prop.

76
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,960
Yeah. I think it says no, whatever. Some idiot was trying to sightsee or whatever.

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,000
So that would have been like 6 a.m. your time. Yeah. So now it's 7 30 a.m. your time,

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,880
10 30 or whatever time on the East coast. And yeah, the second plane hits and I go,

79
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,320
okay, we're under attack. You knew at that moment, exactly.

80
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,920
As soon as the other one hit, I was like, oh yeah, this is an attack. I didn't even think I knew that

81
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,760
it was a passenger plane yet. Cause it wasn't like I woke up, saw that something happened and said,

82
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,280
okay, I'm going to sit down and watch the news now. Cause every day something happens that could

83
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,080
be the first indicating signs of a major problem. Right. I mean, you just can't track everything.

84
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,920
A shooting happened somewhere. Well, generally the shooting happens and they rest someone or

85
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,200
someone gets killed. And then that's not the beginning of a massive terrorist attack.

86
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,640
So when the first plane hit, I didn't think about it. I was like, oh wow, that sucks. But as soon as

87
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,960
the second one hit, I realized, yeah, we were under attack. And how long until you could actually

88
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,920
see the images on TV? I would say by 11 o'clock. I mean, by the time I saw it on TV, the towers

89
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,520
were still up. I don't know how long did it take for them to fall. I do it in East coast time.

90
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,400
But the towers were still up when I saw it on TV. Yeah. Yeah. Which still kind of mitigated

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,440
the tragedy, right? It was much less visually striking, right? The towers were hit. They're

92
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,280
on fire. Okay. We're going to put out the fire. The horrible that these people were killed in a

93
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,840
plane. Oh my gosh. I bet some of those people on the towers were killed as well. That's horrible.

94
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:08,920
Still the intensity when the towers collapsed was really intensifying. It was an intensifying thing.

95
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,240
It's interesting that you immediately understood what was happening. I have another friend who was

96
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,080
a Marine and he just happened to be in Australia for some training gig on 9-11. His reaction was,

97
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,600
I mean, I'm amazed at the insight, right? Which was he realized, oh, it's never going to be the

98
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,040
same. He understood that to be a Pearl Harbor like moment, which you did as well. I mean, that's...

99
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,840
Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I can honestly say I couldn't even think like, I just didn't know what to think. I was

101
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,800
steering headlights. I was thinking much more about... I remember because I was in the hospital,

102
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,280
it was like, oh my God, are we going to need to open up a bigger burn unit? I was just thinking

103
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,080
about a bunch of dumb blocking and tackling stuff. Purely tactical, right? Purely tactical. Not a

104
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,640
strategic thought in my body. Yeah. And yet now in retrospect, it seems so obvious. Yeah. I thought

105
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,000
it was pretty cool because at the time there's a guy called a detailer, which is someone that's in

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,200
charge of your actual billet in the military. So you're going to get assigned a job and the person

107
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,560
that assigns you your job at a SEAL team or at a forward base or whatever is going to be the guy

108
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,920
called the detailer. The officer detailer at the time was a guy that I had worked for, who was a

109
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,400
friend of mine, who was just a fantastic guy. Great guy, had a great relationship with him.

110
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,680
And I called him up and said, hey, sir, it's Jaco, get me out of college. I'll go to college later.

111
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,480
I'll do online college. Don't worry about any of that. Please, please, please get me back to a SEAL

112
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,440
team right now, please. You're having this call the evening of September 11th within a day or two,

113
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,960
I was making the call and begging him to please get me out of college and send me to a SEAL team

114
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:57,000
where I can go and deploy. And he told me, hey, finish college. This war is going to last a long

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,480
time. And so here's a guy that was more mature than me and smarter than me. And I still didn't

116
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,960
believe him. But the reason I started off by saying I thought I was cool because I saw him and

117
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,960
his wife the other day and I was talking to him and I was talking to both of them and saying,

118
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,000
hey, I remember on September 11th, I called and asked you please to send me to a SEAL team.

119
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,600
And this is where I thought I was cool. And he said, you know how many people call me that day?

120
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Everyone called him. So again, when you talk about like the attitude that right there is another

121
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,400
great example of like every SEAL officer that was anywhere but at a SEAL team called up and said,

122
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,880
please send me to a SEAL team right now. So did you finish college? Yep. Yep. So you returned to

123
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:42,280
the SEAL team what year? Spring of 2003. So six months after the Iraqi invasion. Right after the

124
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,880
Iraqi invasion. I showed up at the SEAL team. Explain for people listening who aren't familiar

125
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,160
with the nomenclature. So the people have heard of obviously SEAL team six, got a lot of discussion.

126
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,680
What are the numbers mean? How big is a team? So I would say the biggest misconception is people

127
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,240
think of that a SEAL team. What you think of a SEAL team, people think of a SEAL platoon or a SEAL

128
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,760
task unit, which is like, oh, you think you're a team? 12 guys. 12 guys. An actual SEAL team is

129
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,440
a bunch of platoons and all the platoons generally don't work together. So you'll work maybe in one,

130
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,120
two or three platoons sometimes. Occasionally you might do something bigger than that. SEAL teams

131
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,120
have done some operations that were bigger than that coordinated. But generally you're just going

132
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,480
to be one, two or three SEAL platoons operating. So that's what it is. The SEAL teams, the odd

133
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,160
numbered SEAL teams are on the West coast. The even number SEAL teams are on the East coast.

134
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,120
And are they numbered in the order of like the first one was just SEAL team and then the second

135
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,960
one became two and then three SEAL team one and SEAL team two were commissioned at the same time.

136
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,400
Meaning back in the 60s. Back in the 60s. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what it is. As we grew, they've

137
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,440
made more SEAL teams. And there are how many today? Four per coast. So there's up to eight. Yeah. You

138
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,040
were on more than one, weren't you? I was at SEAL team one, SEAL team two, SEAL team seven and SEAL

139
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,720
team three. In that order. Yep. So you finished at three. Okay. So when you're coming out of college

140
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,480
in 03, you are going into SEAL team. I went to SEAL team seven. Yep. And I showed up at SEAL team

141
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,400
seven, the SEAL team at the time. So you do a workup to prepare to go on deployment. And these

142
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:21,160
guys were just about done with their workup. So what happened was the commander of SEAL team seven

143
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,480
was another guy that I had worked for and was pretty close with. And I showed up at his SEAL

144
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,320
team without a SEAL platoon. So I was just a guy I was going to go on deployment, do whatever I could.

145
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,960
And I remember I was walking, we were walking across the walkway there. And he said, you look

146
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,560
mad, Jocko. What's wrong? He goes, what can I do for you? That's what he said. He said, what can I

147
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,760
do for you? And I said, give me a one way ticket to Iraq, which is of course, again, this is what

148
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,720
everyone was saying at the time. And then he said, standby. And I was kind of interested in that

149
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,280
reply. Fast forward a little bit. He ended up firing one of the platoon commanders and put me

150
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,800
in charge of platoon. So I took over a platoon that was getting ready to deploy. And again,

151
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm the luckiest guy in the world because to show up at a SEAL team and get a SEAL platoon that's

152
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,440
getting ready to deploy to Iraq, it doesn't get much better than that. It really doesn't. Did you

153
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,880
spend any time in Afghanistan? I went to Afghanistan, but I didn't fight there at all.

154
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,000
I flew through there to do some visits with some senior personnel, but I never did anything there.

155
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,800
No. And when you talk to guys that saw combat in both, how did they compare it?

156
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,800
The funny thing was guys that were with me and tasking a bruiser that then went over to Afghanistan,

157
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,240
the principles of combat don't change. One of the big things was one of my buddies described it as

158
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,480
in Ramadi was like, Oh, you got streets and you got buildings. That's your low ground and then your

159
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,800
high ground in Afghanistan, you had valleys and peaks and don't want to dominate the high ground,

160
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,200
just like you did in the city. Want to get good angles. I mean, the geometry is the same,

161
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,320
but the distances are further. So, and then one of my other guys that went directly from

162
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,280
pretty close to thereafter went from Ramadi. He said that in the urban combat, the rapidity

163
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,600
with which things unfold is a lot tighter. So you don't have much time to make decisions.

164
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,040
There's a building right there. There's a guy in it. Things don't unfold for very long. Whereas

165
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,480
in Afghanistan, unless you're in the urban part of an Afghanistan or you're in a small village,

166
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,320
then it's the same thing. At distances, you have a little bit more time to think,

167
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,480
but they both have incredible challenges and both situations were brutal in many ways.

168
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,120
How many troops are still in Afghanistan? American troops.

169
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,320
I don't know what the number is right now.

170
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,400
As low as it's been, presumably since the invasion.

171
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,040
Yeah, low.

172
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,320
What are the differences and similarities between the American experience in Afghanistan and the

173
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,840
Russian one a decade earlier slash Soviet, I guess, to be more precise, because the Soviets

174
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,480
in Afghanistan struck me a lot like Vietnam.

175
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah, it was harsh, very harsh. The tough thing is that the differences between

176
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,600
the US military and the Soviet military is pretty immense. One of the books that I covered

177
00:14:51,240 --> 00:15:00,520
on my podcast is written by a Russian soldier that fought in Chechnya. And it's a crazy book.

178
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:07,000
And this guy, his name is Arcady Babchenko, I think is his name. And the reason that it's

179
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,480
interesting is, do you remember not too long ago, maybe a year ago, there was a journalist that was

180
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,600
assassinated in Ukraine? I don't think I remember this.

181
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah. So this journalist was assassinated in Ukraine and it was this guy, Babchenko,

182
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,960
who had written this book, which is just an incredible book. And he was assassinated by

183
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,640
Russians. And it turns out that he faked his own assassination so that he could like prove

184
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,360
something. And he's just crazy like Russian guy. So he's in hiding right now. Yeah, he's in hiding

185
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,920
right now. But anyways, he wrote this incredible book. What was really crazy about this book is

186
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,480
these soldiers in the Russian army, you're out fighting this brutal enemy, which was the

187
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,480
insurgency in Chechnya, they're sawing heads off of people. It's as bad as you can make it.

188
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,400
And then they come back at night and their sergeants beat them and their captains beat them.

189
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,960
And they're just abused and they're drinking vodka. It's a horrible situation books called

190
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:10,760
One Soldier's War. And it's just a book that's, it really shows you the difference between the

191
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,400
American military and the Russian military. And you know what, the Russians are hard people.

192
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,800
I think everyone knows that, you know, there's a part where he rattles off, you know, the sergeants

193
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,960
beat the corporals, the staff sergeants beat the sergeants, the lieutenants beat the, and he just

194
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,360
goes right down the chain of command. Everyone is getting beaten. Like really, they're going to beat

195
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,680
their shit out of you. Why? Because they're bored. Why? Because you didn't get water for them when

196
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,480
they wanted you to, you're going to get beaten. And that's what they're living through. So you have

197
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,200
that going into Afghanistan. So the point too, is that you're saying the morale is. Morale is freaking

198
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:53,960
horrible. The morale is absolutely freaking horrible. The other thing is like, who ends up

199
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,120
in fighting units in the Russian military? It's the downtrodden people. It's the misconception

200
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,560
that people think in America, people think, oh, in America, it's only the poor people that go in

201
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,240
the military. It's like, no, there's all kinds of people in the military and it's voluntary.

202
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,320
So you can go, you can not go. In Russia, it's like, oh, if you got money, you're not going in

203
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,240
there. If you're a prominent person, your kids aren't going in the military. It's only the people

204
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,640
that didn't have any other choice that are going to end up there. So yeah, their morale was really

205
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,000
bad. And then fighting against the Afghans who are hardened fighters and kind of like the Russians

206
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,280
use their terrain and their environment as their defense. So the Afghans do the same thing, which

207
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,680
is, Hey, we have mountains, we have Hills. And then they got the stinger missiles from us. And

208
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,760
it's like, the movie, Charlie Wilson's word does a pretty good job of actually showing some of that

209
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,120
stuff. Yeah. It's sort of hard to believe. I remember hearing a story, I don't know if it's

210
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,200
correct that sometimes the stingers would misfire and blow up. Sorry, I shouldn't say it would fire.

211
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,000
So you would get the shot off, but the device would actually blow up. So the guy who fires, it dies.

212
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,040
So he hits his target, but dies. And the story was initially the Mujahideen thought that that

213
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,680
was actually a feature of like, that's how willing they were to die, right? It was like,

214
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,280
wait, I get to blow up a Russian airplane and die at the same time. Yeah. Yeah. Bonus bonus program.

215
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,600
And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, sorry. That's a misfire. We have to fix the issue there.

216
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,120
That's not the way it's supposed to be. It's another classic case of

217
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,840
insurgency. You find out that this big organization can't maneuver like you can.

218
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,520
That's how you beat them, right? That's how you beat them. I was talking with a company about that

219
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,040
the other day. Like, okay, here's what you're up against. You're up against Titans and you will

220
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,480
not beat them in a war of attrition. They can outspend you. They can outhire you. They can outwork

221
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,600
you. They can out produce you literally. So the only way you're going to beat them is you have to

222
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,280
be more maneuverable than them. You have to find out what their weaknesses are because they do have

223
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,600
weaknesses. Because when you're that big, guess what? You're not mobile anymore. So how are you

224
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,680
going to attack their weaknesses? That's what you have to figure out because you can't beat them in

225
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,880
a war of attrition. So it's the same thing, right? That's the same thing with what we ran into in

226
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,000
Vietnam. We cannot beat them in a war of attrition because they don't care. And what do they do? They

227
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,040
find our weaknesses. What do they realize? We do care. And once we realize we do care, cool. You

228
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,160
can kill 200 of us and we'll kill one of you. And eventually you're going to grow tired of it.

229
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,800
That's the reality. Why do you think that vets who came back from Vietnam had such a

230
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,840
horrible experience compared to vets coming back from Iraq? So you could argue you saw

231
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,680
similar things that upset the public, right? So the public saw, oh, of course, it's always these

232
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,960
things are blown out of proportion, right? Because you're seeing a snapshot of something. You don't

233
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,040
necessarily know that that represents the person that's in front of you now, let alone the majority

234
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,280
of the people that were fighting. But you had these people coming back from Vietnam that were

235
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,120
pariah. And fortunately, it doesn't seem like the vets coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan were

236
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,240
treated that way. The vets coming back nowadays have been treated great. What do you think is the

237
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,440
transition? Is that a transition in simply the American psyche? A little bit of the American

238
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,520
psyche, the wars for sure. But why were the Vietnam vets treated so poorly? People hated the war.

239
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,760
Most people hate Iraq and Afghanistan wars as well, right? And I don't think people have made

240
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,640
that connection of, hey, just because a guy went to fight doesn't mean that the war is on his

241
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,200
shoulders. Now, some people say, oh, that's crap. And I hear that all the time. Like if, oh, if you

242
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,840
didn't believe in the war, then why did you go fight? Right. And some people make the distinction

243
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,920
of like, hey, listen, this is a soldier out there doing his job. So don't get mad at him. You want

244
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,080
to get mad at someone, get mad at the politicians. So I think we, people made that distinction. And

245
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,680
there's some people that still make the distinction like, oh, if you went and fought, then you

246
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,880
supported the war and you deserve the hatred from me because I don't agree with the war.

247
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,480
But I think less people believe that now or less people act that way now than did during Vietnam.

248
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,840
I had one seal on my podcast. It was a Vietnam guy. That was a just a legendary Vietnam guy

249
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,840
named Roger Hayden, who was one of the guys that I looked up to. And when I was a young seal,

250
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,360
he came on and talked about Vietnam. And I said, well, what was it like when you came home? He's

251
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,160
like, oh, no one protested him. No one never saw anything. You know, and again, you're living in

252
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,720
San Diego. He's a seal. You're kind of in a nice little environment. But I covered another book on

253
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,440
my podcast where the guy lost his arm, came home to Vietnam. He's going to college and like

254
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,440
literally get spit on. And so it definitely was a thing, but that generally doesn't happen anymore.

255
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,040
You see it a little bit more, you know, see some of the radical extremist left wing people that

256
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,120
still might hold a grudge against the frontline soldier. But I think people realize that that's

257
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,680
not a good target for your anger. It's an ineffective target for your anger, right?

258
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,040
And I'm guessing that when you guys were there, when you were deployed,

259
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,560
you didn't spend a lot of time talking about your own political views, because obviously,

260
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:02,200
you guys are pretty well informed. In fact, you're seeing things in person that you can tell people

261
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,440
are missing back home, right? Scenarios like actual interactions, you know what the insurgents

262
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,000
look like. And we know what the insurgents are doing to the civilian populace, which will change

263
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,040
your mindset on what we should be doing. So when you, when you know that the insurgents have

264
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,760
decapitated the head of the household in a neighborhood with five families that starts

265
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,400
to leave, or you know that they skinned the guy alive. When you hear that, you go, okay,

266
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,560
we should be doing something about this. We have some kind of an obligation to help these people

267
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:36,360
that are under the oppressive insurgency that's here. And you see a little kid, you see these

268
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,080
little families just trying to live their normal lives. And you think we can help them. They don't

269
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,240
want these insurgents there. They hated the insurgents, but they couldn't do anything about

270
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,520
it. And so we can. So that does leave an impression on you. Did you generally feel welcome where you

271
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:58,360
were? Yes. In Baghdad, because most of my first deployment I spent in and around Baghdad. And my

272
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,720
second deployment, I spent the entire deployment in Ramadi and the civilian populace wanted us

273
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,840
there without question. In fact, there was a great piece on Vice, you know, Vice News. They did this

274
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,520
piece when ISIS was coming to Ramadi and there was a guy in there and I thought, Oh, this is going to

275
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,320
be an interesting thing. Cause you know, Vice is kind of a left leaning organization. And I still

276
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,320
watch them to hear what their perspective is. Sometimes they have a good perspective on things

277
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,880
and they did this great piece of this guy who was in Ramadi as ISIS was approaching. And he was

278
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,120
showing all the townspeople and he was showing like the mayor or the governor of the city of

279
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,040
Ramadi. He's on the phone, placing phone calls, trying to get America to come back. Please,

280
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,200
please come back. The guys in the streets were saying, we hope America comes. And you know what,

281
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,520
America didn't come. And ISIS came into Ramadi and completely annihilated it. We got reports from

282
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:02,200
people that we knew that were there that when ISIS got there, they went out and had retribution

283
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,400
on families that had worked with coalition forces and they ended up murdering about 500 families,

284
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,400
men, women, and children. What is the presence of ISIS in Iraq today?

285
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,480
Nil. Are they mostly in Syria? No, they're dead. Really? Yes. Cause I had read something quite

286
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,760
recently that said, no, there's a real pocket of them and they're sort of hiding somewhere, but they

287
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,640
were killing thousands and thousands of ISIS fighters. It was a beautiful situation because

288
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,720
the ISIS fighters became a conventional army for the most part, right? They got vehicles,

289
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,360
they had flags, they had uniforms. So that was their strategic error. Instead of it being in

290
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,600
an asymmetrical situation, we were fighting against another army. So it was like fighting

291
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:52,680
a nation state. Yes. That was inferior. Yes. Yes. And so we killed, I would say somewhere around 50,000

292
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,760
of them. These are black uniform, ISIS flag carrying, took back the city of Ramadi, took back

293
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,440
Mosul. So that's, that's what it was. If you went back to Iraq today, let's say you went with your

294
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,080
family, where would you want to go? What would you want to see again? Ramadi, I'd go to Ramadi

295
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,160
and I'd go to Baghdad. Have you been there before? I've never been to Iraq. What was surprising about

296
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,800
Baghdad is Baghdad was a very Westernized city. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, Iraq was very secular.

297
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,400
You're from California where you live in California. You'd be driving down a highway

298
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,040
around Baghdad. And if it was nighttime, you'd think I could easily be on the I-5 here in

299
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,760
California. A guy in my residency program was from Baghdad. And also I just, my parents being from

300
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,560
Egypt, they would say, look, Iraq is by far the most secular, wonderful place in the middle East.

301
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,160
Like such a stark contrast to Iran, such a stark contrast for sure. And in the 70s, even more so.

302
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,480
So what your parents probably remember is like kind of Iraq and its heyday when it was kind of open

303
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,280
and it was doing business with other countries and everything. That's, you know, I remember even

304
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,720
after the first Gulf war, my parents saying, look Saddam Hussein is a horrible creature, but

305
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:06,200
surprisingly, he is not religiously like he doesn't kill Christians. He sort of just lets

306
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,120
people be sort of religiously what they want. Maybe that wasn't entirely correct, but their view was

307
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:19,160
he was not as horrible as we thought, which again, maybe he was. I just remember my parents placing

308
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:26,120
such a premium on the fact that he was religiously more tolerant than other leaders in the middle

309
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,120
East. Now, again, I think that's always colored through your lens, right? That's colored through

310
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,440
the lens of your experience and religious prosecution. But it does beg the question,

311
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,000
which I think most people agree now, he was sort of bluffing with his weapons of mass destruction.

312
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,400
I mean, this was sort of his way of showing strength to his people and potentially to his

313
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,560
enemies who he had used them on. Yeah. Right. So it's like as much as you, again, this is going

314
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:55,320
back to hindsight's 2020. Well, if he's saying that he has weapons of mass destruction and he's

315
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,040
certainly used chemical weapons, he has used them before and he's saying that he has them. Well,

316
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:06,280
then it's like, okay, I guess he has them. And there you go. But again, it just playing these

317
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,640
stupid thought experiments. It's like if he could have seen how it was going to end, wouldn't he

318
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,720
have just come up with some sort of solution that's like, you know what? Absolutely. Yeah.

319
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,200
Let the UN inspectors in. Of course he would have. Well, at least you'd like to think it was because

320
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,680
he managed to maintain power in that country for a long time. He made some good decisions along the

321
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,400
way and he just screwed that one up because he held the line of saying, look, I have these in

322
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:36,040
their mind and you can't come in here and inspect. And it was a bad call. Good God. So what is the

323
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,280
future of warfare look like? I mean, when you think about the fact that we are still at war,

324
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,640
most people, most of us as civilians were just so separated from it. We don't remember it. We just

325
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,600
don't think about it, but the lessons of the past 20 years, how have they shaped what could be the

326
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,040
potential for future conflicts? In other words, are there people in the military that are spending

327
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:02,120
a lot of time thinking very strategically about what military conflict is going to look like for

328
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,000
the United States in the next 25 years? Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's really hard to predict exactly

329
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,440
what it's going to be like, but let's face it. We're going to have technology. We already have

330
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,080
drones that are running around, can shoot weapons and that's the way it's going to be. Right. And

331
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,240
will we have robots? Yes, we will. What's a robot versus a drone? I mean, it seems like the drones

332
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,320
are going to be the more powerful in the air, air control. So yeah, you're going to end up with

333
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,480
drones killing each other and hopefully the drones will all fight the wars and the drones versus the

334
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,560
robots. Will you eventually have all your drones destroyed? Possibly. Will all your robots be

335
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,320
defeated? Possibly. And then what do you do? You're going to be a human being on the ground.

336
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,280
The drones really came into their maturity, maybe the lack of the wrong word, but the drones really

337
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,480
made a big step forward in this past decade, the past 15 years. For sure. What has been the net

338
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,160
impact of that? Has it been more positive or more negative? Because you certainly hear extreme

339
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,960
stories on both sides, right? Well, less people at risk directly, but oh, less discernment in the

340
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,960
field. Definitely less people in danger, right? For the good guys, quote, good guys. What scares

341
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,520
people? Isn't the fact that the drone just is less discriminate than a human? I think it's just

342
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,160
the fact that it's a drone because that's what scares people. Hey, a machine can come and kill me

343
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,680
with no thought, no guilt, no remorse. Can just do it. Yeah. That's scary to a lot of people.

344
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,640
I think it's the way that the future wars are going to be fought. Yeah.

345
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,480
It's interesting because even when you take a step back and ask a broader question, which is

346
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,760
who will the United States be fighting in 25 years? Let me ask you this. So a human being could do a

347
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,640
surgery, right? And a robot could do a surgery. The robot can only do it through a surgeon's hands.

348
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,360
So the surgeon is still sitting there at a console operating, which is presumably the same thing. A

349
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,560
drone is a drone is not autonomous, right? Yeah. Yeah. True. I guess where I was going with this is

350
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,920
that's kind of like with handmade cars versus cars that are made by a machine. And everyone

351
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:04,040
thinks that the handmade things are better and the reality is they're not. Yeah. And so I've seen

352
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,600
some things. Who was I talking to? I was talking to someone that said, if you don't have this type

353
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,400
of technology, if you have a human being doing this procedure on you, you're in the wrong place.

354
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,760
Maybe it was you that was telling me that. Well, you know what it comes down to? It comes down to

355
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,840
you have to ask yourself the question, what problem is being solved by the introduction

356
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,800
of this technology? So we love technology, right? So yeah, when robotic surgery devices came along,

357
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,600
the initial thought I think was this is going to completely replace surgery,

358
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,400
but you have to take a step back and say, well, wait a minute. There are certain operations for

359
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,280
which the robot makes so much sense because there are certain things that the robot can do

360
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:46,280
so much better. And you have to pair those things with it. So the best example I can think of is

361
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,960
probably the radical prostatectomy. And the man has prostate cancer and you want to remove it,

362
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,400
but remove it not by going from the outside of him, like not by taking the shortest path to the

363
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,240
prostate, but by going sort of through the retroperitoneum and the abdomen. That is such a

364
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,680
hard operation to do with your hands, which is the way it has always been done. And to this day,

365
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,400
some people still do it that way because it's so hard to see what the hell is going on. It's like

366
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,720
operating in a deep, dark hole that's bloody. It's just miserable, right? Well, what does the

367
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:27,480
robot do? The robot allows you to have much finer motor control and much better visibility. Well,

368
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,760
that operation is tailor made for that. But there are some operations like breast augmentation,

369
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,400
visibility and tactile ability to do the operation are not remotely problematic, right? It's a surface

370
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:45,880
operation. So could you for giggles and self promotion or whatever, say we're doing, you know,

371
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,960
robot assisted breast augmentation. Sure. Is it an advantage? No, it's a drawback.

372
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,200
I guess where I was trying to go with that, and I think I might've failed, but I mean,

373
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,000
I think your point is there are probably applications where drones and robots make

374
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,600
way more sense, but there are probably places where the opposite is true, right?

375
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,440
The point I was trying to make was we inherently trust another human being more than we trust a

376
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,720
robot, even though the robot might be able to do a better job, right? I mean, if a robot kills

377
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,280
someone on the operating table, then it's like, oh my God, how could that have been? But we know

378
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,440
that surgeons kill people on the operating table as well. And you think, oh, well, it must have

379
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,800
been an accident or whatever. So we inherently trust that the human being is going to do a better job

380
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,400
than the robot's going to do. But when robots do things in combat that get people harmed,

381
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,680
is the mistake usually the human mistake on the other end or is? At this juncture, yes. Just like

382
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,720
in most cases with a robot surgery, it's like, hey, the surgeon put in the wrong input, right?

383
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,440
But in the future, it may be that you're actually having this drone make a little bit more of the

384
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,280
decision and that really can scare some people. I think people inherently don't trust robots to

385
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,280
make decisions that are life and death. Yeah, I know. Like this is not something I know anything

386
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,240
about, but I love. Okay. Driverless cars. Yeah. Okay. Let's just do that one, right? Driverless

387
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,280
cars. Okay. Which one? I'll take driverless cars all day long. There you go. No questions asked.

388
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,720
And yet when a driverless car gets in an accident, it's on the front page, right? It's on the front

389
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,120
page because, oh my God, this thing let this happen. What? 50,000 people die every year?

390
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,480
No, it's more than that. Okay. So whatever the number is, it's a crazy number.

391
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,320
I think it's about a little over a million people die a year in the world in car accidents. And yet

392
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,000
it's like 1.2 million. One Tesla hits a wall somewhere because the program failed or whatever

393
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,520
happened happened and it's on the front page and we don't trust that, but we trust a 16 year old.

394
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:49,080
Oh yeah. That's the most egregious, the best example of a lot. So we can't predict what the world's

395
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,440
going to look like in 25 years, let alone who our quote unquote enemies are going to be or what the

396
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,080
tools and technologies of warfare are going to be. How much time do you spend thinking about

397
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,360
the fact that one day you're not going to be around for your kids? Hopefully, right? Hopefully

398
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,120
your kids outlive you. You don't know what the world's going to look like, but you want to prepare

399
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,040
them to be successful in whatever way that means to you, right? Could be being happy, can mean being

400
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,480
safe. It can mean being productive, having a sense of purpose. How do you think about instilling

401
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,520
that into your kids today? And so much of what we think of the work you do is with the world's

402
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,760
best teams, right? Military business, et cetera. But in many ways, probably your greatest lessons

403
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,000
probably come around a kitchen table. Well, this is why I wrote the kids books that I've written

404
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:46,200
and it's because the things that I think kids need to know in order to become good humans,

405
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,240
I put them in those books and they are very clear, very simple lessons that are very easy

406
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,520
to understand. They're timeless and that's why I did it. That makes it. I had a guy ask me the

407
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,040
other day who was at a speaking at a company and a guy said, you know, these things that you talk

408
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,360
about, they're so powerful and they're so meaningful and these theories and these principles that you

409
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,080
live by are just so important. What are you doing to transfer these to kids? And I was like, well,

410
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,640
luckily you don't know this, but I've written four kids books and that's exactly what they are,

411
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:29,080
these principles. So way the warrior kid. That's what it is. What do your kids think about? Because

412
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,640
you're their dad, right? You're not Jaco, your dad. That's really different. And that means that

413
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,600
they get pissed off at you. And that means that they think you're being unfair at times. And that

414
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,240
means you notice the hesitation in my voice when I said they get pissed off at me, they don't

415
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:50,440
really get pissed off at me. I don't impose things that don't make sense on them. And the things that

416
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:58,440
I steer them towards, they know that they're correct. And so you can't get mad at someone for

417
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,920
telling you something that's going to help you. And I think they've all grown up enough. And

418
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:12,440
one thing I was careful as they got older is to make sure that they developed their own

419
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,800
interpretation of what I was saying. I didn't want to impose things because I did that too much when

420
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,120
they were little, when they were little, I forced to jujitsu on them too hard. And not only that,

421
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,840
but I made them train. I made them compete. I made them train all the time. I made the compete

422
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:35,080
against people that were older than them, bigger than them, heavier weight classes, more advanced.

423
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,840
And so it wasn't fun because they would get beat and that's not fun. And so as they got a little

424
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,800
bit older, as I started to try and actually incorporate the values and the principles that

425
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,720
I kind of attempt to live my life by, I was careful not to make the same mistake of imposing

426
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,440
these things so hard, but instead allowing them to discover the principles, truths for themselves.

427
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,600
So do they see in you vulnerability?

428
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:12,520
I'm not sure. I'm not sure if they do see too much vulnerability in me. I think they know that

429
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:21,400
my best friend died last year and they definitely saw that my heart was crushed. And so I think that

430
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:30,680
was probably the time where they really realized dad's hurt, he's hurt bad. And that's the way it is.

431
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:37,320
Is that vulnerable? Perhaps, I guess. Is that me being a human being? I guess.

432
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,120
One of the things my wife talks about with me a lot and reminds me of the importance of is

433
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,680
being really good at telling them when I make mistakes and apologizing when I make mistakes,

434
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,320
which I make a lot of, right? I mean, I make mistakes all the time,

435
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,040
come home in sort of a shitty mood and take it out on them a little bit. And again,

436
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,880
it's not like extreme, right? It's not like whack them across the head, but it's just like,

437
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,680
whack them across the arm. Or just like, you know, like saying, Hey, how many times have I

438
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:09,080
told you to turn the light off in your room? Okay, well, 50. So make this the 51st, but was that tone

439
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,280
necessary? Is there another way I could have said it? Right? Well, the reality is I'm pissed off about

440
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,120
something totally different and like being able to sort of apologize for that. And that's something

441
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,680
that's very new to me. Like it's something I've never really had much practice in. I mean,

442
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,240
do you think about stuff like that? Do you feel like to be a good dad, I've got to be able to,

443
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,560
to show them all the times I make mistakes and not be afraid of it and let them see that I'm

444
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,800
human and that I screw up every day. And, or do you feel that that just comes naturally to you?

445
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,680
I mean, I guess that's pretty easy for you. Yeah. I'm not hiding any mistakes. When I screw

446
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,240
something up, I laugh at it and say, wow, that was, I'm an idiot. Look at that. To me, that's no

447
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,200
factor. I have no ego when it comes to that kind of thing. The big joke in my family is that I

448
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,040
don't really like technology. I don't get along well with printers and things like that. So they

449
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,720
don't work. You know, my family laughs at me because I get mad at them. And that's the only

450
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,440
time I allow myself to be mad because it's an inanimate object. So I can be mad at something

451
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,600
that has no feelings, right? So I have fun with it. So you like that scene in office space?

452
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,840
I play a game. I kind of play it up a little bit that technology bothers me. Let's my kids see me

453
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,320
get mad and yell at my computer and call it names and just have fun with it. But no,

454
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,640
it's no factor to me. One thing I think is that people probably have the impression that I'm some

455
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,160
kind of tyrannical authoritarian father. And I'm not. It's funny. I wouldn't get that impression

456
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,440
actually. Okay. Well, I should rephrase that. You might not think that, but from the surface,

457
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,000
when people see me, because I look like a serial killer and I was in the military for a long time

458
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,200
and all that people think, Oh, this guy must be a tyrannical dad. And I'm actually very much similar

459
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,280
to, well, not even very much similar leading a family and leading your kids is the same way

460
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,480
you lead an organization, the same way you lead a team. And if you bark orders at your team,

461
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,760
your team doesn't like you, they don't respect you. And they're not going to carry out those

462
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,240
orders with any sort of commitment. Whereas if you allow them to come up with what the plan is,

463
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,040
you let them know what the goal is and you allow them to forge what their idea is and what their

464
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,760
plan is going to be, they're going to commit to that plan and they're going to go execute it.

465
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,600
Cause it's their plan. And so that's the way you should lead your family. That's the way you should

466
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,440
lead your team. That's decentralized command. It's one of the major lessons that I learned in

467
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,920
my military career and now working with civilians and the minute you decide you're going to bark

468
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,400
orders at people and impose your discipline upon them, they're going to reject it. And so you've

469
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,320
got to be careful about that. So let's turn our discussion to a topic that I get asked about

470
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:33,560
more than anything else. Whenever your name comes up, gee, can you guess what this is going to be?

471
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,800
Yeah, I was following your Twitter and your Instagram when you were asking, Hey,

472
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,640
what do you want to talk about? And what? 50% of the people said, ask him about sleep or tell him

473
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,280
to listen to the doctor Walker, Matt Walker did talk to Dr. Walker. And he should listen to that,

474
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,360
which I got that because he was on Joe Rogan as well. And so I got a million tweets about that.

475
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,640
And I responded that one of the fun ones I had was you need to listen to Walker on Joe Rogan when

476
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:04,920
it first came out. And I said, I listened to it. And if what that guy was saying was applicable to

477
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,880
me, I would be 120 pounds. I would be disease ridden. I would be, I would be weak, depressed,

478
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,640
and have bad skin. That's what he was saying. And that's where I should be. So well, let's talk

479
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,080
actually practical. So tell me a typical, let's not get into jet lagged or different time zones

480
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,760
or stuff. But when you're in San Diego, what time are you typically going to bed? Go to bed 11,

481
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,840
wake up at 4 30. Okay. You go to bed at 11 and talk to me about the routine before bed. What are

482
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,680
you doing? When do you stop looking at electronics? When are you eating your last meal? Like, let's

483
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:42,280
just get home from Gigi to around 7 30 or eight. I eat sometime after that. Usually that's my biggest

484
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,200
meal. So there's another big jocko faux pas. Not necessarily, but we're not passing judgment here.

485
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,080
I just want to get a big meal then. And then I'll do a little bit of work. I'll hang around with my

486
00:41:53,080 --> 00:42:01,720
kids, then I'll do some work. And then when 10 40, 10 30 rolls around, I'll brush my teeth.

487
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,840
So you're in bed at 11. You fall asleep pretty quickly?

488
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,520
I fall asleep like almost immediately.

489
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,320
Do you get up at all in the middle of the night?

490
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,920
Maybe, but not that big of a deal.

491
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,600
You wake up with an alarm or without?

492
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,120
I set an alarm. If I don't set an alarm, but then I cannot sleep at all.

493
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,760
Sorry, say that again. If you don't set the alarm, your anxiety?

494
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,160
Yes.

495
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,560
Okay.

496
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:19,800
Yeah.

497
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,400
So you set the alarm for what time?

498
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,280
4 30.

499
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,240
And how many times do you wake up from the alarm versus?

500
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:25,880
50%.

501
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,920
And half the time you've just woken up on your own at what time typically?

502
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,760
Between 4 and 4 30.

503
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,600
Okay. When you wake up without the alarm, how do you feel?

504
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:34,920
Fine.

505
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,760
When you wake up with the alarm, do you feel any different?

506
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,080
No.

507
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,840
How many times a month do you wake up and feel tired?

508
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:49,160
I don't know. I'm not sure. The tired that I know you're not talking about is physically tired,

509
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,840
meaning I'm sore. I'm tired. I know that's not what you mean. I know you just mean like,

510
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,640
oh, I'm tired. I want to go back to bed.

511
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,360
I don't get a lot of that. I'm physically tired. And this is something that when I was going to

512
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,520
college, I was training jiu-jitsu two to four hours every single day and lifting and surfing,

513
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,400
do whatever. But the jiu-jitsu was hardcore at the time. And then at the end of one year or whatever,

514
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,080
my exams piled up and I had like four days of exams and I had to study and I skipped jiu-jitsu.

515
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,000
And on like the third day with no jiu-jitsu, I got up out of bed and I was like, dude,

516
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,760
I feel like Superman. I wasn't, why do I feel so awesome? And it's because I fully rested.

517
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,560
So I usually feel some a little bit sore in the morning, but I don't generally feel like,

518
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,800
oh, I want to go back to bed right now.

519
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
Do you ever nap in the day?

520
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,480
Yes.

521
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,280
What time?

522
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,360
It depends. If I'm tired, I nap. I probably nap two days out of seven.

523
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,640
Typically, how long is the nap?

524
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,200
Eight minutes.

525
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,360
Oh, so I wouldn't even call that a nap. But okay.

526
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,880
So it's not like a 90 minute nap.

527
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,760
Oh, no, no, no. If I take a 90 minute nap, I won't be able to go to sleep at night.

528
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,960
If I take a 90 minute nap, I'm up until two o'clock in the morning.

529
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,200
So the eight minute nap. Oh, you told me about this once before. Tell us your routine.

530
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,320
Elevate your feet above your heart and then set an alarm for eight minutes,

531
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,920
10 minutes at the most, maybe 12. But if I do 12, now I feel a little bit groggy when I wake up.

532
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,560
Eight minutes, I feel like Superman. I feel like I just slept for eight hours.

533
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,800
And you don't consume a hell of a lot of caffeine. You don't drink coffee, right? You're a tea guy.

534
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,560
I drink tea when I need it.

535
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,920
You mean you drink white tea and stuff? I mean, the Jaco tea, which I can't believe

536
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,520
I didn't ask you to bring more Jaco tea.

537
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,320
I got one for you.

538
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,800
You did?

539
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,120
Yeah.

540
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,760
Thanks, brother. I freaking love Jaco tea.

541
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,080
Yeah.

542
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,440
But you're not a caffeine junkie.

543
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,080
Nope. In fact, caffeine has a pretty big effect on me.

544
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,640
Stimulating.

545
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like I feel caffeine. I feel it a lot. So if I'm doing a long drive,

546
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm going to be awake for more than 24 hours and it's nighttime, I'll drink some caffeine for sure.

547
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,080
Was this the same in high school?

548
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,880
I don't really remember. Let me rephrase that. I slept just normal, woke up in the morning,

549
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:58,760
did what I had to do, went to bed when I was tired, probably slept somewhat similar to the same hours.

550
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,120
Didn't wake up as early, but stayed up later.

551
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,040
It's funny. Yeah. I've tried to remember what I was like in high school sleep wise,

552
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,600
but I also know I wasn't sleeping a lot. I remember what I did. Like I remember what

553
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,680
my bedtime routine was exercise wise and what my morning exercise routine was like

554
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,800
and just doing the math on how many hours it would have taken to do this stuff.

555
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,840
I probably only slept six hours a night in high school, which I think today I would caution

556
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:29,960
against. Of course, if I go to bed early for whatever reason, let's say I go to bed at 930,

557
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,680
I'll wake up at 330. That's probably a better answer to your question of how often. So basically,

558
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,960
at six hours, I'm like, that's a normal sleep cycle for me. Six hours, okay, I'm up rock and roll.

559
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,880
You don't have one of these rings, do you? The Aura Ring or any of these sleep tracking devices?

560
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,680
I do not.

561
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,760
I'm kind of curious to put one on you. It'd be sort of, they're very good at tracking duration

562
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,400
of sleep and obviously not entirely accurate on staging, but pretty good. It'd be interesting to

563
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,120
see the efficiency of your sleep because I suspect it is efficient if nothing else.

564
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:04,120
My guess is it is. That is my guess is that when I sleep, I sleep hard and I'll wake up,

565
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,960
I sweat a lot, I'll have bad dreams and I'll wake up in a disgusting puddle of sweat sometimes.

566
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,880
How many times a month would that happen?

567
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,960
Oh, it happens a lot. Yeah, it happens a lot. And yeah, and actually I got the thing that

568
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,040
cools your bed and that helps me. Yes, I have a chili pad. Kelly sent me one and that definitely

569
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,120
helps. As a matter of fact, if I use that, I don't have those things. So that's kind of weird. I don't

570
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,400
know how to explain that. Yeah, I'll have a dream that something's happening and I'm running

571
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:40,040
away or I'm pulling myself or I'm engaged in some kind of a combat situation and I'm running

572
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,880
out of bore. I'm out of bullets, like those kind of nightmares and I'll wake up. The exertion that

573
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,280
I put out in the dream is reflected in my sweat when I wake up. So how often are those dreams

574
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,040
about scenarios that are real, like that you've seen in the past versus totally contrived? First

575
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,680
of all, I don't remember all of them, but I'll remember like that split second when I wake up,

576
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,760
I'm like, oh man, I've been running. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. Yeah, this is nasty.

577
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,440
Our mutual friend, the person who introduced us is Kirk Parsley. Have you and Kirk spent time

578
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,840
talking about this stuff? You know what? We only have a joke back and forth on Twitter. He tells

579
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,440
me to sleep more. I tell him no. One of the interesting experiments that Kirk talked about

580
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:30,040
with me many years ago, and I'm going to sort of bastardize it, but the gist of it was they basically

581
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:36,280
took a bunch of guys in the military, highly sleep deprived, and then put them in an environment

582
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,280
where they were forced to be in darkness for some period of time. I want to say it was like,

583
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,600
I think it was like 10 hours a day or something like that. And the idea was, or maybe it was 12

584
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,680
hours of pure darkness, 12 hours of light, but with no sense of time. I don't think they had

585
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:58,680
access to any clock. And within two weeks, they were all basically sleeping something like seven

586
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,520
and a half to nine hours a night, even though they hadn't been sleeping close to that in the past.

587
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,720
So it begs the question, right? Have you done the experiment? If for no other reason

588
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:14,680
than just out of pure curiosity to what would happen if you slept seven and a half hours a day

589
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,240
instead of six, what would be the impact on your memory, your performance? The closest thing I can

590
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,560
say to that is, like I said, sometimes I'll be really tired and go to bed early. And I wake up

591
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,120
six hours later, I'll get up and start working. Because even if I have nothing to do, I'll get

592
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,440
up and be like, okay, well, I'm not going to lay here anymore. But no, I haven't done any experiment

593
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,360
like that. Interesting to think about how to do it, right? You don't want to conduct that experiment

594
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,920
by taking a bunch of Ambien and sleeping 12 hours, because that's not sleep either. You've told me

595
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,320
before, I think at least one of your kids is similar. Yeah. And so this is when people get

596
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,960
mad at me, which they do get mad at me about, they say you're encouraging people not to sleep. And

597
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,280
I'm absolutely not doing that. I think people should sleep as much as you need. I believe that

598
00:48:54,360 --> 00:49:00,680
sleep is important. That's why I sleep almost every single day. That's a joke. But I got it,

599
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,000
but I was drinking from my topo Chico. I don't discourage sleep. I think sleep is important.

600
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,480
And I, one thing that I've seen is I've seen, I've watched people's cognitive abilities go down when

601
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,760
they're tired. I've seen it. I've watched it happen. Like a guy gets tired and all of a sudden he can't

602
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:24,760
make good decisions. I've seen that over and over and over again. So I know that people should sleep

603
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,680
and should sleep as much as they need. Right? They totally agree with that. I think that there's a

604
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,280
chance that people need different amounts of sleep. One of the things that has led me to believe that

605
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:43,320
is that I have four kids. Each one of my kids has their own sleep pattern that they've developed on

606
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:50,120
their own. I never mandated that my kids wake up when I wake up or anything. My oldest daughter,

607
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,440
when she was in high school, I would go to bed at 11 o'clock and she'd be awake studying and I'd

608
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,920
wake up at four 30 and she'd be awake studying and she would do that all the time and she'd go to

609
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:07,640
school. No factor. She does not need sleep like a normal person. My middle daughter, she will sleep

610
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,320
until you pull her out of bed. She will go to sleep as early as she wants or she can and then

611
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,640
she'll sleep until you pull her out of bed. My son is somewhere in the middle and my youngest daughter,

612
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:26,040
I don't have any judgment about right now. So there seems to be some genetic role that is in

613
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:33,560
play here because my oldest daughter barely sleeps and my wife sleeps a lot and I barely sleep. So

614
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:42,200
that just may be the way it is. Yeah, I would love to. I'm going to be seeing Matt Walker soon and the

615
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,440
three of us should just get together because I'd love to propose sort of what are things that we

616
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,120
could check in you to make sure they're okay. Just out of like total curiosity, right? One of

617
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:58,280
the things we talked about on our podcast was a single night of missed sleep would alter the

618
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,240
brain's ability to clear amyloid or maybe it was tau but something that was sort of toxic to the

619
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,480
brain and you could document this by doing lumbar punctures on patients pre and post and you can

620
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,040
have a root canal and we'll follow it up with a lumbar puncture. But one of the things that you

621
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,680
propose that can't be discounted, right? I mean, it has to be at least acknowledged as plausible is

622
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,640
there have to be differences between people and it's certainly entirely possible that what you need

623
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,200
is different from what I need because I've done the experiment, right? So I used to be the guy

624
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,440
that only slept five or six hours a night. But when I did the experiment of sleeping seven and

625
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,120
a half to eight and a half hours a night, the benefit was significant enough that it justified

626
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:44,520
the less time. You don't feel groggy when you sleep eight hours. You don't feel like slow. No.

627
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,080
You don't feel like a lack of mental clarity. No. You don't feel like you're physically not at your

628
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:55,480
peak when you sleep that much. No. Now again, the challenge that I have is that I travel a lot.

629
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,120
So I don't have the luxury of being in the same time zone. Put it this way, the longest I've been

630
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:06,520
in the same time zone in the past eight years is four weeks. I'm probably worse than that,

631
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,600
or at least as bad as that. So that interferes with stuff a little bit. But when I get those

632
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:16,840
like two week stretches where I get to be in one time zone and I can dial in same time every night

633
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:22,360
to go to bed, same time every morning to wake up, I mean, it definitely feels good. And also I look

634
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:28,200
back at my sort of most unhealthy period of my life when I was overweight and heavily insulin

635
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,240
resistant and all of those things. And I had historically placed a lot of that blame just on

636
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,960
my diet. I now believe at least half of that blame belongs on my sleep deprivation. Sometimes I'll

637
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:47,640
travel and I'll go somewhere and I'll show up and the time benefit is to me. And all of a sudden I

638
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,240
go, oh cool, I can sleep. I can set my alarm clock and I'm really tired right now. And I'll set

639
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:00,120
my alarm clock and I'll wake up in 10 hours. And so I'll do that and I'll go to bed and I'll wake

640
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:07,560
up seven hours or eight hours later. And I don't feel like I feel groggy. I guess that's just jet

641
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,560
lag, I guess. Yeah. And it also might be that you haven't hit an equilibrium. I mean, I think that

642
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,440
would be the question, right? It's like, is there an equilibrium where you got to go through a sort

643
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,040
of reconciliation period for your body to sort of get used to it? But I mean, I appreciate you

644
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,280
saying this stuff because there's one question I get asked, which is like the moment somebody

645
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,440
knows I know you, it's like, when are you going to talk to him about sleep? You're right. People get

646
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,440
upset about it. I suspect it's because they think that or they're interpreting what you're saying as

647
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,440
don't sleep. And I appreciate you clarifying that. Now that gets to a couple of the other questions

648
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,280
that I've actually written down from the Instagram stuff, which was actually great. It kind of worked

649
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:51,320
out as like a mini Q and a before we even. So I'm going to just read them verbatim. Describe a time

650
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:57,160
when you gave up, how did you deal with that in the end? How did you bounce back? How do you tell

651
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:03,480
the difference between giving up quitting versus the smarter calling it quits? This is what we've

652
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,960
been talking about all day, strategy versus tactics. You sometimes in a tactical situation

653
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,720
have to give up because you've taken the wrong path. You've got the wrong plan. You didn't

654
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,640
suspect something was going to unfold the way it did. And so you have to give up. You have to

655
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,720
quit on that plan. What you don't want to give up on is your strategic goal. And so you got to make

656
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,360
those adaptations all the time. And I can give you the countless millions of times that I've said,

657
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,360
you know what, this plan that I had isn't really working out. I'm going to stop doing that plan.

658
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,680
I'm going to quit on that plan and I'm going to go from a different direction because I still want

659
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,600
to reach my strategic goal. Now, what about quitting on the other side, which is quitting

660
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,960
in a moment of weakness? I don't want to keep doing this even though I should keep doing this.

661
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,200
If you want to keep doing it, why would you stop doing it? So I'll give you an example from my life.

662
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:59,000
In marathon swimming, you are disqualified the moment you touch the boat. And every swim has

663
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,560
their own set of rules. So I've never been in a marathon swim, no matter how much it hurt,

664
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,800
no matter how miserable I was, no matter how cold, scared, thought I saw sharks,

665
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:13,080
or I wanted to touch the boat. However, there was one swim I did that was actually a relatively

666
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,280
short swim. It wouldn't qualify as a marathon swim. It's called the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Swim.

667
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:24,440
So it's out near Maryland and it's a four and a half mile swim from one side to the other.

668
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:34,120
And you swim between a span, two enormous bridge spans, and you are disqualified from the race

669
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,720
if you can't stay within the current and you slip outside of the span. So there are boats

670
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,920
on either side of the spans that are there and any swimmer who gets pushed out, gets yanked up.

671
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:51,560
I can't remember what year it was, but there was one year when I felt like this is my year to sort

672
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:57,320
of be in the top 10. Like I really felt dialed. I trained specifically for that distance, which

673
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,440
is not really my sweet spot. And I had looked at all the times in the previous year I had done well

674
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,360
and I was like, you know what? I'm there. I'm going to be top 10 of a race that nobody cares about.

675
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,320
It couldn't be a less relevant goal here. And everyone who's ever done anything knows the

676
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:19,320
feeling of 10 seconds in, you know it's not your day. You know what I mean? Like it's just the next

677
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,720
hour and 55 minutes are going to suck. And by the way, it's not going to be an hour 55. It's going

678
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:30,920
to be two hours and 15 minutes today. So I'm a quarter mile, half a mile, maybe, maybe a mile

679
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:37,320
into this race. And I'm feeling horrible. Like it's just not clicking. Like I don't have that

680
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,720
groove. I can't understand why, but you know, I've had this experience many times before in training.

681
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,600
So I'm taking a stroke and I'm outstretched. So right arm in front, left arm in the cat,

682
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:53,480
in the high position recovery and the swimmer in front of me, not of course on purpose, kicks down

683
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,160
really hard, hits my arm. I sublex my shoulder. So now my shoulder, my humerus is out of socket.

684
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:06,760
So a miserable day has gone to become now a much more miserable day. I put the shoulder back in.

685
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,880
I do have relatively loose right shoulder from boxing. So I'm able to put it back in while

686
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:18,520
treading water. But of course it hurts like hell. So I now realize you're not going to finish in the

687
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:25,960
top 10 dude. You're going to just finish and I'm just upset. Like I'm, I'm in pain. I'm upset.

688
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:32,040
I'm just frankly, just being a little whiny bitch. And so I just got like, put your head down and

689
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:39,400
swim, just put your head down and swim. And what I really remember struggling with as clear as day,

690
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:45,320
and this is like 13, 14, 15 years ago, the struggle I had that moment was I wanted to let

691
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:50,760
the current push me out. You see in that swim, the current is perpendicular to you. The reason this

692
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,800
swim takes as long as it does for the distance it does is you're not actually just swimming

693
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,240
straight. You're swimming against a current perpendicular. So it's very easy to go out and

694
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,720
get disqualified. Like it just means you just have to stop fighting the current. And I remember this

695
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:10,920
was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I just wanted to quit so badly. I was like, look,

696
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,880
there's no shame. No one will even know dude, it's a strong current. You got pushed out. Your shoulder

697
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:22,680
got dislocated. Like just get it over with. Now I didn't, I don't know why. I don't think I deserve

698
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:28,280
a hero cookie for not. I was like, no, I just couldn't bring myself to let, but I wanted to

699
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,720
so badly. And I guess that's sort of my story. That would be the answer to that question,

700
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,760
which was that was the hardest thing I ever did. And by the way, I didn't feel good when I got

701
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:45,240
to the shore. You'd think I felt great. You did it. You conquered your demon. My wife to this day

702
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:52,120
still tells the story of how pissed I was when I got to that beach. She said, you got out of the

703
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:58,760
water. You walked past me. You didn't even say anything to me. You grabbed a bottle of water on

704
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,320
the thing and you said, let's get the fuck out of here. Like, I mean, it was just like, again, there

705
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:08,680
was nothing beautiful or majestic about conquering my demon on that day. I mean, I just, I was

706
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:14,040
miserable. I hated every second of that. And, um, but I still remember it. I didn't perform there.

707
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,360
I wanted to going in and then I was just like, it's one of these things. Like I'm starting to

708
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:24,920
blame everything. Oh, this guy kicks my shoulder. Now I'm dislocated shoulder and I'm in, you know,

709
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:30,520
just get into this awful negative spiral. And then I fought this fight against myself where I wanted

710
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,240
to quit, but I couldn't quite let myself. And I knew enough to know that if you quit now,

711
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,840
you're going to really regret it in about an hour. That's what I was going to say is like,

712
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,000
you might've been pissed that you got kicked and didn't place where you wanted to place. But what

713
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,160
you knew in the back of your head is that you let yourself drift out of that thing. And that,

714
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:54,200
that moment is going to haunt you for a long, long time, despite your efforts to rationalize it,

715
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,560
despite your excuses that you're going to make and the blame you're going to cast on everyone else.

716
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:05,240
You're going to know that at that moment you quit. And that you knew that in the back of your head.

717
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:11,480
That's why he swam on. You're still pissed off, but guess what? You took the lesser of two evils

718
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,640
because you washing out of that thing, you would have hurt more.

719
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,440
Have you had struggles like that where you really, really wanted to just tap out?

720
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:28,360
I was paddling out on a giant day in ocean beach and that's not the San Francisco ocean beach.

721
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:34,680
That's the ocean beach, San Diego. I was paddling out on a big, big giant day where I was with my

722
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:40,920
best friend and we were paddling out and it was a huge giant closeout day of surfing. And I was

723
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,880
on a pretty big board that was hard to duck dive and I didn't have a leash on, which means that you

724
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:51,320
have to hold that thing and get through the surf. And I paddled for a long, long time and I didn't

725
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,200
make out. It's the only time. But hang on, is that just because you physically couldn't make it happen

726
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,480
or did you quit? Well, I mean, I didn't make it out, right? I mean, I didn't make it out. I tried

727
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,840
for a long time and I didn't make it out. Okay. But that's like me saying, Jaco, I want you to fly.

728
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:13,000
I want you to flap your arms really, really hard until you get onto my roof. Yeah. Well, whatever

729
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,520
it was, it left me with a feeling of defeat. And I thought to myself, well, that was pretty weak.

730
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,440
But is that any different than not hitting a deadlift rep that you want to hit or a rep

731
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,240
count on something? Okay. I'm not sure. I guess the reason I bring that up is because you're,

732
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,640
when did I walk away? Well, like I could have paddled more, I guess is what I'm saying. I mean,

733
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,960
I could have paddled more. I don't know if I would have made it or not. I don't wear a leash a lot.

734
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,920
And that was one day I was thinking, man, if I just had a leash, because if you had a leash,

735
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,560
you can just kind of let go of your board. You can just dive under the waves and you can swim

736
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,840
out and it's fine. But when you have to haul that board through with no rope, it's kind of a pain

737
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,720
that I didn't make it. So that kind of feeds into another really interesting question, right? Which

738
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:58,200
was does Jaco understand that others may have difficulty with things that are easy for him?

739
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,360
Here's the problem with that statement. The problem with that statement is, and this is

740
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,480
something that I've experienced with my kids and I've experienced it with other people that are in

741
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:13,720
my life as well, which is, well, it's different for you. It's like, oh, well, it's easy for you

742
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,880
to get up early in the morning. It's easy for you to work out every day. It's easy for you to write

743
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,400
a thousand words because you're different and you're you. So I don't really like that concept

744
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,160
of putting me in some position where I'm some kind of superhero because I'm not, man, I'm not,

745
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:35,480
I'm a normal human. And here's the dichotomy. The dichotomy is I know that I'm not normal.

746
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,440
I know that I say that, but I also know that there's another weird thing going on because,

747
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,080
okay, on the surface, the very initial thing you look at me and you think, oh, this guy's not normal,

748
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,920
right? Then you get to know me a little bit and you go, yeah, you know what? This guy's pretty

749
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,800
normal. Like he's a pretty normal guy. The thing that is not normal is like the real, the deeper

750
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,280
level. That's where it's not normal. That's where it's like, yeah, I will not stop. You know what I

751
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,440
mean? Like there's that little thing in there, but I don't overtly run around with that because it's

752
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:08,760
offensive to a lot of people. And part of my job has been not being offensive to people and trying

753
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:15,720
to be a part of a team and, and have a team and be a good team member. And so if you're constantly

754
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:22,040
rubbing things in people's faces, that doesn't help your mission. You can't bark out your attitude

755
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,880
on people all the time because what you're supposed to be doing is being a part of a team.

756
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,200
So as far as that question goes, I know I'm not a hundred percent normal, but you know what? No,

757
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:36,840
one's a hundred percent normal. My reading of that question is I think that person is looking for,

758
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:42,440
and again, I don't know who wrote this, but they're looking for some acknowledgement.

759
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,800
Have you got into the deep discussion with Sam Harris on free will? No, we've danced around it

760
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:54,040
a little bit, but I'm sure one of the reasons that we really haven't had that discussion is

761
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:58,840
because that's what he does. He talks about free will. He wrote a damn book called free will.

762
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,280
So we haven't really had a big discussion about it because he'd say, Hey, you don't make your own

763
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,800
choices. And I'd say, well, watch this because I'm going to make a choice right now. And then he'd

764
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,280
say, well, that choice was based upon your genetic makeup, the time that you spent on earth. And

765
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,920
I don't know. I don't know. It's such an interesting topic, right? Of all the things that Sam writes

766
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,640
about and talks about, this is the one that bends my brain the most. But here's where I am today. I

767
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:26,040
still don't know if I believe in free will. I would say this. I used to absolutely believe

768
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:33,800
in free will. Today I'm a free will agnostic. Maybe I'll be a free will atheist. Actually,

769
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,800
Sam told me we were talking about what we were going to talk about. I think we were going to

770
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,200
do another podcast. We're going to do a live podcast or something. And he said, I'd really

771
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:49,960
like to talk about free will and extreme ownership. He says, because they really align. And I was like,

772
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,920
hey, cool. I can talk about extreme ownership. You can talk about free will because that way I

773
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,200
don't have to study and go deep on that subject because to me it's like this. Call it whatever you

774
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,200
want. If I want to do something, I'll do it. And if I don't want to do something, I won't do it.

775
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,040
Kind of an interesting concept. Of course. And when you come at it through that lens,

776
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,200
which is, I bet you and I went through the same things. I would come up with counter examples

777
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,240
all the time. What's like, if you told me to walk into a store and pick something out, I promise you,

778
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,800
I have a choice of which thing I'm picking out, which is an easier example than think of three

779
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,320
movies. Tell me the first three movies that pop into your head. Well, that one's a little harder,

780
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,360
right? To say that you picked those three movies. You know where I've shaken out on this? It has

781
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:34,680
given me a little bit more understanding of people that don't share my work ethic, that don't share

782
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:42,440
some of the values that I have because I think it used to be so hard for me to acknowledge the

783
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:47,640
existence of people who didn't just want to crush it every minute of every day. It just bugged me.

784
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:53,080
It just bothered me. And I tried to separate it from the person, but deep down, I think I harbored

785
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,400
a resentment that I think has melted away significantly as a result of this. I think

786
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,680
that's a really good point and I never framed it that way, but I tell people all the time from a

787
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:07,240
leadership perspective, people are the way they are. And so that basically is saying they don't

788
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,720
have free will, right? So I would have to agree with that. And you can have some level of influence

789
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,720
on it, but you've got a person on your team and they have a certain type of attitude and you can

790
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,240
move it a little bit to the left or to the right. You can give them a little bit of course

791
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:24,760
correction, but they're going to be that person. And the only thing that can change them is them.

792
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,640
So maybe that's where I'd have to push back a little bit. Because when you meet someone,

793
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,720
I'm sure you've known people, I've known people in my life that have radically transformed their

794
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,720
life. There's been a transformation that has taken place that they went from being one type of person

795
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,720
to being another type of person, right? Do you know people like that? I mean, you can take a person

796
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:46,440
that's an addict. This is a really obvious example. And they come clean. Okay, cool. So they've made

797
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:52,040
a radical transformation in their life. That's good, but you can't impose that transformation

798
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,800
upon them. They have to come to that conclusion that they want to change. I was having a conversation

799
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:03,560
with a guy that I worked with in a company overseas and he was saying, hey, and this guy's

800
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:08,280
made some pretty radical transformations in his own life. He's opened up a bunch of businesses,

801
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,360
he's making a ton of money now he's doing really well. And he was not not doing that well before.

802
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,720
And he said, got a new business partner in this one business that I'm doing. And can I change this

803
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,120
guy? Can I change this guy? I realized maybe I shouldn't have partnered with him. But can I

804
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:30,360
change him? And I said, No, because these are text conversations. And I'm your jock. I said, No, no.

805
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:37,080
And then he replied, You changed me. And then I replied, You changed you. Sure, I illuminated

806
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,720
the path. But he's the one that decided he was going to change. And that's the same thing with

807
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,080
his business partners is you can't impose the change on them. You can show them the path though.

808
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,080
And then hopefully they make the transition. Well, maybe that's the answer to this next question

809
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,400
that actually dovetails nicely, even though it was asked by a different person, which is,

810
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:59,400
how does Jocko work with people who have virtually the opposite mindset? So, for example, make excuses,

811
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,360
externalize, blame others, procrastinate, how do you work with such people and get the best out of

812
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,440
them when you have to? The answer is you get the best out of people that you can. And when

813
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,360
somebody makes an excuse to me, you know what I do? If I'm working with Peter, and I say Peter,

814
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:18,520
that project didn't get done. And I'm your boss. And Peter says, Well, you know, we didn't get the

815
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,680
funding that we're supposed to have. And I say, Okay, you know what, that's my fault. What can we

816
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,760
do to get you the funding? Or you say, Hey, I didn't have the resources that I needed. Okay,

817
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,440
that's my fault. Because I didn't get you the research. Or you say, Well, you didn't give me

818
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,920
enough people. I say, Okay, well, then I need to get you more people. Or I need to lower the scope

819
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,040
of what you need to get done. Because if you're making a bunch of excuses, I'm gonna own them.

820
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,160
And by the way, that goes up and down the chain of command. So if I'm working for you,

821
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:48,200
and you're not giving me more, I need, that's my fault, too. And when you get people together like

822
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,920
that, that's when people start taking ownership of everything. And not everyone is gonna like that.

823
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,080
Some people do not like to take ownership, like the person that's being used here in this example,

824
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,800
is some people will never take ownership of everything, because it hurts their ego,

825
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,160
and they don't want to be blamed for everything. And so they just would rather slough it off.

826
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:08,040
And what's great about those people is they won't last inside my organization. They'll get eaten up,

827
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:14,680
they'll get consumed. And maybe you're in a communistic type scenario, or whatever HR is not

828
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,400
going to let you mean there's all kinds of situations where you can't get rid of the person

829
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,680
because they don't have a good work ethic. So then what I'm going to do, I'm gonna get the best I

830
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:24,520
can out of them. That's what I'm going to do. You can't fire. People think, Oh, this is different,

831
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,080
because in the SEAL teams, if someone's not doing their job, you can just get rid of them. No,

832
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,440
actually, you can't. And if you do get rid of them, guess what you're gonna get for replacement? No one.

833
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,440
So do you really want to get rid of someone? Do they have any value that they can add? So that's

834
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,840
what we're looking to do. Get the best you can out of people, take ownership of things that they're

835
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,560
making excuses about, and get them fixed. I mean, the extreme ownership is so disarming,

836
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,440
that I think that's part of its power, right? Like who expects to hear that? For sure. And I'll tell

837
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:53,320
you, we've been talking a lot about kids today. One of the best things that I figured out with my kids

838
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:59,080
was when they would mess something up, instead of me saying, you didn't do your homework. It was,

839
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:04,120
Hey, I got a call from your teacher. And she said that you didn't do your homework again.

840
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,280
I feel like I'm not even being a good dad. Because here is the most important thing that you can do

841
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:16,360
in your life is become smarter. And somehow I haven't made that impression on you. And now

842
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,920
you're missing out on simple things that are going to improve your ability to contend with the world

843
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,200
by being the smartest possible human you can be. And I haven't done a good job. Is there anything

844
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:32,760
that I can do that will help you realize why it's so important that you improve your intellect at

845
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,960
every chance possible that you get, you become smarter, because you're going to be out there in

846
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,800
the world one day, and I'm not going to be there, you're going to be on your own. And the only way

847
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:46,440
you're going to be able to survive is because of your brain. And right now, I haven't done a good

848
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,600
job of explaining to you that that's the most important weapon that you have. So when you flip

849
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,600
that on them, they realize that instead of going into your homework, what's wrong with you? Guess

850
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,120
what they're doing? They're blaming their teacher, they're blaming you, they're blaming everyone else.

851
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,680
But if you take ownership, they'll take ownership. Okay, here's an actually an awesome question I

852
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,760
would have never thought to have asked you this. I'll read it in its entirety and let you answer.

853
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:12,680
I really want to know if he indulges ever, specifically, does he drink alcohol? And if

854
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:18,920
he does, how often what kind? It's always overlooked in all of the interviews done by Tim,

855
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:23,320
you and others. I'm surprised. No, I don't drink alcohol. Okay, I don't think I knew that

856
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,320
actually. I've never been with you drinking. So I but I didn't know that is that a decided policy?

857
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,320
Like, did you decide at some point in life, I'm not drinking at all when I retired from the Navy,

858
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,920
I stopped drinking. I didn't even think about it. I retired from the Navy, all of a sudden,

859
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,800
I wasn't hanging around with a bunch of my friends anymore. All of a sudden, we weren't in

860
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:44,840
random cities out there out for dinner and hanging out and doing that. And then I looked up in a

861
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,520
month, and I looked up in two months, and I looked up at three months, and I'd had a beer here and

862
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:53,480
there. And that was that. So now I just don't drink at all. So now is policy, like if you're at

863
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,080
dinner, and there's a glass of wine being poured, you're not gonna have a glass of wine. No. What is

864
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,840
your biggest indulgence, then? Let's start with food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's a big list.

865
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,320
Like, I really like good. Let's hear it. Chocolate, dark chocolate. What percentage is the sweet spot

866
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,760
for you? Well, when you say sweet spot, which is optimum for nutrition and health? No, no, no,

867
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:17,000
no, optimum for indulgence. 72%. Okay, 72%. And I lied to myself and like, you know, that's still

868
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,040
dark chocolate. We know it's not. And the way you can tell, the way I can tell when something is

869
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,760
the right level of darkness is when it tastes good, but you don't want more. When you get a good,

870
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:34,280
for me, 82 squares of 80 to 85%. And I'm satisfied. And I don't even want any more. 72%. I want that

871
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:42,200
whole bar and the box that the bar came in. Dude, that is, that is a perfect metric for life.

872
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:48,280
I completely agree with you, by the way. You throw me a box of milk chocolate. I can eat all of it.

873
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:55,720
A hundred, it's just too dark. There's no pleasure in it, right? But sort of that 85 to 90. Yeah.

874
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:02,040
For me, it's four squares, but four squares of that with like a decaf espresso with dinner is like,

875
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,200
yeah, you don't need to eat the whole thing. You could nurse that bar for a week. Yeah. Yeah.

876
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,960
Besides chocolate, what's a true indulgence? Meaning something that is just patently

877
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:16,200
not great for you in large quantities. Oh, just name foods. Come on. It's weird. Cause I really

878
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:23,480
love steak a lot. And that's by far my favorite food and steak and chicken and pork. And so it's

879
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:28,840
fine. But yeah, man, I love freaking normal stuff that people love mint chocolate chip milkshakes

880
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:35,400
used to be a real, like I would be stoked and I would earn them. I would do something crazy. And

881
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:42,600
I'd be like, you deserve it. And then I ended up making a supplement that's equivalent, right?

882
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:47,000
It's equivalent to a mint chocolate chip milkshake. It's, I made that. And then once I made that,

883
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,320
now there's no reason to, which is, which is a crazy thought, but yeah, the supplements,

884
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:57,560
like a sports powder. Yeah. Yeah. It's called milk M O with an Oomlot L K. And the reason it's

885
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,880
called milk, I made up that word. Cause when I tasted it, when I got it right, I was like,

886
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,920
this is, this needs its own word. You mix it with milk or water with milk. Yeah. I mix it with milk.

887
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,400
I'm going to order some with water. I describe it like this with water. It kind of tastes like a

888
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:17,400
ham sandwich. Like it's good, but it's not enough to like really get excited about it's fine,

889
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,080
but you could do it with like, I love cashew milk is my favorite type of milk. Yeah. Cause it's

890
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:26,920
fatty. And yes. Cashew milk, coconut milk, regular milk. What's the sweetener you use in it? Monk

891
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,960
root. Oh, great. Big fan of the monk. Yeah. No, it's that's the game changer. As far as I can

892
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,800
tell, that's the game changer. And the other important thing is don't overlook Alulos for

893
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:43,240
next additions. Okay. So Alulos actually just approved by the FDA two days ago in its citizen

894
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:49,400
petition to have the FDA correctly acknowledge it for what it is. So Alulos is an enantiomer of

895
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:55,320
fructose, meaning it is something that has the same chemical nomenclature as fructose, but it has

896
01:14:55,320 --> 01:15:00,360
one different position of a bond. It's about 70% the sweetness of fructose, which is still to say

897
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:08,040
it's sweet, but most importantly are two things. One, it has the exact same flavor esque and mouth

898
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,160
feel as sugar, but here's the best part. It's not absorbed. It's excreted by the kidneys. So for

899
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:22,040
every four grams you ingest only for every gram, I'm sorry, you're only getting like one 10th of

900
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:27,480
the absorption. So if that's not good enough, the other property is it seems to drag glucose out

901
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,640
with it. So when you consume Alulos, like for example, I have a bunch of it here, let's say

902
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:35,880
had a tea or a coffee and you put Alulos in it, it would lower your blood sugar. That's impressive

903
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:41,880
because it's dragging glucose out with it and doing so not into your gut where you get gastrointestinal

904
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:47,000
distress, but actually into your kidney. So yeah, so it's really interesting. And for up until two

905
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,680
days ago, the FDA was basically calling it basically an added sugar. So you weren't getting

906
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:57,080
the quote unquote credit for it. So manufacturers weren't using it much because it showed up looking

907
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:01,720
like sugar. So Quest, I think was one of the first companies to work with this. It has a couple of

908
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:07,400
quirks to it. For example, it gets colored easily. It browns quite easily. So if you're making like

909
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:12,520
a white bar, you couldn't use it. And then I think no foods is using it. So anyway, I just saw this

910
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,960
two days ago. So that's something to consider, but monk fruit. Yeah, it's probably one of my

911
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:22,440
favorite of the alcohol sugars. And it's the one that tastes ridiculously good. Yeah. Metabolically

912
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:27,080
quite inert, but I'm not a monk. I mean, we're talking about monk fruit, but for that person,

913
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:33,000
you know, I'm not a monk. I'm a human. I'm a normal person. I like to eat crap sometimes.

914
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:41,240
What do you eat? Typically how many meals a day? Between zero and two. You're not a breakfast guy.

915
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:45,640
Nope. So you're a lunch dinner or a dinner. Yeah. Mostly. Yeah. What was the longest you ever went

916
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:51,080
without food in combat or in training? I don't know. Probably a few days. And then what about

917
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:56,440
these days now? How often do you fast? Probably once or twice a week. And then. You mean you'll

918
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:03,720
just skip a day once or twice a week? Yeah. Yeah. And then once a quarter, I'll do 72. And I know I

919
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:09,400
owe more than 72 at some point in the near future. So I'll be getting some of that. It's really not

920
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:14,040
that big of a deal. I feel fine. I feel totally normal. I feel better. You know, everyone says

921
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,720
they feel better. You do feel better. You do feel better. I don't always feel better. You know,

922
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,360
my last fast, I did not feel good for the first three days. Really? Yeah. I really didn't. I've

923
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,040
gone back and looked and tried to figure out what did I do different? Was there something else going

924
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:30,920
on? I can't come up with what it was, but I definitely did not feel good for three days.

925
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,960
And then by the fourth day, I did turn the corner. It was a bit humbling because I,

926
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:41,720
at this point in the game, I feel like I'm kind of a fasting jock. Like it should always be,

927
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:47,960
it should always be easy and stuff. I still slept really well. So I feel fortunate that I,

928
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,560
using Kirk supplement plus phosphatidylserine, I have the deepest, richest, most intense,

929
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:58,120
beautiful sleep imaginable when I'm fasting. And for that, I feel grateful because I know for a

930
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,840
lot of people, it's really hard. Meditation feels so much better. Like a lot of things do get better,

931
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:09,000
but the hunger was unusual and the sort of sluggishness, not in my workouts. My workouts

932
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,240
actually felt good, but it was just like the kind of ass dragging throughout the rest of the day.

933
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:18,760
That was frustrating. I really don't know what it was though. So I'll be back to it again in a few

934
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,360
months. How often are you doing them right now? I do quarterly. Quarterly five days?

935
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,200
Five to seven, just depending on how long I'm in New York for the given week. I don't fast here.

936
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,680
If I'm at just, I don't want to do it around the kids and stuff. So yeah, it's like I aim for seven.

937
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:35,080
I usually try to do the Sunday to the following Saturday if the trip is accommodates it, but five

938
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:40,280
at a minimum. I think there's benefit at three. I really do. I think three is a real tipping point

939
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:44,600
in terms of glycogen release. Yeah, that's kind of what I'm hearing is that three is like kind of

940
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:50,200
the starting point for the real benefits. So I've been slacking. Yeah. But if you can get to three

941
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:54,520
and feel good, you're really going to have an easy time getting to five. At the end of three,

942
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:59,240
I'm not, I can't wait. No, I'm just sort of whatever. In fact, the first time I did, I remember

943
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:04,200
I was at jujitsu and I had squatted that day. I did my complete normal workout, showed up at jujitsu.

944
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,120
I was like, Oh, this is going to hit me. And I was training with one of my main training partners.

945
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,600
And I was like, I'm going to tell you something. We're done training. And so we trained and,

946
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,920
and this is a guy that I usually do better than I've been training longer than him. So I'm just

947
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,760
a little bit better than him. And that's the way the role went. We trained and I was a little bit

948
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:25,000
better than him like normal. And we got done and, and he was like, what were you going to tell me?

949
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,280
I was like that. I haven't eaten for three days because I didn't want him to get the mental

950
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,160
advantage thinking like, Oh, if he isn't eating, he's going to be trained. I didn't want him to

951
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:37,080
have that. So I didn't give it to him. Or could have backfired, which is a minute in. He feels like

952
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,400
he doesn't have anything over you. He's totally demoralized. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. That seemed

953
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:48,440
like a bigger risk to take psychologically than him thinking, Oh, he's not eating. So I'm feeling

954
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,520
good and I'm going to smash him. I'm going to go extra. Cause when people just like in combat,

955
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,840
just like in life, if someone thinks they have an upper hand and they get a little bit confident,

956
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,520
and then they, they can kind of dictate the situation a little bit more than they normally

957
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,960
would. And this is the type of individual that when I train with him, if he tries to dictate

958
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:11,160
that, then it can be a little bit problematic for me. Again, I've been training longer, so it's not

959
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:17,160
a total game changer, but it'll make things more difficult than they should be. So I would rather

960
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:23,640
have him thinking he's on some new supplement or he's got a new move that he's going to try on me

961
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,520
or something like that. I want him to be in that mindset where he's mentally defensive. And then

962
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:34,360
when it was over, I told him, you know, said no factor. I love when my patients fast because I

963
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,920
love how empowering it is to them. I think the first time somebody gets through a fast, whether

964
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:45,960
it's a modified fast or a outright water fast, it's like, even if it's tough, which, you know,

965
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:51,400
for many people, that first one is actually quite tough. They realize like they did it. They did it.

966
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:56,920
They did this thing, man. They're a little more in touch with our ancestors. Like you did something

967
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:02,360
that you were genetically equipped to do. You know, my kids wrestle and my daughter, my son,

968
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,680
were in high school right now and their season was this last season. But I remember my daughter was

969
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:12,600
cutting some weight and you're talking about how to my kids, I'm not Jocko. I'm just dad. Well,

970
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,560
occasionally they'll let it slip out that they're either listening to my podcast or they're reading

971
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:23,320
my books or something like that. And so one of the things that my daughter told me was she had to cut

972
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,880
a decent amount of weight. And she's like, yeah, I haven't eaten in 36 hours. And I was like,

973
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:31,320
how do you feel? She's like, I feel fine. And then she says, uh, she's like, you know,

974
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:37,640
you said in your book, human beings can go 30 days without food. Like you can make it 36 hours.

975
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:42,360
Do not worry. You're not going to die. It's totally ridiculous. And so she had the attitude

976
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:48,200
like, Hey, oh my God, a three day fast or a two day of 24 hours. Like it's a joke. You're

977
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:55,880
going to be fine. It's really no factor. Well, speaking of daughters, I see mine

978
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:00,920
walking around out there hovering, hovering while I lost her now, but I saw her like two minutes ago.

979
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,880
So she can't be that far. So I'm going to go and get her because of all the questions on her list,

980
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,000
we have got through all of them, but two, and I can think of nothing better than bringing her in.

981
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,200
Let's do ask them. All right. I'll be right back. You need to say who you are first.

982
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:20,200
What are you doing on this podcast? Okay. My name is Olivia Tia and I'm Peter Tia's daughter.

983
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,720
Awesome. What made you want to start being more disciplined?

984
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:32,600
What made me start to want to be more disciplined? One of the main things was when I first got to

985
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:41,560
the seal teams, I noticed that the people that were really good at their job, the people that

986
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:47,960
were seals that I looked at and said, wow, I want to be like that guy. I realized that what they

987
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:53,160
were doing is they were getting to work early. They were taking care of their gear. They were

988
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:58,600
putting forth effort that other people weren't putting forth. They had discipline and that was

989
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:03,560
making them better. And the more discipline they were and the better they did their job,

990
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:11,000
the more latitude they had to do what they wanted to do. So that was kind of the first

991
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:17,560
connection that I made with discipline, making you better and being better, giving you more

992
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:21,880
freedom in everything that you did. Cause when I was a kid, I was kind of a crazy kid and

993
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,680
I wasn't always the best behaved kid. And sometimes the things that I would do, they would backfire

994
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:33,320
on me. And so when I got older, I realized, wait a second, instead of doing things that are going

995
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:38,040
to backfire on me, I'm actually going to try and do a good job and have more discipline. And that's

996
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:44,680
kind of where it stemmed from. Describe what you do during your workouts and what kind of healthy

997
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:50,120
food you eat. I do a whole bunch of different things when I work out, but I think they're all

998
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:57,080
kind of the common exercises that everyone does. Pushups, pull ups, dips, and then I use weights.

999
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:03,400
I use kettlebells. I do deadlifts. I do, obviously I do squats cause everyone, everyone does squats

1000
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:09,400
cause squats are beautiful. And overhead squats, front squats, back squats. I do all those different

1001
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:16,680
kinds of squats. I like to sprint. I have a rowing machine. I have a air cycle. I do a lot of burpees.

1002
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:23,000
It's kind of like there's no secret exercise that I do that's different than what normal people

1003
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:33,000
that work out do. So how did you get the nickname Jocko? Okay. So my real name is John and my dad's

1004
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,880
name is John. And so I was named after my dad. So when you have multiple people in the household

1005
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,920
with the same name, that can be confusing because well, when every time someone says John, then you've

1006
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:50,440
got two people turning their head. So when that happens, it's pretty common for the son to get a

1007
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:56,600
nickname. And so my dad wanted me to be a jock. Do you know what a jock is? Yes. Like athletes.

1008
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,960
Yes. Someone that's all into sports. Yes. My dad was very into sports and he wanted me to be a jock.

1009
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:07,960
Have you ever heard of a magazine called Sports Illustrated? Yes. So my dad, when they found out

1010
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:13,400
I was going to be a boy, he covered my whole room with the cover of Sports Illustrated because he

1011
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:21,880
wanted me to be a jock. Now on top of that, my dad is named after his uncle and his uncle's name is

1012
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:30,440
John and his last name was Oglethorpe. But everyone called his uncle. They called him John O.

1013
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:37,800
John O. So when my dad was born, my dad was named John and they called him John O. That's what they

1014
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:45,640
called him. And then when I was born or actually it was just before I was born, my dad said to my

1015
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:52,920
mom, I hope he's a jock. And my mom said, Jocko. And that's how they came up with my nickname and

1016
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:59,320
it stuck. That's smart. About Face? About Face is a book. It's a note that your dad wrote down.

1017
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:06,200
It's my favorite book. What's your favorite book? Way of the Warrior Kid. Did I pay you to say that?

1018
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,720
No, I just read that last night. Did you read it for the first time last night? No, probably the

1019
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:14,120
10th. Oh really? The first one, the second one? I've read the first one. Okay. Do you have the

1020
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:19,560
second one? No. Oh, I can't believe I didn't bring that. I can't believe that. And the third one is

1021
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,640
coming out soon. Oh, I'll get you that one as well. I need to get my hands on some of these.

1022
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:30,040
What did you learn from Way of the Warrior Kid? What I learned is that the kid, Mark, he wasn't

1023
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:34,680
very disciplined in the beginning, but then he got the training and he learned to eating right. And

1024
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:40,760
he learned how to be disciplined. And then he had more sex in school and he was better at all of

1025
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:46,360
these things. Yeah, it's a big key to life. Yeah. People to this day say what they want to know what

1026
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:50,680
the secret is. And I always kind of say that the best advice I can give someone is have discipline

1027
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:55,560
because then you'll end up with more freedom. I saw that video where it was like a joke and you

1028
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:01,880
said, if you had trouble sticking to your morning routine, get up. Oh yeah. When I was doing my

1029
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:08,760
fake yoga meditation thing, that was pretty funny. When that happened, I was in the studio with these

1030
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:15,160
people from CNBC and I'm in there and they're asking me a bunch of questions. They don't want

1031
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:21,720
me to do stuff. And finally this one girl says, Hey, how do you wake up at 4.30 in the morning?

1032
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:26,440
And I said, Oh, when I wake up, the alarm grows off and I get out of bed. And she says, No, but

1033
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:31,320
and then she kind of like toots like that. You know what a toot is like? Yeah. She goes, you know,

1034
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:37,240
my editor really wants to hear more detail about that. And then I decided to have some fun with it

1035
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:42,520
because the reality is what do you do? If you want to get up early, set your alarm when the

1036
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,560
alarm grows off, get out of bed. That's the way a lot of things are. Your dad and I were just

1037
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,280
talking and your dad says something along the lines of, well, you know, what about if there's

1038
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,400
something that you want to do, but you know, you don't really want to do it. And I was like, well,

1039
01:27:53,400 --> 01:28:00,120
if you want to do it, then do it. I think that's the best policy. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

1040
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:05,080
Thanks for the good questions. Well, my friend, thank you so much. This was so much fun. It's

1041
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:10,360
amazing how quickly time can go by. And yet there's so many things that we didn't get to talk about

1042
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:16,040
that I know we'll continue to talk about, but I appreciate what you're doing. I really, I really

1043
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:21,560
do. And it's so fun to watch you interact with Olivia. I know that half of the interactions,

1044
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:27,240
the really fun interactions actually have just taken place off mic. You know, it's, you are kind

1045
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:32,120
of like a superhero to these kids, I think. And with great power comes great responsibility.

1046
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:37,080
It's my favorite line from the whole Spider-Man movie, right? I think you've seen things that

1047
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:41,960
most of us will never see, fortunately. And again, I don't want to get into the,

1048
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,560
whether it's free will or not free will or how much of this you can take credit for or not. But

1049
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:52,360
the point is a lot of people come back from what you've been through and they're worse for it. And

1050
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,800
I think not only are you better for it, but more importantly, you've sort of figured out a way to

1051
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,560
share it with a lot of people. And I feel grateful to be one of them. Well, I appreciate it. I can

1052
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,600
definitely tell you for what you just said, there's a lot of people that are scared of what war does

1053
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:09,880
to people. And they think that war has a massively negative impact on people. And I can tell you

1054
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:15,720
without a doubt, I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to serve. I'm grateful and unbelievably

1055
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,440
humbled that I had the opportunity to serve with the guys that I served with and fight alongside

1056
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:26,920
them on the battlefield. And I know that it's made me better being around people like that,

1057
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:33,960
seeing what real sacrifice is. And it's an honor to be sitting here. And quite frankly,

1058
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:39,800
when I hear a little girl like Olivia, who is, she's on the path. And just the fact that

1059
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:45,560
conversation right there means so much to me and it feels so good. And I'll be thinking about that

1060
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:52,280
for a long time. And it's awesome. And I'm super happy and stoked that I get to do this. And,

1061
01:29:52,280 --> 01:30:01,560
and again, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for other guys that put down their life, gave their

1062
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:09,240
life to give someone like me a knucklehead this gift and the opportunity to be here. So I'm happy

1063
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:13,640
to be here. I'm thankful that I'm here and I appreciate you having me on and thanks for doing
