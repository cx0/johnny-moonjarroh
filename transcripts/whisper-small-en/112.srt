00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,960
today's episode. My guest this week is Ned David. Ned is the president of Unity Biotechnology,

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,640
a company that he co-founded in 2011. In this episode, we're going to talk a little bit about

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Unity, but more importantly, we talk about the science upon which Unity is developed,

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,400
and that is the science of senescence or cellular senescence. We begin this episode by putting that

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,000
into context. I think if you're interested in the space of longevity, you're listening to this

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,400
podcast, you've undoubtedly heard the term senescence, but it might not mean much to you.

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,240
I think what Ned does a great job of here is explaining not just senescence, but where it

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,400
fits in the overall lattice, if you will, of all of the different cellular processes that occur

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,400
during aging. Where does it fit in with the role of mTOR inhibition, caloric restriction,

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,520
mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell exhaustion, methylation of DNA and epigenetic change, all of

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,560
these sorts of things. We also talk quite a bit about Ned's background as a serial entrepreneur in

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,560
biotechnology. Ned is at least partly responsible for the development of a number of FDA approved

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,680
compounds, and he talks openly about what he learned good, bad, and indifferent along the way,

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,240
and how that helped him at the beginning of this process of creating this company,

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,760
Unity, define sort of the jugular questions that needed to be addressed as sort of a proof of

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,760
principle. In fact, I found that part of the discussion most interesting, and I think you'll

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,240
know what I'm talking about when we get to that part of the episode, because I found that exercise

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,560
that he and his co-founders went through between about 2011, 2015, to be some of the most

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,640
interesting thinking around this idea of company creation. Ned is a prolific innovator. I think

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,120
when he was about 30, he was named to the top 100 innovators in the world by MIT Technology Reviews.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,840
He holds a PhD from Cal Berkeley, and he got his undergrad degree in molecular biology at Harvard.

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,440
So without getting into too much more of the details of this, please enjoy my discussion with Ned David.

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,680
Ned, awesome to see you today. Thank you for coming by. Oh, thank you for having me. I feel

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
like I haven't seen you in person in way too long. Is this true? We tried to get you to come to dinner.

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
Oh, God, I feel horrible about that. Yes, sorry. Yeah, you were distracted. It's all good. No,

34
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
you know what I was doing? You were doing a podcast. I was doing a podcast that I thought

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,320
would take two and a half hours. It ended up taking six hours. That must have been an intense

36
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,280
experience. It was a very intense experience, and I felt horrible after. I'm sorry. So I owe you an

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,320
apology for that. It's okay. We love you. There's so much I want to talk with about you. In fact,

38
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,680
I've been bugging you for about a year to come on the podcast, because what I was hoping we could do,

39
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
and we can never do it when there's a microphone in front of us, but was sort of reproduce at

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,520
dinner conversation that we would have ordinarily, which would be pick some topic and we go way off

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,120
on a tangent about it. It could be energy. It could be biotech. It could be whatever.

42
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
But some of the most interesting discussions we've had over the past five years have been around

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:05,280
longevity, something that we both share an interest in. God, it's been probably nine years since you

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,800
talked to me about what became that which you're doing today. Is that about right?

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah, that's about right. It was 2011 towards the end. Yeah, actually, we're in December now,

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,160
so it's actually been somewhat more than eight years. So I want to talk a lot about your work.

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,920
You're always a guy who's got a lot of hats on. Right now, you're mostly wearing one hat,

48
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,040
and that's a hat that puts you squarely at the center of a pretty big circle with a bunch of

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,360
folks working at a company called Unity Biotech, which we'll certainly get to. But I think for

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,680
listeners to really understand what you do today, what your company does, they need to sort of

51
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,880
understand the journey you've gone through over the past several years and how that's sort of

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,960
shaped your thinking about an interesting problem. You're a serial entrepreneur, and we will likely

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,640
discuss some of that in your background. But let's just start with how you think about this problem

54
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,960
that I think about, which is how do we help people live longer? How do we help people live

55
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
better? How do you define that, by the way? I don't want to impose my definitions on you.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,160
What is longevity to you? Well, longevity for me would be being able to live without the indignities

57
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,720
that I've witnessed, we all witness in our lives, all of these features of aging that seem to be

58
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,840
inescapable. So my father, for example, he has profound degenerative disc disease, which makes

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,520
him functionally immobile. It defines his life. My stepfather died of Alzheimer's at 87.

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,680
That defined the final chapter of his life. So I've been up close to these things in other people.

61
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,480
In addition, we all, and you and I are now, I'm a little older than you, I'm in my 50s now,

62
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,440
we are witnessing these changes in ourselves. And for me, longevity would be the ability to use

63
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:03,600
what I know how to do, which is science and biology, and be able to change how we get to live our lives,

64
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,000
to be free of these indignities. And I think it's something that we can do and we are doing it.

65
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,040
And so for me, it sort of began as a dream, but now we're generating human data that says

66
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,360
this, we can actually do this. So I remember when this started, Ned, circa 2011, how you read

67
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,240
steeped yourself in this field, which at the time was kind of new. You had already done a number of

68
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,920
interesting things in biology that had led to the development of drugs, but none quite in this space.

69
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,280
I mean, I literally remember many nights I'd be driving home and we'd be talking on the phone and

70
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,840
you would be telling me about things that you had just read about. And I saw this paper and it's 10

71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,320
years old, but it was almost like you were going through a second postdoc or something, getting up

72
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,120
to speed in this. I've always liked the way you sort of explained your evolution of thought there.

73
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,800
Do you want to maybe for the listeners, give them a sense of how you developed a framework around this?

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
About sort of aging biology.

75
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
Yeah, why do we age and what can you do about it ultimately?

76
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,920
So maybe it's helpful for me to just create some context. And so the way I think about this and the

77
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,880
way I explain it to people that are new to this or people that aren't scientists is I always talk

78
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,080
about there are these sort of three principles that if you remember nothing else from listening,

79
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,320
if you're awakened two weeks from now in the middle of the night, it's these three principles

80
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:37,280
that I think are a good way to think about this. And the first principle is that aging is not a

81
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,200
rigid thing. So it's this flexible, malleable thing. And nature has throughout evolutionary

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,120
history sort of bent and twisted aging for its own purposes to create creatures that have very

83
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,040
different lifespans. And this kind of takes us to the second principle, which is that nature has

84
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:05,120
done this with these control knobs. These are sort of biochemical systems that nature twists.

85
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,280
And these systems are now something we're learning. And this takes us to the third principle

86
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,480
to turn as people that do drug hunting like us. And so it's these three principles that

87
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,920
nature is flexible or that aging is a flexible thing. And nature has then bent and twisted

88
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,080
control knobs to make it flexible, and that these are turnable stuff. So if you take those three

89
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:36,640
principles as the context, you may ask, well, why do we as scientists, why do I believe these things

90
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,880
are true? So if you just look outside at nature and creatures across phylogenetic history,

91
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,800
you see very similar creatures with very different lifespans. So if you take the hard clam,

92
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,760
so this is this thing you can eat at a clam bake. If you don't eat it, it will live about 40 years.

93
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,920
And it has a deep ocean dwelling relative called a quahog that lives at least 500 years. And

94
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,520
these are very similar creatures. They look very much the same. And no one really knows how long

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,880
this quahog lives. This 500 year thing was just because that was what the age of the wreck off

96
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,800
of which it was pulled was. So these are very similar creatures on the order of 12 fold

97
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,080
different lifespan. Similar story, if you flip over to, let's say the order of rodents. Actually,

98
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,840
let's not even go to rodents. Let's just talk about mammals, because that's us. Of course,

99
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,480
rodents are mammals too, but we are mammals as humans. So if you look at the shortest living

100
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
mammal, which is this thing called the tiny shrew lives less than a year. And then you look at the

101
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,000
longest living mammal. So it's called the bowhead whale. And again, no one knows how long a bowhead

102
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,400
whale actually lives. So the estimate is at least 200 years. So again, you've got this 200 fold

103
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,720
difference at least in creatures that kind of have the same biochemistry or both mammals. Now,

104
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,880
if you flip over to rodents, it's the same phenomenon. Okay, you can take a field mouse,

105
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,640
which can live somewhere between two and three years. And then you find this naked mole rat,

106
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,600
which is this very unusual looking subterranean creature that's blind and hairless. This creature

107
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
lives 10 times longer lives on the order of even more than 10 times longer lives on the order of

108
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,200
30 years if it doesn't die of some trauma. And again, these are these are in the same order.

109
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,120
And so these are closely related creatures, very, very different lifespans. So nature has clearly

110
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,760
gone to town on this and created these marvelous examples of disparate lifespan, but sort of the

111
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,440
same creature, the same biochemistry. So this kind of takes us to this idea of that nature has done

112
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:55,120
this. How has it done this? It's done it with these control knobs. And I'll walk through why

113
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:03,200
we thought they were control knobs and how we turn them. So the first control knob that got discovered

114
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,080
molecularly was the work of Cynthia Kenyon. And this was a paper that blew me away. I was a first

115
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,320
year in graduate school, maybe second year. And Cynthia published a paper that was pretty

116
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,480
heretical at the time. And the paper showed that you could knock down the function of a single gene

117
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,120
in a worm C. elegans. So it's about a millimeter size little worm. And when you knock down the

118
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,720
function of this thing, it doubled the animal's lifespan. And this was a wild result. Because at

119
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,360
the time, aging was thought of as this kind of decay process. But the notion that you could

120
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,520
essentially break the function of something or at least make it function a lot less well,

121
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,200
and double the lifespan of a creature was just a total mind warp for me and other people. Just like,

122
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,600
oh my gosh, you can dent something and it gets better. Now what's happened in the intervening

123
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,800
decades, this has been repeated in flies, it's even repeated in mice, you can knock down the

124
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,080
function of a single gene and calorie restrict an animal. And you can double its lifespan. That's

125
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,800
like you or me living to 160. Okay, because this is a creature with really similar biochemistry to

126
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,840
ourselves. So this just said that you could take single genes, turn them and do radical things to

127
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,760
lifespan. Now in fairness, with Cynthia's work in C elegans, I always felt that it wasn't the best

128
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,280
model to extrapolate from because of the division stopping at the germ cell. And therefore,

129
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,240
if you take DAF2 and DAF16 and project them forward to mammals, I don't think we've seen

130
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,880
the same magnitude of reduction with attenuation of those, have we? No. And maybe it's worth,

131
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,120
rather you explaining it than me, do you want to tell folks what DAF2 and DAF16 do just to bring

132
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,240
them along for the ride? So these were genes that were discovered in Cynthia's screen as

133
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,240
receptors and transcription factors associated with what we now talk about as the IGF-1 receptor

134
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,440
signaling pathway. And if you go in, so this is something that now has been explored in great

135
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,800
detail in mice, for example. And the analogous knockdowns in mice of the receptors don't produce

136
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,960
the same degree of longevity that you can produce in a worm. Now interestingly, a paper published

137
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,400
somewhat recently, this was near Barzilay and actually Pedro Beltran who I work with now,

138
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,000
with an antibody that antagonizes the IGF-1 receptor. Yeah. It extends life, but there's

139
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,960
a sex difference. So it only benefits the females. And it's not something that translates perfectly,

140
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,960
but I think that's not the interesting piece in terms of the whole story of what we're learning

141
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,920
about aging. It was to us and to me, it was, oh my gosh, you can damage the function of a single gene.

142
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,680
The fact that it still works in mammals is remarkable. The fact that it works less,

143
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,640
it's not as cool, it's a little bit of a bummer. But to me, it was really the DAF2, DAF16

144
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,000
observation that opened up the field and said that there were these knobs that you could turn

145
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,040
and you could get these radical impacts on longevity. And the additive value of DAF16 plus

146
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,720
caloric restriction was also very interesting in Cynthia's worms. And I actually thought that that

147
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,640
was perhaps the most extrapolable insight to mammals. But to your point, it was a proof of

148
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:29,360
concept, right? It was, this thing is malleable. Yeah. And to me, at the time, it was just like,

149
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,440
as though the mask tipped a little bit and you could see the face underneath like, oh my gosh,

150
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,240
there's something almost programmatic going along here as opposed to just this idea that you just

151
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,920
decay. And that was exciting. And that paper stuck with me for several decades. It was not something

152
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,360
that I chose to work on. Although I became friends with Cynthia at some point in the early 2000s and

153
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,440
we continue to be friends and talk all the time. But that particular biology is not,

154
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,000
it's more of a marker people use now, as opposed to something that people are actively trying to

155
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,560
perturb. So going back to this question about of knobs, this goes to our, this third principle,

156
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,680
which is that we can turn some of these knobs. The first knob actually that got turned in a

157
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:26,160
super aggressive way goes way back to the 1930s. And it was this guy at Cornell named Clive McKay.

158
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,480
And he had a colony of rodents. And this is shortly after the great depression. And his lab

159
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,400
didn't have a ton of money. And in an effort to keep portions of his colony alive, he fed some

160
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,560
of the animals all the time. And then other animals he fed infrequently. And what happened

161
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,360
was not what he expected. The animals that were restricted with food lived longer. And it was the

162
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,760
first times ever got experimentally demonstrated, albeit by accident. And for me, that was the first

163
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:05,200
time that scientists had sort of set out all for a very funny reason and turned a knob that extended

164
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:12,320
life. And it brought forward this idea that as we live, aging or your biology is making a decision

165
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,440
about the rate at which you are aging. Now flash forward several decades, a molecule is discovered

166
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,640
on Easter Island made by soil bacteria. It's one of your favorite molecules, rapamycin. Now the aging

167
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,440
effects of rapamycin were not figured out until about 2003. And then the awesome work of David

168
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,080
Sabatini eventually linked this caloristriction observation from decades and decades earlier

169
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,480
to rapamycin. And it turns out that rapamycin and caloristriction are both turning the same

170
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,320
control knob. And this is pretty wild because biology typically only invents a few ways to do

171
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,680
things. And what was really neat was the way in which these two totally different approaches

172
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,720
were both touching the same biology. So it's my belief that this biology, so there's this complex

173
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,360
called mTOR, which is this megadalton complex. It's this master decision maker of whether or not

174
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,160
we are choosing to divide and make more biomass because there's enough resources, or are we

175
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,320
choosing to fight another day. And this biology that rapamycin and caloristriction and restriction

176
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:27,600
of various other things like methionine is the single best validated biology across labs, across

177
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,800
species. And one of my co-workers, who's a sort of incredibly brilliant, but cynical guy, always

178
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,080
says, if you want to know what the real biology is, it's the stuff that works in every lab no

179
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,000
matter who's doing it. Okay. Rapamycin and caloristriction definitely have that feature.

180
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,040
It works in all these labs. Did you know that I tried to get a personalized license plate

181
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,360
for rapamycin and they got rejected by the DMV in California because rapamycin is a drug

182
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,160
and you can't have a license plate that's a drug. So then I tried again in vain to get rapalogue

183
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,120
as a license plate. And I got thwarted again because apparently someone at the DMV was smart

184
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,480
enough to Google rapalogue and figure out that it's an analog of rapamycin, which is also a drug.

185
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,360
And I got the same rejection letter from the DMV. I would just assume knowing you would have done

186
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,640
rapaman, which sounds vaguely like a supervillain. Okay. But now we didn't go stop there. I'll tell

187
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,760
you over dinner what I eventually went with. Okay. Gotcha. So anyway, there's this mTOR thing,

188
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,680
which is the best validated control knob. The next knob that got turned is this thing with

189
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,240
young blood. So this is something that's sort of popularized if you watch things like Silicon

190
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,000
Valley, but this goes back a ways. But the first time that the lifespan effects of this were

191
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,200
demonstrated was in the 1970s. And so what you do is you take two animals, one's young and one's

192
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,280
old, and you literally suture them together. And their circulatory systems join. And it's not a

193
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,360
giant mental leap to imagine that crap in old people is bad for you. So the old blood would be

194
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,960
bad for the young. The awesome result was that stuff in the young was good for the old and it

195
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,160
could extend life by as much as 15%. These are with animals that are sutured together, which is

196
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,360
not exactly an optimal way to live. So that tells you that's another knob. There's stuff in young

197
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,360
blood that is able to exert biology and do good things. And I think that's going to be an area

198
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,040
that will be fruitful. The next sort of control knobs we've learned about, so mitochondria age.

199
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,280
So mitochondria are the descendants of ancient bacteria. So they have their own DNA, they have

200
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,320
their own genomes and mitochondria live really hard life. And so their mutation rate of their

201
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,160
own DNA is somewhere between a hundred and a thousand fold faster than our nuclear mutation

202
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,280
rate. So their DNA just gets all chewed up. And as a consequence, by the time you are in your 70s,

203
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,200
you can go into a human being and look in their colonic crypts. And on the order of half of the

204
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,760
cells in their colonic crypts don't have functional mitochondria. They can't utilize oxygen to make

205
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,600
energy or do all the other things that mitochondria do that are important. And so that's something

206
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,960
that we've learned that is clearly a part of this aging story. Another thing that could be a knob,

207
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,720
and this is an area of some intense debate these days, is this thing called the methylation clock.

208
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,760
So this is this ever ticking clock in which these methyl groups, this is a little carbon atom with

209
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:44,400
three hydrogens around it, are attached or detached over time to the various Cs in your GATC

210
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,280
code. And when you're young, there's essentially these five methyl Cs, these methyl groups on your

211
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,360
DNA. It's like a crisp pegboard where everything's lined up perfectly and you've got areas where

212
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:03,520
they are and crisp areas where they are not. And gene expression is not noisy. And as we get old,

213
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,840
it's like someone drops the pegboard and suddenly you've got methylations where you're not supposed

214
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,040
to have them and you're missing them in other places. And it looks as though that might, and

215
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,120
I stress the word might, give rise to sort of noisy gene expression. And the metaphor I often

216
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,920
think of for this is imagine you have a vinyl LP if you're old enough to know what that is,

217
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,720
or hip enough to know what that is, it's going to be hip to your thing now, and you play an LP a lot.

218
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,200
The actual act of playing that LP takes the little knobs and grooves and wears them down so

219
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:43,520
the LP doesn't sound as good. And it's possible that the act of being alive and that aging actually

220
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,320
is modifying these little methyl groups in such a fashion as to cause aging. No one knows if these

221
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,440
changes in this epigenetic clock are the cause of features of aging or the result of features of

222
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,560
aging or even a little bit of both. And that's going to be a super interesting area of biology.

223
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,200
Yeah, I've spoken with David Sinclair quite a bit about this. He uses an analogy that's

224
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,000
similar but has a couple differences, which is the methylation could be thought of as the

225
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,280
scratches one gets in a CD surface. And the question of course being, can you restore the

226
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,560
CD back to its original form if you have that master template? And that's not exactly the same

227
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,480
as the analogy you've used, but it certainly speaks to the music and the disc.

228
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,320
Yeah, it's interesting. So I always think of CDs getting scratched because you're negligent.

229
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,080
Right, as opposed to just putting them in the CD player and using them.

230
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,280
And so there's a nuance. I mean, it's funny, those two metaphors may even, as you know,

231
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,040
may speak to different intuitions between me and David about what's going on here.

232
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,040
But I don't really have an intuition. I'm sort of reporting out what's sort of known and what it's

233
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,920
going to be just very exciting to see when we can actually do experiments that can tease this apart

234
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,800
and ask questions like, if you take these methylation groups away, do you in fact start

235
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,760
making cells that are younger functionally? And that's going to be an awesome experiment.

236
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,560
David did an experiment recently and I think you have to be a little cautious with interpretation.

237
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,360
So twice in our lives, we press a factory reset, you are methylome. So you do it once

238
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,000
at conception. And so a bunch of gene products get made, which erase and reset your methylome

239
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,600
back to day zero because you're now an embryo and the program is beginning again. Now, a few weeks

240
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,200
into your life, it happens a second time, but only in a little bit of your cells.

241
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,280
Yeah. So let's explain that. So when you start at conception, you have one cell.

242
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,480
It goes through about 50 divisions.

243
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
So I don't know exactly. So are you talking about when we do the second reset? First of all,

244
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,000
it's different in humans and mice. And I apologize. I don't know.

245
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,520
But it's some relatively small number.

246
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,400
It's a small number and it happens within, I believe it's weeks in the human. I think it's

247
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,480
a little over a week in a mouse, but anyone out there that works on this, and I have friends I

248
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,360
could call, but not right the second. What happens is there's a second wave of these gene products

249
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,360
that are made and for a second time in your life and the only second time in your life,

250
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,120
you will reset because now you are making germ cells for your children and they are

251
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,840
kept in a special spot in your sex organs until you make babies.

252
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,280
So those are the only two times that this factory reset gets pressed.

253
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,120
And then going back to where I was saying you have to be a little cautious with interpretation.

254
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,560
We now know how to do this artificially. So we can express four factors called the Yamanaka

255
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,320
factors. And these four factors by themselves, if you express them in cells, it's super inefficient,

256
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:57,680
but one in every few thousand cells you can cause to become a reset cell with a prime.

257
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,520
When did Yamanaka do this? This is in our lifetime. I mean, this is quite recent.

258
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,960
Yeah. He got the Nobel prize. I, at last, I don't have the date. I know a lot about

259
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,760
actually how he isolated them. I just don't know the precise dates, but basically he did this.

260
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,240
It was a beautiful experiment with Yamanaka did. He initially identified genes that candidate list

261
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,240
of genes that were turned on in this sort of embryological state. And then he started using,

262
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,440
he was delivering the genes in various combinations. He ultimately wound up paired down to about two

263
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,400
dozen. And then he then would take various pairwise combinations and figured out how few he could do

264
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,920
and still managed to turn on one of these embryonic genes. And he managed to weed it down

265
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,520
to four and he got the Nobel prize for them. And so what's happened in the intervening years is

266
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,320
there's been some efforts to see, could you actually impose features of youth? Because it's

267
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,720
sort of a simple minded leap to say, Oh, if you look embryonic, that's young in fact, and I think

268
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,200
that's the little dangerous leap. Right. Just because you don't have the methyl groups on your

269
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,680
DNA doesn't mean they translate into the phenotype that is youth. That's correct. What I think you do

270
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:16,400
when you do Yamanaka four factor reprogramming is it's a self fate decision. You've entered a very

271
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,120
unique cellular state. Now it just so happens to have things that are in common with youth. And so

272
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,840
I think that when you do a reprogramming event and you were able to exert something that looks like

273
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,840
youthful biology, you may have actually just created new young stem cells that are able to

274
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,240
somehow pick up the music developmentally and participate. That's sort of different than youth.

275
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,400
It's a bit of a sort of cell transplant, sort of thing, although done by the delivery of genes.

276
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,080
So anyway, this whole question about this methyl clock is something that it's an intense area of

277
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,520
interest in the biological community. It's evolving a lot. There's a bunch of labs that

278
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,920
are working on this and it's going to be a very interesting next five years to see where this

279
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:10,640
drops out. We sort of covered a bunch of things. We've talked about. Yeah, you've got mTOR reduction

280
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,080
slash caloric restriction, loss of the circulating youth factors, mitochondrial dysfunction,

281
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,160
methylation clock, which sort of ties into sort of stem cell exhaustion. And then we've got another

282
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,400
big one. What I wanted to do was I've spent the last now just a little over eight years working on

283
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,240
one of these last knobs that we know how to turn, which is cellular senescence. But I wanted to

284
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:43,760
place that particular knob in the context of the others because I don't want to sort of overhype

285
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,360
this idea. But I do want to explain why I've dedicated a large chunk of my life on planet

286
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,240
Earth to this. Because if you look at all of these aging mechanisms and these knobs that I've

287
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,000
described, they all play a role in this. We don't yet know what the sort of underlying primordial

288
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,080
clock that ticks that makes us age. What we do know is that you have a series of these component

289
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,680
mechanisms that work collectively and they create this phenomenon that we call aging. And I want to

290
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,840
talk about cellular senescence now because I work on it because of all of the mechanisms,

291
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:28,240
it strikes me and struck me as the simplest mechanism to perturb and make medicines

292
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,000
that you can use to treat human beings. And I'll get into why that is in a sec, but I'll just tell

293
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,120
you about the knob. So we all begin life as a single cell at conception. And then over the arc

294
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:49,760
of our lives, we, the single cell, will divide as many as 50 times. And on the road to 50 divisions,

295
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,280
the cells that make us up will encounter some form of stress they cannot resolve. They will

296
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,680
pull an emergency brake and they will stop dividing forever. And we call this state,

297
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,120
when you do this, we call cells that do this a senescent cell. And this is something that we've,

298
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,160
we find these cells in all of the tissues we've examined. And these cells, they're a very small

299
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,200
number most of the time. Typically it's on the order of hovering around 1% or less. Now in some

300
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,760
disease states we have looked at that number is dramatically higher. And I'll talk about that a

301
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,120
little bit later. Children don't have these cells. Now they can make them, but they don't accumulate

302
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,840
and we don't know why, but as we age, these cells accumulate. Now, before the work of my

303
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,680
collaborators and my co-founders at the company I work at, no one knew if these

304
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,520
accumulating senescent cells were good for you, bad for you, or neither. And so my two co-founders,

305
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,920
and now almost a decade of collaborators, Judy Campisi at the Buck Institute and Jan

306
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,600
Vandersen at the Mayo Clinic, both of their laboratories genetically engineered mice,

307
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,080
where we could eliminate senescent cells from these animals whenever we want it.

308
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:14,960
And for the first time we got to ask what happens. And what happens is pretty eye popping. So normally

309
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,600
I carry this picture around on my iPhone, so I always show people this is what I work on, but

310
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,840
essentially by a podcast you have to use a little bit of imagination. So imagine two animals,

311
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,200
siblings, born within seconds of each other from the same mom. These are animals that are 24 months

312
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,400
old, so it's kind of equivalent to a 70 year old person. And one of these littermates is blind,

313
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,000
it's osteoporotic, it's frail, it has kidney dysfunction, it has cardiac dysfunction, it looks

314
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
visibly old. It's littermate from whom we eliminated senescent cells from midlife until it

315
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:58,720
dies. This animal lives on average about 30% longer, which is cool. But what's more awesome

316
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:06,320
than that is that when this animal dies and when it's similarly treated animals die, they die with

317
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:14,640
many of the features of aging either absent or reduced. And that is awesome. So we're trying

318
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,880
to do it unity, the company I work at. Now before you say something interesting you said, which is

319
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,480
they have this knockout of senescence that only occurs in midlife. No, what we do is we insert

320
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,160
into every cell of that animal's body, we genetically engineer the animals, so that we can administer a

321
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:36,320
drug weekly which kills senescent cells within that animal. But do you begin that administration

322
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,400
at midlife? And what happens if you begin that administration at birth? We have not done that

323
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,520
experiment in large part because we don't see senescent cells at birth. I see, is there a chance

324
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,600
that those animals would prematurely get cancer if we eradicated their ability to create stem cells

325
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,840
at the beginning of life? Didn't Judith have some data that suggested the importance of senescence

326
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,440
early on as a sort of break against cancer as well? So you bring up a really important

327
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,880
point that I should clarify. So whenever I tell people about this result, people often ask,

328
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,880
this is an important system. Why are you messing with it? So it turns out the ability to make

329
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,240
senescent cells is vitally important to our survival. So if you genetically engineer a mouse

330
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,560
that cannot make senescent cells, this animal is born normally. It's got 10 fingers and 10 toes,

331
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,000
but it statistically winds up full of tumors before it's in reproductive age. So it tells you

332
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,400
that this emergency break, the cellular senescent system, is an anti-cancer system. And you do not

333
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,960
want to mess with the emergency break. You have to leave it alone. And so in the experiment I

334
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,040
described where we eliminate these cells, we don't touch the break. We allow the break to pull

335
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:59,760
completely. And for the cell cycle to stop, we only show up after. Now, I think it's still a

336
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,520
reasonable question. You'd say, dude, it's like this is an anti-cancer system and you're kind

337
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,320
of screwing around with it. Are you sure this is okay? Let's take a step way back. So in medical

338
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,880
school, we spent all this time learning about different cellular insults. And perhaps the most

339
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,840
obvious one, and the one we could use as an example, is DNA damage. So when a cell's DNA is damaged,

340
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,160
presumably its first choice is, can I fix this? But if a cell's fate is such that it can't repair

341
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,720
its DNA, that's sort of when it has this bifurcated pathway of going down the pathway of apoptosis,

342
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,000
which means for the listener that it has a programmed form of cell death. So it basically

343
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,400
kills itself in a programmatic structured way. Or it goes down this pathway that you've described,

344
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,200
which is senescence, effectively saying, I will no longer do anything. I'm still alive,

345
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,640
but I don't grow anymore. I don't replicate. I don't reproduce anymore. My DNA is dysfunctional.

346
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,520
As we'll talk about, I suspect it still does things. It still secretes factors that wreak havoc.

347
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,720
But is that a fair assessment that I've just made of using an example of a cell with DNA

348
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,680
damage? Has that sort of choice? It does. And we don't understand how cells make the choice

349
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,280
between the two. I was going to ask you that. Do we have any sense of what sways that decision?

350
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,520
Well, I'll tell you some anecdotes. So what we do is we in the lab will irradiate cells or treat

351
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,720
them with a DNA damaging agent. These are both things that... Yeah, known things that destroy DNA.

352
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,560
So we have a setting on our irradiator, which does both. So it both causes cells to die.

353
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,880
And then 99% of the cells that remain will enter senescence. So you know that all those cells in

354
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,800
the dish got the same radiation. They're all the same clone of the cell. Yet some of them chose

355
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,000
death and some of them chose senescence. I think it's a really interesting question for us to try

356
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,680
to understand about why did some die and why did some live? Presumably it's driven by some

357
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,960
explicit cell state at the time. Is there a way post hoc to examine the DNA damage of the cells

358
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,480
that died and compared to the DNA damage of the cells that underwent senescence? Because presumably

359
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,080
the actual DNA damage is going to be stochastically distributed across those cells. And even though

360
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,920
they are the same cells receiving the same radiation, they probably undergo different

361
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,400
degrees of DNA damage. And could it be something as simple as if you damage this portion of the DNA,

362
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,720
you lose the ability to undergo apoptosis, but you still retain the ability to undergo

363
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,200
senescence or vice versa? Yeah, I mean, you have to be a little tricky because if you're... So

364
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,800
the challenge with asking cells that died, what happened is that it requires a bit of a cellular

365
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,080
seance. Okay. I have a cellular Ouija board. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah. Since we've been talking

366
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,880
about this, as I've been thinking creatively, there are these... There's moments on the order

367
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,440
of minutes to hours after the insult happens in which the cell is going through its pre-death

368
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,840
throws. And you still don't know which direction it's going to go? This is not something I've ever

369
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,160
seen studied. So this could be something that just outside of my personal experience, but I just

370
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,160
think about what we do every day in which we insult cells in an effort to make cells become

371
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,560
senescent, but a portion of them choose death. There's got to be a dozen postdocs thinking about

372
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,680
this problem, right? Yeah. You'd have to be in a hardcore apoptosis. The thing is, you'd want to be

373
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,280
in a apoptosis lab. I don't know who is actually working on this problem. It's a pretty interesting

374
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,000
problem though. I think the way you'd want to get at it would be, you might want to be looking

375
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,400
quantitatively. For example, if you had some sort of die that could tell you how much DNA damage a

376
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,920
cell got, you had some sort of high content imaging, and you could look down at a plate and say,

377
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,360
oh, these guys that accumulated in the minutes of radiation three times more of the... They

378
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,440
incorporated three times more of the die. These are the guys that chose death. You could do something

379
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,680
like that. And so then you don't need a seance. You just need somebody. It's kind of a, I guess,

380
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,920
it's more of like a cellular death watch. There's ways that you could start to get at that. It's

381
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,080
kind of cool. Sorry to take us off that track, but now let's focus on the guys that didn't

382
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:18,640
undergo apoptosis. So you've got all these cells that have undergone some insult and they've now

383
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,520
committed to sort of a celibate life. They're not going to reproduce anymore. And if they just left

384
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,840
it at that, it wouldn't be such a problem. It's this other thing they do that's problematic,

385
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:34,080
which is they sort of poison the well for cells around them that are otherwise not damaged. Is

386
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,040
that a fair assessment of senescence? That is. So in fact, early on in the history of this field,

387
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,920
which we can get into in a little bit, it was a real theoretical problem. How could something

388
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,320
that's 1% of your cells damage the function of 99% of your cells? Well, as it turns out,

389
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,920
these cells have a very active secreter that my co-founder Judy Campisi discovered in 2008. And

390
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,880
it's, this is the means by which these cells exert bad biology. They secrete into the micro environment

391
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:15,920
around them all this crap that distorts tissue function. And that is how these cells contribute

392
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,280
both to features of natural aging as well as very particular diseases of aging is via the

393
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,200
secreter called the SASP, which stands for senescence associated secretory phenotype. And I know it's a

394
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,760
mouthful, but well, SASP is pretty cool. Yeah. And so it's really a paracrine feature. So in medicine,

395
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,760
we learn about endocrine versus paracrine versus exocrine features. But paracrine is when a gland

396
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:47,200
can actually secrete its hormone. And it goes directly to the tissue that it's operating on

397
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,440
without having to even pass through the circulation and go around like the way, for example,

398
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,520
insulin, when it's secreted by the pancreas becomes systemic, but this paracrine effect is to secrete

399
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,320
it and poison your neighbor right next to you. And I guess your point now explains why if you

400
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,320
don't have the ability to undergo senescence, that would be bad because you take all those cells that

401
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,800
are damaged that for whatever reason, don't choose the apoptotic pathway are now, they should be

402
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,360
celibate, but they're not and they keep reproducing. And that's why you might be born looking normal,

403
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,680
but as you accumulate injury and insult, boom, you're going to develop into tumors. But that's

404
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,920
very different from saying, we're going to let you undergo senescence, but we might potentially

405
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,440
block your ability to cause toxicity after the fact or other means of targeting those cells.

406
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,240
I mean, there's many ways to do this, but yeah. Well, let me just go back to this whole thing,

407
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,720
which is that cancer thing. So we know that if you can't make cells become senescent, you

408
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,560
dramatically increase tumors in mice. And that's a powerful lesson about what not to do,

409
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:00,160
which is don't mess with the underlying biology here. Showing up after, however, is a pretty cool

410
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,280
idea. And the fact that this paper, and I'll come back to how I got involved in all this, but

411
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:14,960
the fact that eliminating these cells can produce a series of youth effects while not increasing

412
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,320
cancer risk was very awesome. And it was actually kind of a theoretical validation of the picture

413
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,240
in our minds about how this was all working. So it might be useful to actually sort of at this

414
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,120
moment, sort of talk a little bit about the history of where this actually all came from.

415
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,280
And then we'll come back to what we're doing with this now and how we're making medicines based on

416
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,040
it. But I think it's always helpful to place what you're doing in historical context. So this whole

417
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:50,960
idea of cellular senescence traces itself back to the early 1960s. There was a very clever guy

418
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,520
named Leonard Hayflick, who I've actually had the pleasure of meeting very randomly on an airplane.

419
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,520
But at the time in the early 1960s, it was widely believed that cells from us, from mammals,

420
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:11,680
could have infinite capacity to divide. And this was made famous by Alexis Carell, who goes back

421
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,480
decades before that. The leaders in the field all believed this. And it turns out this was the

422
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:24,240
result of the fact that the food that was being fed to these cells, which was derived from chickens,

423
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,520
was contaminated with chicken cells. So every time cells were fed food, they were also fed

424
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,560
other cells. And it gave this impression that these cells were dividing forever. And this Leonard

425
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,720
Hayflick showed up and... And for someone listening who's listening to this thinking,

426
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,560
how can years, decades of dogma come from such sloppiness? It is important to understand that

427
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,440
they're basically relying on light microscopes. Today, you wouldn't make that mistake because

428
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,040
you'd be able to look at the DNA of the different cells and realize that, hey, these are chicken

429
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,280
cells, those are mouse cells, et cetera. But it's a beautiful example of both how far biology has

430
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,800
come, but also how the simplest mistakes can lead to catastrophic misinterpretation. I write about

431
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,040
this in my book, this story. And I remember the first time I came across it like you, I was sort

432
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,600
of like... My first thought was, how the hell is that possible? But then upon further reflection,

433
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,840
you're imposing too much of your current worldview on the problem.

434
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,960
Yeah, I think it's important to show a little bit of compassion as you have by pointing out

435
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,440
the limitations of their technology at the time and the context that they were living in. What's

436
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,720
funny is I will report an interesting mistake that turns out we ordered from ATCC what we thought

437
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,560
were mouse cells and they were rat. And as a consequence, they weren't behaving properly.

438
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,120
This is about a year ago. So these types of things are still happening.

439
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,880
So Hayflick turns over this 60 year belief basically.

440
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:00,880
And so he published this paper in 1961 and it's pretty heretical. And he coins this term,

441
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,720
he said, he calls them senescent cells, meaning cells that lose the ability to divide in culture.

442
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,080
And he says something very prophetic. He says, this may contribute to features of aging.

443
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,720
Isn't that sort of like Watson and Crick's DNA?

444
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,280
Yeah, the thing about it does suggest a means for replication.

445
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,440
The most understated.

446
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,480
Yeah, exactly. Which I love these things. Here's the great story is that when I ran into Leonard

447
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:32,000
Hayflick at the Portland airport, having gotten off the plane, I pull out my phone and I show him,

448
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,200
he's very old now, and I show him a picture of the mice with and without senescent cells,

449
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,840
the term he functionally coined. And I said, this is what happened when we delete these cells

450
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,560
that you said may cause aging. And it was just a mind warp for him. He hadn't heard of the paper

451
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,920
at the time. The paper had been out for six years. He was very old. Then his daughter walks up who

452
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,640
lives in Portland. And she thinks you're accosting him or something. No, it was immediately clear

453
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,200
that we were your fans. Exactly. We were fanboys. And I show her the picture and I said, this is

454
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,560
where your dad's work went. She was like, oh my God. And then she turns to her dad and said,

455
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,280
dad, you realize what this is, right? And so there was this moment. It was one of these great

456
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,440
moments where you get to see this person who really architected this major insight in biology,

457
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,760
confronted with the historical result right to his face and watching him trying to process it all.

458
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,000
It was pretty neat. Anyway, so that's the kind of the backstory of where this all came from.

459
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,280
Now flash forward decades. Now, Judy Campisi was the first individual to find a marker that we

460
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,160
could look at in vivo. This was about 1995. So you could actually figure out because senescence

461
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,840
was something that you did in plates, like plastic plates in an incubator. But it was

462
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,480
Judy who figured out the first biomarker where you go into a living creature into a tissue and say,

463
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,600
aha, there are senescent cells. It was the first time we got to know how many there are, right?

464
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,720
It's not a lot. And her work really asked, it raised this larger question, which I mentioned

465
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:22,640
earlier, which is how can so few cells do so much bad for so many cells? And it wasn't until 2008

466
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,600
when Judy described for the first time this thing that I mentioned earlier called the SASP, the so

467
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,720
called senescence associated secretory phenotype that are how these cells exert bad stuff. And it's

468
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,520
over a hundred factors that have been characterized that these cells make now that drive their negative

469
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,760
biology. Now, it turns out that a lot of what we know about the SASP was all figured out in cell

470
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,760
culture and plastic. And what we've been working on the last eight years is doing a lot of this

471
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,560
more in vivo. And it turns out the SASP is very different in different tissues. It turns out to

472
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,640
be very different from different cells within those tissues and different disease states.

473
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,160
Give folks some of the, I mean, I know there are so many of the SASPs, but what's a handful of

474
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,120
things that they have in their playbook? How do they sort of wreak this havoc on their peers?

475
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,800
So if you look at the sort of the totality of the SASP, everything that's been labeled a SASP

476
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,160
factor, what you will see are kind of usual suspects of badness. Okay. So things like TNF alpha,

477
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,720
which is the target of the most successful drug in the world today, you know, Humira,

478
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:36,160
it's an anti TNF drug. You see a factor like veg F alpha, the target of things like Lucentis

479
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,360
and ILEA multi multi billion dollar drugs for the treatment of diseases of the eye and also

480
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,960
using cancer, but that's a sort of a separate thing. So those are both SASP factors that are

481
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,280
the targets of existing massive drugs. There's also some SASP factors that have been clinically

482
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,160
validated. So there's one called CTGF, which if you make an antibody against that, you have

483
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,440
efficacy in a rare lung disease. That's pro-fibrotic that we now know is driven by senescence.

484
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,160
And that's not a marketed drug yet, but it makes the same point, which is antibody.

485
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,000
But we're taking a step back from this. I mean, let's put some broader strokes on this.

486
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,680
Inflammation would result from SASP, right? So there's lots of things that go out there that

487
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,120
basically tell immune cells, Hey, let's recruit you to this area. You mentioned fibrosis. What

488
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,640
other types of broad destructive categories of things go on out there? And I'm fascinated by

489
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:36,480
this work because it's just a little counterintuitive. I totally get the, and again, this is

490
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,280
just my need to teleologicalize everything if that's even a word, but it totally makes sense

491
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,200
why senescence exists. It's a little harder for me to accept the breadth of its destructive capacity

492
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,720
to its peers. My general thinking about teleological discussions. I know you and I could debate this

493
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,040
all night long, which is get over it. Yeah. Because these things are not testable,

494
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,120
any teleological explanation should be evaluated solely on its entertainment value. Okay. Right.

495
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,120
But that's not why we're here. I will say that there's an idea that is also teleological, but

496
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:15,920
which I use and is a framework that I think is helpful. So many things that we see in aging

497
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,640
biology in particular, they're kind of head scratchers. Like, why is the system doing this?

498
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,680
This seems bad for the individual. Didn't evolution get a vote? Isn't that the whole

499
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:33,040
point of evolution? Well, it turns out that features of aging are manifest post reproductively.

500
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,480
Oh yeah. No, no. I don't think there's going to be an evolutionary explanation for this for

501
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,920
exactly that reason. So is your argument that this occurred, call it stochastically,

502
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,520
and evolution was never there to fix it or catch it. So it's just a random muck?

503
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,440
No, it's actually something it's a cooler idea. So it turns out these decisions, if you want to

504
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,160
call them that these seemingly irrational decisions made by evolution, of course, evolution doesn't

505
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,480
make decisions. It's a votes with the survival of a species to reproduce or an organism to reproduce.

506
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,880
Many of these so-called decisions are things which benefit the young.

507
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,400
Yeah. So it's basically, let's get the post reproductive folks out of the way to

508
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,760
conserve resources for the young. I don't think anything so active or sort of sinister. I think

509
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,320
mostly it's, let's take cellular senescence, for example, it's an awesome mechanism to block tumor

510
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:34,800
formation in young, reproductively competent organisms. So if you can make more of those

511
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,360
organisms to make more babies, I guess I'm not arguing the senescence, it's the SASP that I'm

512
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:44,160
struggling with. Right. Well, so it turns out this is interesting. So it turns out the SASP does some

513
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,360
other things that are useful. So a paper published by Judy Campisi again, and Marco DiMaria,

514
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,240
who is a professor in the Netherlands now, they got interested in wound healing. And what they

515
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,240
demonstrated was that if you make a wound in an animal, a week or two after you make a laceration

516
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:10,560
wound at the wound site, you will see an accumulation of senescent cells. And they are dumping SAS

517
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:18,480
factors into the wound. And the question Judy and Marco asked was, is this important? And so in this

518
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,760
experiment, they went in and they eliminated senescent cells in the course of wound healing. And

519
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,240
what they saw was that the wound closed less well, and more slowly. And it suggested that the SASP

520
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,600
had another role wasn't just well, the SASP, this is a role for the SASP here. Its role was to

521
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:41,440
facilitate wound closure, which if you think about it for most organisms in a naturally evolving

522
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,240
ecosystem is super fricking important. And so essentially senescence got co-opted into

523
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,440
suppressing tumors in one case, and in a very different case was co-opted into helping heal

524
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:00,960
wound. And so I think that what you see in these diseases of aging is often the sort of

525
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,280
unintended consequences of a system that was absolutely awesome for the young at the expense

526
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,960
of the old. One metaphor for this that I sort of like is that, let's say you innocently write a

527
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,440
computer program to fill your bathtub. It also unintentionally becomes a computer program designed

528
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,600
to overflow your apartment. It wasn't why you wrote it, but it is the net effect.

529
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,720
Yeah, no, that's an interesting point. Certainly, things that favor wound healing could be quite

530
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:34,400
beneficial. Some have even argued that LpA, lipoprotein, apolipoproteinA, which is attached

531
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,720
to an LDL, so it makes this thing called LpA, has very potent prothrombotic properties. And even

532
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:47,520
though it's wildly atherosclerotic, you could argue, well, frankly, that's a very favorable

533
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,920
phenotype to carry for most of our evolution. It's only recently that we need to concern

534
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,040
ourselves with atherosclerosis, but there was certainly an era where having a prothrombotic

535
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:04,080
factor to help you in periods of trauma would far outweigh the tail effect of knocking off a few

536
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:09,360
elders who managed to survive and die of aortic stenosis or atherosclerosis. So that's an

537
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,760
interesting tidbit with respect to the wound stuff. I wasn't aware of that.

538
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,360
By the way, the other example of this LpA is a perfect comparator to the whether or not either

539
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:23,360
of these teleological explanations matters not. The point is that those are the same logic.

540
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,840
So let's go back to something you said at the outset, which you've now given us enough to put

541
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:34,080
in context. You said, look, you went on this journey of thinking through final common pathways

542
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:40,720
of aging. You arrived at this mTOR-CR thing probably matters a whole heck of a lot. In fact,

543
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,360
it seems to be the only one that works across organisms, across labs, no ifs, ands, or buts.

544
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:51,200
You've got this loss of circulating youth factors. Clearly, something is happening to mitochondria

545
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,200
as we age that is very problematic. We clearly see this observation of methylation, whether it's

546
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,720
causal or not, is unclear. We get a sense of what's happening to stem cells, exhausting, and

547
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:10,240
senescent cells. Your view, which you very briefly touched on, is the first four things I mentioned

548
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:18,640
are probably harder to drug than the last one. Is that a fair summation of how you arrived at this?

549
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,920
Yeah, that's how I wound up focusing the last eight years of what myself and my colleagues have

550
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,320
been working on was that. It was how do we make medicines that target a fundamental mechanism of

551
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:38,480
aging? I was not clever enough or knowledgeable enough, or both, to figure out how to do mTOR

552
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,000
and CR. I mean, there are a lot of people who are trying that by trying to get more and more

553
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,400
selective molecules, but it was not an area where I had anything creative to add. But the

554
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,080
backstory of how I kind of got involved in this was I was sitting around actually in the Calgary

555
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:59,520
Airport. A lot of these important things are happening in airports, okay, for some reason.

556
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,120
And I was eating french fries. And in this 20-minute interval of french fry consumption,

557
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,200
five different people sent me the same PDF, and they were subject lines like,

558
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,360
holy shit, you have to read this. This has to be your next company. And I opened up the paper,

559
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:21,760
and right on the front page was a figure showing these two animals, siblings, one of which had

560
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,240
senescence cells, the other one. These are the mice you talked about earlier. Yes. This was

561
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,400
Jan or this was Judy. Were they collaborating at the time? They were collaborating, though. Judy

562
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,160
was not on this particular paper. And this paper was not exactly the same mice I described. So it

563
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,840
had a very similar or the same means of senescence cell elimination, but there was a difference.

564
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:50,400
This is 2011. These animals also contained a mutation where they made less, far less,

565
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,920
of a protein called BubR1, which is an anaphase checkpoint protein. So this is a protein that

566
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,320
makes sure that your chromosomes line up on the spindle and it sort of is like a bit of a school

567
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,880
master. It sort of says, you're not dividing until everything's lined up. And so if you don't have

568
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,720
BubR1, you just blow right through the checkpoint and you become polyploid. And Jan van der Senn,

569
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,640
my other co-founder and long-term collaborator, he created this animal thinking this animal was going

570
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,040
to get tons of cancer because he was a cancer researcher. So let's just make sure we understand

571
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:26,800
why that's the case. If BubR1 is there to make sure your spindles line up, it means that you

572
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,120
should not be able to divide until all your chromatin is perfectly aligned. Everything is

573
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,240
in perfect tip top order and you're ready to undergo mitosis. That's right. So if you take away

574
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:43,120
your master, a lot of faulty division should follow. That's correct. So Jan's hypothesis is

575
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,880
we either attenuate or knock out BubR1, we should get a lot of cancer. That's right. Okay. What

576
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,240
happened? That wasn't what happened. The animals were super polyploid, meaning that they wound up

577
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,400
with super weird numbers of chromosomes, too many, too few, all that good stuff. The animals aged

578
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,880
quickly. So the animals wound up full of senescent cells. Okay. So there was something about having

579
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:15,680
very wrong numbers of chromosomes and all of the effects of that that caused the animals to be full

580
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:22,000
of senescent cells and to age very rapidly, have features of aging that were on set very rapidly

581
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and die. So it accelerated the speed with which the record played, but it didn't change the music.

582
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,480
In other words, they didn't die sooner because they got cancer. They just died sooner because

583
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:38,400
they sped up their aging. We don't know the answer to that. So these animals are extremely sick

584
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,560
animals. So trying to make a larger statement, I think it's too much to say with an animal like that

585
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:53,040
of the whole record metaphor. What I can say with, I think conviction is that clearly a whole bunch

586
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,480
of things that go along with being old happened very quickly in these animals. And these animals

587
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:04,880
die very quickly. They look visibly old. For me, it was an experiment that suggested that

588
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,960
it was consistent with the notion that the senescent cells were actually driving these

589
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,000
features of aging. And what's so cool about this paper and why it caught so many people's attention,

590
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,160
even though there was a somewhat earlier paper that Jan Alsud did that for many allowed one to

591
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,080
draw the same inference, but it just didn't smell like a drug. I won't get into that paper today,

592
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:31,920
but what was so compelling was that you added senescent cells through this mutation that gave

593
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,400
rise to the production of less bub R1 protein. And then you eliminated those cells or a subset of

594
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:45,440
those cells with this insert into the DNA of every cell of that animal. And you could ameliorate

595
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,720
a subset of the effects of senescent cells. Now you didn't get rid of all the senescent cells.

596
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,720
By the way, interestingly, the animals don't live longer in that particular mutant because it's so

597
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,600
sick when you eliminate the cells, but a whole bunch of the features of aging, for example,

598
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:06,640
their bent spines, their organ atrophy, their cataracts in their eyes. These were all severely

599
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:17,440
blunted when the senescent cells were eliminated. And when I saw this paper, I thought this feels

600
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:27,440
like a drug. You just eliminate cells that are driving bad things. And so I contacted Jan and

601
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,200
Mayo Clinic and 72 hours later we had agreed to meet and a little time after that I set up the

602
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:42,880
company. But this was a observation in a mutant animal. And I remember the sort of early blogosphere

603
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,760
talking about how this paper didn't mean anything. And this was exaggerating the role of senescence

604
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:58,560
in humans and it's a mouse and all this stuff. But to me it really felt important. Now it was a

605
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:06,560
long way between that paper and when you could ever credibly claim there could be a drug discovery

606
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:14,240
program based on it. And we spent the next four years in stealth mode asking for biological

607
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:22,400
questions. And I had some very patient investors who gave us sort of a spoon fed or dropper fed

608
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,200
money into the company. We did not have lots of excess resources, but I will confess that some of

609
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,720
the best times in my life have been under resource constraint because your decision making is very

610
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,520
high quality because every single resource decision matters. So we had four questions we

611
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,760
were trying to ask an answer. And the first question and none of this stuff got answered in

612
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:49,200
the first 2011 paper was do senescent cells contribute to natural aging as opposed to some

613
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:57,120
genetically contrived mouse. Second question, could we find a disease, any human disease that we could

614
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:03,280
model in an animal where we could eliminate senescent cells and take that disease and either

615
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:12,400
stop it or even better send it backwards. Third question, could we find a molecule that could

616
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:20,800
trigger the elimination of senescent cells from a living creature safely? And last question,

617
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,760
which is, was getting rid of these cells safe? We know that kids don't have them, but that doesn't

618
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,000
mean that getting rid of them from an adult, like what if adults need them for some reason when kids

619
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,320
don't. So that was a formal question that really was on our minds. Now today I look at question four

620
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,360
and realize that it's not an equivalence between children and adults because of the following

621
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:50,560
reason. We know that if you prevent kids from being able to make them horrible things happen,

622
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,200
we don't know that if kids make them and you nuke them, horrible things happen, which is what

623
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,840
you're trying to do with adults, correct? We don't know that. Those could be two different things.

624
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:04,960
Yeah. So kids naturally nuke them. So we know kids can make them because you can do experiments

625
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,880
in young animals and they make senescent cells and then senescent cells are gone. So in effect,

626
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,080
that is your living breathing experiment right there. That's right. The superpower of kids is

627
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,200
the ability to make them, which prevents the replication of a cell that shouldn't replicate.

628
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,400
And then it has the good sense to get rid of it before it harms anyone. The adult retains the

629
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,840
ability to make it, but keeps it around. I want to go back to your second question. It seems obvious

630
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,640
now. Your second question, just for the listener, if I recall was, could we find the right disease

631
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,920
in which to study this? Could we find any disease? Because if you think about it, that first mouse,

632
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:46,720
oh, the first and second mouse experiments that John did both 2008 and then 2011 publications in

633
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,800
nature, those weren't diseases the way. Right. They were sort of poly death conditions. Well,

634
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,200
they were sort of like this animal has these features of being old. They weren't things that

635
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,640
the FDA would label a disease like a bent spine, like who's going to develop a drug for that?

636
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:08,640
But your intuition was, of course, you can't study lifespan here. It has to be health span related

637
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:16,000
because if you have an interest in taking this to humans, mortality is a very difficult endpoint.

638
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,360
Yeah. That's not the way we develop drugs. I mean, unless you're tackling conditions that

639
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,040
kill people quickly, mortality is a reasonable endpoint for cancer and heart disease drugs.

640
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,560
Sure. So in fact, I would even make us even ruthlessly more practical. We wanted to find

641
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,920
very diseases of being old diseases, things that the FDA has regulatory paths for and

642
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:41,200
endpoints that you can get drugs approved on. And so we wanted to do that. And that's what we did.

643
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,440
So tell me about number one. Number one, again, we take that for granted today,

644
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,800
but it was a very reasonable question eight years ago, right?

645
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,400
Yeah. So again, Jan van der Zent to the rescue here.

646
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,760
So Ned, at this point, it's just you and Jan and Judy.

647
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:05,360
So it was myself, Jan van der Zent, Judy Campisi, and a guy named Da Hong Jo, who helped us discover

648
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,440
one of the early synthetic molecules. Also, Darren Baker, who's a professor at tomato clinic,

649
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:19,520
was also instrumental. He was first author on the 2011 paper. And he also was the first author on

650
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:25,360
the paper I'm about to describe as it relates to question one, which is how did we figure out that

651
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:32,640
senescence was driving features of natural aging? And so that was what Darren Baker and Jan van

652
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:39,600
der Zent spent the next few years after 2011 doing. And that paper took five years before

653
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:47,920
published in 2016. And what they did in this paper was they took natural mice, mostly natural,

654
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,400
they contain one difference was we mated into natural mice, that same construct, that piece of

655
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,960
DNA that was wound up in every cell of their body. So we could eliminate senescence cells whenever we

656
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:05,360
want it. And so now we got to do that in a very slow multi year experiment. But these were naturally

657
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:13,520
aging creatures. And that paper took as a half decade to happen. And when we got that result,

658
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,800
which was in 2016, we managed to also ask the other three questions by then. But that was really the

659
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,880
trigger for us de-stealthing the effort and speaking openly about what we were doing. Because

660
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,760
if it didn't contribute to natural aging, and it didn't cause a particular disease of aging,

661
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,720
and we couldn't find molecules, there was no company. So you basically were processing question

662
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,720
one, and 234 in parallel. That's correct. We had a small team was a relatively virtual for a few

663
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:47,040
years, we were just living at arch the venture fund. And then we moved and we got too big,

664
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:52,080
we moved up to the Buck Institute. So we were camped out right over Judy's lab, or a floor up

665
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:59,200
and a few doors over. No pun intended. Yeah. And we essentially went to town with a small group,

666
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:06,160
it was just a few people supported very intimately by Jan's group, with Darren's support and with

667
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,240
Judy's group. And so we had this sort of virtual research group where every week we'd get together

668
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,040
and review all the data for each of the four questions. And we had work streams for each of

669
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:20,000
questions one through four. And it was a great time. So I want to kind of pause on this journey

670
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,280
and take a parallel or orthogonal journey for a moment, because I suspect that at least one

671
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:31,120
person listening and likely more also have some sort of entrepreneurial bent in them. And as it

672
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:37,200
pertains to biology or biotechnology, I think I'd love to figure out a way to extract from you

673
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,600
some of the lessons that you've learned along the way. You've done this over and over and over again

674
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:47,360
in many companies. And I'm just sort of wondering what, well, let's start with a broad question.

675
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,080
You've already alluded to the fact that you enjoyed that period of time, right? It was really

676
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,400
less of a company and more of a lab at that point. It was sort of a virtual postdoc that you guys were

677
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,960
doing. Yeah. It was a coalition of the willing doing an incredibly hard project. And it was far

678
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,160
more likely that we were going to fail than succeed. Well, that's actually the question

679
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:11,840
I wanted to pose to you. So we don't talk enough about sort of what the graveyard looks like of

680
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:18,960
these ideas gone wrong. It's quite possible that 2011 to 2016, you spent all of that time working

681
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,000
on something and it didn't work. In fact, that would be the expected outcome of this type of

682
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,240
endeavor. But that said, no one goes into something with a belief that it's going to fail. Without

683
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:35,360
getting too much into the rose colored glasses that inevitably bias our ability to look back,

684
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:43,040
what proof points did you look to to say there's a biological plausibility here that if it wasn't

685
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,760
there would have had you less likely to consider it. And if you can, Ned, try to answer it in a broad

686
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,160
enough way that it would be applicable to other endeavors that maybe don't deal with senescent

687
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,880
cells. In other words, I'm asking this through the lens of somebody who's considering finishing their

688
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,360
lab or finishing their time in their lab or even graduating from undergrad and wanting to join a

689
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:06,800
company, how can they think through handicapping the odds of success, which you've done a number

690
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:14,720
of times. So the approach I take to a bold idea like this idea of making drugs that eliminates

691
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:21,600
senescent cells is I try to picture, it's a simple, beautiful idea. I try to picture the end state.

692
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:28,800
Like what does this look like at the end? And then I say, okay, I can see this in my mind. And then

693
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:36,560
I say, well, what are the existential risks to that beautiful, simple dream? And I try to write

694
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:45,440
them down in the most primitive way I can. And so those four questions, they were the four risks,

695
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,440
which is that senescent cells don't contribute to natural aging. I'll use this particular example,

696
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,360
and I'll back out in a sec. That was a risk. They don't contribute to natural aging. They don't

697
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:58,640
cause a particular disease of aging. You can never find a molecule to eliminate or eliminating the

698
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,960
ones that are not safe. And those were the four risks we came up with. And you can apply this

699
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:12,080
risk to a beautiful, simple idea in any technological endeavor that I've been involved in.

700
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:18,960
What's nice about that is one of those is a very clear market risk. Three of those are biologic or

701
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,840
technology risks. Your second question is actually a market risk question. In other words, if number

702
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:29,760
one worked, so if number one is this absolutely explains natural aging, if number three was true,

703
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,080
you could come up with a molecule that could block it. And number four was true, you could do so

704
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:39,920
safely, but there was no way there was a regulatory pathway that was going to allow you to go from A

705
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:46,160
to B because hook spine disease was never going to show up on the FDA's list of druggable things

706
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:51,600
to think about. It's not to say that it couldn't work, but now you've taken on an enormous regulatory

707
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:59,040
risk that would be almost crushing to any one company. So what I'm hearing you say is embedded

708
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,480
in your questions was actually a very thoughtful risk analysis that reverse engineered success.

709
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:11,840
I think so. It turned out to be a good way for us to focus ourselves. How long did it take you guys

710
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:16,000
to come up with those four questions? Because it was just five of you if I did my math right.

711
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,440
There was a few orbiting. So my long-term business partner, Keith Leonard, he was at the time

712
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,200
we'd founded a previous company together and he was still being the CEO of that company where I'd

713
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,840
previously been the chief science officer, but he was involved in this and a few other just very

714
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:38,880
smart people that I will pull into these things. I need very simple thinkers for this sort of thing

715
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:46,720
because you must in a very disciplined way distill out to these primitive risks that can animate

716
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:53,200
behavior over many years. They have to be durable. If you can summon the discipline and

717
01:09:53,200 --> 01:10:00,400
the simplicity to distill the next say four to five years of your life down to call it two to

718
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,840
four risks, because any more than that and your life gets too complicated. And then you can build

719
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:12,880
work plans that systematically remove each of those risks or do not remove them. But at least

720
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,000
identify them. Yeah, identify them and then build plans. Everything we did at the company

721
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,560
for four years, everything was those four risks. That was it. And the money we raised was pretty

722
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:31,120
paltry at the time. It was all budgeted around those four risks. And whenever I go after a new

723
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:38,720
thing, I always try to just go back to that simple, beautiful idea and then say, can I write down the

724
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,000
risks to this beautiful idea? Then you build plans from them and then you build budgets and then you

725
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,160
politely ask people for money, which by the way, almost no one would provide because this idea

726
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:56,320
seems relatively preposterous at the time. The people that stepped forward were people like Bob

727
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:04,640
Nelson from Arch, who has been a visionary across decades of biotech. And it was he who when I

728
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:10,480
explained this to him very rapidly said, yeah, let's do this. There are some other people at

729
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:16,320
Arch like Christina Burrow who was very supportive early on. So that really was the prime anchor

730
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,960
early on in the life of the company and animated all of our behavior. And that was four years of

731
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,240
my life. How long did it take you guys to define those questions now? Because the way you rattled

732
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,760
them off, they're so logical, they're so obvious. But my guess is those were not immediately

733
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,640
apparent to you in 2011, that those were the four things that had to be wrestled to the ground.

734
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,240
No, we kind of did know them. Really? Yeah. So it's funny, I recently went through the early,

735
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:47,920
I was looking through some old files and I found an old PowerPoint where there was six risks.

736
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,200
And it was clear that we'd done some kind of pruning down to the most primitive because I'm

737
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,160
kind of a tyrant when it comes down to like, we must have the simplest plan sort of thing.

738
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:04,000
So there had been some pruning, but I know that we initially generated the list of a half dozen or

739
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,080
so. And then over a period of weeks, I think we managed to just in a disciplined way,

740
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:16,560
shear them down to this relatively streamlined plan. Now, did you learn this the hard way? Was

741
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:22,960
there a time when you went down the path of trying to do something, lacked this discipline,

742
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,640
and found yourself sort of looking back sometime later thinking we wasted time,

743
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,480
we wasted money. We didn't pursue this as linearly as we could have.

744
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:37,360
Absolutely. No one really taught me this. This is something I sort of learned a bit on the fly,

745
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:45,120
kind of in the eras in which I was building companies like Okeijin and Kaitheira. So those

746
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:51,760
were all early 2000s. So Okeijin was 2003, Kaitheira was around 2005. My first company,

747
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:57,120
which I founded my last year of graduate school, we were strategy free. This was a high throughput

748
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:02,160
structural biology company called Sieriks. And we never had any of these intellectual tools.

749
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,240
And so these were tools that were really developed through feeling as though we wasted time,

750
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:14,080
which is your most valuable resource. And you wasted people's money, which was also valuable

751
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:20,240
resource. And the net effect of this has been now this disciplined streamlining of idea and risk.

752
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,320
Yeah, so it's something that just picked up over time. And now it's reflexive. And

753
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:30,080
everybody in my group, everyone thinks this way. And so whenever a new thing comes up, immediately

754
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,560
everyone goes to the board and starts writing out risks, and then starts writing out, well,

755
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,640
this is the de-risking plan for this, this, and this. And okay, that means it's 18 months,

756
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,120
and this is kind of the budget. Do you think that that type of thinking is productive or

757
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:49,280
counterproductive in academia? It's clearly productive in industry. If you tomorrow decided,

758
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,760
I want to go back and start a lab and go back to Berkeley and apply for a grant. Would you

759
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,000
encourage your graduate students and postdocs to think that way? Or would you modify the thinking

760
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,440
slightly? I would be modified. But I think there is kind of value to this. I think in any setting

761
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:10,880
where you have a problem or a technological thing you're trying to solve, which is being explicit

762
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:17,120
about the failure modes, even if you're in an academic setting. And I'm speaking specifically

763
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,360
of biology or something akin to it. Like I can't talk to you about math or something,

764
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:28,880
because I think it drives a certain degree of honesty when things are failing. So you know what

765
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,000
to see. And so if you're looking out for this isn't working, this isn't working, and only this

766
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,800
is working, and all three have to work for this project to go, you can make a go no go decision

767
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,320
in an academic setting and pivot to another project because there's no end of creative

768
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,880
ideas that you could be working on. They're limitless. And so the important thing is to

769
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,800
conserve your most valuable resource, which is your time. And so I encourage my academic friends,

770
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:02,960
some of whom listen and some of whom do not, to think similarly and to take a sort of portfolio

771
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:09,280
approach to academic projects, which is it's okay to prosecute this question for 18 months, but

772
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,040
there are certain things we want to have in 18 months. And if you do not have them,

773
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,480
we make a formal go no go decision. Meanwhile, you had two other projects going. And so what

774
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,680
you need is only one to raise its hand and say, I'm working.

775
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,720
Yeah, that was super helpful. Let's go back to kind of, you now have the answer to these four

776
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:32,080
questions. Is it safe to say there are still a number of ways to do this? In other words,

777
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:37,840
if you know that senescence is a natural part of aging, if you know that there are specific

778
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,920
diseases for which it plays a role, if you know that there are molecules that can be developed

779
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:49,120
that can target it, and you know that it can be done safely, that third question really has many

780
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:57,200
heads. You can have molecules that kill senescent cells, you could have molecules that target the

781
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:02,960
factors they secrete, presumably there are other ways you could machinate around this. Had you

782
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,760
fixated early on, you alluded to it that killing cells is something we really know how to do pretty

783
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,600
well in biology. Was that the path you guys run from the beginning? Or was that a pivot?

784
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,320
Early on, we honored the possibility that we could either eliminate the cells, because that's what

785
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:23,520
was achieved genetically, and was our proof of concept. But we could also come up with ways to

786
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:30,080
reduce the pathological sass that these cells were creating. It wasn't so much as a pivot,

787
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,800
but a decision to go one way rather than the other. Because in the beginning, we thought you

788
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:41,360
could do either. And the decision was driven by a simple idea, which is that were you to make

789
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:48,960
molecules that would simply suppress the secretions of the cells, but not remove the source of all of

790
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,680
these factors, you'd have a drug you had to take all the time. And the cool thing about eliminating

791
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,000
senescence- And it also assumes you know all the factors. Your approach strikes me as the more

792
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,320
logical approach, but there are companies doing the other approach, correct? Yeah, well, you could

793
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:06,720
take the position that any antibody therapeutic against one of these pro-inflammatories in the

794
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,120
SASP is just such an approach. But actually, I was saying something a little bit more-

795
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,080
I understand your point though.

796
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:18,240
Primordial. I was suggesting, if you understood, for example, the regulatory mechanism that makes

797
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:24,960
the cell decide to secrete all of these factors, and you targeted that, then hey, what you've done

798
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:30,160
is you've shut down the secretion, the cells sit in there not dividing, how bad can it be?

799
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,920
But what motivated us was this would be a drug you would have to take all the time. And what we

800
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,960
thought was so neat about the idea of making a molecule that could eliminate senescent cells,

801
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:48,480
which we then named, we called them senolytic molecules, if you could make a senolytic molecule,

802
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:55,920
you could dose it once. And once you eliminate senescent cells, the cells are not there anymore.

803
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:02,160
So these are not drugs you take every day, every week, or every month, these might be dosed once a

804
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:07,840
year until your body makes more senescent cells. And in fact, which maybe we can talk about later,

805
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,880
in our human clinical data, what we show is that when we eliminate senescent cells

806
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:20,320
from the painful knee joint of a human being with osteoarthritis, a single administration

807
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:26,080
of a senolytic medicine, eliminates pain dramatically in these humans for as long as

808
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,160
we've looked. And so the cells, we don't know if the cells have come back, but we don't think

809
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,800
they've come back by that time. This sort of validates the notion that you can now have a

810
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,320
drug that's far safer because what kills most drugs actually is the fact that they're unsafe.

811
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,880
That generally is a result of treatment again and again and again. If you don't have to do that,

812
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:49,840
if you can go in once, surgically eliminate the cells, I mean, surgically, metaphorically here,

813
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,720
it's not surgical. You can make a safer drug, at least theoretically. And that's why we went

814
01:18:54,720 --> 01:19:03,200
that direction. So there's another big challenge here, which is how do you identify which cells

815
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,800
are the senescent cells in vivo when you don't have the luxury you've had in the animal lab,

816
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,760
which is you get to label those cells, you get to put big targets on them. What was the proof of

817
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:22,080
concept that you could go into an organism and without the luxury of having the senescent cells

818
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,880
raise their hand and say, here we are metaphorically, actually send out snipers to get them.

819
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:34,880
Deep profiling of human tissues for senescence exists, but it's few and far between. And so

820
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,800
we undertook a study and this is after we demonstrated in animals that osteoarthritis,

821
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:47,280
which is the second most prevalent disease of aging and the primary reason it hurts to be old.

822
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:52,480
What's the first, by the way? Type 2 diabetes. Interesting. So what we did is we knew from

823
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,880
animals that if we could induce surgical trauma to an animal's knee, a mouse, and we eliminated

824
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:03,120
senescent cells, that we could eliminate pain and actually repair cartilage in a mouse.

825
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:07,360
Wait a second. That's counterintuitive. I know. That's what's so cool. Well,

826
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,160
it's counterintuitive because of the experiment you shared with me earlier that Judith's group did.

827
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:16,160
I think it was Judith's group that did this looking at wound healing. You would think if senescent

828
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:23,200
cells were necessary for wound healing, they would be necessary for the non-pathologic healing of

829
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:29,040
cartilage following surgical trauma. And they may be. So our theory about what's going on in

830
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,240
osteoarthritis, and this is just one of the ideas we entertain here. And I can explain what data we

831
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:39,760
have that supports this notion is that senescent cells accumulate at sites of osteoarthritis.

832
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:47,920
In fact, they may be trying to heal. Got it. But unlike in the skin, they literally fall off

833
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:53,520
in the context of healing, the cells remain and essentially continue to sound the alarm

834
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,640
over and over and over again. And we think it could be giving a sort of flawed attempt at wound

835
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,840
healing that could be driving the pathophysiology of disease. And the margin for error, sorry to

836
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,120
interrupt, is much smaller in a joint. In other words, you don't have to heal a wound perfectly

837
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:14,720
to achieve a functional outcome that is perfect. You might not have a cosmetically perfect outcome,

838
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,720
but functionally, you could have a hypertrophic scar, you could have a keloid, you could have

839
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:24,240
this, you could have that, but you've closed the barrier to the outside world. But inside of a

840
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:30,720
joint, it's a very delicate balance of one cell layer too many. And all of a sudden you have a

841
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,720
different outcome than you had prior to the insult. Coupled with everything you said,

842
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,440
I mean, that's all of these things factor together, I suppose.

843
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:45,280
So what we were able to show in animals was that when we induced trauma by cutting the ACL,

844
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:50,080
which is known to be risk factor for human osteoarthritis of the knee, we got something

845
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,840
that looked like osteoarthritis and we eliminated senescent cells either genetically

846
01:21:54,720 --> 01:22:00,480
or with our drug, which we've now taken into human beings, we could, in this trauma induced

847
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,280
setting. And sorry, that genetic mouse, just to be sure, that's a mouse that has a genetic

848
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:10,080
tag for senescent cells that's easy to turn off. That's correct. Okay. One aside question,

849
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,720
is there a mouse model of osteoarthritis that comes from overweight or obesity?

850
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:20,560
No. Is that the most common cause of osteoarthritis in humans? It's a comorbidity. I'm not aware that

851
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,920
anyone's established causality, but it would make some sense that it could be causal because of

852
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,960
weight-bearing this. Interesting. So the animal model for osteoarthritis is an ACL injury, which

853
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,360
is still true in humans, but it's- There are a few different models for osteoarthritis. And so

854
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:40,560
really, one of the things we've learned is that when you attempt to model disease, there are lots

855
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:46,080
of off the shelf models that people have built for things like osteoarthritis because they're

856
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:52,480
making a painkiller. So they do things like hurt the animal's knee and then give it a painkiller.

857
01:22:52,480 --> 01:23:00,400
How relevant is that to osteoarthritis in a human? It's not. You inject iodoacetate into the joint.

858
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:05,040
It hurts like hell, and then you give them painkillers. So we had to search around for

859
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:11,040
models that happened fast because that's the way we do experiments in which senescence played a

860
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:16,720
role in the ACLT model. So this was work we did collaboratively with Jennifer Elisif, who's a

861
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:23,760
professor at Johns Hopkins of bioengineering. And she was someone, an old friend, and she'd been

862
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,680
thinking about osteoarthritis and had the model in her lab. And I called her up one day and I said,

863
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:34,160
we have this crazy idea. We think that senescent cells could be driving this disease. Do you want

864
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:40,240
to try to figure this out with us? And she was an awesome collaborator. Some of the first

865
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:46,000
senolytic molecules we found, we shared with her and she had her model in operation. And very

866
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,840
quickly in her laboratory, we were able to demonstrate the senolytic molecules that we

867
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:56,880
had identified at the Buck Institute in Judy's group. One of them was active in Jennifer's model

868
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,960
of osteoarthritis. And so for the first time, we actually had a disease, a human disease,

869
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,840
the second most prevalent disease of aging. The primary reason it hurts to be old, I can't

870
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,800
overstate that enough. It's like being in pain sucks and this is the reason old people are in

871
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:17,520
pain mostly. And we could drive that disease backwards in a mouse. So we were just overjoyed

872
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,400
by this because we could achieve it genetically, which says it's really senescent cells. And the

873
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,880
second thing is we could also achieve the same result with a drug-like molecule. It was the

874
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:32,320
confluence of those two results that convinced us, this is really cool. It seems that we got the idea

875
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,560
right. How does the drug actually target the senescent cell when you don't have the luxury

876
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:43,200
of a genetic tag? We spent the first, remember that was question three of the big four questions.

877
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:50,240
We spent the first two and a half years of this whole effort searching fruitlessly and not finding

878
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:57,200
a senolytic molecule. And the first molecule we identified followed swiftly by the second,

879
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,360
and then a series of others that were very related to the second one. The first molecule

880
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:08,960
we identified was a MDM2 P53 interaction inhibitor. And so normally MDM2 is this

881
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,760
ubiquitin ligase. So it walks around and it's like a meter maid who goes around marking cars

882
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,600
with chalk for getting a parking ticket. But what MDM2 does is it walks around and it marks proteins

883
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:25,520
with a little molecule called ubiquitin and it marks them for destruction. And P53 is one of its

884
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:31,680
client proteins. And so if you break up the interaction between MDM2 and P53, P53 doesn't

885
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:38,080
get marked for destruction. So it's concentration in the cell goes up. And discovered in Judy's lab

886
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,800
by a few people, including Remy Marten-LaBerge, who was a postdoc in Judy's lab at the time,

887
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:49,360
he discovered that when you did this to senescent cells, senescent cells died preferentially.

888
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,720
By the way, is there anything on the outside of a senescent cell that identifies it?

889
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,440
There are some things on the inside and we've been searching.

890
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:03,040
But it's not like you have an antibody or anything that would render it externally identified.

891
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,800
We are searching now and we don't have any universal external marker of senescent cells.

892
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,440
We do have some that we just haven't talked about openly yet in various disease states where the

893
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:19,600
senescent cells in a disease state have a marker that's on the outside. We've not found and people

894
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,240
like Ned Sharpless have been searching for over a decade for such a marker.

895
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:29,280
Wow. So just to add to the complexity of the biology, if you were on a little mini nano

896
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:34,560
spaceship and you were inside the joint of a person with osteoarthritis, you wouldn't be

897
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,760
able to look out and see which of the cells are actually senescent and which ones are

898
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,440
normal, which ones are simply injured. You wouldn't be able to make that distinction.

899
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,600
So even if you had a special gun to shoot senescent cells, you wouldn't know which cells

900
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,480
to shoot based on just the observation of the cell.

901
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:57,600
Optically, no. Now, if you had a little bit of a sniffer, eyes would not be useful if you were

902
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:04,000
very small. A nose, however, would be useful. So if you could just sort of swim up the gradient

903
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,480
of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers, you would find yourself.

904
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,360
You'd find your source.

905
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,200
Yeah. Right. So I do think that the little mini spaceship things often very

906
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,000
illuminating to think about biology. I use that a lot.

907
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,920
Your drug then targets P53.

908
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:23,120
Oh, that's right. Yeah. So, so P53 goes up in these cells. So it doesn't target P53. It actually

909
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,560
binds on the MDM2 side, thereby kicking,

910
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,680
Relieving.

911
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,720
Yeah. Yeah. So, okay.

912
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:36,480
And then, so P53 goes up in concentration. The senescent cells die selectively. And then,

913
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:44,000
and this turned out to work very well in our trauma osteoarthritis models. And another very

914
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,920
cool result, and this is something else that Jennifer did wound up in our Nature paper,

915
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:55,600
our Nature Medicine paper in 2017, was Jennifer got knees from patients undergoing total knee

916
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,440
arthroplasty. So these are people that don't need their knees anymore because they're getting a

917
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:05,760
metal one. And she would take the cartilage at the site of the osteoarthritic lesion,

918
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,440
and she would digest out the exocerular matrix. And she'd take the cells, the cells that actually

919
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:16,880
make your cartilage, and she would grow them in 3D culture. And she would either expose those

920
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:24,640
little blobs of baby cartilage to either vehicle or our drug that's now in phase two clinical

921
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:30,560
trials in humans. And she observed something awesome, which is that exposure to the drug

922
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,800
eliminated senescent cells that were very prevalent from this site of damage.

923
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,680
You talked earlier about how you might see one to two percent senescent cells in an organism,

924
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,800
but when you talk about a very local spot of damage like that, how highly concentrated were they?

925
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,160
So it's a little hard because I'll tell you a slightly different number because

926
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:53,280
the cartilage stuff, so basically it's very, there are a lot of them at the site where you

927
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:59,680
have the osteoarthritic injury and you go millimeters away and then it drops way down.

928
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:04,480
So it's more puncta of it in that setting. If you look at the synovial membrane, which is,

929
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,920
I'll talk to you about another study we did in humans where we actually counted

930
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,800
senescent cells in patients with osteoarthritis, the number hovers around one to two percent,

931
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,800
even in patients with osteoarthritis, but it scales with you have more senescent cells when

932
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,520
you have more disease. And when you say, do you mean synovial fluid? Like if you did a joint

933
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,880
aspiration on somebody with osteoarthritis, you're saying one to two percent of the cells

934
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,040
in the synovial fluid is senescent? So we actually did tell you, I'll come back to this a little bit

935
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:35,840
later. Let me just finish up and then we'll immediately flip to that. Sorry. Okay. Is that

936
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:41,840
we did this experiment where we soaked the cartilage from the patients that had osteoarthritis

937
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:47,920
in our drug and eliminated senescent cells. But another really cool thing is they started

938
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:53,840
growing cartilage in the plastic dish. So these are cells that came from that sick person's knee.

939
01:29:54,480 --> 01:30:00,080
They had the capacity to make cartilage, but they just didn't. But once you eliminated the cells,

940
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:05,360
all of a sudden they were producing cartilage again. And so that was super cool. We have yet

941
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,800
to prove in a human being that this drug can grow cartilage when it's still in your knee.

942
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:17,760
But that experiment is kind of cool because it suggests that you have this innate capacity

943
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:24,640
if you were unburdened by these cells and their bad stuff they're making. So this next question

944
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:29,120
about how many senescent cells do you have in the disease? I'll tell you why I'm asking the question,

945
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:34,160
which is not just general curiosity. It's really to get a question of how difficult is it to target

946
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:39,840
these things in vivo. Are they ubiquitous enough that you can whack these things with an injection?

947
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,880
Because obviously when you're doing this in a person, you're not going to have the luxury of

948
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,600
taking their knee out to do it. That's sort of the etiology of my question. So I'll tell you a

949
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:53,440
little bit of what we've done in the clinic. So in human beings, we have eliminated senescent cells

950
01:30:54,320 --> 01:31:02,240
from patients' knees with a single injection of this drug. And we can not only eliminate or

951
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:08,080
dramatically reduce pain, but we can also eliminate factors that senescent cells are making.

952
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:13,680
So the quick answer to your question is that this molecule is safe enough, selective enough,

953
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:19,200
and potent enough that we can do it. So it doesn't just work in a plastic dish,

954
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,760
but it works actually within the knee of a patient suffering from osteoarthritis.

955
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,400
So this was your phase one trial with your first agent. This is the 101?

956
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,040
Yeah, that's right.

957
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:35,760
I've seen the phase one data maybe explain a little bit of what was done. Phase one for

958
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:42,080
people who aren't familiar with drug studies is mostly to ensure safety, but sometimes you'll see

959
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,600
efficacy. Sometimes you'll see that the drug actually does something beneficial, and that's

960
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:51,040
a bonus if you can see both efficacy and safety. But you're typically escalating the dose, and

961
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:56,480
again, you want to see if more drug leads to more toxicity. But if there's efficacy and the

962
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:02,400
efficacy improves with dose, that makes you a bit more confident that it's not the placebo effect

963
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:06,080
or not the effect of the vehicle that you use to deliver the drug.

964
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:13,680
That's correct. So the experiment we did, and this was all the result of what we saw in animals,

965
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,840
that was a result of what we saw in a phase zero study in which we went into patients with

966
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:24,160
osteoarthritis, no drugs, but we biopsy little bits of their synovial membrane and counted

967
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,720
senescent cells. And we saw that the more senescent cells they had, the worse osteoarthritis they had,

968
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:33,040
the more bone deformation they had in the knee, the more pain they had.

969
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:40,080
So emboldened by these results, we then took the drug to humans. And as you noted,

970
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:46,400
phase one studies are typically for safety. We realized though, that we couldn't really do the

971
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:52,080
right safety study in patients that didn't have a senescent cell burden. Because if you're asking

972
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:56,480
the question, is it safe to eliminate senescent cells from an osteoarthritic knee, you need to

973
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:03,120
have the cells to eliminate. And so that was our kind of logic in the design. And so the way we did

974
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:08,480
the study was 48 patients where we did a three to one randomization, meaning three people would get

975
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,800
drug versus one person getting placebo. And as you noted, we stepped up in dose and it was a single

976
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:21,920
dose of the drug at day zero injected into the knees of patients with painful osteoarthritis.

977
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:27,920
And we then followed these patients for three months. And we checked in with them every week,

978
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:33,520
and they checked in with themselves every day on a little iPhone device. And we monitored their

979
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,160
pain. And the investigators were blinded as well. Oh, yes. It's called a double blind study, which

980
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:45,280
means nobody knows who's got drug, who's got placebo or what dose of drug you were on. So there's 12

981
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:51,760
placebos, 36 treatments, treated patients, and those 36 treated patients were about six per dose.

982
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:57,280
They were six per dose. Yeah. So we had six dose levels. And so they were marched up from

983
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:03,200
essentially a group of a series of doses, three of them, which we based on some modeling we did

984
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:08,400
in cell culture, we thought would be sub pharmacologically active doses. So we thought

985
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:13,760
they'd be semi inactive or inactive entirely. And then we moved into the dose range where we thought

986
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:20,000
we'd be doing biology in the knee. And we saw what happened. And we asked the patients, they had

987
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,920
once a week meetings with their physician where they answered questionnaires about their pain,

988
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:29,360
about their functional state. Then every day they would go and they'd enter on a little iPhone

989
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:34,000
device, they answer one question, which is how much pain am I in on a scale of one to 10. And

990
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:41,840
what we saw when we unblinded the data was that there was a dose dependent meaning as you go up

991
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:48,000
in dose, you get more and more pain reduction and durable impact in pain. For as long as we

992
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,600
looked, when you got to three months, the pain is not returning. It's completely flat. Do you

993
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,920
remember what the placebo group experienced? How much of a reduction in pain did they achieve

994
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,720
relative to their baseline? It depends on which of the end points we're using. But I'll just

995
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:09,920
summarize by saying that injections into the knee placebo effect is a big deal. In fact,

996
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:14,320
if you did not see a placebo effect that looked like other clinical trials, you would scratch

997
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:19,840
your head and wonder what's wrong. We saw a very similar placebo effect to what is seen with the

998
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:25,920
injection of steroids into the knee. And that was actually good. Meaning if you do a trial with

999
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,960
steroids and with saline, for example, you saw the same placebo effect. You didn't see the same

1000
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,440
effect as you saw with steroids. Correct. You see the placebo groups in a steroid trial.

1001
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,480
Had comparable benefits.

1002
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:42,160
Looked like the placebo effect in our trial. And that is something that one must, the placebo

1003
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:49,280
effects in pain studies is absolutely important. But what we saw was that we vastly exceeded

1004
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:55,280
anything looking like the placebo effect. So in fact, at our highest dose of drug, again,

1005
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:59,520
because it's a phase one study, the N number of patients was small at the highest dose.

1006
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:05,920
We saw patients who were entering, so this is this scale of one to 10 thing. Okay. It's actually

1007
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,440
zero to 10 patients were entering on average at about a 6.2 and at the highest dose, they were

1008
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:16,480
dropping to just over one. Is that comparable to what patients experience with steroids? I know

1009
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,560
it's not apples to apples. And by the way, it's a reason it's not apples to apples that I actually

1010
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:25,440
learned on this clinical study. The reason you don't compare across studies is that different

1011
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:30,080
studies in rural different patients, different inclusion, exclusion criteria, even if you use

1012
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:36,880
the very same clinical instrument, it's really not an apples to apples comparison. That said,

1013
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:41,920
okay, the effect looks very large in terms of what we are doing in terms of approaching

1014
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,680
our highest dose, getting some patients close to pain-free. Now, I know that the phase one trial

1015
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:53,680
was a three month study. What's the average duration that patients have now been since their

1016
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:58,640
injections? I don't have the answer to that question. We are not monitoring the patients

1017
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:03,440
in that study going forward because we didn't consent them for that. What we are doing now is

1018
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:10,560
we're actively dosing patients in our phase two study. So presumably the duration will be extended

1019
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:16,720
in phase two. That's right. So because we only went three months in the phase one study and we

1020
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,920
didn't consent patients to keep watching them, we really wanted to answer this question, which is

1021
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,160
if you eliminate senescent cells from somebody's knee, how long does the pain stay away?

1022
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:33,360
And so the phase two study goes out to six months, so it's 24 weeks, and we're trying to replicate

1023
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:39,520
the phase one study as much as we can. So we're using the same clinical instruments to measure

1024
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:45,440
pain and function. We're similar dose levels. So we're doing placebo, a half-meg, two-migs,

1025
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:51,440
four-migs, which was the highest dose that we explored in the phase one study. And it's 45

1026
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:57,920
patients per dose level as opposed to six. So we should have sufficient statistical power to

1027
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:04,720
really see this really clearly. And in terms of the criteria of the patients that are coming in,

1028
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:10,560
they have to have painful osteoarthritis of the knee. And so there is a score, this thing called

1029
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,000
the NRS, which is this numerical rating scale. This is this zero to 10, so it's an 11-point scale.

1030
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:20,720
And you have to be between a four and a nine. And are these patients that typically have

1031
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:27,120
already tried corticosteroids and only achieved limited or short-term response? Like I'm trying

1032
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:31,600
to understand clinically, somebody listening to this, who should and shouldn't be excited about

1033
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:37,920
this type of work on the horizon? So I think all of us should be excited about this work,

1034
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,800
because not only is this a solution, so if our phase two replicates the phase one,

1035
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:51,040
and which we all hope and believe it ought to, not only is this a means to treat the primary

1036
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:57,440
reason it hurts to be old, but it's a read-through to this whole idea of medicine, which is could you

1037
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:03,840
treat diseases of aging by eliminating these cells at sites of disease? This is just the beginning of

1038
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,360
something. Well, let me go back and make sure I understand a few things, because I'm already

1039
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,120
doing what you're doing, I think, which is sort of extrapolating to the what it means.

1040
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:16,640
Is radiographic evidence a way, because you can certainly look at a person's knee on an x-ray and

1041
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:22,800
examine the loss of cartilage and appreciate an osteoarthritic knee. You could do the same thing

1042
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:29,200
on an MRI. Do you know if the reverse is true? Do you know if the level of cartilage that's making

1043
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:35,440
its way back into the knee as a result of the loss of senescent cells is radiographically evident as

1044
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:42,400
well? Or is it possible that some of the amelioration of pain is due to the reduction of the

1045
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:47,280
circulating factors there, but not so much an increase in the structural integrity of the knee?

1046
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:54,080
So what we saw in terms of the speed of pain resolution in the phase one was that within

1047
01:39:54,720 --> 01:40:00,800
two weeks of the injection, you achieved most of your pain reduction. So it seems pretty

1048
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:06,800
implausible to me that that is the result of a structural change to your joint. It seems far

1049
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:12,720
more likely that this is the result of getting rid of factors that are driving pain acutely.

1050
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:17,040
And it's possible, like my questions are probably so ignorant, and I'm sure there's some orthopedic

1051
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:22,400
surgeon listening to this cringing. We would assume that some of the pain that people experience in

1052
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:27,040
osteoarthritis is due to the structural part of this, but your evidence would suggest that at least

1053
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:31,600
part of the pain is not. It's consistent with that idea, but who's to say? So we're going to

1054
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,800
know because we're also doing MRI and x-ray in the phase two study. And so we're going to be able to

1055
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:43,600
not only follow pain, but we will follow structure as well. But we have no idea if you will see

1056
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:48,720
improvements in the structure of the joint over what time scale you would see changes and

1057
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:53,280
improvements to the structure of the joint. This is the cool thing about doing cutting edge biology

1058
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:57,760
in clinical science. I mean, I would love to take a group of patients if resources were no object,

1059
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,520
and we could continue to be absolutely sure of the safety of this. You know, you imagine

1060
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,960
take a bunch of people our age and you do a bunch of T2 weighted images, MRIs of their spine, and you

1061
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:16,240
look at these signal loss L4, L5, L5, S1 discs. Many people our age, myself certainly, have these

1062
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:22,240
blown out blackened discs that just aren't taking up water. Yeah, I have them. Yeah. It would be very

1063
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:27,360
interesting to note if you did directed injections of synolytic agents like this, if you could restore

1064
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:33,600
this signal, could you, by eradicating enough senescent cell, create an environment where the

1065
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,640
existing cell could proliferate into a healthy enough place where it takes up water? Something

1066
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:44,480
as simple as that, that again, it's a slippery slope in the spine to go after indications because

1067
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,960
it's not as clean as the knee, I don't think. But again, just a great proof of concept.

1068
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,840
Yeah, I will say that I suffer from degenerative disc disease. It's, well, everyone does at some

1069
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:59,680
point, but it's particularly prevalent in my family. There was a result I did not mention earlier

1070
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:05,840
from mice, that when we eliminate senescent cells from mice, from midlife until death, and we

1071
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:15,600
do x-ray on their spines, we see a 41% improvement in the maintenance of the intervertebral disc

1072
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:21,200
volume. Now, do you see a restoration or a reduction in decline? We only measured reduction

1073
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:27,520
in decline, so we do not know if you could see restoration. So that's still an unknown question

1074
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:33,440
in the senescent space. Absolutely. So it's possible you, me, and all the other folks that are

1075
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:39,280
in the senior category here won't necessarily reap the benefits nearly as much as the people like

1076
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:45,280
your kid, my kid right now, where you figure this out and when you're 20, you start to prophylactically

1077
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:51,280
take these things to reduce the glide rate of decline. That might be true structurally,

1078
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:56,720
but I would say that what we saw in our phase one study was you can take people with Frank,

1079
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,880
painful osteoarthritis of the knee, dose them, and two weeks later they have profound pain reduction

1080
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:07,920
at the highest dose. So that tells you that you are taking a big feature of that disease,

1081
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:12,800
the one that you get to feel on a minute to minute basis, and you are sending it backwards.

1082
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,200
Now, whether or not that becomes a structural change is something we hope to understand in

1083
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:21,440
the phase two study. And the other thing we, I guess, don't understand, and it might take even

1084
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:27,120
more than a phase two study to understand, is with corticosteroids we have problems, which is

1085
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:33,680
excessive use of corticosteroids is not a viable option. No. They themselves become destructive

1086
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:39,040
and or potentially lose efficacy over time, and so they're a great once in a while tool,

1087
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:43,680
but not a great maintenance tool. It will be interesting to know if this, if you become

1088
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:51,520
tachyphylactic to this, or if the efficacy increases with use as you start to increase

1089
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:57,520
the amount of cartilage laying tissue that exists, and you tip the battle in favor of the chondrocyte

1090
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:03,120
over the senescent cell. Yeah, that would be the kind of prediction one would make from the simple,

1091
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:07,600
sort of zero order prediction would be that, I think. Is there an example in biopharmacology

1092
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:13,360
where the good guy ends up winning with progressive dosing? Oh, I would say oncology.

1093
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:18,320
If you think about cancer as a gain of function. Only in the cancers that don't spread though,

1094
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,840
but that's sort of, that almost seems binary, doesn't it? I guess you're right. I guess you

1095
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,200
could say that. So because if you think of cancer as a sort of pitted battle between you, the organism,

1096
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,480
and cancer, which is sort of a gain of function, separate organism based on you living in you,

1097
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:38,240
but not you, when you successfully treat cancer through the elimination of those cells,

1098
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:44,880
the good guy won. Yeah, I guess that's true some of the time, but most of the time that's not true.

1099
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,560
It's sort of a tautology, right? It's true when it's true, but when it's not, it's not, but most

1100
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,720
of the time it's not true is the problem. But it could certainly be the case here. There's certainly

1101
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:58,640
a case, but even if the worst case scenario is you need a drug injected every six months or every 12

1102
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:04,560
months, it's certainly interesting. Let's go one step further because this is obviously a critical

1103
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:10,480
piece of health span. In fact, you could argue that along with cognition, there's no more important

1104
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:16,960
piece of health span than the structural integrity of your body as you age. Have you, in your leisure

1105
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:23,040
time, had the ability to think about how this might impact lifespan vis-a-vis atherosclerosis,

1106
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:29,920
cancer, or other diseases that actually shorten life? Well, we know that atherosclerosis is another

1107
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:35,600
disease in which senescence plays a role. Now, we're not currently working on that. One of the

1108
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,600
things you may have noticed is that osteoarthritis, the way we approach the disease, even though it

1109
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:46,400
affects many of the 360 joints in your body, we treat the local version of the disease with local

1110
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:53,680
therapy. Atherosclerosis is about as systemic as it gets. And Jan van der Zinn at Mayo Clinic

1111
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:58,000
published a paper. Actually, it was Jan van der Zinn, the guy named a very excellent young scientist

1112
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:04,080
named Bennett Childs. And this is a paper in Science in which he showed in Rodents that

1113
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:12,960
senescent cells accumulate in the atherosclerotic plaques that form in a high-fat diet mouse,

1114
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:19,360
which is a model that can predict, say, statin efficacy to some extent, although it exaggerates

1115
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:24,240
it somewhat compared to the human case. And what Bennett showed, these plaques are full of senescent

1116
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:29,520
cells. And if you eliminate those cells, what are the cells that have become senescent? What's their

1117
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:35,280
origin? So they appear to be macrophage in origin. I see. So it's not the endothelial cell. Well,

1118
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:40,080
no, there's three cell types. It's basically there's a senescent endothelium. There is a

1119
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:46,480
myofibroblastic type of cell that's in there. And then there are macrophages. So it's all three.

1120
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:51,360
It's basically the barrier, the immune cell that came to the rescue and the fibroblasts that

1121
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,760
attempted to repair the damage. Yeah, all of them. And when you eliminate these senescent cells,

1122
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:01,600
either genetically or with a drug, first of all, you can reduce plaque volume, which is cool. But

1123
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:06,880
what might even be cooler is that, and again, it's in a mouse. And so you just gotta wonder,

1124
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:12,720
what is that really saying about the pathophysiology of the human disease? But there is this

1125
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:21,120
fibrotic cap that forms on the surface of an atherosclerotic plaque. And one of the ideas in

1126
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:28,960
the literature is that the thinning of that plaque gives rise to a unstable plaque that is

1127
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:36,560
clinically dangerous and that interventions that can thicken that plaque might be a therapy,

1128
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:41,120
because you could take a plaque that you have and now convert it into something clinically

1129
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:47,120
more innocuous. And what Jan showed was that genetically and with drug that he can thicken

1130
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:52,880
the plaques of atherosclerotic plaques in a mouse. That would seem to counter the idea that you could

1131
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,640
lessen plaque volume. Do you have to pick between one of those two strategies? Because typically,

1132
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:00,560
if you thicken the plaque, wouldn't you likely increase the volume? No. So if you look at the

1133
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:08,000
relative partitioning of how much of the plaque volume is the cap, and then how much is this

1134
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:19,280
lipid deposit with macrophages in it, eyeballing it, 90% is this kind of lipid-y macrophage blob.

1135
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:26,240
And then there's this thin little veneer on top that is the cap. And so the thickening of that

1136
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:31,200
cap doesn't dramatically contribute to the overall volume of the atherosclerotic plaque,

1137
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:35,760
at least in a mouse. But both are happening. You're thickening the cap and reducing the

1138
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:43,840
subendithelial portion of the reducing the femme salins. So the ATHRO is a very tough

1139
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:51,840
place to do drug development. I mean, we've seen the PCSK9 story has been a multi-billion dollar

1140
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,400
battle that has given rise to relatively moderate uptake of those drugs.

1141
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,640
I could argue that's just due to the cost of the drug.

1142
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:04,240
It's also the fact that it's a relative cost issue going up against statins. So switching

1143
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:08,640
people and all this sort of thing, but it's not been, it's caused a sort of downward pressure

1144
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:15,520
on people's enthusiasm for doing cardiovascular drug discovery. Because now we have to, you're not

1145
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:20,080
using surrogate markers anymore, you're using outcome studies, you're actually following people

1146
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:26,240
until they die or have a serious cardiac event. Do you see an application here in oncology? I mean,

1147
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:31,200
it seems like there should be. Well, it's an area of interest of ours. So one of the things we saw

1148
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:37,520
in Jan van der Zent's 2016 paper was that these mice from whom we eliminated senescent cells from

1149
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:45,520
midlife until death, they had the same cancer prevalence. So 85% of them die of lymphoma with

1150
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:50,880
and without senescent cells. The difference is that when you eliminate the cells, the animals

1151
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:58,720
from whom these cells were eliminated get cancer 30% later in their lives. So you have to kind of

1152
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:04,160
head scratch for a moment. Like what does that mean? And if I recall, you said they got a 30%

1153
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:09,600
lifespan extension. Yeah. So you basically created centenarians, you just phase shifted chronic

1154
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:15,200
disease by a third. And some of the diseases were just dramatically reduced. So the effects

1155
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:20,160
on kidney function, the age effects of kidney function were reduced dramatically, cataracts were

1156
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:25,120
reduced dramatically. So there's a whole bunch of behavior stuff that we don't know what that means.

1157
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:30,960
But these animals seem to preserve features of youthful behavior. Their spinal lord lord doses

1158
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:36,800
looks youthful. So there's a whole set of things. But one of the things that people often ask about

1159
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:43,040
the experiment is, do they die of different things when you live 30% longer? And the answer is no,

1160
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:48,000
they die of the same thing mostly. Now that could have to do with the fact that it's mice and these

1161
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,920
lab strains of mice. Yeah, they just get cancer like crazy. And it's less interesting to me that

1162
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:56,160
it's how much lymphoma they get. It's more interesting to me that you could phase shift it.

1163
01:50:56,160 --> 01:51:04,000
So we don't know why that is. But an explanation that makes some sense to me is that there is

1164
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,240
something perverse that senescent cells do to the tissue microenvironment. So this system, which is

1165
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:18,880
an anti cancer system in the young, could become a pro cancer system in the old by doing something

1166
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:26,320
to the tumor microenvironment that makes it more amenable to tumor genesis. And that would be

1167
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:31,760
consistent what you see where the rate of tumor formation across the animal's life is unchanged,

1168
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:37,920
but its ability to take root is delayed. So you could imagine applications in oncology,

1169
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,800
but you would require something in which you had some sort of highly sort of tumor prone

1170
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,240
situation where you could intervene in it. There's also an idea where if you could make cells

1171
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:54,160
senescent, which is what chemotherapy does in many cases, and then do a sort of a two hit strategy

1172
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:59,920
where you drive the cells into senescence, and then you exploit a senescence associated, you know,

1173
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:05,680
Achilles heel. So it could be a strategy in which you deliberately are trying to drive tumor cells

1174
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:12,320
into senescence and then killing them. And then there are a series of cancers that we think that

1175
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:17,680
are age associated that may be essentially the product of a highly senescent environment.

1176
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:23,520
So cancers of the skin, what if you could or cancers of the say the bladder or something

1177
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:29,440
like this, these things that older people get, could you go in and eliminate senescent cells

1178
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:35,280
and change trajectory of disease? That's an idea. That's very cool that you could think about. But I

1179
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:43,200
would say that the most powerful read through from our results so far in humans are these other

1180
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:50,480
diseases of aging for which we have no treatments. So let us take something like the dry version of

1181
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:56,720
macular degeneration. This is a disease for which there is no treatment. And it's eight fold more

1182
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:01,840
prevalent than the wet disease that you can treat with anti-veg S. This is a disease that appears to

1183
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,080
have senescence associated with it. What's the distribution of those two? So people that have age

1184
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:11,760
associated macular degeneration, one in eight has the wet disease. And only that one out of eight

1185
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:18,720
people is treatable with the anti-veg F antibodies. Seven out of eight of those people are untreatable.

1186
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:24,640
Now that disease, the dry disease moves more slowly, but it makes you just as blind. And so that is an

1187
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:29,760
area in which senescence and senolytic medicines may play a role, but we'll have to find out in

1188
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:36,880
the clinic. And next year we are going with our first molecules into the eye. Do you have an animal

1189
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:43,200
model for that? No. So you have animal models of the wet disease and our molecules work in that

1190
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:49,120
model. And so you could say that that's pretty neat. This is a giant opportunity, but I'm

1191
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:52,640
personally attracted. First of all, I just want to say that when we talked about the four risks,

1192
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:59,200
defined your work stream for four years, we live in a different risk set. So if you think about it,

1193
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:05,120
the chapter one of this entire effort really was demonstrated in a human being that eliminating

1194
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:10,720
senescent cells could take a feature of aging that otherwise was untreatable and sent it backwards.

1195
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:16,240
Our phase one study, certainly if the phase two replicates, that was the end of chapter one. And

1196
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:21,520
we're sort of living in this chapter two moment where we're seeing how broad can we make this

1197
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:27,840
work. And if you think about what risks live in chapter two, for me, and I think anybody, it would

1198
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:33,920
be that the risk is you have your biological disease hypothesis wrong. And animal models,

1199
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,560
they only ask an answer the questions they're built to ask an answer. And the only way you get

1200
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:43,840
to really ask an answer the question you want to ask is in the clinical setting in human beings.

1201
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:49,760
So the way I think about diseases of the eyes, you have a series of these untreatable diseases

1202
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,840
that make you blind, where we think senescence could play a role. And we're going to explore

1203
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:59,120
each of these in the clinic. So essentially being able to ask in the relevant setting,

1204
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:05,200
that can we intervene in these diseases of aging, using the very same approach that we took

1205
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:12,960
to osteoarthritis, albeit with different drugs. Now you won't be doing a real phase one here,

1206
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,960
you're going to go directly into a phase two, right? So this is something that we haven't

1207
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:23,200
really talked about yet. But notionally, we're going to be going into patients, because obviously

1208
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:27,760
your eye is something that's super, super important and you can't mess with it. We're

1209
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:33,360
going to be going into a very select population first, demonstrating safety and then branching

1210
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:38,640
outwards into multiple diseases of the eye. How do you deliver the vehicle? Is it an injection?

1211
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:42,400
Yeah, so it's very similar to clinical practice for anti-veg.

1212
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,760
Anti-veg after delivery.

1213
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:48,560
So it goes right into the vitreous fluid of the eye. And our drug then takes up,

1214
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:53,600
we actually know exactly where the drug goes into the various sub compartments within the eye.

1215
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:59,120
And we know where senescent cells are in these different diseases and our drug gets there. And

1216
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:05,680
the clinical hypothesis is that one or more of these essentially progressive diseases of the

1217
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:09,280
aging eye, when we eliminate the cells will stop.

1218
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:13,040
And can you speak about the drug? What is it targeting? It's not targeting p53?

1219
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:18,400
No. So we have two molecules that we're advancing toward the clinic. Both of them are inhibitors of

1220
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:26,000
the BCL2 protein family. So these are molecules that inhibit inhibitors of apoptosis. So they

1221
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:32,640
cause cells to enter programmed cell death. But interestingly, we've shown in animals that they

1222
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:40,240
don't cause that to happen in normal healthy eyes. They only target cells that have been damaged by

1223
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:44,720
the disease process and the stress associated with disease process. And so-

1224
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:45,680
Why is that?

1225
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:53,200
There's something about, so senescent cells when they enter the state, do a variety of things. They

1226
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:59,680
turn up proteins that are pro apoptosis and they also turn up proteins in terms of their expression

1227
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:05,280
that are anti apoptosis. So what we do is we go in with a drug and just give a little shove in one

1228
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:05,920
direction.

1229
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:12,480
I see. But you're saying if you give that same shove to someone who has not up regulated or

1230
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:15,680
down regulated either of those factors, it doesn't seem to matter too much.

1231
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:21,120
Yeah. And so we have a beautiful experiment in mouse where we have a disease condition,

1232
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:29,120
and we have a normal condition. Mice are identical, but for this. And we put the drug in and we can

1233
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:36,080
see the drug molecularly going in and engaging its target. So because it actually breaks up to

1234
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:40,160
proteins that are stuck together. And you can see in these animals, both of them are equally

1235
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:46,880
engaging target, but the apoptosis program only turns on in the disease state. And it was a pretty

1236
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:52,960
awesome result because you can see the selectivity of the molecules in a living creature's eye.

1237
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:57,280
Does that same molecule work in the osteoarthritic scenario?

1238
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:03,520
No. So we couldn't get it to work either in the trauma models in mice. We couldn't get it to work

1239
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:08,880
when we took the cartilage out of human needs. It didn't work there either. And so it never raised

1240
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:09,520
its hand.

1241
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,080
What do you think that says about the biology?

1242
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:21,520
There's something about cells and their fate that determines which apoptosis vulnerability

1243
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:28,160
you have. They have different Achilles heels. And we don't understand mechanistically why that is.

1244
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:35,440
We've sort of figured this out empirically and picked molecules based on their behavior

1245
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:40,720
against the cells that we find to be senescent in these human diseases.

1246
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:47,840
So 15 years from now or 20 years from now, we will likely look back and companies like Unity,

1247
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:55,360
and presumably there will be many like Unity, you will have an entire suite of targets. You will say,

1248
01:58:55,360 --> 01:59:01,440
well, here's the playbook in this type of cell or this scenario going after the anti-anti-apoptotic

1249
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:06,400
pathway is the way to go. In this case, we're going to go after P53. And you might have a dozen

1250
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:11,680
of these different targets. Well, we're not sure yet. I think it's too early to say how this is

1251
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:15,520
going to play out. Oh, so you don't think it's a fait accompli. I mean, you think it might be that

1252
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:20,320
there's a very small number of ways to go about doing this? I doubt that. I doubt it will be

1253
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:27,040
dozens though. I think it's going to be a small number. I think it'll be context specific. I think

1254
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:34,320
there'll be super creative ways that we and others come up with to exploit these different

1255
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:39,440
vulnerabilities. I don't think biology is going to have made 24 different keys to this lock.

1256
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:45,600
They think it's going to make a half dozen. And we actively search for these. It's just interesting

1257
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:51,200
to me that you can turn one key and get a benefit. I mean, think about how often that doesn't work.

1258
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:59,200
Think of the futility of that in chemotherapy, where you target this one piece of cell cycle

1259
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:08,000
replication and very quickly the cell mutates away around that drug. So cancer is incredibly hard,

1260
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:16,400
okay? Because cancer exploits the single best tool biology has, which is variation. Cancer cells can

1261
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:23,360
divide and mutate and become anything to avoid death. They live under selective pressure,

1262
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:31,200
particularly in the context of drug. Senescent cells can't divide by definition. So their ability

1263
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:37,600
to access variation is dramatically reduced. Now that's not to say that there couldn't still be

1264
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:43,840
selection without division, but boy, it's way harder when you can't make a million progenate

1265
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,840
with tiny variants and test them all in parallel, which is what cancer does.

1266
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,880
Yeah. It's sort of funny, isn't it? Cancer is the ultimate A-B tester.

1267
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:58,320
We like to think of senescent cells as cancer cells that can't divide. I've heard that said

1268
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,800
semi-humorously, but that's actually really neat.

1269
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,320
Right. Which is sort of funny because it's like,

1270
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:07,200
tape the top 100 most valuable traits of cancer and take away 99 of them.

1271
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,640
By the way, I was saying that in some joking.

1272
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,760
No, I understand. Yeah.

1273
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:15,440
In the sense that senescent cells become senescent. Well, first of all, in vivo,

1274
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:20,320
we don't often know why they became senescent, but one of the mechanisms by which cells can

1275
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:27,200
become senescent is activation of a cancer causing gene. But that could be very rare event

1276
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:34,560
compared to mitochondrial failure or high concentration glucose or telomere shortening.

1277
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:38,080
I mean, I was going to actually ask you exactly about that example, which is,

1278
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:44,640
do we have any reason to believe that the increase in age associated type two diabetes

1279
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:49,440
could be resulting from some sort of pancreatic senescence where beta cells

1280
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:54,400
become less and less robust due to senescent beta cells in the proximity?

1281
02:01:54,400 --> 02:02:00,320
There is some data in support of senescence in that cellular niche, but it's very complicated

1282
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:06,080
biology. And there's even some talk about compensatory mechanism where senescent cells

1283
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:11,360
actually may improve the function of some of those cells within the niche. It's an area of

1284
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:17,600
intense literature debate. The other challenge we have there is we don't have good models in animals

1285
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:22,480
of studying this. And so it's been hard for us to get our heads around. What I will say about type

1286
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:31,600
two diabetes in humans is that there was a large meta analysis of a genome-wide association studies

1287
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:40,080
looking for the genetic correlation between grievous illness of aging and loci. Where did

1288
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:48,320
these mutations map? And what you saw is that one of the very big peaks for diseases of aging maps

1289
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:54,880
into the control system for the establishment of cellular senescence. This P14 Arf locus.

1290
02:02:55,680 --> 02:03:00,160
And you look at this is where this very important gene that people use for senescence all the time

1291
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:06,720
called P16, which is this part of the emergency break. Its gene lives in this locus. And what you

1292
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:13,520
see is diseases like type two diabetes, mutations that give rise to that live there. Mutations that

1293
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:20,720
give rise to late onset Alzheimer's live there. Frailty lives there. Atherosclerosis lives there.

1294
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:28,480
So a whole bunch of these diseases where we saw phenotypes in mice, you see a natural genetic

1295
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:34,480
variation of humans also shows a kind of tie-in to senescence. And so type two diabetes caught my

1296
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:40,080
eye there because you see that in the GWAS studies. And lastly, what about Alzheimer's disease? We have

1297
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:47,760
to believe that astrocytes are losing some functionality to protect neurons, right? So

1298
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:56,160
this is what my group works on. And it's something that animates a lot of us at the company. We know

1299
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:01,440
that astrocytes or glia, just call them glial cells. So if you guys don't know what glia is,

1300
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:06,320
that's actually derived from the word glue. So this is the cells that are not your neurons

1301
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:10,880
in your brain that seem to hold the rest of it together. Which outnumber neurons tremendously.

1302
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:15,440
Vastly. I think the number is on the order of 10 to 1. 8 to 10 to 1 or something like that.

1303
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,880
Guys got to look that number up, but it's on that order of magnitude. And what was known before we

1304
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:26,800
got involved was that as human beings aged, there's a dramatic increase in senescent glial

1305
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:33,040
cells, specifically astrocytes and microglia, which are the sort of macrophages of the brain.

1306
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:38,640
And stuff we've been working on, if we've been looking at that trend in rodents, and we see a

1307
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:45,600
very similar trend. Now, we have not talked about doing on this yet, because it's still early days,

1308
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:51,840
but it's hard to imagine that the pro-inflammatory environment created by this vast number of

1309
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:58,960
senescent glial cells is good for you. One needs to ask the question, what would happen if you could

1310
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:04,240
eliminate senescent glial cells? Would that enhance cognition? Would it harm cognition?

1311
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:09,040
And this is something that we are actively looking into. But all of the work we've done over the last

1312
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:15,600
eight years, everything going from the mutant animals to the wild type animals to human data

1313
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:21,760
in osteoarthritis, and now moving into human data soon within the eye, it would just be very hard to

1314
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:30,800
imagine that senescence is not playing a role in aspects of cognition loss as we age. And this is

1315
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:38,080
something when I think about why we do what we do, that is something that there could be very few

1316
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:42,960
greater contributions that myself and my colleagues could make than making a contribution

1317
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:50,480
there, because it has been an unsolved problem and a scourge to humanity. I mean, do you get the sense

1318
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:53,840
that doing what you've done now, it would be very difficult for you to go back in time and do

1319
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:57,920
something like Kythera over again? And I'm not saying that to be critical or in any way, shape,

1320
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:02,640
or form. I'm just saying like, I mean, maybe tell people what Kythera did. That was a very successful

1321
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:07,680
company for you, but there's no comparing the nature of the two problems you're trying to solve.

1322
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:12,160
Actually, thank you for actually pulling me out of what would otherwise be a kind of like

1323
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:18,880
overly sort of sappy discussion about contribution. Okay, so Kythera is actually a total kind of

1324
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:23,680
opposite sort of thing. And Kythera was a company myself and two co-founders founded

1325
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:30,800
now almost 15 years ago. It's about as opposite as you can get from doing unity. And so it was

1326
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:36,240
basically this idea that all this biology that's been explored for oncology and inflammatory

1327
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:44,400
disease, taking molecules from that and applying it to the biology of aesthetics. And we did this,

1328
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:49,840
and I had these great business partners that continue to be partners with me today.

1329
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:56,480
One of them is Keith Leonard, who's CEO at Unity and very close friend. And he's been my big brother

1330
02:06:56,480 --> 02:07:02,560
for 15 years and continues as of this morning, calling me and giving me feedback on things. And

1331
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:09,360
the reason I did Kythera was it was sort of a cute idea, but it was mostly because of people,

1332
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:15,360
was these guys said, hey, let's do something together. And it was a great decision, because

1333
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:21,200
I learned so much in a sense because, so the drug we ultimately got approved, we took four things

1334
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:25,840
into the clinic, and one out of the four things worked. And it was a molecule that causes fat

1335
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:32,240
cells to explode. So we went from an in vitro observation all the way to a launched commercial

1336
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:38,800
product called Kybella, you can go get it, you're dermatologist. And Allergan acquired the company.

1337
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:44,880
And it was a great learning experience of just how to develop pharmaceuticals in something that

1338
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:53,360
didn't have historical resonance at all. And so it was a great moment where the stakes weren't as high

1339
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:59,440
whether you succeeded or failed. And as a consequence, it allowed you to hone your skills

1340
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:06,640
of kind of making really high quality decisions on risk and making drug development decisions in a

1341
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:11,680
way that's actually frankly, a little more dispassionate. And it was a great growth experience for me.

1342
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:16,400
I mean, is it safe to say that if you had not had the experience at Kythera,

1343
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:20,400
because then you would have been coming from a cajun, right? Basically, yeah. Would you have had a

1344
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:25,040
more difficult time doing what you and the early co-founders did at Unity?

1345
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:31,360
It would have been impossible. I would have none of the intellectual or emotional toolkit to do

1346
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:35,840
what we did. I mean, that whole risk thing, that was stuff we built. I mean, it was a little bit

1347
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:43,120
when we put together a cajun, but it had become a kind of ritualized practice by the time we were

1348
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:50,240
doing Kythera projects, this dimensionalization of risk and creating work plans based on it.

1349
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:55,600
And so, yeah, I would say that there would be no Unity without there being Kythera.

1350
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:59,280
Last question, Ned. I actually have two questions for you. I'm sorry that I think about it.

1351
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:06,080
First question is, what advice do you give for a person who's studying science and trying to

1352
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:12,640
decide between the entrepreneurial pathway that you've been on versus a more academic pathway?

1353
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:16,640
What would you offer them as an insight or a set of questions that they could pose to themselves

1354
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:22,880
to further delineate that? Well, I would say two things. First, don't create a false choice.

1355
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:29,120
I have friends that are academics that have founded as many companies as I have.

1356
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:36,160
I do from time to time have career jealousy over some of the freedoms and some of the

1357
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:40,960
responsibilities, frankly, that they have as people who have academic appointments.

1358
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:46,320
There are wonderful things that you can do from the seat of academia in company creation if you

1359
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:52,480
are so lucky and so positioned to do so. So first, don't fall into this idea of a false choice. And

1360
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:58,160
I see people do that, I think, out of some emotional discomfort, this desire to just move

1361
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:04,400
and confuse action with progress. And I'd say just slow down, take a deep breath, don't rush,

1362
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:12,000
you have your life. That'd be the first thing. The second thing is animate what you do with a single

1363
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:20,000
beautiful idea. So something that moves you, that literally gives you goosebumps, that weird

1364
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,520
tingling sensation when you think about it, when you think how cool it is, and oh my god, if we

1365
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:33,360
could actually make this work. I mean, few things in life rival that feeling when a hard fought

1366
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:39,520
battle for data that was 18 to 24 months and the experiment finally works, and you're looking at

1367
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:44,560
the data and you feel like the future taking root in the present. The only thing I can compare it to

1368
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:53,120
is love from your kids. That is the only thing that has the same emotional gravitas. Finally,

1369
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:58,560
third thing, learn from people that are better than you, that are more experienced than you,

1370
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:04,480
that will have patience with you. I mean, the Kythera experience was that. I mean,

1371
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:10,880
good heavens, I was, I may still be sort of unemployable in normal corporate settings.

1372
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:19,280
Yet the people there saw that I knew how to do certain things and I learned from them and I

1373
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:26,800
learned how to do the things that allowed us to build unity because people were patient and took

1374
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:33,440
time to teach. I learned from real experts and I don't claim to be an expert at much of anything,

1375
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,880
but I do claim to have a deep appreciation for learning from people who are better and more

1376
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:42,640
skilled than myself. So three things. Well, I'm going to leave it at that. I was going to ask you

1377
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:46,800
another question, but I think this was the more interesting question and so we'll leave it at that

1378
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:51,760
and grateful, Ned, for the time that you've set aside today to talk about this stuff. I think this

1379
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:56,080
is a super interesting topic. When I think about the pillars of longevity, going back to your

1380
02:11:56,080 --> 02:12:01,920
initial framework, which is things that inhibit tor, things that target mitochondrial function,

1381
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:07,840
things that may set back the methylation clock, slow down time in that regard in this problem.

1382
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:13,120
It's not a zero sum game and it's very likely we need to be pursuing all of these strategies

1383
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:19,760
in parallel, but the data so far with respect to a very tangible problem like osteoarthritis is

1384
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:24,400
pretty exciting. So I suspect there's going to be a lot of people listening to this who are going to

1385
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:29,840
be very eager to follow the results of the technology that you guys are trying to bring

1386
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:34,480
to market along with presumably some others down the line. Thank you, Peter. It's been really a

1387
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:40,480
treat and an honor to share this with you and I've always and shall always, I love your questions.

1388
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:46,000
