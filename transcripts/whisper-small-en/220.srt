00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,320
Hey, Celia. Thanks for making time on a Friday evening to sit down and talk about ketamine

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,000
and perhaps a few other things, but great to meet you.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
You too. Thanks. It's my pleasure.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's talk a little bit about your background because I know that you ... I think you finished

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,840
your graduate training in the UK, but then you did a stint here in the US at Yale, if

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,840
I'm not mistaken, correct?

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Yeah. I did my undergraduate in psychology with pharmacology and astrophysics for a bit,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,120
but then I went ... I did a PhD program at University College London, but as part of

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,200
that I spent some time at Yale and I'd got a scholarship to do a little bit of research

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,720
out there in the US.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,880
What did you focus on during your PhD?

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,520
My PhD was largely focused on the effects of ketamine. Back then, that makes me feel

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,760
quite old, but nearly 20 years ago we were looking ... both had the acute effects of

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,240
ketamine as a model of psychosis. At the time people were using ketamine with the idea that

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,720
would help us understand the neurobiological underpinnings of psychosis because actually

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,880
from the outside ketamine looks quite a little bit similar to people who are psychotic.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,320
We were using that to map the cognitive processes altered by ketamine, but I was also simultaneously

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,920
looking at people who take ketamine recreationally because at the time that was quite a big problem

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,720
in the UK. Yeah, I had this dual focus. When I went to the US it was to work on, again,

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,360
neuroimaging studies looking at ketamine as a model for psychosis. It was before it

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,640
really became established as an antidepressant.

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,600
Let's talk a little bit about the history of ketamine. It was synthesized in the 60s,

24
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,080
I believe, correct?

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,880
Yeah. It was synthesized as an anesthetic by Parker Davies who ... it was synthesized

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:18,680
as a replacement for PCP or Fence-like LeDine because obviously people know PCP as Angel

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,840
Dust and this is folklore around it of people running at the police and being shot down

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,900
and keeping running. Really, the problems with it had this protracted psychosis-like

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,920
effects that lasted for a really long time following anesthesia. It was still a good

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,240
analgesic anesthetic. It synthesized ketamine as a similar molecule. It still worked on

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,760
the same receptor in the brain, the NMDA receptor, but it was 10 times less potent. It was synthesized

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,280
back in the 60s. The drug company that synthesized it were initially really impressed by its

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,540
analgesic and anesthetic effects. Then with increasing clinical experience, it was noticed

34
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,200
that people were coming around from ketamine anesthesia reporting a variety of quite weird

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,360
effects, say things like hallucinations and out-of-body experiences. That's what's really

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,320
limited its routine clinical use, but it's still one of the most widely used anesthetics

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,080
in the world today. It's on the World Health Organization list of essential medicines.

38
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,880
Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I remember from my clinical training was that one of

39
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,720
the perks of ketamine was that you didn't have the respiratory depression. Most things

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,320
that we use as anesthetic agents have this problem where if you overshoot them, and that's

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,880
not an issue if you're doing general anesthesia because you have an endotracheal tube in the

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,760
bronchus and the main stem bronchus, so you're breathing for the patient. When you start to

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,960
think about conscious sedation, respiratory depression starts to become a very frightening

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,120
consequence that must be managed closely. With ketamine, you didn't have that. Now,

45
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,000
is my memory correct that kids were less susceptible to the hallucinogenic effects?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,280
I literally, this is because I didn't do much in pediatrics, but I can't recall if there was more

47
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,720
flexibility in using it with kids or am I making that up?

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,320
No, I think, I mean, it is used more with children. I don't know. That's the thing. We

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,360
tried to do a study actually, which never really came off, but I don't know if it's that people

50
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,200
haven't asked kids if they're hallucinating or maybe they're just more open.

51
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,000
It seems less foreign to them if they are.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,880
Yeah, exactly. They're tripping all the time, but no, maybe not that. But they're more open to

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,720
changes in consciousness. So yeah, I think they certainly seem to, I mean, it's used

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,680
routinely. I'm really interested and I don't think anyone's really actually asked children

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,520
about their experiences. But yeah, it's definitely, I think it's used because it's so safe. So

56
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,840
in pediatrics and geriatrics, also in battlefield medicine, it was the most widely used anesthetic

57
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,680
in the Vietnam War, for instance. So it's used, yeah, as you said, it's really safe

58
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,800
physiologically as an anesthetic because it doesn't slow your breathing or your heart rate.

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,800
So when you've lost a lot of blood, it's good as well because it actually even vaguely increases

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,000
your blood pressure. So yeah, I think that's why it's a widely used anesthetic. It's a really good

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,280
question about kids though. And I don't think, I mean, I know there's some people trialing,

62
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,280
get them in, in its antidepressant use now with adolescents. So I'm sure we'll come on to that later.

63
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,760
Yeah. And I'm glad you made that other point, by the way, it doesn't lower blood pressure. So now

64
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:33,640
you talk about it being the perfect anesthetic in trauma and shock where those patients are

65
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,840
hypovolemic, their blood pressure is already going down. You give them an agent that if anything

66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,960
slightly acts like a vasopressor raises blood pressure without the respiratory depression. I

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,080
mean, in that setting, you can understand why it sort of became, you know, a turning point in the

68
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,840
field medicine in Vietnam. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the acute experience must be really unusual

69
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,080
when you're in that setting, but I guess the dissociation. So like, I think there's an interesting

70
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,760
study about looking at the interaction between those acute subjective effects when you're on a

71
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,400
battlefield. But I mean, yeah, also, as you mentioned, not having to intubate people, that's

72
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,960
why it's really popular in developing countries, where you've got limited access, you know, to,

73
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,960
or ability to intubate patients, you know, so it's a really important medicine, you know,

74
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,040
anesthesia still. And I think that's something people forget with all the new developments with

75
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,520
the use of ketamine. Yeah, it's really interesting when you go and imagine what surgery was like

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,560
before ether. And, you know, I mean, when you, I mean, that's just ridiculous. And to think that

77
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,480
anesthesia is something we've only had for about 140 years. Yeah, it's a pretty crazy thing to

78
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,040
imagine. That fascinating, that fascinating concept anyway, like when you lose consciousness

79
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,520
and how you measure that, you know, there's different things on it. And you could just use

80
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,920
there's an index, which will realize on some EEG to look at how your consciousness drops. But I

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,200
still don't think we really know, you know, what turns it on and off. But yeah, that's probably

82
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,320
another podcast. So you mentioned that ketamine is kind of an analog, is it safe to say it's an

83
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,680
analog of PCP? Yeah, so they're all under the class of arrow cyclohexamines. And so I think

84
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,160
Edward Domino coined the term dissociative anesthetics to describe PCP and ketamine. And

85
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,400
also people include nitrous oxide in that category, laterally, so I think based on the fact that they

86
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,040
kind of dissociate you from your body and are characterized by these out of body experiences.

87
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,400
Which can be quite helpful again, I think in anesthetic use. Yeah, so they are related compounds

88
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,200
with similar their main action is on the NMDA receptor. So let's talk a little bit about that.

89
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,920
Let's assume that folks don't know what the NMDA receptor is. They don't know what glutamate is.

90
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,920
They don't know GAP. Like, let's just assume people are coming at this from a standpoint of not being

91
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:08,920
completely up to speed on excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters. Explain in some detail

92
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:17,240
exactly how these neurotransmitters work and how other neurons can amplify or attenuate

93
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,560
the response of those and where ketamine fits into that. Sure. So I guess, well, do you jump in as

94
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:31,400
well if I'm either going too slowly or too quickly. But yeah, so glutamate is the major excitatory

95
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,480
neurotransmitter in the brain and it's prevalent all across the brain. And one of the receptors

96
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,400
that glutamate works out is the NMDA receptor and the NMDA receptor, the N-methyl-despartate receptor,

97
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,040
which are really important in a lot of our higher cognitive functions. So it's the kind of the

98
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,760
fundaments of learning and memory, particularly a process in learning called long-term potentiation,

99
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,640
which is where neurons that or brain cells that activate at the same time are more like then if

100
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,320
they both activate, then they're more likely to activate in future. So it's characterized by this

101
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,800
term that someone said neurons that fire together, wire together. And glutamate is really important

102
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,960
in that and other excitatory functions in the brain. And GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitters

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,360
so it shuts down the flow of electric impulses across the brain. What ketamine does is.

104
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,040
And before we do that, so just to give some people some examples, right. So

105
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,840
glutamate is excitatory, GABA is inhibitory. We can give people a sense of like alcohol.

106
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,440
You and I were talking before we started about, you know, GABA analogs that are meant to mimic

107
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,600
alcohol. I mean, what are they doing? Why do people feel relaxed when they drink? It's the

108
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,000
GABA potentiation. When you look at things like benzodiazepines, they're working at GABA.

109
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,120
Right. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, so, and then are there things that we can examples we can give

110
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,160
people that work at glutamate that are amplifying glutamate? We tend to focus more on the opposite,

111
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,720
right? Yeah. So like the mocha genes, the drugs used in seizures tend to reduce the flow of

112
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,800
glutamate in the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. I'm trying to think of examples.

113
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,120
So good question, Peter. Do you know of any? No, I can't think of anything off my head that

114
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,160
would do that. Because again, we normally are thinking of the opposite side of that.

115
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,600
So alcohol increases GABA in the brain and that has the effect of kind of

116
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,280
dumping down your brain activity and reducing things like anxiety and slowing your motor

117
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,080
function and generally inhibiting the flow of electrical impulses across your brain.

118
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,680
And then it's part of the reason why we get the symptoms you get when you stop drinking,

119
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,320
your brain kind of goes into a more hyper. It's like a see-saw, I guess. So the alcohol is being

120
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,280
pushing down on that side and keeping it dampened down. And then you release that and you go into

121
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,480
kind of a more excitatory state. And so you get things like, and, you know, I work a lot with

122
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,920
alcoholics, things from alcohol withdrawals, you can get seizures and the shakes and that's all

123
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:14,440
down to this kind of increase in excitation. So that's why withdrawal from strong GABA

124
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,400
promoters like benzos and ethanol can be fatal if not managed directly. You can't, you know,

125
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,520
it's sort of funny. I think people intuitively sort of know this, right? Like you can stop

126
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,080
opioids immediately and it might be the most painful thing in the world, but it won't be fatal.

127
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,360
Whereas if you take a person who's on a high dose of benzodiazepines or a person who drinks

128
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,520
a lot of alcohol and you stop that abruptly, it actually can be fatal.

129
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,760
And they are the drugs you can die from withdrawal in because of these huge, then increase in

130
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,840
excitation. Cause they get a bit of, you know, repeated alcohol. Your brain gets used to having

131
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,840
all this GABA on boards and then you get adaptation and your brain kind of regulates

132
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,040
to counteract that. And then when you remove it, yeah, you can die from withdrawal. So the people

133
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,320
I work with, you know, severe alcoholics, it's unsafe for them to stop straight away. So they

134
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,400
have to cut down and use things like benzodiazepines and withdrawals. So yeah, it's something that I

135
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,360
think people do think about opiate withdrawal potentially as a really difficult thing. But as

136
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,440
you say, you wouldn't die from that. It's only from withdrawal from these inhibitory substances

137
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,840
like alcohol and benzodiazepines. So, so, so then, so, so, okay. So we have excitatory and

138
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:40,520
inhibitory neurons and the inhibitory neurons, are they the ones where you have like an NMDA receptor

139
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,880
that is sort of globbed on to say a glutamate receptor? Yeah. That's, that's one of the theories

140
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,160
of how ketamine works basically. Well, we were just talking about the neurons.

141
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,280
But you're right. Yes. I'm going exactly to now like different ideas. Cause I think

142
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,880
it's not a hundred percent clear exactly how ketamine works, correct?

143
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:07,480
No, no. And so there's a couple of theories that either ketamine blocks directly, the NMDA receptors

144
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,800
on the glutamate, surging neurons. And then this triggers a kind of downstream cascade or I mean,

145
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,640
there's some evidence and maybe it's a combination of the two. And this was, you know, is that the

146
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,080
ketamine blocks NMDA receptors on these, they're called gabber, jacinta neurons. So they're,

147
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,600
who are gabber receptor neurons that synapse onto your glutamate ones. So they,

148
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,120
they put the brakes on your excitation. So they, they, so if you block an NMDA receptor and a

149
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,080
GABA, urging into neuron, then you're going to have a net effect of increasing glutamate flow

150
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,800
in your presynaptic cells. So they're presynaptic. So yeah, it's not quite clear and it probably is

151
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:54,200
a combination of the two. It's, I think increasingly people have become interested

152
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,760
in the downstream mechanisms really, and potentially in the therapeutic effects of

153
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,960
ketamine, but I expect we'll get to that later. Yeah. So, so again, ketamine is one of these

154
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,320
drugs where the dose kind of makes the poison. I mean, I think that's true of most drugs, but

155
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:17,480
it really has different effects on an individual based on how much they're getting, right? And,

156
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,040
you know, anything from kind of like mild hypnosis to some dissociation to complete,

157
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,880
you know, complete anesthesia. Yeah, absolutely. No, and low doses as well. People, you know,

158
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,520
I worked quite a lot with people who take ketamine non-medically or recreationally and they,

159
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,840
low doses, it's got kind of stimulant properties. And then as the dose increases, you get kind of

160
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,720
just perceptual distortions and illusions and kind of a mild melting. People talk about floating

161
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,320
higher doses. Still you get kind of much more profound, maybe not hallucination, but changes

162
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,960
in the perception of reality and the highest dose you're completely sort of catatonic,

163
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,800
but people are experiencing inside these really, really profound hallucinations. And that's, I

164
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,240
mean, it's, there's really high doses from my work with, you know, non-medical ketamine users that

165
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,520
were actually really dangerous. A couple of people died from taking ketamine, you know,

166
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,200
and then having a bath and they're completely dissociated from reality and they drowned. And

167
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,880
it's like the saddest thing. And it makes you, I think as a user, the ketamine users are very

168
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,200
vulnerable to accidents at these higher doses because you are not completely dissociated from

169
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,640
reality really. Wow. So that's sort of like LSD in the sense where it really has no LD50, meaning

170
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,480
you can't, there's no amount of LSD that you're going to take that is going to create some

171
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,840
physiologic process that kills you the way, for example, Tylenol, acetaminophen, you know,

172
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,480
would, you know, poison your liver at a certain dose. But it's not to say that LSD is completely

173
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,840
safe because you can alter your behavior in a way that is so altered from reality that you put

174
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,320
yourself in harm's way. And you're saying basically, is that the same with ketamine? That if you look

175
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,280
at it from a purely pharmacology standpoint, there's no LD50, given that it doesn't have

176
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,280
respiratory depression and all these other things that we worry about, or how do you think about

177
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,600
that? Yeah, no. I mean, I think there's very few, yeah, it's much the cases I'm not aware of anyone

178
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,400
are getting to like a toxic dose of ketamine. And there are problems with, you know, repeatedly

179
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,520
taking high doses of ketamine, and which have been uncovered in work with abusers, but yeah,

180
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,000
and physiological problems, that ketamine has a direct toxicity on the epithelial, so like the

181
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,240
lining of your bladder, which is really interesting as something that only emerged really with people

182
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,480
using really high doses. But yeah, there's no LD50, like you say, I think it's more how, and much

183
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,680
more so probably even than LSD, where a lot more of your kind of top down higher cognitive functions

184
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,320
are preserved with ketamine, they're not, and you are completely, you know, catatonic, people will

185
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:04,360
be kind of collapsed anesthetized really in a cataleptic state, so much more vulnerable to

186
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,120
accidents and yeah, through that. The drowning in a bathtub example, that seems tragic, and to

187
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:22,040
imagine how dissociated you would have to be to slip into a bathtub, inhale water, and not respond.

188
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,680
Yeah, exactly. You are completely dissociated, and it's really sad, it's someone that I was

189
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,440
working with, and that is not the only example I know of a few case studies or examples of people

190
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,120
who that's happened to, various different accidents. So yes, it's really tragic, as you say.

191
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,600
While we're on the pharmacology, let's talk about the different routes of administration. I assume

192
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,920
that most of the time when it's used medically, it's intravenous?

193
00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:00,120
Yeah, that's most of the studies, certainly in the depression field, and when it's used in

194
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,160
anesthesia, I think people would give it intravenously. It's the best availability

195
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,640
in the most well-characterized route, but yeah, or out, as you say in American.

196
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,600
But there are other ways of administering it, which I think have been increasingly used.

197
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,720
Intramuscular has got quite good availability in the blood, and then there's people starting to

198
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,320
use things like sublingual administrations, they're putting under the tongue. Intranasal,

199
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,720
obviously, is the route popularized by first the drug users themselves, but then patented by

200
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,840
the pharmaceutical company, Janssen, have now used that for their licensed form of ketamine

201
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,760
and depression. Yeah, and those are the main ones, and oral dosing, although that's not as

202
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,040
great in terms of bioavailability, it's obviously an easy way to get a drug over and across into

203
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,400
the system. But yeah, you're right. I think- And there's no liver toxicity with, I know you're

204
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,560
going to have a bad first pass effect, which is why you prefer to put it under your tongue as

205
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,920
opposed to swallow it, but there's no toxicity. It just means you need a higher dose if you're

206
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,120
going to take it orally, presumably. Yeah, I think, I mean, it's not that well

207
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,320
characterized, I don't know whether. I assume people are doing detoxicity studies at the moment,

208
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,840
because I know there's some pharmaceutical companies looking at oral dosing as a potential.

209
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,000
But I think for the purpose of our discussion, we're really thinking about what has been learned

210
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,840
through intravenous and intramuscular and perhaps most recently intranasal.

211
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,600
Yeah, and that's where I made the bulk of the research, is for sure.

212
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,120
Okay. So in the 1970s, when this drug was being used pretty liberally as an anesthetic,

213
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,880
was it unscheduled in the United States? I know now it's a schedule three, so it's a

214
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:49,080
much more regulated compound. But is that- Yeah, I think it only came, when was it in the US,

215
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,840
I think maybe 1996? Yeah, I think it was the late 90s.

216
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,120
It was relatively recent. Yeah, late 90s. 2003, Putin banned it in Russia.

217
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,000
Just banned it altogether. Yeah, even for using humans. And quite an interesting story,

218
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,560
Bridget Bardot, obviously the very attractive French actress, petitioned him to use it in

219
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,160
animals, because it's obviously widely used in veterinary anesthesia. So he removed the

220
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,600
ban for animals, but kept the ban in place for humans, which is pretty horrendous,

221
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,000
considering what an amazing anesthetic is. In the UK, it became, it was 2006. So yeah.

222
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,960
In the UK, it mirrors basically the US regulation around our equivalent of C3.

223
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,200
Yeah, ours is class B, ketamine. So yeah, it's under the misuse of drugs scheduling,

224
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,960
but it's obviously what we could, we scheduled two drugs they use for medical use. But

225
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,000
unlike, I mean, maybe it's something we'll get into, whether you consider ketamine to be a

226
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,480
psychedelic drug, but there's not any other drugs with these kind of type of effects that can be

227
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,160
used medically that are legal. That's right. So in the United States, the other psychedelics,

228
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,600
LSD, psilocybin, and even MDMA, which is not a psychedelic or schedule one, which means

229
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,400
they are not even used, they have no medical use at all. Yeah. And that's, I mean, it's interesting

230
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,200
drug policy wise, right? Because ketamine is the most likely to be abused, I would say, of all of

231
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,920
those compounds. But it's the one that's, you know, legal for medical use. I mean, it has,

232
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,920
as we've said, got an amazing number of medical use ends, but you don't consider MDMA psychedelic.

233
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,960
I mean, I don't think I'm an expert to say, but no, I don't consider MDMA a psychedelic personally.

234
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,160
I sort of put it in the category of an empathogen and, because you don't really have any dissociation

235
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,440
with it, right? You know, it's not altering perception in the way that LSD or psilocybin

236
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,120
would. And your point is an interesting one, right? Which is, you know, schedule one typically

237
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,200
implies no medical use, high potential for addiction. Well, certainly, I think there's

238
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,720
medical use for psilocybin and MDMA, as you said, pretty low potential for abuse. And interestingly,

239
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,720
while ketamine clearly has a high medical use, I want to talk to you about the potential for abuse

240
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,480
as well. I've heard mixed things on this, but what are the data say? How addictive is ketamine

241
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,680
in terms of other things for which we have benchmarks, like, for example, benzodiazepines

242
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,200
and opioids, where we really have a clear sense of the addictive potential of those molecules.

243
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,760
Where does ketamine stack up? Well, I don't know if we have really good data on that,

244
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,880
but I would say, I mean, in terms of physical withdrawals symptoms, I mean, it turns out you

245
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,600
assess the addictive properties, right? So there's the initial high, there's, yeah, and how you

246
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,680
really categorize that. Because I guess I would say, I struggle with things being addictive,

247
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,200
people become addicted to things, but they're also, you know, multifunctional. Coffee's addictive or

248
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,840
whatever. Yeah. But I would say, I mean, we did a study of people that use ketamine, so they're

249
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:08,280
probably at higher potential for abuse. I've found, I say people who use ketamine non-medically,

250
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,800
it's as in what you would say, recreationally. I think about 9% of them had symptoms of some

251
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:23,080
sort of dependence or craving. 9%. 9% of a group of like recreational users of drugs. So I'm finding

252
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,760
that hard to benchmark that against opioids and benzase. I mean, that's, that actually is a bit

253
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,960
lower. So I'll tell you, I mean, the last time I looked at the opioid data and someone listening

254
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,840
to this will probably say, no, that's wrong because I'm going by memory. My memory was about 20%

255
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,840
of opioid users became addicted, but that was prescription based opioid painkillers, right?

256
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,800
That doesn't include heroin where that number might be higher. But of course, you're also pre-selecting

257
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,160
a different subgroup of the population. So it's not really an apples to apples comparison. In other

258
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,880
words, what I'm saying is of 20% of patients who would be prescribed opioids for medical use,

259
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,840
could become addicted, which is a staggering number, right? One in five people who gets an

260
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,280
opioid prescription could go on to abuse them later. So I don't know how much faith to put

261
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,640
in that number because it seems so absurdly high, but it's plausible. And I guess, so the only way

262
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,160
we would really know this, I suppose on an apples to apples basis is you took patients who were

263
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,720
being treated with ketamine for another indication, such as recalcitrant depression. And you ask the

264
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,680
question, how many of those patients would go on to experience dependency, pharmacologic, physiologic

265
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:47,000
dependency? Yeah, yeah. And that we know is, I mean, so far the data suggests is pretty low,

266
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,680
like what's not really seen at all. So we know that a little bit from the trials that have gone

267
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,240
on so far, but it's a really early stage. And I guess if you're doing apples to apples, opioids

268
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,960
is that daily, like, or benzos, I don't know, like frequency, obviously how you're defining addiction

269
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,760
is quite hard because if it's physical withdrawal symptoms, or is it impacting on your everyday

270
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:16,440
functioning, or is it seeking beyond your prescription, day, sesculation? Yes, it's

271
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,080
a tricky one. I mean, I know from having worked with ketamine, people who are addicted to ketamine,

272
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,200
that's a small proportion of people do become addicted. And for those, you know, as we mentioned,

273
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,920
it has these really serious physical consequences of having toxicity on your bladder. You know,

274
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,840
I was working with people, 16 year old girls who've had their bladders have to have a

275
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,120
cystectomy. So you have your bladder removed, and then they're, you know, having to wear a

276
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,320
colostomy bag, really dire consequences. And I think that's quite rare. I was thinking about

277
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,040
other drugs that have got like a direct physiological. So just to make sure I understand,

278
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,200
so these are 16 year old girls that were not using ketamine for medical indications, such as

279
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,320
depression, they became addicted to it recreationally. Yeah. And this was kind of an

280
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,400
epidemic in the UK in the 90s, early 2000s, when we were researching it, because people didn't really

281
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,520
know anything about ketamine. So the nickname was, I mean, I was in medical school in the 90s,

282
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,680
and we learned about it as Special K, right? That's what it was referred to. So now that,

283
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,440
I don't know if that was the San Francisco name, because that's sort of where I was going to school.

284
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,800
And I don't know if it was it called Special K in the UK also? Yeah, I think people called it that.

285
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,560
Some people, you know, it was very, so these people that I was working with were very constrained

286
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,960
subcultures. So we have kind of these travelers, they're like people who live itinerant lives.

287
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,320
I don't know if you have something equivalent in the US. So it was amongst those groups. Some of

288
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,960
them called it kiddie smack, basically saying it's like an addictive drug. It was basically like heroin

289
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,040
for kids. I see. So it's kind of the JV or junior version of heroin, not quite as bad. Yeah. For

290
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,000
those people, but there was zero information about it at the time. And they were not taking

291
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,440
the drug the way it's given, you know, for depression. They were taking grams and grams

292
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,720
of it every day. So these serious, something important to say. And what would they experience?

293
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,440
I mean, grams of this, I will come back and do the math on what that means. But if they're taking

294
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,840
high doses of this stuff daily, were they taking it and then basically passing out in their

295
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:28,440
apartments for hours and just associating on trips? And no, I mean, they would be a dose that

296
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,200
would render someone completely catatonic or septic, which they would just tolerate it.

297
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,920
Because it is the tachyflaxes, it's like a rapidly developing tolerance. And if you do administer

298
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,920
ketamine repeatedly in a short time window, you do need to give higher and higher doses.

299
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,240
I think that's what we felt like with these people, they were going, they were functioning, you know,

300
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,440
walking around on doses that yeah, would floor an elephant or certainly a horse. So yeah,

301
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,400
it's pretty, it's pretty extraordinary. And I think, I do feel, yeah.

302
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,320
So with opioids, we kind of have a sense of what that high is that the person using it is

303
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:15,320
experiencing, right? The mu receptor, when it is, you know, agonized, it produces a very deep high.

304
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:24,200
What is the feeling that that person is getting from those escalating doses of ketamine, even

305
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,000
once they're tachyflactic? What do they say that they're experiencing that is bringing them back to

306
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,680
it? Yeah, it's a really good question. I think it's not one thing. We actually did some research on

307
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,040
this. I think we spoke to about 120 ketamine users doing some interviews of why they took it.

308
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,360
And some of them did. So some of them said very pragmatic things, I think, because it's very cheap.

309
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,080
So things like it's cheap, it gets me really off my head. I think at the escapism of it, you know,

310
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,960
but there is, I mean, there's some mu receptor, there's some slight opioid actions of ketamine,

311
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,240
maybe come on to that, talking about the different isomers of ketamine. But yeah,

312
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,520
so some people are taking it just for the escapism. Some people talk more as we'd see them kind of

313
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,280
psychonauts, but almost addicted to chasing the consciousness and the insights they felt they were

314
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,200
getting. And they were just taking more and more to try and get more insights. I mean, there's some

315
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,520
really high profile examples of that. I don't know if you've heard of John Lilly, who was the

316
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:32,600
kind of neuroscientist based in California. And the film Altered States is about him. And he

317
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,120
did quite a lot of unusual research, you know, giving out acetidolphins. He invented flotation

318
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,840
tanks, I think. And he writes in his book, The Scientist, clearly documents becoming completely

319
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,600
addicted to ketamine, to the extent that he was having an intravenous drip of ketamine, you know,

320
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,440
pretty much 24 hours a day. So he really heavily escalated his days and became kind of psychotic,

321
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:03,640
I think. And we had these revelations and went to tell the president of the, the president of the USA,

322
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,120
about the world being taken over by computers. But yeah, so I mean, it's a really fascinating

323
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,520
book if you're interested in reading an account of ketamine addiction.

324
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,400
And how did that story end for him? What is the?

325
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,360
Well, I think he managed, did he manage to get off of ketamine in the end? I'm trying to remember

326
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,800
this. It's a really good question. I can't remember the end of it. I know there's some sad ends. There

327
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,680
was another book called Journey to the Bright World by someone called Marsha Moore. I think

328
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:37,560
she was an heiress to some, her husband, some kind of fortune. And her husband was an anesthetist and

329
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,880
she experimented with ketamine. So actually quite interesting. They are very different

330
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,720
subjective experiences. They're generally these ones, very machine state, and he's experiencing

331
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,680
these nations very related to being in a computer and hers were very soft and round and going back

332
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:59,880
to the earth. But she sadly, I think, froze to death. She took some ketamine outside. And again,

333
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:07,160
that thing where you are completely dissociated in your, yeah, from your body. And she'd gone

334
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,600
outside one evening and actually froze to death. That's really sad. I mean, they were people taking

335
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:19,800
really high intravenous doses of ketamine. But yes, it's got a rapidly developing tolerance.

336
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,480
And why is it different? So PCP, I'm trying to think, I don't really think I took care of any

337
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,800
patients that were strung out on PCP, but I certainly remember the lore of the drug. And it

338
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,520
struck me as a much more aggressive drug. People that were on PCP, as you alluded to earlier,

339
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,160
they seemed almost bulletproof, right? They'd punch their hand through a glass window,

340
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,920
be unfazed by the fact that they just broke every bone in their hand.

341
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,600
Given that these drugs have such a similarity, why did PCP seem to produce that phenotype? Or

342
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,240
is that just lore and that really wasn't what was happening? Yeah, I think that's lore. I mean,

343
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,040
I think it produced a protracted psychotic state, but some people have likened it. I think they

344
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,720
gave the police nets even to catch people on PCP. There was a lot of kind of police brutality,

345
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,200
these special PCP nets, police brutality associated with PCP and maybe the people taking PCP. Some

346
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:23,960
people have suggested kind of a degree of racism or against kind of people in poverty. So yeah,

347
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't, I've been looked for examples of this kind of bulletproof phenomena and I can't find any

348
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,480
in the literature, certainly. There's definitely examples of people having a protracted sort of

349
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,800
psychotic like symptoms, having hallucinations, having to be hospitalized, but this whole running

350
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:46,760
up piece and the kind of violence aspect, I find hard to imagine. And is PCP still being used? Is

351
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,840
it still a street drug? It's certainly not, it's never really been a street drug in the UK. I'm

352
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,120
not aware there's many reports in the US either. So it's interesting. And it's interesting in the

353
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,760
context of the new use of all these substances. Nobody's really thinking about using PCP, but

354
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,640
maybe that would be something to investigate. So speaking of kind of the resurgence of these

355
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:15,640
drugs, how would you contrast ketamine with psilocybin and LSD? So psilocybin and LSD of course

356
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,120
are much more similar to each other. How does ketamine differ? I mean, obviously it differs in

357
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,080
use case, but do you have other senses of how it produces a different experience? Yeah. I mean,

358
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,960
obviously it has to come to a different action where they work on the 5-HT2A receptor and

359
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,880
ketamine, as we were talking about, works on these kinds of glutamatergic receptors. And there

360
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,680
are some similarities in the acute experience, which is one of kind of people talk about EO

361
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,240
dissolution and ketamine causes that quite profoundly. So you lose your sense of self.

362
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:55,480
And that happens to a degree as well on psilocybin, psilocybin mushrooms and LSD. I think you get

363
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,120
much that you can think more clearly on LSD and psilocybin. Ketamine

364
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,640
impairs some of your higher cognitive functions and causes that kind of analgesia, which is

365
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:12,200
associated with ketamine's got an anxiolytic effect. So even at higher doses, people don't

366
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,760
report anxiety. Whereas, I mean, they can describe things, so some of our patients describe things

367
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:26,360
that sound scary, but they don't feel the kind of physiological anxiety. Whereas, you know,

368
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:32,280
drugs like LSD, psilocybin, people can report being absolutely terrified by the experience.

369
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,800
And I think maybe that's the dissociation that happens more on drugs like ketamine,

370
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,080
where you really have the sense of being separate and everything's kind of emotionally

371
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:49,160
numb, as I guess you'd think with it being an analgesic or an anesthetic.

372
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:55,880
And that might be due to the greater inhibitory effect potentially of ketamine is probably why

373
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,880
you maybe can short circuit some of the anxiety that can definitely happen with LSD and psilocybin

374
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,360
if the setting is a brighter, if the dose is too high.

375
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah. And so that, I mean, it's, and that's probably when you're, we were talking before

376
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,960
about the, you know, the P's potential, maybe why it's got higher B's potential because.

377
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,040
That's right. It has less of a negative feedback loop. I think anybody who's tried the other

378
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:24,680
psychedelics will say, look, if you go back to the well too many times, you can get stung.

379
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,800
Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's unpredictable in that sense. Whereas, ketamine, and that,

380
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,120
if you're looking for kind of escapism, you don't want to escape into absolute terror.

381
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,560
Well, so, all right. So let's, let's talk about depression because I think this is where

382
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,360
people are really becoming interested in ketamine. It's certainly how it came to my attention,

383
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:54,600
seven, eight, maybe nine years ago was, God, I'm trying to think how it was, it was a physician,

384
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,600
friend of mine saying, Hey, I, you know, he was saying he's been prescribing intranasal ketamine

385
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,360
to some of his patients for depression. And I thought, none of this makes sense. Please say

386
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,560
more. And he said, yeah, no, this is, it's perfectly legal. We, you know, I have a compounding

387
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,240
pharmacy and these are the instructions that we give the pharmacy and they give him an intro,

388
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,200
you know, they give the patient an intranasal spray and they use this spray. I forget the

389
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,600
frequency with which it was like one, they were doing it once a week or something was the,

390
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,720
the use case. And at the time, again, this is maybe 10 years ago, I couldn't find a lot of

391
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,000
literature on it. And, and, you know, I found some, and I found some interesting case reports and I

392
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,400
found, I remember there was one study I found based in India that looked pretty interesting.

393
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:49,080
But then I sort of forgot about it until maybe four years ago. And, and I think what brought it

394
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:56,520
back to my attention was frankly the epidemic for lack of a better word of ketamine clinics,

395
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,720
which, which, you know, basically are almost as ubiquitous as Starbucks now. So before we get

396
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,200
into kind of the business of ketamine clinics, I want to just kind of understand where the,

397
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,280
where the idea came from. How was this something that people even thought was, you know,

398
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,280
worth pursuing clinically? And then how does it work? Who does it work in? Who does it not work in?

399
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,160
You know, let's just go down the depression rabbit hole. Sure. Yeah. I mean, that's quite

400
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,760
where it came from is probably either was an early early study in Iran, I think. I mean,

401
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,920
it might even date back to some quite dodgy work by Salvador Bocce. I'm not sure if you've heard of

402
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,520
him. Yeah. He was, he was a, I do want, I do want to compliment you on the use of dodgy. That word

403
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:48,200
cannot ever be overused. So any, anytime you want to just throw in that that's a dodgy scam or

404
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,920
that's just dodgy work, please, please feel free to insert that. Thank you. It's not a very scientific

405
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,000
word, but it belongs here. It belongs here. Okay. Yeah. And he definitely was a dodgy guy.

406
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,520
So there we go. He was a, he was working for the Mexican government actually, I think interrogating

407
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:13,000
people and he took some of the techniques from that, I think, and tried to, he's a psychoanalyst,

408
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,800
kind of psychotherapeutic practice. And he was giving ketamine with other psychedelics to try

409
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,880
and produce changes in people's brain state. But I guess that's probably the first documented cases

410
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,720
of people using ketamine in a kind of psychiatric therapy sense. And this is what, this is in the

411
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:39,000
80s or 90s? No, that was back in the 60s. And yeah, so way back, maybe the 70s, there was this

412
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,960
study out of Iran. But really, yeah, the work that's kind of caused this whole explosion in

413
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,600
ketamine depression research, because I don't think anyone was really watching those areas of

414
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:59,800
research came out of a group at Yale and a guy called Robert Berman, who did an early study in 2000,

415
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:07,640
giving ketamine, a single ketamine infusion to patients with treatment resistant depression.

416
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,520
And they showed this thing, which was kind of groundbreaking and that's,

417
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:20,440
was that you could get this rapid reduction in depressive symptoms, not as traditional SSRIs,

418
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,320
you know, your Prozac's and your traditional antidepressant drugs have got a delayed onset

419
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,560
of action. And it was just kind of accepted that they take two weeks to work. And you know,

420
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,560
there's various ideas of why, but this, these ketamine works immediately. And then people with

421
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,080
treatment resistant depression, this is a mild depression. And tell me how it was administered in

422
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,800
those early studies. Was this, it, that was, yeah, sorry. So that was intravenously.

423
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,960
Intravenous. Okay. And what kind of doses were they using?

424
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,200
That was 0.5 milligrams per kilogram. Yeah. So,

425
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,400
okay. So an 80 kilogram person is getting 40 milligrams intravenous.

426
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,680
Over 40 minutes. Yeah.

427
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,960
Over 40 minutes. So not an IV push, but a pretty quick drip.

428
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,880
Yeah. So pretty quick, like mild dissociation, I would say, from my experience of using different

429
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:13,480
doses and some kind of peripheral subjective changes. So yeah, we've used that dose in acute

430
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:20,760
studies. And then just for reference, what would a recreational drug user who's not completely

431
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:27,320
habituated. So they're not way up the tachyflaxis curve. But if, if, if a recreational person went

432
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,920
to their drug dealer and said, I want some ketamine, cause I want to blast off, what dose

433
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:40,440
would they be given? That's really variable, I'd say, but maybe more on like at least a hundred,

434
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,200
if not 200 milligrams, I would say. Got it. So they're going to be given two and a half to

435
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,960
five times the dose that, and they would blast off with that. They would probably take that.

436
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,800
Yeah. That would be a blast. Yeah.

437
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,800
No, people with intranasal, I think is the typical route for.

438
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:04,200
Okay. And is the bioavailability similar? I'm sure the onset is different with intranasal versus

439
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,440
intravenous versus intramuscular, but does the same amount of drug basically get to you

440
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,000
with each of those routes? Yeah, slightly less than intravenous, obviously the optimal

441
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,320
rate for that. But yeah, it's pretty good way to get it across, which is why it's now been

442
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,560
taken forward as a treatment and depression, I guess. Okay. So, so the, so going back to this

443
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,080
patient that's getting 40 milligrams. It was a higher dose, I would say.

444
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,880
That's a dose that they know something is happening. They're not getting a placebo,

445
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,320
but it's, they're not being blown out of the water. No. I mean, I think it's really variable

446
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,040
through all my work. I guess I must have given them hundreds of people get them in, in research

447
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,320
studies and it is, the response is really variable and not necessarily predicted. So we wait, adjust

448
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,720
all of our doses. So give me the range. What's the, what's the sort of interquartile range? So

449
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,320
there are, are there some people that literally feel nothing at 0.5 Migs per gig?

450
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,920
I don't know that anyone would feel nothing, but maybe feel more like slightly drunk and feel a

451
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,360
bit disoriented. You know, that kind of feeling like intoxicated basically and slightly dissociated.

452
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,200
And at the other end of the spectrum, are there people that are just tripping?

453
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,920
People who are going, you know, people have gone down a canoe in their mother's eardrum,

454
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,960
like doing really weird stuff, like having fine calisthenations basically, like really extreme

455
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,360
responses. And I think, I mean, we can talk about that in a bit. We've found that a little

456
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:28,600
about what predicts that I think now. Tell me, yeah, I'm very curious because I just know myself

457
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:35,800
with any single agent that I've ever ingested in my life, anything that ranges from alcohol to

458
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:45,000
acetaminophen to, to a psychedelic agent. I'm, I need like three times what anybody else needs

459
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,360
to feel it. And I've always been curious as to why. That's incredibly hard to beat.

460
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,040
Now I think, so the things that we, the things that we found out from our research is that people

461
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,480
with a family history of alcohol problems, would they have a greater acute response to ketamine?

462
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,680
They're more sensitive to it.

463
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,600
Yeah. Well, they have a greater, sorry, they're great to response to the therapeutic effects.

464
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,280
They've actually got less of a response to the acute. Sorry, I said that completely wrong.

465
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,840
And what are the other things BMI, which is kind of obvious, I suppose is so higher BMI

466
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,960
body mass index is, um, predictive of a higher acute effect.

467
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,280
Because they're, but that's because they're getting a higher dose.

468
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,520
Yeah. Well, in a way, but then I guess the BMI is, is slightly different. And I

469
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,560
suppose maybe that's something to consider it similar with alcohol, right? Like your

470
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,240
lean muscle versus your fat.

471
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,680
That's not surprising, right? Because it would, because BMI really speaks to how much lean mass

472
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,280
and non lean mass you have. It doesn't really speak to your organs and it certainly doesn't

473
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,320
speak to your brain.

474
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,800
No, no, it doesn't speak to your brain. So no, these are really obvious things. I mean,

475
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,560
this is why we haven't got very far in predicting how people respond. And therapeutically, we know

476
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,880
with depression, the more suicide attempts, people have a better response. So they're more

477
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,440
likely to respond, which probably maybe means they're more severe, I guess. Um, but yeah,

478
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,080
we know not very much at all. Really. There's some kind of,

479
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,560
But so let me ask another question. Does the acute response that you are watching

480
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:25,560
during the call it two or three hours that they're in your chair being administered the

481
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,800
drug, right? Cause it's a 40 minute infusion, presumably it's another couple of hours while

482
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,040
they're under the effect of the drug. We call that the acute response. Is that predictive

483
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,240
of what you're really after, which is the, um, the abatement of depression?

484
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,800
Yeah, that's a really good question. I think the field is pretty divided.

485
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:52,280
So the way that the acute effects have typically been measured is with a scale called the clinician

486
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,760
administered dissociative state scale, which basically looks at dissociation, but it was

487
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,960
designed to look at dissociation from people having flashbacks from traumatic experiences.

488
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,560
And so it asked some questions that are relevant for ketamine, but some

489
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,480
than not. So it's like, are things moving into the emotion? Have colors changed? Um,

490
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,520
do you have a sense of forgetting chunks of what have happened? A lot of it is relevant, but

491
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,960
people have looked at other aspects of the acute experience. So with these dissociative effects,

492
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,000
some studies, I'd say about 25% find they predict, predict the therapeutic effects.

493
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,720
We've actually done a systematic review on this, um, but the others don't. And so I think there's a,

494
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,520
this is maybe, but I think in general psychiatry, there's a feeling that these

495
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,120
acute effects are a nuisance and that we need to find, there's a whole, you know,

496
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,160
research effort has been devoted to finding drugs that don't have these acute effects, um,

497
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:57,160
with kind of limited success. Um, so I don't know. I think, and actually when you look into the data,

498
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,080
people who use a bit more nuanced ways of looking at the acute effects. So there's some scales that

499
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,240
look at some of the bit more, I guess you'd say trippy effects and things like mystical

500
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,720
experiences in the sense that you can't explain the experience that's gone on. And those do seem

501
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:15,240
to predict. So it's quite interesting. Wow. First of all, I mean, to just try to unpack that

502
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:21,400
it's not crystal clear that the person who's sitting there feeling slightly drunk is going

503
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,120
to have a lesser outcome or a greater outcome than the person who's on the canoe in their mum's,

504
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:34,840
you know, station tube, right? So the second point I would extract from what you said is

505
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:42,200
we're probably using too crude an instrument to try to tease out exactly what effects in the

506
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:49,960
acute phase matter. And it's either because we don't know what questions to ask them in that

507
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:56,920
window, or we're not doing our analysis on a fine enough gradation of symptoms. Is that

508
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,000
a fair assessment? Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Basically, I think we need,

509
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:08,520
you know, maybe a finer, more nuanced understanding of the effects. So we're doing some stuff now,

510
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,320
just recording what people say and getting them to describe it and then using artificial

511
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,920
intelligence kind of machine learning algorithms to find patterns in that to see if that might

512
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,080
predict it. Because I mean, that seems like a, you know, a bit of a no brainer now that we've got

513
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:29,400
quite a long way with just using natural language to predict outcomes. By the way, does ketamine

514
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,760
produce amnesia? Yeah, it's got some amnesia, but people can't remember the experience. It's not

515
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:43,000
as, so you might forget aspects of what's happened and it's an impairs your episodic memory, but

516
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,640
people do remember the experience. So we do interviews with people about the salient points

517
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,600
of the experience they'll remember. But I guess it's through a bit more of a fuzzy haze than maybe

518
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:59,160
your classic psychedelics. So a bit less accessible, I would say. The patient then,

519
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,000
let's say after you've done this, the patient wakes up and it's three hours later or wakes

520
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,280
up as the wrong word, but the patient sort of returns back to their baseline state. Do they

521
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:16,840
immediately feel the alleviation of the depression? Is that how quickly it can onset? People can feel

522
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:22,520
just, yeah, quite considerably better. A colleague of mine, we put McChane, he set up the first NHS

523
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,040
treatment resistant depression clinic here in the UK and he likened it to the film Awakenings,

524
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,760
which is actually about Parkinson's. But these people are really severely depressed, they often

525
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,800
can't get off bed and that they suddenly come alive. Some people, not everyone responds to it,

526
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:45,480
but yeah, that is pretty rapid and people just feel a kind of sense of clarity, a bit more

527
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,760
interest in the world, I would say. Almost like you're able to detect novelty where you went before

528
00:48:50,760 --> 00:49:00,600
you know your attention. Yeah, it's quite a great thing to see. What is the mean and median duration

529
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:09,480
of how long that lasts? Well, yeah, that's again a really good question. Is around, I think people say,

530
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,960
I mean, and again, it's really variable and obviously some people don't respond at all,

531
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,080
so it's important to say that. What fraction do not respond at all? I don't think we have a good

532
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,480
handle on it basically. We need more real world data because if you look at people in trials,

533
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:31,800
it's often very different. I think it's around maybe I would say like 50, 50, 60%. Oh my god,

534
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:37,000
I had no clue it was that high. So you're saying just call it 50%, half the people that go through,

535
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,480
so half the people that show up with completely treatment resistant depression

536
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:47,240
and go through this experience under the well controlled setting of the lab in a clinical trial.

537
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,880
Have no benefit from it. Yeah, I think that's what's happened over time. So the early studies,

538
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,240
like Carlos Arrate study, you know, it was 75% and this typically happens with any new treatment,

539
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,360
I think. As more and more studies come out, the rates of response reduce. So yeah,

540
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,840
I would say, I mean, maybe I'm being overly conservative. So I should probably have that

541
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:19,000
figure to hand. But I will say, I think the duration is probably about, you know, two days

542
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,640
to a week often. And some people have longer will have two weeks. But that's the bit where my

543
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,720
research comes in really, because we've been looking at how you might extend that response.

544
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:35,000
And that's something that does seem to be coming out now. If you give it alongside psychological

545
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,680
therapy of some kind, you can really extend the response of the to ketamine and the antidepressant

546
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:47,720
effects, as well as the my child's been looking at ketamine in the treatment of alcohol. But we found

547
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,720
still reductions in drinking six months following just three infusions. So

548
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:01,720
how far did you space those three infusions? Oh, they were between either a week or kind of up to

549
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:08,280
two weeks, probably on average between them with seven sessions of psychological therapy. So quite

550
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,200
a limited treatment program, really. So let's go back to this, because this is sort of interesting,

551
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:19,000
right? So we would say, let's say 50% of people that show up and let's define treatment resistant

552
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,560
depression for somebody. It's not defined by duration, is it? No, it's not responding to it.

553
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,600
So and it's very nice to tricky one, because it's defined differently depending on different trials,

554
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,760
often we would define it as not responding to two conventional antidepressants

555
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,880
in the current depressive episode, or having had multiple different treatments. But yeah,

556
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:49,080
so it's not defined as treatment. But there have been some people taking more conservative definition

557
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:55,080
of that to have maybe three failed responses. So it is pretty variable in the trials.

558
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,680
And depression requires at least two weeks of the set of symptoms that we typically associate

559
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:07,960
with depression. And would it be classified as depression if there is an obvious externality? So

560
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,280
loss of a child, you know, if your child died, and a month later, you can't get out of bed,

561
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,640
is that considered depression? I mean, what I mean by that is like, how does that get classified,

562
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:25,000
given that there's such a clear explanation for the why? Yeah, I think, I mean, if that continues

563
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,080
for a really prolonged period of time, but then even that in itself is maybe contentious, because I

564
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,520
guess, but yeah, there's a clear boundary between, you know, grief, what's your anticipate from grief

565
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:42,440
and natural sadness, and then depression. So let's keep this one sort of simple and say that this is

566
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:48,280
not something that's clearly associated to a trigger such as grief, but instead, less

567
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,560
obvious to explain form of depression. It's been going on for at least a couple of weeks, let's

568
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,440
make it interesting and say it's been going on for months, so that this person has gone through

569
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:07,400
one SSRI, they've taken it to a therapeutic dose, they've had no benefit. They've then progressed

570
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,800
and moved to a different SSRI or a different class of drug in SNRI or something like that.

571
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:19,560
And similarly, they're just not getting the benefit. Does it matter if, do we sort of assess

572
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:26,360
how much psychotherapy they've been doing at the same time? It depends on the, I mean, I'm just

573
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,600
thinking about the clinical trials, all the reasons we give for prescribing off label

574
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,960
ketamine here in the UK. And typically, it would be the antidepressants, like not responding to

575
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,000
antidepressants. But yeah, you could say failed response to CBT. I mean, that's happened in,

576
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,360
in a lot of the trials, they would have non-responders to CBT. I know particularly some

577
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:51,480
of the psilocybin studies, but that's cognitive behavioral therapy. Yeah. Okay. So, so now the

578
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,760
person comes in and again, we've just said 50% of those people are not going to respond.

579
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,280
And that's pretty sad. So what are we saying to those 50% of people? It's, we, we, we're going to

580
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,520
go back to trying more and more conventional therapies, or do we say we should try this again

581
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,080
and maybe the second time we use a higher dose or something like that? Yeah, because some people,

582
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:16,920
there's some evidence that people take maybe three, this is in depression. Maybe we'll take,

583
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:23,720
might not respond to actually three ketamine doses, but maybe the fourth one,

584
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,440
they, there's some evidence that having an extra beyond three doses might increase the response.

585
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,400
I mean, certainly the unlabeled ketamine, which is this bravato, this is the Janssen

586
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,320
version of ketamine, which is intranasal. And that's indicated, you know, for repeated dosing.

587
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,760
So you start out twice, weekly, I think it's for a month and then move to weekly.

588
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,040
And what they're finding with the long-term studies is that people are staying on the dose.

589
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,480
I think it was an idea that people might, you know, progress off or drop down to,

590
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:03,080
I think they dropped down to fortnightly, but they're staying on it for a number of years now,

591
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:08,520
I think is the kind of long-term data. So it is a maintenance.

592
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,480
So the plan is to keep people on ketamine or like, let's go back to somebody who responded.

593
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,880
So let's go back to a patient whose depression is profound and they've been through all the

594
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:26,840
treatments and nothing's worked. They do their first ketamine infusion and they feel remarkably

595
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:33,240
better and it lasts four days. And then all of a sudden the depression sets back in.

596
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:40,200
Is the thinking that we're going to repeat this treatment and get longer and longer periods of

597
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:49,400
benefit, during which time we can work more on psychotherapy to try to, you know,

598
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,000
wean off the need for ketamine?

599
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,440
Yeah. I mean, that would be my thinking and that some people's thinking, I think,

600
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:04,040
is that targeting the therapy during that time is really important if you don't want to keep

601
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,680
someone on ketamine as a maintenance dose.

602
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,880
By the way, do patients need to stop their traditional antidepressants when they are

603
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,200
coming to these trials? So if the patients, because most of them are probably on SSRIs

604
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,640
and not doing well, do you at least get to keep them on that?

605
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,840
Yeah. I mean, we, in our trial, we were our funding buddy, which is the like,

606
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,160
the UK state didn't want us to include people on SSRIs, but actually most of the studies,

607
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,960
the depression studies, people are still on them and there's no interaction. So it's not like some

608
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,080
of the other novel substances like psilocybin where you'd, because it's working in a completely

609
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,600
different way in the brain. So there's no sense.

610
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,040
So why wouldn't this work?

611
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,400
You probably wouldn't be responding to them, I guess. Sorry.

612
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,000
What do you think is the mechanism of action?

613
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:54,040
Oh yeah. So I mean, that's where I think potentially the therapy and targeting the

614
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,240
therapy is really important. I mean, people have talked about ketamine and

615
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:04,280
indeed the other psychedelics, the psychopathic gens. I'm not sure about the term, but maybe the

616
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,800
idea that they provoked this kind of cascade and the study showing they increase synaptic

617
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:15,320
plasticity in the prefrontal cortex was certainly ketamine does. So increases the growth of new

618
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:21,800
synapses and dendrites on, so basically the ability of the brain to form new connections.

619
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:30,040
And that is correlated with the antidepressant effect. And so we kind of want to, we're doing

620
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,640
some work at the moment to sort of chart the time cause of that in humans by looking at EEG. So

621
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,800
that's kind of electrical signals from the brain and trying to target the window of this synaptic

622
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,520
plasticity. Because we know from animal studies, this might be kind of starting four hours following

623
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:52,120
the ketamine dose peaking about 24 hours. So it just sort of track the antidepressant effects,

624
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,520
which is quite interesting. I think the idea, you know, from me as a psychologist is that you could

625
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,960
time your psychological therapy when your brain is most plastic and is able to learn new things.

626
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,600
And we know actually, you know, this kind of plasticity is impaired across a whole range of

627
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,920
like sort of psychiatric disorders. So not just depression, but also an alcohol

628
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:19,240
and addiction and trauma. So actually still be able to stimulate the brain. So it's kind of

629
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:24,840
learn new things that, well, it's really plastic than actually giving some psychological therapy

630
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:31,000
that uses that process because we know that's what we're asking people to do really in psychological

631
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,480
therapy is to think definitely about things, learn new ways of thinking about old problems.

632
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,920
So yeah, that's, that's to me, it seems like an intuitively appealing mechanism. I mean,

633
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,600
there's some problems with it and that neuroplasticity happens from all sorts of things.

634
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:50,440
So some might argue, you know, is this like specific enough as a process? Other drugs

635
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:55,400
produce neuroplasticity that we wouldn't say were necessarily potential treatments for mental

636
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,640
health problems and psychiatric disorders. So you need to find out more about it. Well,

637
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:05,400
like cocaine. So people say the neuroplasticity produced from cocaine is used, is why it becomes

638
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,960
addictive. Like there's this kind of stimulation of that from an acute cocaine dose. So I don't

639
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,200
think we need to find out a bit more about it. And maybe it's down to something really specific

640
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:20,280
and neurobiological. So I leave that to my kind of preclinical researchers. But yeah, it's

641
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,800
fascinating. Now, when you think about, when you think about things like MDMA and psilocybin,

642
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,080
the real, a lot of the therapy takes place well under the influence of the drug,

643
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:38,680
whether it be for PTSD or depression. Is that happening also with ketamine when that patient is

644
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,120
in the aftermath of the infusion? Or is that, are they basically just left alone during that

645
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,640
period of time and the psychotherapy takes place immediately following, you know, the next day and

646
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,960
the next day and the next day trying to take advantage of them being less dysthymic?

647
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:01,000
Yeah. I mean, in our work, certainly, we wouldn't be trying to do any therapy

648
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,320
under the influence of ketamine. I think people would see the associated, you know,

649
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:12,920
the memory impaired. To me, that's, I know there are some ketamine therapists who do use this,

650
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,640
what's called kind of psycholytic approach, to where you use mild doses to be able to

651
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,600
do some therapeutic process. There's a really interesting study actually from a guy, where is

652
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:29,720
he? In Texas, I think, like in one of the VAs, I would have some correspondence with him. He's

653
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:35,880
actually looking at complex PTSD, which is, you know, really severe multiple traumas. And he was

654
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,440
treating complex regional pains and drain on top of that. So these are really traumatized people

655
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:48,520
who've got like really severe pain. And he was giving continuous, quite low dose. I can't exactly

656
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:56,040
have my fingertips, the dose, but ketamine over 96 hours. So continuous infusion. And he was doing

657
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:03,240
very kind of basic psychological therapy during that time and found massive reductions in, you

658
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,280
know, CAPS score, which is a long measure of PTSD symptoms. I mean, it was a really small study,

659
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,040
but I thought that was quite interesting approach. But no, to answer your question,

660
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,280
we do the therapy outside of that. And I think most people with ketamine do do that. I think

661
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,160
really with psilocybin as well, even people would argue what you're doing in that, when they're

662
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,560
having the acute experience is really just supporting them. Yeah. Yeah. That's fair. And

663
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,800
then it's the integration afterwards where we see it. Yeah. Well, there's a very little

664
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,480
research on what integration is or what the key fundamental is kind of accepted that this thing

665
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:42,440
that you have to do, but I don't know. We're kind of lacking research from that side. And what do

666
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:49,080
we know about the brain under the influence of ketamine? I mean, have people done FMRI or FDG

667
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,360
PET and kind of looked at either the metabolic state of the brain or the activity of the brain?

668
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,320
I mean, you've obviously mentioned the prefrontal cortex, but can we get even more granular than

669
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:05,240
that? Are there certain sections of the PFC that are more active than others? Yeah. There's quite

670
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:10,680
a lot of very interesting work. So there's the kind of, I guess, as you'd imagine, the default

671
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:16,760
mode network, which is, you know, being the- Tell folks what the default mode network is.

672
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,840
It's very important. It's basically what happens in your brain when you're not doing

673
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:27,320
anything active. So when you're in a scanner and we don't give anyone anything to do, then that's a

674
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:32,120
resting state scan. And you look at how the brain networks connect. So people say it's kind of,

675
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:37,720
yeah, the task, the kind of background activity of the brain and have likened it to things like

676
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,960
rumination, which we know are important in depression, which is like where you repetitively

677
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,840
think about something. You can have positive rumination as well. Repetitively think about

678
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:52,120
something good, but repetitively thinking about something bad or kind of mind wandering. So that's

679
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:58,200
where the default mode network has been kind of shown to be disrupted following psychedelics.

680
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,960
So this kind of background, normal kind of chatter of your brain and also similarly with things like

681
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,560
mindfulness. So there's been studies looking at that. We mentioned the prefrontal cortex. There's

682
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:12,440
some really interesting studies looking at prediction error signaling. So the idea that your

683
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,920
brain is basically like making predictions all the time about the world. And that's how we

684
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:22,280
understand everything perception. We know that there's like whatever behind your computer screen,

685
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:27,320
there's a world behind that. I would predict that if I put my laptop screen down and found there was

686
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:33,080
a gap in reality, then I'd have like a massive shock of surprise because that would signal to

687
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:37,800
my brain that I had to learn something new. So every time a prediction that we make based on our

688
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:43,480
learning is violated, then you get this increase in learning and attention and activity in your brain.

689
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,200
And there's some work that Ketamine basically disrupts. There's a bit of the

690
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,920
towards the lateral prefrontal cortex, those sort of in your prefrontal cortex, but a bit back and a

691
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,560
bit to the side. And that's really associated with this prediction error processing. And that's

692
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,000
disrupted with Ketamine. So things that aren't surprising become surprising. The things that

693
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,600
shouldn't be surprising and are completely predictable and things that aren't predictable

694
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:12,600
are no longer surprising. So basically kind of noisy signal that I think it's just quite an

695
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,320
interesting way of understanding maybe the subjective experiences from a lot of these

696
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:22,280
drugs that you turn off some of that kind of forward prediction from the brain and make a kind

697
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:27,320
of a noisier signal. So I think that's quite interesting way to think about the subjective

698
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:33,400
experiences. But yeah, I mean, there's quite a lot of neuroimaging work being done. Yeah,

699
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,600
we've done some of it as well, looking at kind of hippocampal function.

700
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,200
And is the brain hypermetabolic under the influence of Ketamine?

701
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:48,440
I think the idea is that there's more kind of more hypo in some ways. So get an increase in

702
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:55,320
sort of prefrontal glutamate. And we know that as well, because you get attenuated. So

703
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,160
and an increase in kind of prefrontal function. But then there's, yeah, so I don't know that that's

704
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:07,960
particularly clear, I guess. And the neuroimaging, as I've done it as a as a method in the past,

705
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:16,840
is not my area of expertise. So yeah. How many patients do you think, when relieved of their

706
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:25,000
depression during these Ketamine trips, will need to stay on Ketamine as a long term treatment? And

707
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,520
if so, at what frequency? Yeah, so I think that's what's really frustrating in a way is that there's

708
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,920
all of these Ketamine clinics, as you mentioned, that sprung up all across the US. We don't really

709
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:42,680
have that in the UK because we have a state health care system. So in the UK, any patient who is

710
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:48,760
receiving Ketamine for depression is doing it through the NHS. It's paid for by the NHS.

711
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:55,400
There's a couple of private clinics now that have sprung up, giving Ketamine. I'm involved with one

712
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:01,560
actually. But there's, it's mainly there's five centers prescribing on the NHS, but it's all

713
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:10,520
off label. Because our state health care regulator have not recommended yet Spravato, which is the

714
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:16,360
kind of intranasal Ketamine for use. And so there's no licensed Ketamine for depression.

715
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,760
So it's all prescribed for treatment resistant depression.

716
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,840
But if the physician prescribes it off label, is it paid for still by NHS?

717
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:31,080
Yeah, in some of these clinics, yeah, that have sprung up. Yeah, so there's maybe five of those

718
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:36,440
at the moment. But yeah, I think potentially there's a lot of data out there that we could

719
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:41,080
be looking at, but we don't have a good registry of all the patients. So we don't, I think in

720
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,520
answer to your question, yeah, there'll be a number of people that probably might respond.

721
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,560
And we don't know what, in all of these clinics, my sense is that not everyone has treatment

722
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,280
resistant depression, I think, particularly in the US has been given for a wide range of indications.

723
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,520
I mean, my guess in looking at the way it's being done in the US is there is no indication.

724
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,760
The only indication is, do you want to pay for it?

725
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:08,840
Yeah. And that's really, I mean, that's a bit, I guess there's kind of worrying signs there.

726
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,920
Although, but yeah, I mean, that's why I think it would be amazing if we could have a kind of

727
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,520
international registry way and we could look at, and then we could look up this data. We'd have

728
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:25,080
the data to be able to say, you know, with this presentation, how long someone would likely be on

729
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:32,200
ketamine. Because speaking from the trials data is one thing, but actually it's already being given

730
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:38,040
out there, you know, for like you say, for all manner of things. So it's a shame, because I think

731
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:43,560
those data would be really helpful. And also it would add a level of kind of safety potentially

732
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:50,280
for the patients and for the clinicians. I know there's a couple of case reports of people

733
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,320
going across state lines, ketamine seeking. I don't think it's a huge problem because,

734
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:00,280
I mean, but we don't know, right? So we must be mindful of the potential of these things.

735
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,440
I've seen some slightly worrying trends recently, but I'll organize a ketamine conference with some

736
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:12,440
colleagues, some of them from the US. And we had a few pharmaceutical companies coming in and

737
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:19,560
developing ketamine for all daily dosing. And to me, that's a bit of a worry having worked,

738
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,280
you know, for 10 years researching ketamine users, because I feel like even if you're using very low

739
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:29,880
all daily dosing, you're going to have to dose escalate, right? So where's the end point? And

740
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,680
if you aren't giving it in a sport of therapy, because the idea that people are just on ketamine

741
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:39,480
all the time, I don't know, to me it seems a bit worrying. Maybe there's something I'm missing

742
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,000
about the drug development pathway there, but. No, no, I don't. I mean, I'm going to just take

743
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,160
the skeptics point of view on that. I don't think you're missing anything. I think it's a land grab

744
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:55,720
for a greater profit motive without enormous consideration for the downside. You know, so,

745
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,800
so I mean, I would, I would share your, I don't know what it is about ketamine that has me

746
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:11,480
sort of cautious. And maybe it's just the anecdotes and that's a bad, that's a bad frame. But

747
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:19,480
you know, it just, do you, is there, this is going to sound really silly, but do you, do you have a

748
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,480
sense, have you ever seen people with these sort of ketamine eyes, like these sort of sunken,

749
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:29,400
distant, like this person has taken too much ketamine in their life and their brain doesn't work

750
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,000
as well anymore? And I think you can have that with, I'm sure there are lots of different drugs

751
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,280
that can produce that phenotype. I'm sure somebody that's taken far too much cocaine can experience

752
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:44,280
something, but, but, but it, I think it has, it's something that you see more commonly, I would

753
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:49,560
assume with ketamine than you would with LSD or psilocybin, because as you said, the frequency of

754
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:57,080
use is much harder with those other drugs. Like no one is going to, I mean, I shouldn't say no one.

755
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:05,240
Someone can do anything, but it's far less likely that a person is going to take heroic doses

756
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:12,040
of LSD or psilocybin over and over and over again. Whereas you could get down that path with ketamine.

757
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,320
And again, it's just anecdotal, but you know, you see some of these people where

758
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,760
you, you get the concern. It's not just the bladder. I mean, the cystitis is a very obvious

759
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:29,480
and tangible objective side effect that can be devastating. This is much more subtle. It's just,

760
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:34,760
something's changed in that person's brain and it's not for the better. So am I just sort of

761
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:40,840
making this up and it's possible I am and that I'm just over extrapolating from something else,

762
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:46,040
but have you, you've been around this more than almost anyone. Do you have a concern around that?

763
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,320
Yeah, no, we've done a lot of studies on that as well. And I guess maybe, I don't know,

764
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,200
we haven't studied that, sunken eyes. But we have lids and brains.

765
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,520
Yeah. And it's not, I mean, it sounds silly to say it. It's not physically sunken, right? Like,

766
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,400
like you would with hypothyroidism. It's just, it's a vacancy is more what I'm describing.

767
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,800
Yeah. I kind of dullness. And I mean, I guess like any addiction, one thing I noticed,

768
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,280
and again, anecdotally, it was just like a lack of, you know, when people lose their sense of humor

769
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,840
and that seems to be like a thing in addiction, it's like the spark has gone out of life,

770
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:20,440
which is odd, right? Because what we're giving ketamine for, this is quite a paradoxical drug

771
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:24,760
in depression is to like put the spark back. But then it makes sense you do it too much. And maybe

772
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:29,320
that spark has gone. And we found that, you know, cognitively, we found cognitive impairments and

773
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:36,520
with planning. And we found actually reductions in, you know, your hippocampus, which is involved in

774
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:43,640
processing novelty and encoding memories. And that's the function of that is reduced in some

775
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,720
of our brain imaging studies with people who, these are people who take daily heavy doses of

776
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:53,720
ketamine. So I'm not saying even your non-medical recreational user, which show this kind of symptoms

777
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:58,360
to people who take it occasionally, but yeah, really, really, really heavy doses. I think that's

778
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:06,200
possible. I don't know because seeing the way that it's administered in clinics, I mean, originally

779
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:11,080
it was not never really the idea of it as a rapid acting antidepressant. And I think the promise

780
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:15,640
was that it's not a maintenance medication, you know, and how empowering that is for patients

781
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:21,320
to not be on a daily medication. And that's why I feel a bit sad that there's not more research

782
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,280
effort going into looking at enhancing the antidepressant effect with therapy. So we don't

783
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:30,360
have to give people hundreds of doses of ketamine. And maybe some people will just need that. And

784
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,920
that's a cost benefit analysis, I guess, you make when you're prescribing any drug, you know,

785
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,320
because these, some of these people, you know, this is life threatening, right? Like people who

786
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,920
are really heavily suicide or say, has anyone done that study where you, because that's the closest

787
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,800
way to get to a quality adjusted life year analysis, which is going to be that cost benefit

788
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:56,840
analysis. Has anyone taken that group of patients who are the most treatment resistant and randomize

789
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,800
them to continuing to try to treat even though it's resistant versus ketamine and looking at

790
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:07,480
really hard outcomes like differences in suicide rate? These people have definitely done work with

791
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,280
patients with suicidal ideation. Yeah. And you get reduced mortality with ketamine. So I guess,

792
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,800
and they have randomized people, which is, I mean, these are tough studies to do, right?

793
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,320
Yeah, of course. They're ethically difficult as well when you know that you have a treatment.

794
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:27,400
Yeah, really, really difficult. And so just, you know, amazing. Just, yeah, amazing. And all of the

795
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,680
researchers doing that work because it's so important. So what does your intuition say is

796
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:42,600
probably the sweet spot for what the intermittent, you know, call it transient but fixed use of

797
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:50,440
ketamine is as a bridge to go from completely treatment resistant to depression to treatable

798
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:57,000
depression. Well, yeah, I mean, I guess my work's been with people with addictions. So maybe I

799
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,200
could talk about that because I feel, you know, more able to speak just from our data. But there

800
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:09,720
we used, as I was saying, like these three doses and seven. Three doses separated by seven days

801
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:15,880
each? Yeah, seven days to two weeks. And then that was a 0.8 milligrams per kilogram. So it's

802
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:21,400
quite a slightly higher dose than in depression because you get a sort of cross tolerance with

803
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:28,040
alcohol. Because alcohol also works on the same receptors ketamine at high doses so that, you know,

804
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:33,320
when people get really intoxicated and feel like they're spinning out, that's kind of your alcohol

805
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:39,720
working on your NMD receptors. So yeah, we use that three doses. And these, I mean, people with

806
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:45,080
alcohol problems have depression as well and can be quite severely treatment resistant. What we found,

807
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:51,480
I think is interesting, is we were still seeing impacts on like reductions in rumination,

808
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:56,840
which are meant that repetitive negative thinking and reductions in anhedonia, which is a hallmark

809
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:02,680
of depression, but also across multiple disorders. And that's an inability to experience pleasure in

810
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:09,560
the world. And so we saw reductions in that at three months, but they were back to baseline at

811
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,920
six months, whereas they were still showing reductions in drinking, which is, I thought,

812
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:17,400
is really interesting. So they might suggest like, certainly in depression, that maybe that

813
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,920
would be the time, you know, so you have maybe weekly or fortnightly days.

814
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,000
Yeah, because to me, that model makes a bit more sense. If you could say, look,

815
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:34,040
this is a treatment that, you know, you need to do once a quarter, you know, every three months,

816
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:40,280
you know, so you have a loading phase where you do the infusion weekly for three or four weeks,

817
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:45,400
and then you're on to kind of a quarterly schedule. That to me is very interesting.

818
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,760
What's less interesting to me, and what I'm seeing certain people do, is

819
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:59,400
twice a week ketamine infusion for life. I mean, that strikes me as, you know, I just worry about

820
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:08,360
the toxicity of the drug. And B, it would have to really have an enormous efficacy to justify, it

821
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:14,360
seems. And I look at the short term studies where they're comparing ketamine to Versed,

822
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,160
like it's not that much better, not that Versed is a good option, by the way, but, you know,

823
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:24,600
when you're using Versed as a control, and you're seeing, well, basically that's telling you there's

824
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,240
a pretty big placebo effect from doing this as well.

825
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,920
No, exactly. I think it was put on. Well, I mean, that's my intuition as well, is that

826
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:38,840
this is a positive thing if we're maintaining people on this twice weekly, you know, for life.

827
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:44,440
So tell me why you think it's working in addiction, and do you primarily work in alcohol addiction,

828
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:49,000
or do you also look at opioid addiction? We want to look at opioid addiction as well. And actually,

829
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,120
there's some other work going on in the US looking at opioid addiction. And this work dates back to

830
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:02,840
some work by a Russian psychiatrist of Jenny Kropitsky, who did work with heronatics and found

831
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:09,160
a similar, you know, dosing regime, which was just three infusions with this psychological

832
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:15,720
therapy around it, produced reductions in herone use at 12 months, you know, quite significant.

833
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,680
Do you know how much? How much of a reduction?

834
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,640
I know in alcohols, there's a 40% reduction in relapse rate.

835
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,120
At 12 months?

836
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,840
In these Russian, at 12 months, yeah.

837
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:29,320
And what's the control group, which I assume is doing, is the control group

838
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:33,800
doing pharmacotherapy or behavioral therapy, such as 12 step program?

839
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,360
I mean, for context, this is in the 80s in Russia, they were inpatient alcoholics.

840
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,880
And so they were in lock towards. So I remember saying to have Jenny, did anyone drop out?

841
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,920
So they can't drop out. They're locked in. So I think it wasn't in the normal consent and ethics

842
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:53,960
process as we have now. But still, a really important study in both groups had 100 people in.

843
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,480
And so and it wasn't, you know, it wasn't a randomized control trial.

844
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,800
He asked people if they wanted to be in this ketamine and psychotherapy group.

845
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,480
So I'm sorry, I'm just trying to understand the trial. You have an inpatient trial,

846
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:11,480
where all the patients are given trial, in quotes. This would constitute a dodgy trial.

847
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,160
Yeah, this is dodgy.

848
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,760
So it's inpatient and they're all given unlimited access to alcohol.

849
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,320
But they're no, no, no, no, no, no, they're not.

850
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,280
So how do we know how do we know what the relapse rate is?

851
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,240
So they do they had to do their detox. They get given their ketamine treatment,

852
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,360
they're discharged. And then when followed up at.

853
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,920
Oh, I see. So they're out. They behave as outpatients, but they're not allowed to drop out.

854
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,400
In other words, if you drop out the KGB, bring you back.

855
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,000
Yeah, they can drop out of the treatment. I was what I was asking him about was like,

856
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,400
do people tolerate the treatment? Well, they just did the treatment.

857
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,040
Yeah, I got it.

858
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:51,080
Sorry, no. They didn't get like shot by the KGB. No.

859
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:51,400
Yeah.

860
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:56,280
Yeah. So they're really important studies. So yeah, I've only asked people if they wanted to have this.

861
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:00,760
It was kind of like groups, like a dynamics, like therapy with just three infusions of

862
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:07,960
ketamine. He was using higher doses. So around an intramuscular to one to two milligrams per

863
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:12,200
kilogram. So yeah, quite strong.

864
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:18,600
So but we haven't done the head to head of ketamine plus behavioral therapy versus

865
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,000
pharmacologic plus behavioral therapy for alcohol.

866
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:31,880
No, we haven't. I've done Katzman plus therapy plus compared to Katzman with a kind of therapy

867
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:37,480
control. Yes. Compared to placebo and therapy compared to placebo. So I did a four arm trial.

868
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,880
Okay. So tell us about that. Tell us about that trial.

869
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:45,320
Oh, yes. That's the one that I mean, it's been so yeah, what we found, I mean, which was great,

870
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:49,240
because that's what we hypothesized. And that's quite rare. I wasn't expecting to get what we

871
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:57,160
hoped for was that we saw the strongest, greatest reductions in drinking and and greatest abstinence

872
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:05,880
in our ketamine and therapy group. It's 86% abstinent at rates at six months. And then

873
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:11,640
the second best effect was in our ketamine and education controls. We wanted to look at the

874
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,880
effects of therapy, ketamine within and without therapy, but there's really non-specific effects

875
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:21,560
of just spending hours with a therapist. Yes. It's quite nice. So we would put the kind of we

876
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,280
concocted this. I mean, it's a bit like medication management, which is used in a lot of the US trials.

877
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:33,240
So tell me about what that's a that's a very elegant trial design, because you get away from

878
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:39,160
what's called the performance bias of the therapy, right? The therapy itself, you have to make sure

879
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,560
you're you're controlling for just the fact that an hour, three times a week, they have to go talk

880
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,280
to somebody. And so the question is, what so tell me what they do in the education arm of that?

881
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,720
Yeah, so we wanted so that we wanted it to be I mean, it's not blind, right? I think for most

882
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:58,040
people, but some people thought they'd had the therapy. So that's quite positive. Because you

883
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,640
can't that's another issue is that you can't be blind. It's like therapy. But

884
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,400
and people were doing kind of calculations about alcohol, talking about how alcohol affects the

885
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:12,200
body. And we did some relaxation. But just as we thought as a bare minimum of what we wanted to do

886
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:17,800
with people going into like a ketamine session, you know, a ketamine infusion was to have a bit

887
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:23,240
of a relaxation and control. So I think maybe the relaxation helps with the blinding. But yeah,

888
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:27,800
no, we were pleased with the design. I mean, and then did for the non ketamine group, did they get

889
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,920
Versed or what type of control do they get? What's the placebo?

890
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:35,640
The same. So they were they got no, they got they just got saline basically.

891
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,560
Also no dissociative effects.

892
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:43,560
No, I know, which is a bit of a shame. In retrospect, we should have used something

893
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:52,040
like midazolam or the DIO of you know, but we just use the saline placebo. So it's I mean, we

894
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,880
never the last.

895
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:58,440
So it's a it's a but it's still a very elegant two by two study, perhaps only limited by the

896
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:04,920
fact that the control didn't get some sort of active substance. Yeah. But nevertheless, at 12

897
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,960
months or sorry, at six months, you said that the double positive group double positive meaning

898
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:16,120
ketamine plus actual psychotherapy dedicated towards alcohol reduction. Did you say 86%

899
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,640
were still alcohol free at six months?

900
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:25,160
Abstinence rates. Yeah, which is good really. I mean, we were really impressed. And then there was

901
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,680
and then what about the other three groups?

902
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:31,320
The response were quite good in all of the groups, but it was statistically significantly

903
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:37,640
different. So that's, you know, what we care about. So there was a small, I mean, it was 96

904
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:43,000
patients. It didn't feel like a small trial. It was only 24 patients per arm. So we weren't

905
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:48,840
powered for the really for the full interaction. But actually, we're taking it forward now into

906
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,200
phase three with 280 patients. So that's good. Again, funded by the UK state, which is great.

907
01:22:54,200 --> 01:23:00,280
So we get to run it in NHS settings and hopefully see it as a medicine, you know, in those in those

908
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:07,560
contexts, because one thing, I mean, I don't know what you think of the psychedelics world, but and

909
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:13,480
I think some of the therapies are amazing. But for our state healthcare system, those things are

910
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:18,360
not ever going to happen. You're never going to have two therapists for 40 hours, you know.

911
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:22,360
So I wanted to come up with a therapy that was deliverable in our state healthcare system,

912
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:28,600
because, you know, I mean, there's certainly it's a great idea that you could do have that kind of

913
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:34,360
system. But we've got we have had we've got these kind of slightly lower level trained therapists,

914
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,080
and there's a lot of them in the NHS here. And so we designed our therapy to be quite

915
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:44,040
manualized so that they could deliver it. And it take a short amount of time.

916
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,160
So how much therapy how much therapy were they getting in the active?

917
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,680
They get about only about in total about 11 hours.

918
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,360
In six months?

919
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,560
Yeah, so they just get they get it for the treatment part. And I do think that, you know,

920
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,400
like, so just in those in those first three weeks or two weeks when they're getting

921
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,040
it's three doses separated by seven days.

922
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:11,560
Yeah, for a total so they have a therapy session before their infusion immediately before. And so

923
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,560
if they were in the therapy group, they would be doing kind of mindfulness practice. And then

924
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,040
in the education group, there's some relaxation, and then they have the ketamine session.

925
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,360
And then they just recover, you know, as you went from an anesthetic, and they go home,

926
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,720
come back the next day where we think the peak of that,

927
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,160
and the kind of synaptic plasticity effects are and they have another note. So these are

928
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:39,000
longer sessions of an hour and a half therapy. And they so it's kind of a ketamine infusion

929
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,760
sandwich between two therapy sessions. And they repeat that three times.

930
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:47,720
What is the therapist talking about? I don't really know much about alcohol addiction. But

931
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:53,080
so so when like in particular, when that patient comes in the day after their first ketamine

932
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:58,600
infusion, when they're, as you said, at their maximum neuroplasticity, what I mean, I assume

933
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:04,920
the therapist has a very clear playbook for how they want to work with that patient in that

934
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,040
90 minute block, what what's in that playbook?

935
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:13,240
And think some of it's very pragmatic, you know, things like what are your most risky

936
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:19,080
situations for drinking, like trying to preempt situations where they might relax, but some of it's

937
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:23,000
more about how you want to live your life and the values you want to embody.

938
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:29,080
So trying to think about, give out your life without alcohol, how would you structure that?

939
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,680
And there's some yeah, things about thinking about your thinking around drinking, which is

940
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:37,880
more kind of cognitive behavioral therapy based, what are your thinking biases, let's identify

941
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:43,080
those and then planning. So they have quite a lot of activities to do in the week or weeks in between

942
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:48,760
the sessions, you know, what I guess like standard homeworks, but planning their days, generally

943
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:54,680
keeping track of those things, we teach kind of mindfulness techniques to enable people to deal

944
01:25:54,680 --> 01:26:02,120
with cravings and to get a bit more of a space between them and their kind of addictive impulses.

945
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:06,760
See, there's a whole range of stuff really, we through the book of the evidence based therapies

946
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:11,560
out there. And so it's very, oh, sorry, go ahead. Yeah, no, no, no, no, you go ahead.

947
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,480
No, no, I was just gonna ask you, tell me about the inclusion criteria. I mean, obviously,

948
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:21,000
you're dealing with a patient who's motivated who says I want to stop drinking. And then they

949
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
actually come and do a pre infusion therapy session. Is there anything that in that session,

950
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:32,200
the therapist says, we're not going to include this patient? Like, is there is there another

951
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:36,760
decision that's made of a go no go based on that pre infusion session?

952
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:43,000
Well, the go no goes normally made before that. So they had to go through like a number of

953
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,200
screenings basically to get as is with a clinical trial, which is kind of a problem with clinical

954
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,960
trials that we end up with quite pure populations. But we needed people to be abstinent when they

955
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,720
started. As we were talking about right at the beginning, you know, with a lot of people who

956
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:01,800
are drinking, they can't stop straight away. So they either need to go through a medical detox,

957
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,840
in most cases, or, you know, supervised, most of those are in the community now. So you can

958
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:12,520
work with people's health care providers to support them as they're doing that. So we keep

959
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,240
checking in with them until they're ready to start. So normally, maybe two weeks after if

960
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:21,720
they've done a full detox, if someone's drinking really heavily, but we're at levels that we think,

961
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:26,120
you know, we can help them support them cut down over a four week period, we would do that. So

962
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:31,560
there'd normally be a kind of pre screening where we check all the medical contraindications for

963
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:37,240
people and psychiatric ones. So we don't include people with psychosis or psychosis in a first

964
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:41,960
degree relative. People with uncontrolled blood pressure because of ketamine increasing,

965
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:46,680
your like, so uncontrolled hypertension, because ketamine increases your blood pressure and a

966
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:53,640
variety of other things. We would exclude people from the study. And then we have to access kind

967
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:57,800
of their medical notes. And so yeah, it's quite a process. But the main bit is getting people

968
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,920
abstinent. And so when so this all the therapy is all around like, you know, supporting people

969
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:07,880
with a new life and giving using the ketamine experience really, to get that perspective,

970
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:14,680
perspective they might not have had for a while, that kind of new perspective, to think about

971
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:21,960
their life in a new way, and try and focus on how they want to go forward, really. So it's really

972
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:26,600
using the ketamine as a catalyst for the therapy, rather than purely focusing on the pharmacological

973
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:32,200
properties of it. And remind me how much does blood pressure go up in that type of a therapy

974
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:37,160
when you're at 0.8 megs per Kig? What's the increase in systolic and diasolic blood pressure?

975
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:42,680
I don't know. It really varies. So some people are really minimal. Some people like goes up about 10,

976
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:51,800
I guess. I'm trying to think. As a psychologist, I guess, we have an eutectist there for the whole

977
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,400
thing. So they're probably checking that. And there was someone, we had to stop the infusion

978
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:03,080
because it went above, I think it went over 180. So, but that was, that's pretty rare. And that's,

979
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:07,960
you know, why we do exclude people. But they're my eutectist colleagues say, you know, if we're

980
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:13,720
people in theatre, we just give them ketamine, the perspective of this. They're quite, you know,

981
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:18,040
I guess, because of the way, an eutectist are the people that kill you, right? Ultimately,

982
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:23,560
if all of the medical professionals do want to, they're quite, yeah, desensitized, I guess,

983
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:29,880
to risk. Whereas we're like, oh. Right. So again, tell me what the response rate was in the double

984
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:35,240
negative group. So the group that didn't get the ketamine and only got the education, but without

985
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:41,400
therapy, what was their six month? And was like, still, I mean, really high, so about six, just

986
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:48,040
68%, I think. What do you attribute that to? So that means there's a 20% difference between the

987
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:58,440
two extremes, which is still great. But how do you attribute a 68% non-drink or an abstinence rate

988
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:03,160
in people that didn't get ketamine and didn't really even get therapy? They just

989
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:11,880
sat down and talked with somebody about alcohol, biochemistry. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and it is not,

990
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:17,400
I think that was pretty extraordinary for any good child. And we did have a really lovely team,

991
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,760
so I partly put it down to that. I think, you know, it's something you see in clinical trials,

992
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:25,640
people just do better. A, because they've gone through this whole rigmarole process with this

993
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:30,680
really strong intention to stop, you know, so they've been through quite a lot of hurdles that

994
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,920
the trial was pretty demanding. So, you know, if you start with it, we also had things which I

995
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:39,240
had mentioned, like, we had a SCRAM. I don't know if you've ever seen them. They're using criminal

996
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:46,120
justice. More Lindsay Lohan had to wear one when she had some DUIs. It's basically like a tag that

997
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:52,280
you put around your ankle that measures your alcohol through transdermally because you're

998
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:57,240
excrete about 1% of alcohol and sweat. So there were things that we were using to measure alcohol

999
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:00,920
that might have actually acted as an intervention on their own. And you know, the fact that you have

1000
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:06,440
to go over, it wasn't, now we're using a much more discreet wearable, right? But then this really

1001
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:10,680
clunky thing, you know, you had to say, you're not going to do swimming for six months, you know,

1002
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:15,880
all these things. I think that in itself was an intervention. Yeah. But also just be, you know,

1003
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,920
a lot of these people don't have a lot of social connections. Some of them did. But the fact of

1004
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:25,240
having people looking after them, checking in on them all the time, you know, repeatedly measuring,

1005
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:29,160
like people just showing you general human kindness, I think can have obviously a really

1006
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:33,880
positive effect in a group that might be quite isolated. Yeah. I mean, that's amazing. I mean,

1007
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:38,920
I think these are really kind of staggering insights because you have everything from the

1008
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:46,600
monitoring of compliance to just the interaction. I don't say any of this to diminish the

1009
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:52,920
fascination I have in both two components of this, one being the effect of the ketamine and

1010
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:59,640
therapy producing 88% abstinence at six months, but also just looking at the control group and

1011
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:05,080
realizing it didn't take much to move the needle. And what can we learn from that sort of more big

1012
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:11,480
picture? It's a bit of a sad statement. It really is. Yeah. I think alcohol services here in the UK

1013
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:17,160
are just so dysfunctional at the moment. You have to, you know, people by the time they get to any

1014
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:23,080
sort of treatment, people that are really seriously complexly, you know, with multiple

1015
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:27,160
health problems, well, people have been through multiple treatments and they've not worked. I

1016
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:31,480
don't know. And it's really hard to access therapists. It's like multiple things. It's

1017
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,760
like, oh yeah, it's really sad. It doesn't actually take that much to shift something

1018
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:41,560
that's pretty entrenched, you know? Well, the other thing too is it makes me wonder about

1019
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,480
less responsive cohorts down the line where you would expect the response rate to be lower. But

1020
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:53,000
let's say you took an individual who's less interested in not drinking. You know, I mean,

1021
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,400
I don't think you could treat someone who says I'm going to keep drinking, but someone who maybe

1022
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:02,280
hasn't fully hit rock bottom but says, you know, yeah, maybe I'm drinking too much. And yeah,

1023
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:08,520
I probably meet the criteria for being an alcoholic, but I haven't destroyed my life yet.

1024
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:13,720
You know, I just sort of wonder if you have these places for earlier intervention as someone is

1025
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:21,320
on the path towards, you know, really destructive alcoholism. So a lot's here. So in the phase three,

1026
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,720
obviously you said 200 plus patients, so that's going to be great. You're still going to do the

1027
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:31,080
same four arms? Well, actually, I mean, it's funded by the NIH at the department for health

1028
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:37,720
here. So we've gone down to take the two most extreme arms. Ideally, I mean, in an ideal world

1029
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,200
of infinite resource, I would definitely have the four arms because I really like that design. And

1030
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:46,440
I think something that's really missing from the broader psychedelics world is teasing apart the

1031
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:53,320
impact of the therapy and the drug. But I think we felt speaking to clinicians, so we've got like a

1032
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:58,680
patient advocacy group involved from the start that actually given potentially the, you know,

1033
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,760
some of the risks with ketamine that we wouldn't really want to give it without a therapeutic

1034
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:08,920
container. So having found these promising effects for this efficacy study, which is more

1035
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:13,640
of a definitive study, then we would just take the most extreme arms. But yeah, so we're looking

1036
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:19,720
just with the therapy and then, you know, the various other more discrete variables compared to

1037
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:28,360
our placebo, but we're using a low dose ketamine this time instead to manage expectancy.

1038
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:33,640
So what will that low dose be? Will the high dose still be 0.8 mg per kilogram?

1039
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:38,760
Yeah. And the low dose is low, like 0.05. We're sort of working out with some piloting.

1040
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:47,160
But. And why is that? Because at point, at not 0.5, they will, or 0.05, actually, they'll

1041
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:52,120
experience nothing. I mean, they shouldn't feel anything. Yeah. Not really anything. We've done

1042
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:58,440
some other studies and studies with morphine and childhood trauma, say looking at people's,

1043
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:03,000
you know, I mean, it's a completely different area of research, but looking at how childhood

1044
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,120
trauma seems to sensitize the brain to the, to respond to opiates. And there we found actually

1045
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:13,480
using a very low dose morphine was kind of a better control than another drug. So I think it

1046
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:17,320
is actually helpful in expectancy. So you tell people you're getting it, you're getting the drug.

1047
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:25,480
Then also because we had patients actually drop out because well, because they thought, you know,

1048
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,920
they knew that they hadn't got the ketamine and they hadn't got the active. So we're saying you're

1049
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:33,320
getting one of two doses of ketamine. It's kind of easier to maintain people in that.

1050
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:38,280
The other thing is you might be able to recruit some KGB officers to help with that,

1051
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:45,000
that dropout rate. Exactly. No one drops out. So we're not doing any dodgy stuff.

1052
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:55,320
This is not, this is a non dodgy trial. So what's your, what's your, there's one other thing I want

1053
01:35:55,320 --> 01:36:00,120
to talk about before we, we, we, we, we wrap this up. So I want to, but I want to sort of put a bow

1054
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:10,520
on the ketamine story. What would you say to people here in the U S right? So we're, we're

1055
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:17,320
ketamine clinics are ubiquitous. And as far as I can tell, I think you can just walk into them.

1056
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:21,480
I don't think you need a referral. I don't think you need a medical referral to go to a ketamine

1057
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:26,920
clinic. Although I think there are therapists who do make referrals and say, look, this is a

1058
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:32,520
reputable clinic. And I'm sure that there are many reputable clinics and, you know, your

1059
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:38,920
depression is recalcitrant or, you know, you're having this problem in your life and I think it

1060
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:44,360
could get better here. So, so I suspect that there's a really good conduit of therapists

1061
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:49,560
sending patients appropriately to good ketamine clinics, but let's also posit that anybody can

1062
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:55,560
walk into a ketamine clinic, which I really do believe is true. And sort of tell the persons

1063
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:00,680
there, Hey, I'm having this issue. I want to do it. But there's a bit of a conflict in that model

1064
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:06,280
because when you walk into the clinic, they're in sort of incentivized to do what they do, right?

1065
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,480
When you're a hammer, everything's a nail. When you're a ketamine clinic, you're incentivized to

1066
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:18,840
give ketamine. How would you caution people around ketamine use liberally in that context?

1067
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:25,000
I suppose I'd say that it's the evidence, you know, that we've gathered and not just us. There's

1068
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:30,920
another group at Yale, Sam Wilkinson has looked at, you know, therapy and ketamine. And there's

1069
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:36,600
another trial starting in depression is that actually it's a bit of a waste. If you just,

1070
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:42,120
if you just do the ketamine, you should certainly try it embedded within therapy and you probably

1071
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:46,520
don't need, you know, all of those doses. I think interrogating what you're trying to get out of that

1072
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:51,160
experience and that actually, you know, I think it's, it's, that's great to hear that therapists

1073
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:56,120
refer people to ketamine clinics, like we've got so far with therapy, then we're going to use this

1074
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:02,280
as a boost so we can continue the therapy. To me, that just seems much more appealing model

1075
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:06,360
because really do people want to, I don't think people want to be kind of stuck on a drug, even

1076
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:11,480
if you're not, you know, addicted, but you're going in twice a week or even once a week, like

1077
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:17,240
that's so disempowering for patients. We know that, right? And speaking to patients, one of the things

1078
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:21,400
they said was great about there are treatment approaches, you know, rather than being on daily

1079
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:25,640
meds, things like other treatments in alcohol, like the campus that you have to take three times a

1080
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:30,440
day, they feel pretty liberated, you know, and they know they're doing the healing themselves,

1081
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:35,000
which I think is a really important part of the process. So I'd say, yeah, get kind of,

1082
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,120
get a therapist, think about using a really minimal number of doses. I mean, I do,

1083
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:45,640
yeah, it's, it's worrying. There's some really worrying practices that you hear about, you know,

1084
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:51,240
some mail order ketamine clinics. I don't really worry about them from the abuse side. Maybe I'm

1085
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:56,360
wrong not to, but just because it's so expensive, I think, unless you're, you know, you have to have

1086
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:03,240
a lot of money to be able to afford that ketamine. But I just think it works unsafe because if it's

1087
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:07,400
certain, you don't take ketamine at home when you're not supervised, you know, this drug makes

1088
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:12,040
you completely dissociated from your environment. If you, if something happens, there's a fire or,

1089
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:17,160
and all sorts of things could happen. You can't take it unsupervised, but I think that's a lack of

1090
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:24,600
kind of clinical care and supervision in some of these models. Yeah, I find that really worrying,

1091
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:30,280
but it's expensive as well. So you sort of answered what my next question was going to be,

1092
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:36,920
which was not at all to say, do you condone the use of, of, of non-medical or recreational ketamine,

1093
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:42,760
but more to say if someone is going to use ketamine recreationally, what, what is the,

1094
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:48,120
what is the instruction set you provide them to make sure that they don't harm themselves

1095
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:53,560
psychologically and physically? So one of them is, if I'm just going to extrapolate, it's like,

1096
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:58,200
if people are going to do ketamine recreationally, there really needs to be somebody around watching

1097
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:02,840
them, right? You can't, you can't trust yourself to be under the influence of this drug, at least

1098
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:07,560
at a high dose, which I'm guessing based on what we've said is, you know, depending on your size,

1099
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:11,960
a hundred to 200 milligrams would be considered a high dose. Yeah, really high. And I think, you

1100
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:16,040
know, start with any small doses and I guess is the advice that you would always give to people

1101
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,640
with any non-medical use of a drug. Yeah. And do it in a, you know, a safe place with someone who's

1102
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:27,560
not under the influence of any substances and start with a small dose. But yeah, I mean,

1103
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:34,920
it's not, I don't know so much them in the US. You rarely get ketamine, particularly cut with

1104
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:38,520
other things, but it can happen. So there's something to be careful of as well.

1105
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,400
Wow. That's interesting. What would it typically be cut with?

1106
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:47,160
I don't know. I mean, there are ketamine analogs, which people have shown. So there's a drug

1107
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:52,520
methyl acetamin. So they're the kind of research chemicals that have come out of labs in China,

1108
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:59,080
Israel. So it's an analog of ketamine, but it's got studies of shame, more toxicity of the bladder

1109
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:06,200
and slightly maybe higher abuse potential. But yeah, typically, I mean, I, yeah, I don't,

1110
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:11,560
I don't think it's, it's normally particularly cut with things, but it's something to be mindful of

1111
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:16,760
and why it's really important to take a small dose, you know, but ideally, yeah, obviously,

1112
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:23,080
I think caution may not medically use. Well, Celia, that's, I mean, this is super interesting.

1113
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:28,920
I mean, this is, I've sort of been deliberately sort of ignorant of ketamine. I don't know why

1114
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,480
I've sort of gone down the rabbit hole and trying to understand as much as possible about these other

1115
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:38,920
agents, which ironically are tend to be the one that are schedule one and therefore not really

1116
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,480
readily available for clinical use outside of trials. We do have many clinical trials here

1117
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:47,080
in the United States looking at in particular, the use of psilocybin and MDMA.

1118
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:53,400
But, but ketamine has been a bit of a black box to me and yet it's the one that I probably have

1119
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:59,720
seen the most people use because of course it can be used legally. So I found this discussion

1120
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:06,040
very helpful. I found this discussion really insightful and it sort of clarified for me

1121
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:11,880
a lot of the use case, the neurobiology, the risks and perhaps most importantly, what the

1122
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:17,880
promise of this agent is. So I want to thank you for your time. And again, I know it's late there

1123
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,800
in the UK at the moment and more importantly, I think thank you for the work you're doing. This is

1124
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:39,720
really fascinating and I kind of love the model. Oh, thanks for having me, Peter.
