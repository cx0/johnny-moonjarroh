00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,720
today's episode. I guess this week is Senator Bill Frist. Senator Frist is a former transplant

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,320
surgeon. He's a pilot, though we don't even get into that in this episode. It's just a whole other

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,560
amazing story. Obviously, a politician, businessman, healthcare policy expert. He's truly a Renaissance

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,680
man, as you'll see. He graduated from Princeton and Harvard Medical School, went on to study at

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,960
Stanford where he learned transplant surgery from the pioneering transplant surgeon of our era,

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,800
Norman Shumway, before heading over to Vanderbilt where he created the largest transplant program

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,120
east of the Mississippi. He did that till the early 90s when he up and ran for the US Senate

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,880
in 1994, having never held public office before. And perhaps even more remarkably than that,

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,600
he was elected as the 18th Senate Majority Leader in 2002, taking him from the single least senior

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,160
person in the US Senate to the most senior person. We spend a lot of time talking about his journey

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,280
through medicine and ultimately 12 years in the Senate through some of the difficult policy

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,560
decisions and the controversial decisions that were made. Since leaving the Senate in 2006,

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,800
Bill has done a number of things. He sits on the board of more not-for-profits, for-profit

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,400
companies than you can count on, probably spent a decade really focused on private equity before

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,200
now shifting his attention to more venture-based funding. He also hosts a podcast called A Second

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,560
Opinion. And we get into about two thirds of what I had wanted to get into here. That's how

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,720
much I wanted to talk about, but it's really a remarkable discussion. And one of the most

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,000
interesting things about Bill that we do touch on here is that in 2005, he effectively called

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the pandemic. He really laid it out through his experience in studying HIV and creating policy

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,480
around HIV. He was an instrumental part of PEPFAR, which we talk about as well. And also his

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,040
experience with the anthrax scare post 9-11. And he basically looked at these examples coupled with

30
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,680
what he saw on a lot of his travel to Africa, which he had done as a physician and basically said,

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,560
look, it's not going to be a question of if we have a major pandemic, it's a question of when.

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,160
And these were the things that needed to be in place. And these are the likely things that are

33
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,880
going to happen. And unfortunately, a lot of those things came true and we weren't really ready. So

34
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,760
we spend a little bit of time on that. And finally, we talk a little bit about just the current state

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,080
of politics. And even though this isn't a podcast about politics, I think most people in the current

36
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,880
environment can't help but acknowledging that we're in a bit of a strange environment. And we talk a

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,560
little bit about his optimism as to how things might get better in the future. So without further

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,600
delay, please enjoy my conversation with Senator Bill Frist.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:46,040
Bill, thank you so much for making time to sit down with me. I know today was,

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,320
you had a lot of things going on in your personal life. So I appreciate that we didn't

41
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,920
reschedule this, but it would have totally been understood if we needed to.

42
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,880
Great to be with you, Peter.

43
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,720
By the way, it feels weird calling you Bill. I always feel like I need to call you Senator Frist,

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,560
but the first time we spoke, you were adamant that I call you Bill. So I'll tell you a funny

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,520
story. When I left residency, I had such a hard time not calling people Mr. So-and-so,

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,400
just because you talked to your patients that way, right? Like Mr. Jones, Mrs. Smith,

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,960
we're here to talk about this. And then when I got out in the real world, people were like,

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,720
you can just call people by their first name. Was that a difficult transition for you?

49
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,520
You know, there's two things come to mind. Number one, the most common thing I get,

50
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,280
do you get called Senator or doctor? People who want to be formal. And of course, I say,

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,280
Bill, but that is a harder one because in the Senate, especially today, people have kind of

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:43,000
down on the respect world and doctor is still pretty much up there. So I say, well, doctor,

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,880
but you're supposed to call a senator, et cetera, et cetera. But then I remember going to Mass

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,320
General up in Boston, being from Nashville, Tennessee, and being from Nashville, I called

55
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,240
everybody out of respect, Mr. If they were four years older than me, and it may sound crazy to

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,520
a lot of people. Listen, that's just sort of the Southern way of doing it. And I remember going

57
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,760
down and working with a cardiac surgeon and right in the middle of the case, I said, yes, sir.

58
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,040
And you're not supposed to say, sir, either. It's kind of like the Mr. And then he turned around

59
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,120
and he said, don't you ever, ever say, sir, to me again. It just depends on where you are.

60
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,680
You're exactly right. At what point did you realize growing up that you wanted to be a doctor,

61
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,080
let alone a surgeon? You know, I had a real sort of fortunate circumstance. And then I was last to

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:37,080
five children. And my dad was a family practitioner, a doctor. And my older brother, who was 15 years

63
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,880
older than me, went into medicine. So he was a doctor. My middle brother ended up going on the

64
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:49,240
cardiac surgery. So he was in this track. And so I pretty much assumed I would go into medicine or

65
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,640
nursing or the healing profession from very early on for that reason. I saw the gratification. I saw

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,480
the way when dad would come home at night, what he would talk about in terms of healing and giving

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,560
people hope. So that was just always stuck in my mind. And I thought about other things. And when

68
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,640
I jumped up to college, I majored in public and international affairs. And so when I tried other

69
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,680
things, I always came right back to the healing profession in some shape or form.

70
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,280
So when you were an undergrad, you were not a pre-med. And Princeton is pretty well known for

71
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,240
international affairs and things. So you were kind of in the epicenter of where one would go to

72
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,760
study such things. But that didn't sway you from medicine. Did it plant a seed that ultimately

73
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,160
there would be more for you to do then medicine? You know, in high school and in the early years

74
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:50,440
of college, I interned in Washington, DC, for Congressman Joe Evans from Tennessee at the time.

75
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,240
I spent a summer writing for a newspaper, the Nashville banner, no longer a daily newspaper

76
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:02,680
here in Nashville. So throughout, it was always being interested in the broader aspects of medicine,

77
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,760
of being a doctor. And I had no idea, and I didn't have any master plan with it. But I guess at every

78
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,040
stage, and now that I look back, it gets reflected in my life that I always had other parallel

79
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,040
interests going on. And as you probably know, and recall, I'm a little older than you are,

80
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,000
it wasn't all that popular at the time when you were in medical school to have these other

81
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,680
interests. You know, to basically say, well, I want to go write an op-ed on some technology

82
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,800
when your professor is sitting there of medicine. And basically, the only thing in the world is

83
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,400
medicine. So it was always challenging. And not being in a pre-med track at Princeton,

84
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,200
but still wanting to go to medical school, even the medical schools had a little bit of bias about

85
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,880
coming in at that time, very different today, if you didn't demonstrate working in a lab and

86
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,640
all those other pre-med track things in those college years. And so what was it like for you?

87
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Mass General obviously is one of the pillars of American medicine. If my memory serves me correctly,

88
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,360
isn't Mass General the second oldest hospital in the United States, or is it the third oldest?

89
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,960
Yeah. I don't know, but it's there in the tradition and is all there as well.

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,120
And so you've got this Northeast training, and then you go way out West for training in

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,680
cardiac surgery. What was that experience like back? This would have been early 80s that you

92
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,720
went out to Stanford?

93
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,760
Early 80s, and it's actually interesting in many ways, mainly in retrospect, of course, but I went

94
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,800
to Harvard Medical School, and then I did the six years at Mass General and did my cardiac

95
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,040
fellowship at Mass General. But when I was just entering that fellowship, it was fascinating

96
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:48,680
from an ethical standpoint that the community there had decided with the board of trustees of

97
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,920
the hospital that they were not going to do heart transplants. And you know, I'd kind of stayed at

98
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,760
Mass General because they'd done the early kidney transplant work in America there, had great

99
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,520
immunologists, and then I was, you know, 10 years into this, and then all of a sudden the board of

100
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:13,000
trustees and the broader community said it's too experimental. It hasn't proven itself. We can

101
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,120
vaccinate a million people, I'm exaggerating a little bit, for the cost of one transplant,

102
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,720
and therefore they put a moratorium.

103
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,960
Now, what was the mortality at that time? Because Bernard's first heart transplant was in 67?

104
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,880
66, 67 was when Christian Bernard down in South Africa did the first transplant, and then after

105
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,440
that there were a hundred done in Texas, and then most of those patients died, so it was kind of

106
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,040
shut down. And what was happening with Shumway at the time? What was he doing in the 70s?

107
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:51,400
Another fascinating story, and Norman Shumway, who was my mentor at Stanford at the time,

108
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,480
was really outside of the mainstream of cardiac surgeons, and you know this, but again bringing

109
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,040
our listeners in a little bit. He had worked diligently for about 10 years in the laboratory,

110
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,760
figuring out this heart transplant world, systematically with discipline, not taking

111
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,120
it to people until they figured out the science. And then Christian Bernard came in, he watched a

112
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,200
little bit of this, he was from South Africa, and more in an opportunist way, he said, well,

113
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,120
it looks like Shumway's figured it out, so I'm going to go back to South Africa and do it. And so

114
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,320
he did it. Shumway, from that mid-60s to when I got involved in the early 80s, systematically had

115
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,360
a program where other programs would do a hundred or fifty or thirty, like out in Texas, and then

116
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,560
they would just leave it totally because the patients died. Well, Shumway would ask the

117
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,320
question, why are they dying? He would figure it out, so he was doing about 10 a year,

118
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,320
or 15 a year, and figured out the science, so with the immunology of it, the cardiac biopsies,

119
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,320
the instruments of it, and in a very deliberate way. And I tell that long story because it really

120
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,200
had a huge impact on me that the science is really fundamental. It's important. Until you

121
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,400
get the science right, you should not be taking this to the clinical world. Know the facts, get

122
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,120
rid of the misinformation, do clinical trials, don't prematurely take things to the field.

123
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,520
And so at Mass General, they saw a 50 percent mortality, very expensive procedure of this

124
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,680
moving hearts around and the immunology and the equipment that was required. And they said the

125
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,120
greatest good for the most people is to not do heart transplants at Mass General, or Peter

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,720
Bent Brigham, or Beth Israel, or Boston City. To me, from my perspective, I said,

127
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,280
are you kidding me? You know, we have the opportunity to, in a very ethical way, figure out

128
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,080
heart transplantation in a way that can save hundreds of thousands of lives. If you don't

129
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,680
get a heart transplant, you die within six months. If you get it, you can live 10, 15, 20, 30 years.

130
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,320
People I transplanted, you know, 28 years ago were still alive here in Nashville and around the

131
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,200
country. So I got fed, I didn't get fed up. I did get fed up. But instead of staying at Mass

132
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,280
General, I said, I'm going to California to train with this one person in America who systematically

133
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,080
had spent 20 years developing heart transplantation and continue to do that

134
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,400
because the overall field, the overall heart transplant world continues to evolve.

135
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,280
I mean, to me, it's just such an amazing story within medicine to go back to the first transplants

136
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,240
within kidney and then to look at heart. And in some ways, liver was almost the most ridiculous

137
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,400
of them in terms of the complexity of it. You know, I don't know if you have like a bucket list

138
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,400
of people you wish you could have met or interviewed who are no longer alive. And I'm sure you probably

139
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,280
met Thomas Starzell, but if I think about people I wish I could have met, Thomas Starzell would be

140
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,920
very high on that list. I don't know if you ever read his book Puzzle People, but I can't recommend

141
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,880
it highly enough to people who love stories about the history of medicine. To me, it is,

142
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:08,520
it sounds so much like what you described Shumway doing, which is systematically in the face of

143
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,320
nonstop failure, watching, you know, bad outcome after bad outcome after bad outcome, but in patients

144
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,360
for whom there is no other choice. I mean, there is no such thing as an extracorporeal liver.

145
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,520
So if a person is in liver failure, they are going to die. There is no temporizing measure.

146
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,920
And I don't remember the numbers because it's been so long since I read it, even for the second time,

147
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,400
it's a book I've read twice. But I, one thing that stuck with me when I read it, which is,

148
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,480
one is the belief that you have to have that this is going to get better.

149
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,680
And two, just the personality trait that says I'm not going to get broken by short term failure

150
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,400
after failure after failure, because I'm seeing some other progress and whether it is,

151
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,440
look, we're making strides in immunology because back in the early eighties, what was your two,

152
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,600
what was your immunosuppressive regimen? I mean, prednisone and, and MMP, I mean,

153
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,240
what you didn't have much. Well, and it comes back and we're seeing it today with today's

154
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,920
technology, which is even moving faster, but these great breakthroughs, which require this

155
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,360
deliberate thinking in the spite of these challenges that seem insurmountable, there were

156
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,560
technological mechanical ones like doing a cardiac biopsy. All these patients were dying

157
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,400
early on because the heart would reject, get inflamed right afterwards. And so then the typical

158
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,520
surgeon would walk away from that and say, I'm not doing this. Some way said, okay,

159
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,920
let's figure out the inflammation. So developed an instrument that you can go through the neck

160
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,800
into the heart. Sounds terrible, but it's real simple. It can do it in three minutes and figured

161
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,680
out how to, to, to address the inflammation, to diagnose it and treat it. And then you,

162
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,200
in the medicines that you mentioned, when I started in the transplant world and success was

163
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,360
not that good early on, it got better, but we were using two drugs. One was called prednisone or

164
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,720
steroids that most people have taken or understand. And the other is Imuran. And we didn't have a new

165
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,680
drug that came along in about 1982, which is cyclosporine. When you added that drug, which was

166
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,280
serendipitously discovered from a fungus over in I think Sweden or Switzerland, when you added

167
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:24,520
that to the cocktail, all of a sudden the mortality, which may have been at 50% went to 20%. Just that

168
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,680
one addition, because if you can adjust the immunological treatment and make it where it's

169
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,200
not as severe, you don't push down the immune system so much where people would die from infections.

170
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,760
But I think the important point in all of this, which I think you're leading and I'm sort of

171
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,600
feeding into is, is that science is this evolutionary process. And that the greats,

172
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,880
the Starsville, Tom Starsville, University of Pittsburgh did all transplants, but the world

173
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,160
icon leader in liver transplants, which was about two or three years behind our transplants,

174
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,840
and the Norman Shumways of the world had that deliberate, that disciplined, that focused process

175
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,520
in taking these insurmountable challenges that were impossible to do. And systematically over

176
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,720
a period of time, capturing the best of the best, even when there are lots of losses along the way,

177
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,240
ultimately be successful. This is just kind of a broader historical question of surgery. When you

178
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,080
think back of the last 150 years of surgery, the modern era, right? And you think about the giant

179
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:37,080
the Blalox, the Halsteads, the Shumways, Linnehan, Starsville. I mean, these people,

180
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,280
they had step function changes in the field, their existence and the teams around them,

181
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,520
right? When you talk about a surgeon, you have to talk about the critical care staff,

182
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,800
the anesthesiology staff. I mean, no surgeon can do what they do alone, but they fundamentally

183
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,280
changed surgery. Do you believe that there are any more step functions ahead in surgery?

184
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:07,800
Are there sort of from a technical standpoint or combination of technology, medicine, instrumentation,

185
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,160
like, is there something that you think is still an untapped opportunity in the way that, you know,

186
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,760
we're talking about what Shumway or Starsville did, for example? Yeah, you know, it's good. The

187
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,160
transplant world is a dramatic world that we've talked about where I would go take a heart out of

188
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,400
one person who is brain dead and then replace a diseased heart and a living person totally. And

189
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,280
even me describing it is pretty gross. I mean, it's brutal. I mean, you're talking about lifting

190
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,800
a heart out of somebody and putting it in there. And I say, yes, I've done hundreds and hundreds

191
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,920
of times. And then people say, it doesn't sound right. It is amazing, though. I mean, it's worth

192
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,480
pausing on that for a moment. It is, it's hard to believe. And I haven't participated in nearly as

193
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,000
many as you. So maybe it gets old after a while, but it wouldn't surprise me if every time you did

194
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,520
it, it still felt magical. Yeah. It probably never wore off in terms of what you just explained. It's

195
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,040
profound. Never. I think you don't have to have faith, really. People will jump to that immediately.

196
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,080
But the idea of me getting a call, and not me, this is done by everybody now at that time,

197
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,200
not that many, but now it's done in every major hospital around. But getting a call flying off

198
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,120
in the middle of the night, taking a heart out of somebody, putting it in a bucket with ice around

199
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,960
it, and then putting it on an airplane, traveling for three hours, coming back, opening up a patient,

200
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,560
and spending 45 minutes, putting the heart in. It's just like a piece of meat you're setting in

201
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,760
the chest. And then you just step back. And as you warm the patient up, the body up, all of a

202
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,560
sudden, that inner piece of meat that you've been carrying, and it's terribly been described it that

203
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,960
way, all of a sudden, slowly, that sort of magical moment, it would begin like a bag of worms just

204
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,840
kind of moving around. And then, bang, all of a sudden, it would start beating rhythmically,

205
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,920
you know, 70 beats a minute and pumping blood throughout the body. And then that patient goes

206
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,440
home a week later. And then, you know, it's miraculous. So I agree with it. And you can't

207
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,000
fully explain it, but it is. But it took the shumways and the storzels and people like that

208
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,120
to do that. And then my generation, which came right beyond that. And then beyond the transplant

209
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,800
world, there are other great innovations. You remember, and I don't know exactly when you were

210
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,560
doing your surgery, but taking out gallbladders, we used to do these big incisions and these bloody

211
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,720
pills and hip replacements. I mean, how that's been revolutionized through scopes and minimally

212
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,160
invasive surgery. So that will probably continue with more robotic surgery. But I think the really

213
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,480
exciting things will be at the cellular level of regenerative medicine, instead of replacing that

214
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,320
heart, keeping that old heart in the person, injecting some of the cells in there, understanding

215
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,080
what the Human Genome Project delivered to us back in the early 2000s, with some manipulation,

216
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:01,320
having those cells that you put in there, liven up and energize the dead cells that are there.

217
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,520
That kind of breakthrough is going to really be exciting coming forward. So is that surgery or

218
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:13,560
I'm not sure it's it takes things down to almost a synthetic biology world, which to me is where

219
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:20,600
things are really exciting in terms of at the level of the cellular interaction and and surgically

220
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,280
putting in it, whether it's mitochondria, a lot of things we're talking about with

221
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,000
COVID and vaccines and all today, that's sort of where so much of the future is, I think.

222
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,640
So when you got to Stanford, was Bruce Wrights there or had he already left for Hopkins?

223
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,520
He was leaving at exactly that time. At that time at Stanford, as you know, there were four cardiac

224
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,200
surgeons and some way the cardiac surgeon who was father to them all. Most of the people had

225
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,040
gravitated there because of his approach, bangs out of outside of the norm. Not a lot of respect

226
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,600
for tradition, for tradition's sake. Big believer in team approach. In Boston, you have to work 10

227
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,960
years to get to put in a stitch. You had to wait your time on the East Coast. If you were good at

228
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,320
it and you were a first year intern, if you were a fourth year medical student and some way saw you

229
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,120
operate, he would let you do what he wouldn't let a resident with 10 years of training do

230
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,400
if you could do it. So it was more kind of merit based there. All of that approach. And so that

231
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,000
was the culture that he built. Huge respect for nurses, huge respect. It wasn't about him. It was

232
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,680
about the people around him. He said he was the world's greatest first assistant. And for those

233
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,680
who don't follow surgery, the first assistant is the person who's across from the main surgeon

234
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,160
who kind of helps the main surgeon do the work. And what he was saying basically, it's not about me.

235
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,160
It's about us as a team. And Bruce Wright came out of that tradition and he had just led and of

236
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,880
course, didn't know him well because he went to Hopkins after that. So you finish getting your,

237
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,240
basically your transplant training at Stanford and then you head back to, is it Vanderbilt? You go

238
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,440
straight to, yeah. And you serve there on the faculty for quite some time and you're building

239
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,200
a program obviously, right? There was no transplant program. Yeah. You're building.

240
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,280
No. Yeah. At that time we had the Stanford program and there were few other programs around the East

241
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,720
of Mississippi. There were no established real programs. In Tennessee, there was no heart

242
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,520
transplant program. So built a program on the model of Stanford in heart transplants. And,

243
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,280
and I want to come back to where you're going. But once we mastered heart transplants, this whole

244
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,800
field of lung transplants three years later had never been done, never been successful, but because

245
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,280
of that drug cyclist form, we were able to do that. That's what Bruce and Norm did together,

246
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,800
right? They did the first heart lung transplant. They did heart lung lung. Ironically, you have

247
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,960
the heart lung. Lung is heart lung. Yeah. So you have the heart. It seemed like taking a lung would

248
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,360
be easier, but it's not. So the combined heart lung where you take them both. And that's what

249
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,560
Bruce Rides and Shumway did. And that's what I brought back to Vanderbilt. Was there any

250
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:08,120
resistance to this given what you just described on the East coast being kind of a bias towards,

251
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,880
hey, this is still very costly on a cost per life basis. There's probably more efficient things

252
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,160
that we can do with resources. Nowhere in this have we talked about where insurance companies are,

253
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,200
how are insurance companies thinking about this type of a procedure at that time?

254
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,640
It was interesting. So insurance and the payers, you have Medicare, government, Medicaid, and then

255
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,760
you have the commercial payers. At that time, it was still investigational. So Medicare,

256
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,160
our government did not reimburse for transplants. It was regarded as experimental for about eight

257
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,960
years. And they did a very smart thing. They designated certain centers to figure it out.

258
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,440
And then once the survival was sufficient and you were you were qualified as a center of excellence,

259
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,120
then they would start reimbursing you. The payer system was a little bit the same thing. And I was

260
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,160
again, lucky and I wouldn't have come to Vanderbilt if it hadn't been that far sort of thinking ahead.

261
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,920
They basically said, Bill, to get the program up, you've done, you know, scores and scores of heart

262
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,920
transplants you were trained by the best for your first 10 transplants, because we know this is

263
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:23,640
just the opposite of Mass General. We know this is lifesaving to thousands and thousands of people

264
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:30,760
dying across America. We also know that it's not 99% successful. But what we'll do for your first

265
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,760
10 transplants to get your program up and running, we will cover you if the insurance does not. And

266
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,360
so that gave me enough to and we did maybe six and then it started being reimbursed. And then

267
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,760
over a period of about eight years, every commercial payer, Medicare and Medicaid began to reimburse

268
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,440
because they had the outcomes 100% mortality, everybody would die who needed to transplant,

269
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,880
everybody would die within six months without it. And if you got it, you on average, 80% of the time

270
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,800
would live at least five years. And if you got beyond that would live 10, 15, 20 or 30 years.

271
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,280
What was the pressure like on you during those first transplants? I mean, here you are. It's one

272
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,560
thing when you're at Stanford and you're under the umbrella of Shumway and this incredible

273
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,120
environment he's built, which as you said, you've got the best anesthesiologists, you've got the

274
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,520
best nurses, you've got the best perfusionists, like everything that is needed to support that

275
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,400
program, you have the best of and the culture is already there. And you're a fellow within that

276
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,880
system. And now you have to go out and hang your own shingle and you have to now train everybody

277
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,800
to do what you took for, I'm not saying you took it for granted, right? But what one could have

278
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,360
easily taken for granted at Stanford. And all of a sudden now you're the operating surgeon. You don't

279
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,920
have Shumway first assisting you and you don't have a lot of time to figure this out. You can't take 50

280
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,640
transplants to get it worked out. Do you remember what those first few days were like? I mean,

281
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,400
that must have been unbelievable stress because it's two stresses. It's the obvious stress of,

282
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,120
I got to save this person's life, but there's even, there's a bigger thing at stake, which is

283
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,320
enough bad outcomes and this program gets shut down and we don't know what that means for the

284
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,680
future transplantation. Yeah. And there was an additional burden that at that time Shumway was

285
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,760
training the great cardiac surgeons. They weren't great. They were young people like me at the time,

286
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,960
but just like Bruce Wright, who we talked about, he didn't send them to Hopkins, but Bruce came

287
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:38,520
out of this very interesting culture where team was very important, where humility was very

288
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,640
important. That's juxtaposed the way most people think about cardiac surgeons who are in there,

289
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,960
you know, high pressure type A throwing instruments. You never saw that. And so when I came to Vanderbilt

290
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,920
east of Mississippi, Bruce was up in the Hopkins. All of a sudden all over the country, people said,

291
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,080
why don't we go to these guys instead of going out to California? So all of a sudden within a year of

292
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,640
me being at Vanderbilt, starting a program from scratch, I was getting referrals, you know,

293
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,600
hundreds of people coming in saying, I want the Shumway approach. Shumway says, you know,

294
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,600
you're as good as he is, you know, that's the way he would talk could coming in. But to answer your

295
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,800
question, it comes back to what I threw in about Shumway saying he was the best first assistant.

296
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,200
I came here, there was a guy by the name of Walter Merrill. Walter Merrill was Hopkins trained,

297
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,840
excellent surgeon, pediatric surgeon, adult surgeon, and he could do it all. He was gifted,

298
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:37,080
the most humble person in the world. And Walter had come out to Stanford to watch me operate,

299
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,200
to kind of learn about the program for Vanderbilt. And so we had this dialogue. And from day one for

300
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,880
the next 10 years, there wouldn't be a transplant that we did. And we did hearts and heart lungs,

301
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,920
and we did lungs, we did infant transplant, we were transplanting kids or babies at two days of

302
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,200
age and three days of age. There was never a transplant that I was involved with that Walter

303
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:05,480
Merrill wasn't there. Linked side by side, sort of this alter ego. And with that, and building the

304
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:12,440
team with nurses and perfusionists to sort of share this same Shumway mentality of team first,

305
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,640
keep it simple, stupid, don't be afraid to double dribble. If you don't get it perfect the first time,

306
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,600
go back and do it again. And it's worth saying all that a little bit because I want to jump ahead

307
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:30,040
a little bit because that program after I left has continued to grow 10 years, 15, 20 years later

308
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,800
to where that program today is the largest heart transplant program in America. It does more heart

309
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,240
transplants than in any center that people are listening to us in their cities today. And it

310
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,600
has nothing to do with me really, but it's taking that experience, which again, you understand that

311
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,560
what the residence experience is and the young faculty is, if you're lucky enough to have a

312
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:57,480
mentor and you can capture that culture and you go out and apply it. So I replicated exactly what

313
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,840
I saw at Stanford to get it up and running those first two years, worked with a great team. And

314
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,200
then with that, we were on the cutting edge of the early lung transplants, early heart lung transplants.

315
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,680
And then ultimately, obviously we added liver to it and we had bone marrow already. We had a pancreas

316
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:21,640
and became a large multi-organ transplant center. Now, where was DeBakey and Cooley in the midst of

317
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,280
this? When did the big Texas centers participate? They were early and it fits with Texas and they

318
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:35,720
were great surgeons and they are up there and they would say they're above Starsil and in some way

319
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:42,280
just because their egos were big and they were excellent surgeons and they did these incremental

320
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,680
leaps in surgery and vascular surgery. Both of them, they're in the same town in Houston, Texas,

321
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,240
and they, which fits with the ego, the confidence and ability, jumped on transplants as soon as

322
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,960
Shumway did the first one in America. Christian Bernard did one a few months later, Shumway did one

323
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,440
and then Shumway was going to continue along 15 a year, the way he was doing it. Deliberate, let's

324
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,720
learn, iterative process. But DeBakey and Cooley said, well, listen, this thing looks pretty good,

325
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,920
seems to work pretty well and so they did in Texas, this is all in the late 60s. So remember,

326
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:22,360
this was all 67, 68 and between 68 and about 69, they did I think 110 heart transplants in

327
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,840
competition with each other. Do it big, do it Texas style and then all those patients died

328
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,800
and they died, which comes back to the story. Shumway was out there figuring out how to treat

329
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,920
the heart rejection, this inflammation using that little, that little cannula he puts through the

330
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:42,360
neck and they didn't have the patients for that. And so they shut their programs down and went on

331
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,200
to other things. And then in the late 70s started doing a few and then the 80s kind of picked up

332
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,200
where everybody else did. I mean, the whole story of DeBakey and Cooley, I don't know if there's a

333
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,680
book about it, but if there is, I'd love to read it. The rivalry between them is unbelievable,

334
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,960
right? I mean, it's two legends in cardiac surgery, both of whom will tell you that they're the

335
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,240
greatest of all time. Did they ever reconcile before DeBakey, I think DeBakey died first, right?

336
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,480
Yeah, they did. And the hospitals were right across the street and never did really. I think

337
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,840
when DeBakey or Cooley got a medal of honor that there was some kind of congratulations that went

338
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,680
on, but in essence never, never did. Yeah, it's interesting. I never met DeBakey, but I met Cooley

339
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,640
because he trained at Hopkins. And so every night when you're on call, when you'd be walking through

340
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,160
the Blalock hallway, Hopkins is such a storied place. There's never a piece of tradition that's

341
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,640
not enough, right? And you'd see these pictures of the young Denton Cooley and he was just

342
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,960
upsettingly handsome, right? So sure enough, we're at the American College of Surgeons one year

343
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,000
and each, as you know, every university or every medical school has their own thing. So you'd go

344
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,960
to the Vanderbilt one and you'd probably go stop at the Stanford one and you'd go stop at the MGH

345
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,120
one. And so at the Hopkins one Cooley shows up and I'm there with my closest friend from residency

346
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,320
who happens to be a cardiac surgery fellow about to go and embark on his pediatric cardiac fellowship.

347
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,040
And Cooley was talking with both of us and he says, Oh, what year are you in? And I think I was in my

348
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,680
third year or something. And he says to my friend, Jorge Salazar, what year are you in? And Jorge

349
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,600
says, well, I'm in my ninth year. Cause that's, you know, at the time by that point it's nine years

350
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,320
just to do adult cardiac surgery. And then he said, and then you're going to go off and do

351
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,160
pediatric cardiac, I think is another two years at UCSF. And he's like, gosh, that's just unbelievable.

352
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,200
I mean, back in my day, it only took six years to become a cardiac surgeon. Now, admittedly,

353
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,000
I was better than everybody else. And he just went on, but he said it completely seriously. Like

354
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,560
there was no irony in that statement. And we got such a kick out of that, but I guess there's

355
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,200
some truth to it. I mean, he was a gifted surgeon. Yeah. And he did really, there are icons and

356
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,320
contributed so much and there are hundreds of thousands of people alive today because of people

357
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,680
they've trained and procedures they've done and really amazing icons in that field of cardiac

358
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,440
surgery. They probably won't ever be anybody like them again. And cardiac surgery has changed so much.

359
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,000
It's one of the reasons, but they were just two talented prodigy type surgeons.

360
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:19,320
Do you think that medicine can no longer attract that caliber of individual? Like has the

361
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,400
profession changed such that the best and the brightest would never consider medicine today?

362
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,160
I'm not close enough to what the hot shot college kid is doing today, but given, for example,

363
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:37,080
the incredible changes we've seen in technology, is it really the case that the coolies and the

364
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,440
debakes and the some ways of the world, if they were 20 years old today, would be going to Silicon

365
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,120
Valley or would be going to Boston and going into biotech startups. Like, there are other ways to

366
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,480
serve people that don't involve literally going into medicine. And I, do you ever think about that?

367
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,760
Like, is there, has there been some sort of passing of the torch in terms of the war for talent?

368
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:05,160
You know, when you think of the Starzels, the DeBakeys and Shumway and the great surgeons,

369
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,680
you think of great athletes. You think of the athletic part of it. In part, they're using their

370
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,520
hands. They want you, you got to be fast, deliberate, you got to keep it simple. You got to be right.

371
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,960
And I think because of technology, that's less important. I think the fact that we're operating

372
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,560
through telescopes and soon microscopes, when you asked your earlier question, that the sort of

373
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:38,520
athletic, competitive hero on the field, cowboyish sort of approach, I think we're beyond that.

374
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,400
Just the most of the big sort of blood and guts, that kind of imagery is passed by. But to go back

375
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:52,520
to your question, no, I think medicine still, it may be in some ways even more so because

376
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,320
we've opened up this whole world of biology, synthetic biology, and at the cellular level,

377
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,240
the regenerative medicine and the use of stem cells, all of these things are going to attract,

378
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,280
and they're going to be, they're going to go in as medicine because they want to heal.

379
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,560
They want to be a part of something bigger than themselves and not just behind a microscope,

380
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,640
that I think it's going to continue to attract great, great people. And if you look at,

381
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,080
at least here in Vanderbilt, where I'm familiar with medical school applications,

382
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,560
they're all time high right now. And people say yes, but the quality is not there. And

383
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,080
the attraction of making a lot of money or doing the next Uber or Airbnb is out there.

384
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,560
I think all of that's right. But I think we're going to continue to see,

385
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,000
and maybe even see an increase in the overall quality of people applying to medical school

386
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,720
and then going to medical school and then entering these fields.

387
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,520
I'll ask you the question I get asked all the time, and I think you can answer it with

388
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,240
frankly, a far better lens, which is, what advice do you have for somebody today who wants to go

389
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,080
into medicine, doesn't quite know how they want to do it based on all you've seen and what you see

390
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,760
in the future, in the landscape. And now we're getting ahead of ourselves because we haven't

391
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,560
got to this part of the discussion where we're going to talk about policy and things like that.

392
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,600
But given what you know about the profession of medicine and also the landscape of payers,

393
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,520
hospital systems, consolidation of these things, at risk versus not at risk reimbursement,

394
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,320
all these things, what do you say to somebody? Do you say go forth and conquer? Do you say,

395
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,760
here's a hedge that you want to have in place? I mean, what advice do you have for somebody to

396
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,200
be successful? You know where you started is probably still my philosophy and I'm still

397
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,480
active in teaching here and mentoring a lot of people in medicine and in health. And I think

398
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,880
staying broad, I kind of fell into that because I knew what my track was going to be in medicine.

399
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,360
And therefore I wanted to do journalism and I wanted to try the policy world and wanted to go

400
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:58,600
to Washington and wanted to write about technology all at the time I was going to medical school.

401
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,920
Then it was harder, as we said, because there was a stigma almost against it. And today I think

402
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,080
the professors in medical school understand that the best, whether it's on the social side or even

403
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:17,640
on the technical side, the best are people who bring broad experiences, have the curious mind

404
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,560
that isn't narrowed down to just one area, to you know, just cardiac surgery or just

405
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:30,280
bypass surgery or valves, but has that curiosity throughout life. So I'd still continue to

406
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,000
encourage people to live as broadly as possible, to develop those interests, to look for your

407
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,840
talents. And if they're outside of medicine, figure out some way either as a hobby or something on

408
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,680
the side or write an article every week about it to keep that going. And I guess because I have

409
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,960
jumped around so much and kind of changed career every 10 to 12 years, that I see how in truth

410
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,800
it's all the same thing. It's all health and it's all healing and it's all giving hope. There's lots

411
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,200
of different ways to do it. Let's fast forward a little bit to call it the early 90s. Do you have

412
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,480
a sense at this point that you want to make a run for Senate or how were you starting to think about

413
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:16,120
a transition into elected office? It's interesting. My goal was never to be in the United States Senate

414
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,560
ever, ever, ever. And I'd spent right at 10 years learning all the surgery in medical school and

415
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,800
how to do transplants and how to do surgery and then about 10 years here at Vanderbilt.

416
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:34,200
And we built a transplant center, a multi-organ transplant center that was a great foundation for

417
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,800
the future. And then I just began to ask myself, I did not serve in Vietnam, which a lot of people

418
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,080
just right above me had done. I've not been in the service. I've not done anything actively other

419
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:52,840
than learn to be a doctor and spend 18 hours a day doing it for those years. And I said given

420
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:59,320
that I was running a large transplant center and doing a lot of good, I felt what would be the one

421
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:05,960
other thing that one might do to affect health, maybe not of an individual, but health of a

422
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,640
community or health of a population. And I said, well, do you go run a university? I'd been on the

423
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,080
board of Princeton University as a young alumnus and sort of solved the power there and thought

424
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,600
about that. No, because that's don't think I could reach quite enough people. And so I systematically

425
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,360
eliminated doing anything. A new policy could do it because policy could affect the world.

426
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,200
And I'd seen that back 20 years before when I'd been an intern during the college years. And so

427
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,520
I said the only place is really the United States Senate. I have a job. I know what I can do. But if

428
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,280
you could get to that position, not to change health care necessarily, not to at the time it

429
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,160
was Clinton care and all sorts of political issues. And it really wasn't for that reason.

430
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,080
It really was an extension of what I saw as a little boy when my dad would come home. And that

431
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,160
was in the days they had doctor's bags and he would sit down exhausted and say, you know,

432
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,360
the greatest gratification has been able to give somebody hope. And all of a sudden I said,

433
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,240
policy can do that. And so I jumped in. Nobody in my family had ever served in public office.

434
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:19,800
Nobody had run for public office. They were not overly partisan. My mom was probably more

435
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,600
of a Democrat. My dad was probably more Republican. And I was probably neither. You know, I was

436
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,160
just out there doing heart surgery every day. So it really was an extension of that earlier

437
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:37,160
poll, probably genetic in some way of wanting to serve and that being a way to serve a population.

438
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,560
And, you know, it sounds kind of patting yourself on the shoulder now in retrospect, but

439
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,880
that was what was going through my mind. And I didn't have anybody look to my dad said,

440
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,840
are you crazy? And he's no longer alive. He died 20 years ago. But he said, you know,

441
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,440
you're at the top of the world in surgery and innovation and running a large laboratory and

442
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,720
writing papers. And, you know, why would you leave that to go into this world of policy? And

443
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,360
the answer then was what it is now. Also said, I wasn't going to stay forever. I said, you know,

444
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,520
I'm not a politician. I love policy and I want to affect change and I want to innovate, but I

445
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,160
only I only want to go do it for 10 years. And that's how I took the leap.

446
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,000
The Senate is the highest piece of Congress. So to, you know, I could, it's almost easier to

447
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,720
understand if you said, look, I'm going to go run for the House of Representatives. I don't know how

448
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,680
many seats are there in the House of Representatives in Tennessee?

449
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,280
Nine. Okay. But to say to say I'm going to be one of the two people running for Senate is kind of

450
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,000
remarkable. How long of a process was that? So the election was 96. When did you have to get

451
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,360
serious about this? Is this like a two year process, a one year process?

452
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,240
I spent a year and a half. I had to leave. I didn't have to leave, but you either do it or you

453
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,960
don't. And this is the advice I give people. If you're going to get go all in. So probably about

454
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:03,400
two and a half years before I started talking, the problem I had is my parents didn't really buy into

455
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:10,120
it. My family really didn't because kind of hard to understand. So who do you talk to? And there

456
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:17,800
hadn't been a physician elected to the United States Senate. One hundred people, two from every

457
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,440
state. There hadn't been a physician elected to the Senate since 1928. So I didn't have anybody

458
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,200
to call or go see who'd gone through this eye of the needle medical school and internship and

459
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,960
residency and fellowship and practice. And that made it hard. And maybe that was a good thing.

460
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,720
They may have said, get out of here. Don't do it. But that was hard. And so I systematically took

461
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,320
about a year. This one I'm still practicing. And I went to see Howard Baker. He'd been majority

462
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,840
leader of the United States Senate before a centrist. I went and talked to Lamar Alexander

463
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,240
at the time who had been governor, but he hadn't been in the Senate. I ultimately recruited him

464
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:03,160
run for the Senate and went and talked to Al Gore at the time, who was a senator and had great

465
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,400
conversations. And my fundamental question was, am I right or is this just like, you know, dreams?

466
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:16,040
And to the one they said to tough business, half the people are going to hate you all the time,

467
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,320
and half are going to like you. And to me, very different than medicine. But if you're really

468
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,200
serious about it, you ought to do it. Howard Baker, who was just an amazing guy. And again,

469
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,600
he was also from Tennessee. He the first time he didn't listen to me very much. And or he

470
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,960
politely did the second time politely. And then about the third or fourth time I went to say,

471
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,560
he finally said, okay, you must be interested in go ahead and make the jump.

472
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,360
I mean, you're having a chance to speak with Al Gore when he's the vice president at this point.

473
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,240
No, he was still it was right during that period of time. And that was going to open up a seat,

474
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,000
actually in Tennessee at the time he was still in the Senate, because this was in the early 90s.

475
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,320
Oh, this is before 92 then even. Wow. Exactly. And this all 91. And then ultimately, that seat

476
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,320
opened up and then I had an option of running for that seat, which is an open seats easier to win

477
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,040
because you got two people in there that nobody knows. And it's sort of a flip of the coin or the

478
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:18,920
other seat. And I don't know exactly why, but I went the less traditional route and challenged and

479
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:25,000
incumbent. And I know why because I was the fresh face and he was the person who'd been around for

480
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,120
18 years. But it was unconventional to go that route at the time. So you ran in 94 against the

481
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:38,280
incumbent. Is that correct? Yeah. And you won by a pretty hefty margin, correct? Yeah, that was,

482
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,480
I had a primary with six others. Yeah, I was going to ask you about the primary. What was the primary

483
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,200
like back then compared to, for example, what primaries are like today, which is a fight to

484
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:55,400
the extreme. Thank goodness. It's not today where people are get pushed out Tennessee until recently

485
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,840
and it's changed in the last four years, but until recently, Tennessee had produced senators that were

486
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,640
in the center. The eastern part of the state was more Republican. The Western was more Democratic.

487
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,360
The middle where I live was sort of in the middle. So if you were versatile enough to move through

488
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:16,360
that state, your politics tended to be very principle and it might be principle Democrat

489
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,760
or Republican, but you're pretty much going to be appealing to a broad range of people. So in our

490
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:29,080
primary, there were six people all out of that same ilk. My disadvantage was that I was an outsider.

491
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,480
I hadn't played my political dues with the Republican Party. Number one, I was from middle

492
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,200
Tennessee and not east Tennessee. And then that was it. So, but the race was very different. And in

493
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:47,000
that primary, just interestingly enough, was the person who I ultimately recruited to the United

494
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,200
States Senate, Bob Corker. And Bob Corker and I, he was an outsider and I was an outsider. He and I

495
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,840
were in the primary. So it started at six, came down to two. All races are tough races. He always

496
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,440
say that ours was a clean race and ours was a hundred percent cleaner than these races today.

497
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,880
But it's all just hand-to-hand combat, this politics stuff. And so I don't want to over idealize

498
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,280
the way it was, but we were out of this extreme sort of polar opposites where in a primary,

499
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,760
somebody's driven to the either extreme right or extreme left. Do you remember what the main

500
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,720
policy issues that you were running on in the primary and then ultimately in the general that

501
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,400
year in 94? And that comes to the other thing. So, and because ultimately one, which nobody had

502
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:38,120
expected, nobody, chances were probably one in a hundred. And the other thing that did happen,

503
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:44,440
that it didn't start that way when I jumped in, but at the end in 1994 ended up being a lot of

504
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:51,320
Republicans coming in. So I was part of that wave. I was still the least expected. I was the only

505
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:57,720
person to be an incumbent United States Senator who came in and so ultimately won, but there was

506
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,760
the luck end of it being at the right place at the right time as well. And so the policy issues,

507
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:11,000
ironically, when you look at today, were balance the budget. Over time, eliminate the debt,

508
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,800
keep taxes small. So those were sort of the big issues. They were these big physical issues that

509
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,760
were out there. Welfare reform, which just talked about in that period of time, ultimately the bill

510
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,360
passed about three or four years later, but those are the sort of the three big issues.

511
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,680
And just to go back to the first point you made, what you're really saying is, look,

512
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:40,920
in 94, two years into a president's term, the opposite party generally has a tailwind at that

513
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,080
first midterm election, correct? That's correct. For example, I remember in 2010, two years into

514
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:53,000
Obama's term, you get a little bit of that tailwind for Republicans and vice versa. So this in 94 was

515
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:01,560
the same thing. Now, how did you learn the mechanics of the US Senate? I mean, I got to tell

516
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,080
you, I find this stuff really interesting, Bill, just in part because I grew up in another country

517
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:13,560
and I have an inferiority complex. I didn't learn US history growing up. So you asked my daughter,

518
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,720
she's like, dad, why are you always grilling me on US history? And it's like, hey, I'm trying to

519
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,080
learn this stuff with you. But oh my God, trying to figure out what the whip does versus the minority

520
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,240
leader versus this and what this means in this bill versus that. I mean, it just strikes me as

521
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,880
when you go straight into the US Senate, that's like going straight into the major leagues,

522
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:41,000
never playing AAA, AA, and little league baseball. Like how do you learn all of that stuff? I mean,

523
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,320
was that the scare? I mean, if the first time you're doing a transplant by yourself is scary,

524
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,320
I would think the first day you're sitting on the floor of the US Senate is 10 times more scary.

525
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:57,320
Yeah, it was, I guess when I was first running, I didn't know if I'd win or not. And then about a

526
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:04,920
week out, I felt it that I knew I would win. So that the worst part was the first, the November to

527
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,640
January equivalent 22nd or January 4th, not knowing what all this is about. The Senate doesn't have a

528
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,800
Robert Rules of Orders. There's not a book you read. There's a little book of rules and you'll

529
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,880
hear, you know, you hear about it every two years after pass the rules. But it's like a 30-page book.

530
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:30,680
The real book is precedent that's set. And precedent is experience. It's being around its

531
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:38,440
age, its knowledge, it is, you know, all the other stuff that I had zero. You gave me a 30-page book,

532
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,240
you know, it's like it like in medicine or going to a new rotation in your residency, you know,

533
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,160
you just hop in and do it and you do it fast and you do it hard and you may do it for a month,

534
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,000
you'll have to switch the next month. So that would have been easy. The challenge of the Senate

535
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,840
is that it's not a book that you can read. And I had the disadvantage of not having anybody I knew

536
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:02,360
in the Senate either, no friends, no, no sort of colleagues. In retrospect, that's all a real

537
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:08,200
advantage. I was able to come in as an outsider, as a physician, somebody who has looked at to be

538
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,840
trusted, somebody that has looked at to be fair, somebody who learns predominantly, not the way a

539
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:21,640
typical politician does it, that I know better than you. It's I got to listen. If the patient

540
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,680
comes in the door, which I had done for the previous 20 years, I want to size them up. I want

541
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,840
to listen. I want to look at the body language. I don't want to say anything until they give me

542
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:37,000
that chief complaint or that last, you know, look or question as they go out the door. And all of

543
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,600
that, which is second nature, it's part of being a physician or being a healer or a nurse, is that

544
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:51,240
listing that empathy component is part of the culture, but really the being it is in the DNA

545
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:57,480
of physicians and nurses and counselors and healers. The room I walked into had 63 lawyers,

546
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
63 lawyers. I walked into that chamber and and that chamber, every chair was full with somebody

547
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,520
who for 10 years had been arguing legal cases and all. And so you'd say that's a disadvantage.

548
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,040
Again, it ended up being a pretty big advantage. And I didn't realize it at the time, but by

549
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,560
listening very carefully, by working with trust and upholding that trust, because I came in with this

550
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,560
image and the reality of being a physician, people would come to me and they'd say, what do you think?

551
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:34,200
And you know, how, what is your look on this from the outside? You've been around patients every day,

552
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,920
20 different patients every day for the last 20 years of your life and you've listened to them.

553
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,000
You know, I've been in the United States Senate about as far from real people as you can get.

554
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,840
And so all of that came as real advantages. And again, I didn't know it. There hadn't been a doctor

555
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:54,920
there. I told you since, you know, 1928 or elected since 1928. So that was it. And kind of stuck with

556
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,480
that throughout. But it wasn't the health care issues. When there was a health care issue,

557
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:07,000
it would all come to me immediately because the time health care was probably, I don't know, 16%

558
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,200
of our economy. And yet there was nobody in the chamber who'd ever taken care of a patient or

559
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,720
written a prescription or been involved at all. And so that kind of information gravitated

560
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:26,440
for me as well. You know, you mentioned that 63% of the Senate were lawyers, 1% physicians.

561
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,400
It's probably a dated statistic, so I don't know what it is today, but I can't imagine

562
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:37,800
it's far from this. But the last time I looked at the stats, when you looked at the entire Congress,

563
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,800
both the House and the Senate combined, slightly less than 1% had any training in secondary

564
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,040
education. So whether it be an undergraduate degree in science or an advanced degree like yours,

565
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:55,080
why do you think that is? Well, you know, it's interesting. And then right now there are three

566
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,720
physicians in the Senate. And so I kind of broke the glass ceiling and that's been three or four.

567
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,800
And in the House are 14. So it's clearly more than what it was when I... So it's more. But if

568
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,480
you look at historically, and you sort of start now and go backwards in 50-year increments,

569
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,040
I won't exaggerate, but I'll give you just the image. In the first 50 years of our country,

570
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:25,560
the sort of 17, sort of 50 to 18 or 1810, there were, I think like 25 or 24 physicians in the

571
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:31,480
Senate over a six-year period in and out. If you look at the next 50 years, 1800 to 1850,

572
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:37,160
it was 12, about half of that. And if you look at 1850 to 1900, it's about half of that. And then

573
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,160
1900 to 1950, it was about half of that, so it got down to one. So it hadn't always been that way.

574
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:50,760
But over time, as medicine got more specialized, as some of the stigma that we talked about earlier,

575
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,680
that if you're in medicine, even if you could look at policy with the AMA, the American Medical

576
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,880
Association, you're not a serious doctor. That was kind of the stigma. So people were discouraged,

577
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,480
and then doctors wanted to focus on their work, and therefore they didn't put themselves out there.

578
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:13,400
And then even after I got there, you know, physicians don't support the political system

579
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,880
that much. They don't get involved in the policy or politics, and I think it's been to the detriment

580
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:27,000
of patients in America, because physicians are the best voice for 300 million people,

581
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,560
because they're listening to their problems and their challenges and the socioeconomic and the

582
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:38,680
diversity issues. And so they should be more interested. And so I don't think it's really

583
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,960
that the body itself had a version to them. It's really that people from the science world didn't

584
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,600
move in that direction. And there are good reasons not to. I mean, it tears your life apart.

585
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:55,320
I mean, you give up all your privacy, families are destroyed. Yeah, 50% of the country hating you,

586
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:01,960
not hating you, exaggerating. But well, certainly today. Today, you really do. So I can't fully

587
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,960
explain it. But I can tell you what the sort of issues that that we are confronted with today,

588
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,600
and the issues that I ultimately, you know, even my 12 year period we addressed,

589
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:19,560
I was not the lone voice. But I spent a lot of time explaining what science is. And as science

590
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:25,240
was progressing, and technology was progressing, ethical issues were involved, they would gravitate

591
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,800
naturally to the person sitting next to you if they happen to be a doctor on the on the chamber

592
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:35,320
floor. There's just been too few of them, I would say over time. When you think about that first term

593
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:43,320
in the Senate from 94 to 2000, you alluded to it earlier, you came into this saying, without any

594
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:49,240
ambiguity, you were hoping to serve two terms in the Senate, not a day longer, and you were never

595
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:54,680
going to seek higher office thereafter. Why were you so confident to make that assertion? I mean,

596
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:00,120
most people who would serve in the Senate would want to maybe keep their options open and say,

597
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:05,400
you know, look, maybe if things go well, there's I'd stay for a third term or I'd seek higher office.

598
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:11,640
Why were you so adamant about this 12 year limit? Yeah, I actually told the people of Tennessee,

599
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:18,680
7 million people, I'll serve for 12 years. I've got a job, I believed very much in a concept called

600
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:26,120
the citizen legislator. The concept that somebody goes, it's at the federal level, that goes, they

601
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:31,480
leave their home, they leave the people, they stay in touch with them, but they go to Washington, D.C.

602
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:38,680
to serve as a citizen legislator, the citizen, the broad experiences, the trials, the tribulations,

603
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:45,320
the challenges, the understanding, the empathy, and applying all that to help shape the laws of

604
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:50,680
the land. And then after I've done that, go back and live under the laws that I've passed or we've

605
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:56,360
passed. And that's just a philosophy. And I believe that today, not for everybody, but I think the

606
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:02,200
majority of people in the Senate benefits from it. And I think people benefit from it, not to get

607
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:08,360
locked up in this very almost encapsulated environment of the Senate or the House of

608
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:14,200
Representatives itself. It was just clear to me. And that perspective came from medicine, the breath

609
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:21,240
that a clinical person has in taking care of acute medicine and chronic medicine and mental

610
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:27,320
and issues in the transplant world, you're taking care of all of that, that the world is much broader

611
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,680
and that you've got a job to do. And after it's done, leave, let somebody else who may be brighter

612
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,320
or smarter or bring their citizen legislature experiences there. Social media was a philosophy

613
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:43,880
for me and the right one to do. It did allow me in my last term to focus on, instead of

614
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:49,400
fundraising and having to cast votes in a certain way that looked politically good and that sort of

615
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,960
thing, which is just part of the business. It allowed me to just have a clean slate, do what I

616
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,320
thought was right and move ahead. So would you endorse the idea of term limits? I mean, this

617
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:04,440
idea, if we just said, look, no Senator can ever serve more than two terms, no member of Congress

618
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:09,160
can ever serve more than six terms if you wanted to keep it equal at 12 years. I mean, I've heard

619
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:14,360
many people suggest that that could be one piece of the remedy to some of the situations we find

620
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:21,800
ourselves in. I mean, I personally, I find that to be a very appealing idea. And initially I did too.

621
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:28,360
And you asked about those first days going in. And I think of those first days, just as an aside,

622
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:34,760
my dad, who was a doctor came up to visit me and he said on my door, it said, Mr. Bill Frist,

623
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,920
another one said the honorable Bill Frist. And there's been these gold plates on the door and

624
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,480
on your chair on the Senate floor. And he walked around and he grabbed me by the arm. He walked me

625
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:49,400
back down the hall and said, son, you know, Bill, I love the fact that you're in the United States

626
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,320
Senate. I may not have wanted you to be here, but you need to change that. Take that back off and

627
00:58:53,320 --> 00:59:01,640
put Dr. Bill Frist there. And so that whole whole world of being a senator for a period of time,

628
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,560
sort of running the occupying the office, but not owning the office was was one to answer your

629
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,160
question. No, I think term limits would be a huge mistake of the United States Senate.

630
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:20,120
This job is, is, is complicated and it's equally complicated to heart surgery and, and, and other

631
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:26,760
things that I've done. The breadth of knowledge to be really good at it. And you can't know everything,

632
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,560
but ultimately every law of the land, every federal law of the land is going to come through

633
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:37,240
you, everyone. And that is really tough. The procedures we talked about the rule book and the

634
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:42,920
books of precedence and the things that aren't written down. When I came in and then jumping

635
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:49,240
ahead, when I got into leadership, all of a sudden, who did I turn to? I'm not smart enough. I'm sort

636
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:54,680
of, you know, average sort of intelligence overall. And I work really hard. And so I would turn to

637
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,600
the person who had been there for 18 years or 24 years. And I would ask what it was like 20 years

638
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:06,520
ago or 25 years ago, what is the precedent itself and not go to some staff member who's

639
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,160
25 years old, who's very good, but hadn't been around. And that would not have been possible.

640
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,760
That would not have been possible if there weren't a handful or 20 or 30. I don't know what the number

641
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,840
is of people that are there. And so the system works pretty good. When you have this, this, this,

642
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:29,720
this crucible, this, this mixture of people like me who say, I'm not staying any longer. Or Bob

643
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,600
Corker, who I helped recruit to the Senate who said, you know, I'm just going to stay for, for 12

644
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:40,520
years. And then go back and do other things. But I do think this add mixture is important because

645
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:47,240
of the complexity of the job. In that first term, what was the camaraderie like between parties? You

646
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:53,160
hear stories of, I'm in the middle of reading a book about Abraham Lincoln right now. And

647
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:00,200
maybe these books somewhat romanticize it, but obviously there have been huge swings in sort of

648
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:06,040
how partisan the country has been. But there are these periods of time in which politicians of

649
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,640
opposite parties still socialize together. There was still a degree of respect that existed, even

650
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,880
if you disagreed on policy. As you kind of alluded to it earlier, you might spend the week in DC

651
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:23,000
without your family. And that would be a time when these would be your colleagues and you'd go home

652
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,960
on the weekend sort of thing. I mean, what was that environment like? And how much time did you

653
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:34,200
spend with members of the opposite party, your own party, and what were those relationships

654
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:40,440
like? And above all else, how did that influence your ability to bring your empathy to the side of,

655
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,160
Hey, I understand another person's point of view, even if I don't agree with it.

656
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:49,560
Yeah, it's really important. And like you, you don't want to over romanticize the past and

657
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,120
recent events, you're asking the same question. Is that the way it's always been? Or is this brand new?

658
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,880
And the first six years in the last six years were different for me. I served under two presidents,

659
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:06,520
one a Democrat, President Clinton, and the other President Bush are with them. And it wasn't because

660
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:12,200
of them, but it was because of impart media, and because of the impart the internet impart.

661
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:20,200
Initially, it was cable TV. As we had more of this sort of real time, nothing could be done behind

662
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:27,240
closed doors. If I wanted to take a trip called a code out a fact finding trip to Africa, and I've

663
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:34,600
spent a lot of time in Africa, I would take and go on a trip with four Democrats, senators, and four

664
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:40,680
Republicans. And we would go to four countries in Africa. And we'd be together, we travel together,

665
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:47,160
we would share meals together, we would have discussions together. And over the period of

666
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:53,480
sort of that 12 years, but over a period of about four or five years, that became the junket. And so

667
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:59,800
every New York Times, Wall Street or anybody would come and say you're spending taxpayer dollars

668
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:06,040
by having a vacation over in Southern Sudan. Anybody who's been to Southern Sudan knows

669
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:12,040
that ain't a vacation. Yeah, no, exactly. But you know, it's easy when you're in this sort of fully

670
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:18,920
exposed media world in real time, where it's hard to counter everything. And so that really

671
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:26,360
contributed a lot. So early on, probably the first four years, a lot more of that having dinners. And

672
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,000
these aren't like Georgetown parties. And I were talking about in the Senate dining room, sitting

673
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:37,480
together. And then over that 12 year period, much, much less of that. And it's gotten much, much worse

674
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:42,920
since then. I'm still very close to a number of senators. And it's gotten much, much worse since

675
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:48,280
then. But the trend began to change right through that period of time. And really the scrutiny of

676
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:55,240
the media played a role in that. Of course, the critic will argue, well, isn't that the job of the

677
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:00,840
media to bring the critical eye to it? I mean, what is that balance between the media holding

678
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:07,320
politicians accountable versus actually creating a counterproductive environment where it

679
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,080
polarizes everybody more and creates distance between them? How do we think about this?

680
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,400
Well, we're seeing it play out. And I think you're exactly right. The transparency is critically

681
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:21,400
important. And past politics is playing that out in our history. That, you know, hiding things

682
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:27,400
in the long run is unhealthy and destructive to our government, to the fundamentals of our

683
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:34,440
democracy. I think what changed it all is that what we're seeing today more than even when I was there,

684
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:40,360
but is the misinformation that campaigns if the media like on this whole thing of

685
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:47,320
codels being junkets make the accusation. There's no way really to counter it. And if misinformation

686
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,360
is put out there and it's in real time. And again, this is the period of time before Twitter and

687
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:57,160
before Facebook and all. But if you put the information out, it was much harder to counter,

688
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,360
but it was same sort of stuff. It was misinformation that was there. Therefore,

689
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,720
the institutional structure, the corporate structure of having one lunch together,

690
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:10,440
which we used to do Democrat and Republican ultimately evolved into the Republicans going

691
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,280
to one room and Democrats going to another room, something they already did for business,

692
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,080
but that joint room of getting together disappeared. And that's unhealthy. And

693
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,320
there are ways that you can fix that. I won't jump ahead with that, but there are ways that

694
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,520
you can fix that. And it does have to be fixed. And it comes back to this being a doctor, I think

695
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:36,520
the empathy word really does come back to this connectedness. Doesn't mean you have to agree,

696
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:41,000
but this connected of saying two sides of things and you just less empathy in the corporate

697
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,720
structure of the United States Senate today. What committees did you sit on in your first term in

698
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:52,120
the Senate? Yeah, it's interesting. I sat on the banking committee. Actually, I had been on the

699
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:56,840
board of a bank ironically before, but it's not the reason I went on it. But Pete Domenic, he was on

700
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:03,080
it. And when I was choosing my committees, the way committees are chosen, I was 100th in seniority.

701
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:08,520
So I had 99 people about me. Were you the only freshman Senator elected in 94? No,

702
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:14,760
there were others elected, but the ones, if you've served in public office before, you get credit

703
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,240
for it. If you've been a governor, you get credit for it. Yeah. So you are the lowest totem pole.

704
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,240
Yeah. I mean, I thought I was okay being a heart surgeon and taking care of people and saving their

705
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,400
lives. When I got up there, boy, they could care less, especially when it came to committee choice

706
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,960
or it came to anything that had to do with appropriations or power and that sort of thing.

707
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,240
But the committees I ended on were great committees. One was the banking committee.

708
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:42,360
Fascinating time and always a good committee has no power per se, but a really important committee

709
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,440
in terms of constituents back at home. And the health committee, the health education,

710
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,560
labor pension committee, which is health. And that it did include things like I chaired the

711
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,520
subcommittee on disability policy. And, you know, for the whole United States of America,

712
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:03,720
every law of the disability world had to come through that particular committee. And then went

713
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:09,800
to foreign affairs with about two years later and stayed on that throughout because I had done so

714
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:15,560
much travel to other countries doing medical work and it fit there. But those were the ones in the

715
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:21,640
first few years that I was on and learned a tremendous amount. And then in the last four to

716
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:26,040
a year or six, joined the commerce committee and the commerce committee, that was the time there was

717
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,640
telecommunication and all of the great reform that was going on then.

718
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,200
I've resisted asking you this question before, because I wanted to ask you for the first time

719
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:42,360
during this discussion, how is it that someone so young and so junior in tenure can become

720
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:48,920
the Senate majority leader at such an early time in their tenure? So I guess walk me through the

721
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:54,840
late nineties, you're obviously going for reelection. You won by quite a healthy margin,

722
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:01,080
but what were the string of events that allowed you to go from being still a relatively junior

723
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:07,800
senator to being, you could argue the second most powerful person in Washington after the president?

724
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:15,480
Yeah, it's an interesting sort of line narrative in large part because that was not my goal.

725
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,840
And if you're going to start with 100th and GRT and jump to number one in a period of

726
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:28,600
six years, that just sounds crazy. And it is crazy. And Lyndon Johnson did it, but he'd spent

727
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,360
all those years over in the House of Representatives, but they come in.

728
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:38,760
By the way, LBJ was generally considered one of the most effective Senate majority leaders.

729
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:45,480
Some people still wonder how he actually managed to take the vice presidency as such a step down.

730
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,680
And of course, how history would have been different had he not, but yeah.

731
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:55,160
Yeah. But the sequence of events was I won reelection at the time there, Bob Dole,

732
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:02,040
who is just an iconic leader as well. And Trent Lott and others were sort of the Trent

733
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:07,880
Lott representative, a younger generation, but all very senior to me were sort of added

734
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:13,960
to each other and competitive and sort of the intra-family politics and class office sort of

735
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:19,880
stuff. And I didn't pay any attention to that really. What I was interested in, and I use this

736
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,600
in different ways today now that I'm out of politics. So if I'm on a board, I like to go

737
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:31,720
to the nomination committee that the future of a body of an institution, if you really say,

738
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,840
how I want to affect a board, a nonprofit board or a for-profit board or the United States Senate,

739
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:42,440
a hundred people, the best thing to do is to get involved in the determination of who's in the

740
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:50,200
room and who is not. And therefore in leadership, the sort of fourth or fifth position down,

741
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,760
depending on how you look at it, in the row of Republicans, say there are about 50 Republicans

742
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:59,560
there, is a more political position called the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

743
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,960
But they're in charge of the 33 elections, that one person is, and they get selected by the body

744
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,880
to choose the next generation of senators. Not choose them, but you recruit them. And, you know,

745
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,200
I recruited Lamar Alexander, I recruited Elizabeth Dole, I recruited John Thun.

746
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,400
Maybe they would have ended up there, but maybe probably for most of them they would not.

747
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:28,280
And so I ran for a leadership office then, and that leadership, again, I came there to do policy,

748
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:33,960
to pass big stuff that would help people in health and welfare and lift them up in education.

749
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,520
So I said, let's do that position for two years, then I could come back and do policy the last

750
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:45,800
four. And so that year, six years in, between sixth and eighth year, we did what you implied,

751
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:51,480
or you suggested earlier, I ran that group, I represented the United States Senate in every

752
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:57,800
state, I had to raise money for the Senatorial Committee. But we won that year 11 seats,

753
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:06,120
11 Republican seats. It was the first midterm of George W. Bush. As you said earlier,

754
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:11,480
there's a huge bias for the Democrats to win. Right, but 9-11 shifted it, I'm sure.

755
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:21,880
It was all sorts of macro everything coming up. But we won, and we won big. And so I worked it

756
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,160
hard. And again, it's been a heart surgery, not trained to do that sort of thing. But I traveled

757
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:33,560
and I recruited people and I'd go to New York, I'd go to North Carolina, I'd go to Nebraska,

758
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,240
I'd sit down with 10 people who wanted to run the United States Senate, I'd spend hours with

759
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:42,360
them. I talked to their families and their spouses and say yes, and say this isn't going to work out

760
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:47,320
for you. And then I have to raise money as well, state to state and say this is important to support

761
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:52,760
these campaigns. And both parties have this. Is the expectation at that point that if you broke

762
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,840
even that would be a victory to not give up seats in your first midterm? No, no, no, no,

763
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,320
you were going, you were in it to win it. Yeah, no, well, no, the expectation was,

764
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:08,200
it's very unlikely to even break even in the first midterm of any party of the president, just,

765
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:13,880
you know, just historically nine out of 10 times loses seats. So I wanted to keep the losses to a

766
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:19,640
minimum. I wish I could say which to break even. But we won and we picked up seats. And with that,

767
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:26,120
I developed a certain credibility among my people. People weren't jealous of me either, because I'm

768
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:32,280
just a doctor doing his best. You know, good guy can bring people together, can bring the

769
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:38,040
Democrat can be Republican together. But, you know, when my historical precedent, not, you know,

770
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:44,120
nothing great in the family started breaking down. And without going into details, there was a lot of

771
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:50,520
dissension in the party. And it was mostly with behind closed doors in these caucuses. And when

772
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,800
it came to elect the majority leader, I again, I didn't want to be majority leader. It wasn't my

773
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:03,400
goal. In fact, if you go to be in leadership, it's hard to do big policy. It's hard to do the sort

774
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,920
of things I ended up doing HIV, AIDS, PEPFAR, these huge things that affect millions of people.

775
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:13,320
If you're the leader, you look at what McConnell, if you're whoever's the leadership,

776
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:17,240
Schumer and McConnell today, and whoever it will be, you know, as people listen to this in the

777
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:22,520
future, they don't have time to do the legislation or the policy. They're out there managing,

778
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,440
hurting these cats, being the leader. So I didn't want to do that. I only had 12,

779
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:31,160
I only had four years to go. I didn't want to spend four years hurting cats. But when it came

780
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:37,400
down to the election, there were five people who wanted to be majority leader. And all of them,

781
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:41,960
to be majority leader, you had a majority vote. And one might have 12 votes, and one might have

782
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:47,080
nine, and one might have eight, one had four and six, and then you get together with other people.

783
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,520
And I wouldn't have part of any of that. But then it got down to where nobody had the votes.

784
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:58,520
And people came to me and I had a group of people because I'd come off these Senate races with

785
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,240
credentials. They said, well, what about you? And then all of a sudden, all these, all four of the

786
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:08,760
other people came to me and said, if you will do it, they said, I can't win. And if you are

787
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,240
interested, we want you to be a majority leader. So I haven't really told that story publicly,

788
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,120
but I think it is important for people to humanize as the place. You know, this is no

789
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:23,400
different than elections and life and things are fair and things are unfair. And luck is a part of

790
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,560
it. But that's the that's the story. It did not have the credentials, didn't want it,

791
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:34,040
did want the two year job. So I could go back to policy, but the two year job did well, but got

792
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:39,640
lucky, really lucky. And one, and then at the end of the day, because in part because of this

793
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:44,360
doctor thing, they also saw me as somebody that is non-threatening. They said, this guy comes in,

794
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:50,440
I want to stay here forever. They would say to themselves, this is my job. This is my pinnacle

795
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:55,160
in life. And my pinnacle in life is doing heart transplants, you know, out the window, going to

796
01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:00,840
the Vanderbilt and saving lives every day by just doing my job. And but this was the pinnacle in

797
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:06,680
life to a lot of people. And so they probably said, well, you know, if I give him my people,

798
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,400
and I worked with him for four years, when I leave, I might be the one that he said should be

799
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,520
the next majority leader. As you alluded to earlier, these next four years while your Senate

800
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,880
majority leader are quite busy and potentially one of the signature things you're a part of is PEPFAR,

801
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:29,640
which you've alluded to now. I've always found it interesting how little Americans understand PEPFAR.

802
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,600
And yet, you know, when you talk to people in Africa, it's a very different picture you get

803
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,760
there, right? I mean, I think when you go to the parts of Africa that have been impacted by it,

804
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:47,080
they hold the administration in such high regard. And yet for some reason, it doesn't get, I think,

805
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,840
the attention it deserved domestically. Do you agree with my assessment? And if so,

806
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:56,040
why do you think that might be the case? I partially agree. Yeah. You know, PEPFAR.

807
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,800
Let's start with telling people what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're talking about HIV AIDS.

808
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:06,600
And it makes sense being the only doctor in the Senate that people would come to me early on. And

809
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:12,600
I had spent years going to Africa, spending two to three weeks a year, taking care of people,

810
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,800
doing surgery, training people, worked with a group called Samaritan's Purse initially,

811
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:23,720
and then other groups on my own and throughout Africa, mainly in South Sudan and a province

812
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,280
called the Louis Province there, but also in Ethiopia and South Africa and Botswana.

813
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:34,440
And I would see people dying there a lot. And there was no testing for HIV AIDS at the time.

814
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,480
And then I came to the United States Senate and worked with President Clinton. And President

815
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:44,360
Clinton said, yeah, it's a big issue. And we'd put maybe a couple of hundred million dollars into it,

816
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,880
but never did anything about it. And then this right wing, not really right wing, this middle,

817
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:56,520
but right wing George Bush came. And President Bush, this is 2000, had never been to Africa.

818
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:03,080
Maybe he'd been one time when his dad was president for a night. In conversations with him and other

819
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:07,240
people, Tony Fauci, who everybody's heard a lot about today, was a huge part of it. I'd bring

820
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:13,240
pictures back of people dying of HIV AIDS. But the story at that time was that three million people,

821
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:22,040
three million were dying every single year because of a little virus that in 1980, in 1981,

822
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:27,000
we didn't even know what it was. We had never seen it in the United States. But with three million

823
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,800
people dying of that and a couple of million dying of tuberculosis and one in malaria,

824
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:38,280
this was by far the biggest killer globally of a disease. And so President Bush basically listened

825
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,080
to the stories, focused on it, sent Tony Fauci down to Africa. You know, is this something we

826
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,560
could do something about? He came back in a surprise way at the State of the Union missions,

827
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:53,320
2003. When I was majority leader, I knew it and probably five or six other people knew it.

828
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,840
Basically said, I'm going to make the single largest commitment to a single disease that's

829
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:02,760
ever been made by a president of the United States. This little cagey virus, HIV AIDS.

830
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:10,760
At the time, Republicans and faith-based people, you know, thought it was a disease of gays and was

831
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:15,240
bad. And the Jesse Helms of the world basically said it was, you know, a call from God and

832
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:20,440
punishment and all. The left wasn't doing anything about it, but they talk about it,

833
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:27,880
but nobody would step. So President Bush, I wrote the Senate bill and I, but a lot of others got

834
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:33,080
together and passed this legislation about six months later in record time, jumping ahead. 20

835
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,360
million people are alive today because of that five page bill that surprised everybody coming

836
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,640
out of this president. And it's no small figure. I mean, we're talking, you said, you know,

837
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,160
Clinton put a hundred million into this. I mean, your bill put $60 billion into this,

838
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:51,960
if I'm not mistaken. Is that right? Oh, we were spending about 200 million a year. And again,

839
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:56,200
President Clinton was right on all the issues. And later after he left office, as you know,

840
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:01,000
made a big issue about it and still has done unbelievable things to the Clinton Foundation

841
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,080
for it. But at the time there were just so many other things going on. So it's been about 200

842
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:10,120
million. And then that first year with President Bush that we got it through the first year,

843
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:16,200
$3 billion and then $3 billion a year for five years. And then over time is the $65 billion

844
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,680
because subsequent presidents have continued with that program coming forward.

845
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:27,000
But the interesting thing is it came from way out to the right and it came from a people who brought

846
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,280
the left and the right together in a bipartisan way. And when I brought it to the floor of the

847
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:38,280
Senate, you know, it was close, but it was bipartisan and it passed. And when the house

848
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,400
passed it, so it will be legacy and legacy changing. And then the spinoffs from it,

849
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,960
all that money is spent. It's not just on HIV, age, it's on tuberculosis, malaria,

850
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:54,040
infrastructure, surveillance, putting clinics in cities and communities and villages and towns

851
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:58,280
all over the world, not just Africa, but Russia, China and around the world.

852
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:02,840
Now, one of the things that put you at a little bit of odds with the party was when you broke

853
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:09,560
with the party's views on stem cell research. Initially your view was in line with the Republican

854
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:15,320
Party, which was to be against stem cell research. You changed that view and in the process,

855
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:19,960
presumably upset people in the party. So I guess I'd start with what changed your mind.

856
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:25,240
Yeah, you know, it's interesting to sort of go through what stem cell research is because

857
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:30,840
the changing of the minds or the switching of positions or sort of the role of a senator is

858
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,640
one that's kind of worth going through. So I had come to the Senate as a position,

859
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,480
I know brain death well because all of them, I don't have patients, I'm involved in all of those.

860
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:47,000
I am in immunology. When I came to the Senate, I was in and did things like disability policy

861
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,280
and health. So people came to me on this particular issue coming in. And there was an

862
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:58,920
amendment back in 1996, which basically banned federal funding of embryonic stem cell research,

863
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:05,000
not adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells being the ones that were just discovered in 1998. So

864
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,880
this is fairly new at the time. And the beauty about those embryonic stem cells, they do something

865
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:14,520
that no other cell had ever done. And that is you could take it and it could become a liver or a

866
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:19,800
heart or a pancreas. You could kind of channel it in those directions. And the second thing,

867
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,280
it was like a, back in those days, we'd say it's like a copying machine. You can make unlimited

868
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:29,560
copies of it. No other cell ever in the history of man had we discovered. So then you had people

869
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:34,200
who said these cells are powerful, going back to the heart transplant. Why not take a few of those

870
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:39,080
stem cells, stick it in the heart, make that heart come alive. The problem is it had never been done

871
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:43,880
before. And ethically, people didn't know whether it can be done or should be done. But if you had

872
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:49,960
Parkinson's disease, neurodegenerative disease, the hope for everybody, including me as a scientist

873
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:54,760
who kind of lived in this world was tremendous. So the question was, how do you take these embryonic

874
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:02,120
stem cells and in an ethical construct, allow that research to go forward. And that was always the

875
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,560
issue. And do you do it with federal monies or you do it with state monies or local monies? So the

876
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,640
issue is all what happens at the federal level. See that amendment and then President Bush came

877
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:17,320
out in 2001 and he said, we're going to fund embryonic stem cells for the first time. We're

878
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:22,040
only going to do very little. We're going to limit it because we don't know if these cells are good

879
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:27,720
or bad. That's sort of one line. The more important line at the time was, is it ethical?

880
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:34,040
The embryonic stem cells, the only way you could get them is by creating an embryo and then

881
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:39,080
destroying the embryo. So you can see real quickly where this is going. You got pro-life, pro-choice,

882
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:45,640
50-50 in America. Pro-life people said that the embryo has the full genetic code. It is all you

883
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:51,800
got to do is nourish it. It is a human. It may be early on, but it's in the first stage of development.

884
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:57,320
So the ethical issues there were Americans believe that or half of America believes

885
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:04,680
it has sort of moral value of some sort. Do you allow embryo mills to be created? And so that's

886
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:10,120
where the ethical issue is, a fascinating issue. So Bush said, no, we can't do that. Let's restrict

887
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:15,000
the number of cells. And he said, here's 78 cell lines because they've already been created,

888
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,080
but let's not destroy any more embryos or create and destroy embryos. And so he limited 78 lines.

889
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:27,480
So I endorsed that. And about two months before that, and this was all written up in the

890
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:32,200
Wall Street Journal because it was all new science and political. I'd written,

891
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:39,320
gone to the floor of the Senate and said, I think that here by 10 principles, let's put them forward

892
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:45,880
and engage federal funding. State funding is okay. And local funding is okay. That's outside.

893
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:52,440
But for federal funding, let's limit it like Bush limited. He limited to 78 cell lines.

894
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:58,920
I said, instead of doing that, let's sort of stay with the times and use these blast

895
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,400
assists or these little embryos that are used in fertility clinics that are otherwise going

896
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:08,280
to be thrown away. But they're still, they're still pluripotent. These are still completely

897
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:13,800
pluripotent stem cells. Exactly. You create five of them. You implant a couple. The other three

898
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:20,360
are thrown away, discarded. So my argument in my 10 principles that I went to the floor in 2000

899
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:26,200
was that used those. So Bush came out with something different. He limited to 78 cell lines.

900
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:31,160
So I endorsed that because at least we were getting federal funding of stem cells. And then

901
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:35,480
we jumped four years later. And this is what's really interesting to me. And this is really

902
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,960
important, I think, for our senators today. Science changes over time. You learn things.

903
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:45,800
There are better techniques. There's evolution of knowledge. You clinical trials prove things.

904
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,680
And it got to be four years later that it was clear those 78 cell lines didn't work.

905
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,360
They were contaminated by mouse cells. Only about 22 of them ended up being good.

906
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:01,400
And therefore, what was intended to be sort of a limited opening of the door for federal funding,

907
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:07,480
in my mind, had failed because science had demonstrated those cell lines were not sufficient.

908
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:11,560
So I pulled my 10 principles back out, again went back to the floor of the Senate,

909
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,600
put those 10 principles out there. And the reason it became such a big politicized issue

910
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:22,760
is that President Bush did not agree with me and the majority of the Senate and the majority of the

911
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:29,000
House. We passed in 2005 a bill called the I think it was the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.

912
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:35,880
It passed. It says you could use these blastocysts. An ethical construct was set up. You got consent

913
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:43,160
set up. And then that bill passed, overwhelmingly bipartisan, but it was vetoed by President Bush.

914
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:50,520
And so then people said that Princeton and Bush are in totally different areas. But from the day one,

915
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,160
the embryonic stem cells to me have been a heart transplant, certainly one of the most exciting

916
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:59,960
science that had come by in 10 years. But when this whole ethical issue came up,

917
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:08,280
out of both my own beliefs, you know, when you have nascent life in an embryo and you had these

918
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:13,240
embryo mills being created, women were being paid $400 to create embryos to have them destroyed.

919
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:18,840
And there was no mechanism, discipline mechanism around that that we had to create that. And

920
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,440
ultimately it got created. And now we jump, you know, 10, 15 years later, the same principles that

921
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:29,880
I had put in in 2000 and 2005, the ones out there. And that's where that research has gone.

922
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:37,080
And in retrospect, it's probably been pretty good in the sense that the stem cells eventually are

923
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:43,320
going to live up to the promise, but we're 17 years later and adult stem cells are used in bone marrow

924
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:49,880
and cord blood is being used. That has no ethical issues around it. It's these embryonic stem cells.

925
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:54,840
And with the research that's out there, it's 17 years later and some good things are happening,

926
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:02,120
but still there's no embryonic stem cells being used to treat the Alzheimer's in Parkinson's.

927
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:08,440
Yeah. I mean, it's such a hard problem, right? The challenge is how do you instruct the stem cell?

928
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:15,240
Where is the instruction set that says, I want you to go and replicate 32 times, 32 doublings and

929
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:21,400
become cardiac myocytes. And this subset of you are going to go on to develop Prickinji fibers

930
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:28,120
and this set of you will not. I mean, we're still so far from cracking the code of what the

931
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:35,800
instruction set looks like to the stem cell. So this is step one of 10, basically, in terms of that.

932
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:40,920
But it's hard to tell people that. And as a policymaker, you have to make the decision. You

933
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,600
have to set up the construct or you're not going to fund funding, but you literally have thousands

934
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:52,120
of people who are dying and they have the chronic diseases and then they have a group of people

935
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:58,120
telling them that within two years, this was all in early 2000s, within two years, your Parkinson's

936
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:04,040
could be or your neurological injuries severing of the spinal cord can be cured with these cells.

937
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:09,000
And therefore we need to open up the field and forget destruction of embryos or all these moral

938
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:15,160
concepts of life. And that's the tough job of a policymaker. You got a hundred regular people

939
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:22,600
who, some are smart, some are not, that are maybe not perfectly representative of people,

940
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:28,360
but they got to make these decisions. So it's the sort of thing that at the end of the day,

941
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:33,640
we increased federal funding for stem cells, constructs were put around it, imperfect. His

942
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:39,640
approach was different than mine. People made a big deal about it at the time, but at the end of

943
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:45,560
the day, I think it ended up working out pretty, pretty well and learned a lot. And it comes back

944
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:52,520
to science a lot. And these fields that are just so promising. I mentioned synthetic biology and

945
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:58,600
we think of CRISPR technology today and the creation of kids with blue eyes and brains that

946
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:04,120
are good in math and all, all of which we could do. But how do you slow that down? How do you bring

947
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:10,440
the discussions, not just to the capital and not just to the academic centers, but to, to Main

948
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:15,880
Street and get the right ethical constructs. And that's what our policy, I'm not a policymaker now

949
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:21,800
in that sense, but that's what these people in Washington do. That's what we hire them to do.

950
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,240
And that's what we need to hold them accountable and they need to do it the best way they can at

951
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:31,000
point in time. So things are going to shift with time. In that particular one, I luckily, I did

952
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,120
the same 10 principles in 2000 as I did in 2005 when I passed the bill. It got vetoed by the way,

953
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,240
so I lost, but ultimately back under President Obama, the same bill was taken out and passed.

954
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:47,080
What are the restrictions on a president's ability to veto? Can a president veto any amount of

955
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:52,040
majority, any Senate majority? He can, if the 99 senators are in favor of a bill, the president can

956
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:57,000
still veto it. Well, yeah, it's a good point because you, if you could have a majority of the votes for

957
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:02,200
it or a super majority, but you have to have two thirds or three points come back. So if you veto,

958
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:06,520
you have to take a whole nother vote and then override that veto. So he or she has that

959
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:14,840
intervening time to put pressure on people and change that. Another very complex issue that you

960
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:20,520
weighed in on, which ties into your past, which is this idea of end of life, right? I mean,

961
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,640
it's funny, I remember a really complicated case when I was in medical school at Stanford,

962
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:34,040
which involved a patient who was more or less brain dead, but there was a very complicated

963
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:39,560
family dynamic. And I don't, I don't remember the exact details, but it was one of those scenarios

964
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,440
where every ethicist in the hospital had been in that room to try to talk to that

965
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:50,920
family and resolve the withdrawal of support. And interestingly, even though this case had

966
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:57,320
nothing to do with cardiac surgery, ultimately the person that came in and mediated it was Bruce

967
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:03,560
Wright. And it's an interesting story because again, here's Bruce Wright. At the time he was

968
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,920
the chair of cardiac surgery at Stanford. He had by now come back from Hopkins and you know him. So

969
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:12,920
this probably isn't surprising to you, but you don't think of like the chair of cardiac surgery

970
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:19,160
being the warm fuzzy, but he was like the most soft-spoken human alive. Like you would never

971
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,920
see him and think that that's the guy who did the first heart lung transplant or anything like that.

972
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,360
But it was sort of like, I don't know, he spent, you know, two hours with this family and everybody

973
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:33,000
had come to a point of comfort that in the case of that patient support should be withdrawn.

974
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:39,640
So of course, as a transplant surgeon, you are intimately familiar with what the criteria are

975
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:45,640
for brain death, what makes a donor, what does not make a donor, et cetera. And so again, here you

976
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:51,800
are now Senate majority leader and a very public case comes up. This case of this young woman,

977
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,880
Terry Shivo, and I guess just for folks who don't remember this, and you can correct me on some of

978
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:01,560
the details, but my recollection, because I was in residency, this was such a big discussion for us.

979
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,560
This is a young, healthy woman who I guess unbeknownst to a lot of people had an eating

980
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:12,520
disorder. So she had bulimia and through lots of repetitive purging had developed profound

981
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:18,920
hypokalemia. So very low potassium. So she's otherwise looks perfectly healthy on the outside,

982
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:24,680
but I believe her potassium got as low as two to 2.5 milliequivalents, which not surprisingly put

983
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:29,400
her into an immediate cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. By the time the paramedics arrive

984
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:34,520
and resuscitate her because she's so young and healthy, they can get her heart beating again,

985
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:41,880
but her brain has been without oxygen for minutes. No one really knows. This was in 1990,

986
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:50,360
if my memory serves me correctly, fast forward a few years. Now her husband, Michael and her

987
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,120
parents, whose names I don't remember, are basically having a different point of view

988
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:58,760
about what to do. And the husband believes, you know, she's going to be in a persistent vegetative

989
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,240
state for the rest of her life. This is not what her wishes were. She's being fed through a tube.

990
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:09,080
The parents feel otherwise, and it just keeps escalating its way through courts and it gets

991
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:13,640
higher and higher and higher and higher. I don't remember exactly how it got to the point where

992
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:17,560
Congress was now being asked to weigh in, but maybe you can pick up the story of how this

993
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:22,680
basically rose to a national story and frankly, even potentially involve the US Congress.

994
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,640
Yeah, it is a fascinating story. And this is one again, and Peter, I haven't

995
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:34,040
talked about a lot in part because it is complicated and you do need the sort of the

996
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:37,720
time and we can do it very quickly, but. No, no, no, we don't have to do it quickly. Yeah, yeah,

997
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,680
you know. But now it is fascinating case and because it has implications for everybody listening

998
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:50,520
to us today, everybody, and it will be having even greater implications in the future as technology

999
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:56,360
can do these miraculous things. Here it was miraculous in the sense that she could even be

1000
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:02,120
kept alive on a ventilator for a long period of time. But increasingly, it's going to get more

1001
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:06,920
complex because technology and science is going to give us these tools to use. So lots of lessons,

1002
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:12,920
and so it is worth going through it. So you're exactly right. 1990 Terry Shavo collapsed hypokalemia

1003
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:19,960
for just a persistent vegetative state is a medical term. It's an important term here because

1004
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:25,960
the law uses it. But for people who are listening to us, you know, you're on a ventilator and you

1005
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:31,800
can move and I open your eyes, but it's just you have to be supported overall with both feeding

1006
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:37,160
tube as well as a ventilator. And Michael, her husband, you know, did everything, at least in

1007
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:43,080
my review at the time. He took her to UCLA, took her to multiple centers and for rehabilitation.

1008
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:48,040
And then three years later in 1993, he'd given up basically. And I don't know, I wouldn't have

1009
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:54,920
both found me. And this is 10 years later that I got involved. And but the issue was exactly as you

1010
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:04,680
described that all of Terry's blood relatives, the mother, the father, the brother, the sister

1011
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:11,640
objected to Michael putting her on a DNR or removing the tube. Do not resuscitate or remove

1012
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:17,640
the tube. So you had this dichotomy of walking the room just like you said Bruce did. You had on one

1013
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:24,680
side one person who by the law says if she's in a persistent vegetative state, the husband can make

1014
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:30,600
the decision. On the other side of the room, you had all the mother and father who raised her,

1015
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:37,800
who cared for her brother, her sister, who said, no, she's responding to us. She's alive, touch her,

1016
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:44,680
feel her, look in her eyes. She recognizes us. And so the parents and Michael disagreed on

1017
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:49,960
their impression. They also disagreed because she had, and this is what the implication is,

1018
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:55,080
everybody listened to sort of this part, she had nothing written down. She had no living will,

1019
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:00,760
no advance directive. And therefore you had the parents and everybody says, well, of course,

1020
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:06,840
she's a devout Catholic. She values life. And you had the four of them saying, you know,

1021
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:11,080
we'll support her, we'll take care of it, financially we'll take care of it. And then you

1022
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:17,480
had Michael who by the law would have that responsibility of saying DNR or not.

1023
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,920
I just want to interject there for a second. I think it's such an important point you made,

1024
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:23,960
and I had actually scribbled notes down to bring it up, so I'm glad you did.

1025
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:32,520
I don't think you and I as doctors could overstate the importance of an advance directive enough.

1026
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:38,840
And I think a lot of these issues could be resolved if, well, you don't have to worry

1027
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,920
about it, you go through this exercise. I mean, my wife and I did this 12 years ago,

1028
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:49,560
sat there in a lawyer's office and spent an hour going through what we wanted and what we didn't

1029
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:54,840
want down to the levels of detail that is comical, right? Now, not everybody has the luxury that

1030
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:58,440
might not have the medical, my wife's a nurse. So, you know, we could talk about it through,

1031
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:02,600
well, this is, I would tolerate this many line changes at this many weeks of a trach and this

1032
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:07,720
feeding tube, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But it is very important, I think, to do this. And

1033
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:12,520
hospitals are getting better at it now for people admitted electively to at least have a box that

1034
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:17,720
you check that says, do you have an advanced directive? But I think everybody should have one

1035
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:23,880
of these things because the time to build the roof is when the sun is shining. And the time to have

1036
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:29,320
this discussion is when clear heads prevail. And it's hard, you just have to do it. People don't

1037
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:35,880
like to think about death or where they're going to be buried or wills. This is one that out of

1038
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:41,320
respect for your loved ones. And it plays out here. And I'll mention again, because I'll come

1039
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:46,040
back to it because it had real implications. But they had nothing, the interpretation of

1040
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:50,600
one set of relatives and then the husband were very different. So, jump ahead seven years,

1041
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:56,680
her feeding tube was taken out, then a court, these courts that you said came in and they replaced it.

1042
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:01,560
At the time then, 33 medical specialties, and this is why I had to go back and review all this

1043
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:07,960
eventually, came forward and had affidavits that her condition was not beyond some sense of

1044
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:14,600
recovery that she could improve. And so, seeing that complicates things a little bit because she's

1045
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:20,600
in this either minimally conscious state or persistent vegetative state. So, in 2003,

1046
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:26,120
the court ordered five doctors, these are state courts, ordered five doctors to test Terry,

1047
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:31,480
two appointed by Michael, the husband, and two appointed by the family. And then one

1048
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:36,520
appointed by the judge, three to two, they said she was in a persistent vegetative state,

1049
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:40,200
they'll be okay to withdraw therapy, take the tube out, take her off the ventilator.

1050
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:47,000
The two who voted against that said no, she's in a minimally conscious state and can recover.

1051
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:53,480
So, she stayed alive for about six days and during this six days, it became this huge global issue.

1052
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:59,160
It went to the state of Florida, the state, the equivalent of their house and senate,

1053
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:04,520
the legislators got together and actually passed a law in that six-day period that gave

1054
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:10,680
governor, Governor Bush at that time, the order to put the feeding tube back in.

1055
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:16,280
All this is over a six-day period. The Supreme Court there struck that down. And again, this

1056
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:21,640
is kind of the politics and you say, oh gosh, as you said, the Bruce Wright's of the world,

1057
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:26,760
these sorts of decisions as a physician, and I'm talking about one who's run disability policy for

1058
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,320
America, who's been in brain death, who's been in the whole field of transplant, whose whole

1059
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:37,080
career has been around life or death. These decisions should best be made by a family with

1060
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:43,960
a directive, with a physician or a caregiver, maybe with a faith person in that room. But this got

1061
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:50,920
elevated throughout the politics. You had Pope John Paul made a statement on behalf of the family

1062
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:55,080
and the sanctity of life and that they would support her and that was their belief.

1063
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:59,080
The brother, the sister, the parents said, keep her alive and that they would support it financially.

1064
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:04,600
Somebody gave $2 million or said they would give $2 million to support her. So that's that. So of

1065
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,200
course, coming back, being the only doctor in the Senate, and maybe it was one more at the time,

1066
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,840
and knowing brain death, I was involved in all those discussions. And when I was at Stanford,

1067
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:19,000
the ethical issues, the disability policy, the only physician. So I didn't want to do it because

1068
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,080
I don't think it should be done. It should be really rare, really exceptional, but this had

1069
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:29,080
become a global issue on the news every night. And again, it was a long time ago at this point,

1070
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:34,840
2003. So I asked myself at that point, does the government have the right to terminate life

1071
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,960
when the family objects to it, if they'll financially take it? And that was kind of

1072
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:45,000
where I came down to. And the question is, which part of the family do you listen to? The one that

1073
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:52,280
the law would give it to, ultimately, it would be the husband or all of the siblings and the loved

1074
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:57,880
ones and the people who lived with her and taken care of her and large, large part. And it's a

1075
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:02,760
little bit like coming back to the transplant world. If I walked into a room to remove a donor

1076
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:07,160
heart to bring it back to Vanderbilt to transplant it, and I walked in the room and the patient was

1077
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:12,360
there in the operating room. And there was a spouse who said, no, she said, take the heart.

1078
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:18,520
It's okay. But the rest of the family said, no, we don't want you to desecrate, you know, the body

1079
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,680
of our loved ones and take the heart. Even though the law would say I could do it, you know,

1080
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:26,760
under these donor laws that we have, I wouldn't do it. Of course I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't,

1081
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:32,040
to me, it's just not the right thing. So what did I do? Have you ever been in a situation like that,

1082
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:38,680
by the way, where the legal spouse, the person with the legal right to authorize the transplant

1083
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:45,560
says yes, and a group of others say no? It's fairly fair. As you can imagine, it's fairly

1084
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:49,960
rare, but it's common. And so no, I did not. I would not take off in the airplane tonight

1085
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:57,560
if I knew talking to the donor counselors up there that the family disagreed, although legally,

1086
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:03,240
it says so I avoided it totally. And others may have done it, but I would not do it. But yes,

1087
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:07,880
it's not that, you know, as you can imagine, you get six members of a family and they all disagree

1088
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:11,720
about something unless you have a Bruce Wright's walk out and you've described that well. So the

1089
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:15,720
first thing I'd go faster. The first thing I did is I called the last neurologist to examine her.

1090
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:19,640
And he said she's not in a persistent vegetative state. It's a mentally conscious state.

1091
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,760
What is the difference there? I mean, I want to just kind of make sure some people understand

1092
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:27,880
what we're talking about. She has some brainstem function. For example, if you touched her cornea,

1093
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:33,080
she'd blink. Presumably if you injected ice water in her ears, you'd get a doll's eye reflex.

1094
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:38,520
Did she have a gag reflex? She had a minimal gag reflex, which, you know, so she had,

1095
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:45,160
the definition is not by a single test. So it is a clinical test. And there are certain tests that

1096
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:49,800
you just ran through, three of them. There are certain tests that you do, but things like an MRI

1097
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:54,440
and PET scan, she hadn't had any of that. She ultimately had them after she died and she did

1098
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:58,760
have very, very serious disease, but it's a tough diagnosis and that's the world we live in.

1099
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:04,440
Oh, so that CT scan that we see of her head that shows basically it's mostly fluid. There's no

1100
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:10,040
brain matter. That was post-mortem. Yeah, after. See, that was after. Six months later, because

1101
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:14,840
then it all surged up again, as you can imagine. So to talk to the neurologist, he was just having

1102
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:19,320
me the last neurologist. I personally, as majority of you are met with a brother, he was clearly

1103
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:24,200
going to be coming to us. The house had already sort of called for the case. I talked to the family

1104
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:29,640
and the family said, don't terminate her. I looked at the medical records again, just because I was

1105
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:34,280
curious about it. And it was clear that she had not had an MRI, had not had a CT scan, had not

1106
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:39,640
done any of the current things. Remember this happened back in 1990. So I checked what I did.

1107
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:44,600
It was there now. And so I checked with the Senate leadership. Harry Reid was the Democrat at the time,

1108
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:52,600
became bipartisan, the house led on a bill. I'll come back to what the bill was. And we had a bill

1109
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:56,440
and it was bipartisan. It was supported unanimously in the United States Senate,

1110
01:43:56,440 --> 01:44:03,880
overwhelming majority, both parties in the House of Representatives. And 15 neurologists had signed

1111
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,680
an affidavit and all of that that said she needed an independent current evaluation that she hadn't

1112
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:13,640
been evaluated recently. So really controversial, even among my staff, they said, what in the world

1113
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:19,240
are we doing? And I said, I know, you know, but this has come to us and it's at an issue that

1114
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:24,600
cannot be resolved. And I said, it should be rare. It should be decided locally the way,

1115
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:29,480
you know, for 20 years in medicine that I'd been able to decide life and death decisions,

1116
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:34,520
which I was in this field that you do. Bill passed unanimously in the Senate, in the House,

1117
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:42,440
I think it was like 210 to 50 something bipartisan. What it did, the bill itself guaranteed a process

1118
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:47,880
and not an outcome. And so it basically didn't say keep her alive. It basically said she needs

1119
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:54,280
an exam that is truly independent, not with courts and not done by politicians. And once that exam

1120
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:59,160
is done, if she's in a persistent vegetative state, then remove the tube if that's what the

1121
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:03,880
husband wanted. And if not, the family should be listened to the extended family should be

1122
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:08,920
lifted to. So the outcome, it passed the United States Senate, it went to the federal courts,

1123
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:14,120
they denied the petition and the feeding tube was removed, and she was allowed to die.

1124
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:20,440
So that's the story. So it's an interest you went in and on reflection, you know, again,

1125
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:24,200
publicly, I don't go through this. And I've written some about it, because I've written a

1126
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:31,320
lot about brain death issues and persistent vegetative state. But as a policymaker, it the

1127
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:42,920
story captures this sometimes necessary conflict and this very real tension between the rule of law

1128
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:49,880
and the law basically said, well, the husband can decide, and this broader consideration of ethics

1129
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:57,880
and morality and in this world of increasing technology and the ambiguity of not having any

1130
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,200
sort of thing written down. So in retrospect, people ask me because a lot of people say that's

1131
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:07,160
got to be the biggest mistake you did in 12 years. And I say I kind of just avoid it and move on.

1132
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:13,720
But in retrospect, the fact that it had come, I'd probably do the same thing and pass the same bill,

1133
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:18,440
set up a process and not an outcome. And I was the only person in the Senate at the time who

1134
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:23,000
taken two oaths. And one of those oaths was to the Constitution, the life, liberty, pursuit of

1135
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,120
happiness, the oath that all those 62 lawyers and everybody take in the Senate. But I'd also

1136
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:35,240
taken this other oath, this Hippocratic oath to protect life and to do no harm. And when it's,

1137
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:39,640
when there's ambivalence around that, and when the family wishes otherwise, and it's true

1138
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:46,440
ambivalence, I will opt on life. And I will opt on what I would interpret as life, others may not.

1139
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:52,040
And this has got to be exceptional and rare and it has been in retrospect, and those kind of cases

1140
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:58,600
haven't made it back to Congress. And these decisions clearly, clearly, clearly are best made

1141
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:04,040
locally. The other challenge, I'll close on that is the politics made it worse because you had

1142
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:10,520
the Chris Matthews of the world who would go out every night and, you know, big sort of Democrat

1143
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:15,160
and sort of after people and he would, he would say, here you have Senator Prist, Prist playing

1144
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:19,800
doctor in the United States Senate. You know, he's one of those other Republicans. And then the

1145
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,720
Republicans would shoot back from the House and say, oh, this is a great case because it shows

1146
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:31,880
right to life. What I did and what I tried to do with these, and it's hard to do, is to separate

1147
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:38,840
the politics from the policy, to separate the politics from the science. And it shows, this

1148
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:45,880
case shows that this inherent tension and challenge to our policymakers who are, are,

1149
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:51,480
whether it's at the state level or local level or federal level, are given our trust to make

1150
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:57,720
decisions like this and to have appropriate oversight. The decision should be locally though,

1151
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:03,560
as much as possible. Yeah. I mean, I definitely agree with that. My personal views notwithstanding

1152
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:09,240
on this case, which is that I think that I can't understand how a CT scan wasn't done, you know,

1153
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:14,200
in the late nineties, frankly, to have, you know, made it so obvious as to what the state of her

1154
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:20,120
brain was. I think the interesting point here is that you were probably the least political in my

1155
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:26,120
view in that because that's the advantage of being in your final term in a Senate when you've

1156
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:30,200
publicly declared you'll never run for another office is you don't technically have a political

1157
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:36,120
dog in the fight anyway. So even though your viewpoint was viewed as political, actually,

1158
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:40,760
I think it was, those were your personal views and people are free to disagree with them or agree

1159
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:45,400
with them. But I didn't think of it as necessarily a party view because you, I don't think there was

1160
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:51,000
anybody in the US Senate that had less of a stake in what the party felt. That was just sort of, you,

1161
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,560
you were voting your conscience and we may disagree with that, but I don't think it was political.

1162
01:48:55,560 --> 01:49:01,880
Yeah. And, you know, you know, issues, all the issues and even with impeachment back in the past,

1163
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:09,400
people have a hard time understanding that politics is a part of our democracy. And you wish,

1164
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:14,600
and with things so partisan, everybody wished, not everybody, but so many of us wish you could push

1165
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:19,800
this extreme partisanship out of it. But even things like impeachment, there's a political

1166
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:24,760
nature to it. It was intended to have this political thing and politics and policy can't

1167
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:29,560
be separated totally. And that's why I come back to this tension that has to be there and this

1168
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:34,920
discernment and this past experience and not arguing, you know, the law to the extreme that

1169
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:40,600
you can't see a larger picture because laws are imperfect as well. And that's the sort of

1170
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:47,240
representatives that I think we do, we need to aspire to and then elect and have people get

1171
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:52,440
involved enough in politics that they can elect those sorts of people to these bodies of Congress,

1172
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:59,160
of Senate or governors or state assemblies. It's so hard to believe that we are now in the

1173
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:06,600
20th year since 9-11. I want to go back to that Tuesday morning for you, because I think anyone

1174
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:12,920
can remember, you know, anyone of a certain age can remember every detail of it. But I can't imagine

1175
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:17,880
what it's like to have been a member of the United States government at the time, let alone a senator.

1176
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:22,600
What do you remember about that morning and what was running through your mind as

1177
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:30,120
this thing was unfolding? I still have nightmares about it. We all have the anxiety, like we feel

1178
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:36,200
with, you know, COVID and other things, but the nightmares experience of having an assault

1179
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:45,320
that we have no idea how big it is, how deadly it can be, coupled with being in a position of having

1180
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:51,000
to make decisions at that point in time. You're a United States senator. The security at that time

1181
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:57,800
rests 100% with the president and a co-equal branch of government, the Congress,

1182
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:04,920
and with inadequate information, no information having to make decisions there. So the fright of

1183
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:11,160
it, my first thoughts when it hit, I was out in front of the Capitol and over to another senator's

1184
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:17,960
office in the first plane hit and I fly and fly a lot. And it'd be really unusual for somebody to

1185
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:23,080
hit a building, World Trade Center, but it could be done or it could be a suicide mission.

1186
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:27,720
You even thought that during the first, because when the first plane hit, I remember, I was in

1187
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:32,840
the trauma bay at Hopkins and I remember someone coming in and saying it and I had just assumed

1188
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:38,680
it was like a Cessna had hit on a foggy day. Did you know that it was an actual passenger plane?

1189
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:43,560
No, not at first. I was in an adjacent room. I was outside of the Capitol in an adjacent room

1190
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:47,560
and somebody just said, you know, should you stop your meeting because the plane hit the cap,

1191
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:53,640
same thing is what you said. Then when we figured out that it was an airliner and then shortly

1192
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:58,920
thereafter the second one hit, I was in leadership at the time. I was in the top five of leadership

1193
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:03,480
at that time doing the Senatorial Committee. So at that level, you get briefings beyond what

1194
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:07,960
other senators get. And then when you're a majority leader, you give a different higher level

1195
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:14,840
briefings. So I knew that a lot was going on in the world and that there was a lot of noise on

1196
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:20,440
the internet, but not nothing that you'd think about, but I knew the capacity that this wasn't

1197
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:24,200
just like a small thing. This was really going to reflect the world. And then when there were two,

1198
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:29,960
always when there are two in life, there's going to be a third in these sorts of things. And so

1199
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:35,480
that was it. So my first thoughts were that the second was, and at the same time and probably

1200
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:41,000
really first were my kids because my kids were in school over in Washington over near where the

1201
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,520
vice president lives. And it's near the cathedral. And I knew if they're going after us to go after

1202
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:51,880
Pentagon, they're going to hit any sort of symbolic sites and that they went to school right there. So

1203
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:57,000
of course, concern to worry about them. And then that was it. Then there was this long period of

1204
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:03,880
time where we got together and were shepherded to an offsite secure location. And people, there's

1205
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:09,320
certain people in leadership that are identified. So if there is an atomic bomb or if something

1206
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:14,520
happens, we can refashion government. So those people are taken to a secure location.

1207
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:22,040
A few senators, a few House members, a few Supreme Court justices, the president or the vice president.

1208
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:29,000
And I was not part of that particular group, but it was at that level. And it was as intense as

1209
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:35,400
anything in the surgery that had gone awry that I'd ever done. And I wouldn't panic there,

1210
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:41,720
but this world of not having any information, no intelligence, essentially no intelligence,

1211
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:45,640
and not knowing where it's coming from and not knowing what was going to sue over the next 12

1212
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:49,720
hours. And it's different than anything at the operating room at the table. And there you're

1213
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:57,080
doing life and death things every day. This was different. Do you recall like what you went through

1214
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:02,440
over the next two or three days? Because I mean, I think back to it and I've been thinking a lot

1215
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:07,080
about as we approach the 20 year anniversary, the stuff I want to talk about with my daughter who

1216
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:12,440
obviously was born after. And in some ways it feels like it was yesterday because there are things

1217
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:19,000
about 9 11 I remember as though they literally happened a week ago. Like there, I remember

1218
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:24,840
exactly where I stood. I remember exactly what the TV looked like. I remember moments that evening,

1219
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:29,320
cause none of us left the hospital for two days. You still were in a state of, are there going to

1220
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:34,760
be people coming here? Do we need to be here? And then there are other things that are a total blur.

1221
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:42,280
So I can only imagine in your situation that's amplified a hundred X, but do you also have

1222
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:48,760
sort of pockets of that period of time that are almost a blur or does everything still sort of

1223
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:53,960
fit nice and neatly and linearly into your recollection of the weeks that unfolded from that?

1224
01:54:54,600 --> 01:55:00,520
Yeah, no, it's an interesting question. I think the difference was that we knew we had to act.

1225
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:05,560
And the first thing that we needed to do quickly, we didn't know if this was a single actor,

1226
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:11,240
a single state, a single group, a country, multiple countries, and we didn't have the

1227
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:16,920
intelligence. And so once we found out we didn't have the intelligence, which was, was pretty quick.

1228
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:22,680
We had to pretty much assume that we were going to all be taken out. And by us, it's not us. We

1229
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:26,840
don't matter, but it's the United States of America. So you go after New York, you go after

1230
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:32,360
Washington, D.C., you destroy the Congress, you find the president. So ours was how in the first

1231
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:40,840
six hours, eight hours, actually that night, how we could display to the world that this is terrible

1232
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:48,040
and unprecedented and has to be addressed. And so we said, how do you do that? So we all stayed at

1233
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:54,600
the Capitol. We went to the front steps of the Capitol. And this is the sort of thing that does

1234
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:59,960
bring Democrat and Republicans together. I mean, really close to together and nothing else sort of

1235
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:03,720
matters. We're talking about the safety and security of our country and maybe the

1236
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:09,080
existential, the future of our country. And so we went out and I remember obviously the,

1237
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:14,360
the people you think are, are, who are there, the leadership was there, of course. And the people

1238
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:20,040
were there, but the John Lewis's of the world, you know, spoke and we displayed to the world

1239
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:24,760
that, that you can try to take us out, but you can't take us out. And I think that was really

1240
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:29,240
important. We did that after the anthrax attacks, other attacks, we sort of did that. But I think

1241
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:33,960
it's really important to make that statement to the world to, to stand strong. And then it was,

1242
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:38,360
it was, it was, but once we knew we could reconstitute government, if something worse

1243
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:44,120
happened, it really was just sort of systematic of up and run. This is how much intelligence we have,

1244
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:49,000
making decisions, should we hit how fast we should hit, should we hit it all coming back?

1245
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,360
If we hit what's going to come at us next? So it was a busy time. And then I had family, as I said,

1246
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:58,520
that, that was always in the back of my mind, just being in Washington, DC.

1247
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:06,840
One of the things that you said that really stands out to me is the amazing lack of partisanship

1248
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:13,800
that existed for a brief window of time following the attacks of 9 11. And obviously you could say,

1249
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:21,400
well, it was an external attack directed directly at the United States. But does it surprise you

1250
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:28,760
that a pandemic like COVID didn't have any of that effect of unifying the country? There was,

1251
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:34,680
I can't, at least politically, it doesn't seem to have done anything to have unified

1252
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:39,800
people. It's driven people further apart. And yet it's an enormous existential crisis. Do you think

1253
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:46,920
this is different because a pandemic is not a nation state and it doesn't affect the U.S.

1254
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:56,520
exclusively? I think when you can externalize your enemy or the assailant in some way,

1255
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:03,080
brings people together. You've got an image, you can create an image. They're, they're out there.

1256
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:08,840
There's somebody there. There's an embodiment of something that, that is external to you that you

1257
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:17,000
can project towards and receive sort of incoming on. When you have the virus itself, you don't have

1258
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:26,680
that because the virus is this cagey little thing that knows no borders, that is truly global, that

1259
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:34,040
does, does not discriminate at all. And there's no sort of externalization of it. There's no sort

1260
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:39,800
of setting it up and putting it on the table and saying, saying, let's do it. I think the other,

1261
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:46,120
the other big thing, and there's no reason to get into the politics of it, I think the leadership

1262
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:51,800
was different as well in our government. The communication was very different. And that,

1263
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:57,560
to me, has been the most disappointing. When I look at the big assaults on our country

1264
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:04,840
that were on our soil here, whether it was anthrax with 14 or 15 people dying here and hit our

1265
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:13,160
capital, whether it is 9-11 and now the pandemic, my biggest disappointment has been the lack,

1266
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:18,120
or maybe just the difference in the type of leadership that was demonstrated. And it's

1267
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:23,480
leadership slash communication, how things are articulated and the like. And I think that plays

1268
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:29,880
a big role. I think that if there had been a call to action with appropriate communication,

1269
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:36,600
leadership, trust, empathy, understanding that this pandemic could have been externalized,

1270
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:41,800
and we would probably have more rallying around it instead of this, you know, what you see on

1271
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:46,680
social media and internet and television, which continues to this day.

1272
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:58,280
In 2005, you quite accurately predicted what we're seeing now. You referenced the 1918 Spanish flu,

1273
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:06,280
and you said it was not a question of if, but rather a question of when we would experience

1274
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:15,640
another pandemic, another virus specifically. You very astutely pointed out that these 10 things

1275
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:19,480
are basically going to happen. There's going to be complete and total social chaos. There's going

1276
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:26,600
to be supply chain disruption, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And a pandemic preparedness strategy

1277
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:33,320
should include stockpiles of antiviral medications, all of these other things. It's easy to blame

1278
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:40,440
one party or the other, but the reality of it is no administration's really ever taken that seriously,

1279
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:46,200
have they? People have taken it seriously. I'd say both administrations have, and this may come

1280
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:53,640
back to where we started, that my experience coming in was colored by things like HIV AIDS,

1281
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:59,320
killing three million people a year, was characterized by anthrax, which when it hit

1282
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:05,880
the Capitol and knowing the potential of what it could do. The lack of preparedness was just

1283
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:11,080
crystal clear to me just based on my past experience. And so what I did in 2005, as you

1284
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:16,040
said, 20 different speeches I gave, all basically out the same speech, but I gave them on the East

1285
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:21,560
Coast, West Coast, Silicon Valley, the Florida United States Senate, far reaches like Nantucket,

1286
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:26,840
the red forest of California, everywhere. It was essentially the same speech, as you said. It was

1287
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:33,320
called the Manhattan Project. It did predict it was going to come because of this admixture of birds

1288
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:39,480
and animals and transportation around the world. So it's clear. It's clear from a medical standpoint.

1289
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:45,240
And just to be clear, you thought it was inevitable just from these factors, not necessarily even

1290
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:50,200
bioterrorism. I mean, you were thinking that would be another potential way, but it was, yeah.

1291
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:54,440
Yeah. And I used the bioterrorism a little bit because I'd talk about that as well,

1292
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:59,320
because you could intentionally manufacture any of this. You hook it onto a virus or hook it onto

1293
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:03,720
smallpox where you have something that's real transmissible. And it's not that hard to do. It's

1294
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:10,440
real easy to do. You can do it in a room, 8 by 12 foot room with simple things. And so the

1295
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:17,960
bioterrorism at the time, because of 9-11 and all the things that had gone on, it was clear we needed

1296
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:21,640
to worry about that, especially with smallpox, because Russia had a supply of smallpox it could

1297
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:25,960
use. But no, this was outside of that. This was sort of coupled with that, because the same things

1298
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:32,760
that you need are the communications, the infrastructure, the stockpiling, the virology,

1299
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:39,400
the research and development, the antiviral agents, the manufacturing capacity, all the things.

1300
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:43,240
These are all the things that as I say to them now, people say, oh, yeah, check, check, check.

1301
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:49,560
That's with COVID. And the point is, and I called it a Manhattan Project in each of these speeches.

1302
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:55,720
And as I said on the floor, I left the Senate the next year and work has been done and people

1303
02:02:55,720 --> 02:03:01,560
have tried to do pieces of it, but nobody has really stayed on it. But the six proposals I

1304
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:07,560
testified before, Lamar Alexander's committee, about the next pandemic, about three months ago,

1305
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:11,560
because right now is the time we have to talk about the next pandemic, there will be another

1306
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:17,160
pandemic. And will we be prepared? And we all know, and especially political people, that,

1307
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:22,600
you know, it's only the snake that's at your foot that you're scared of. Once the snake goes off in

1308
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:30,600
the trees, you just lose that sense of sort of urgency there. So from the scientific standpoint,

1309
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:36,520
I mean, that wasn't any great. I mean, we say this like I could say it, I wrote it down

1310
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:40,520
and I wrote what we should do and what we should do, we didn't do. And therefore, it's, you know,

1311
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:45,800
it's interesting to go back. My biggest fear is that you write that same talk and you give that

1312
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:51,320
same talk or somebody does, and there's nothing done after that. And I don't think that'd be the

1313
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:57,800
case, but it's going to take, you know, a constituents and people saying this is an

1314
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:02,840
existential threat. This is, you know, this COVID thing is not a deadly virus. I mean,

1315
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:09,320
I say that. I mean, that's my fear, right? Is we kind of, and you say this and it sounds horrible,

1316
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:17,160
but we dodged a bullet here. This virus is quite a wimpy virus relative to the Spanish flu or the

1317
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:25,640
Hong Kong flu or SARS-1 or MERS. And there's a sweet spot. Obviously, if a virus is so deadly,

1318
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:30,760
that it basically knocks trans, like if it's an Ebola virus, in many ways, those are less

1319
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:37,160
threatening because they kill people so quickly. But there's an inverted U shape of lethality and

1320
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:43,400
SARS-CoV-2 is actually quite far to one side, which is it's so non-lethal that it's so contagious. But

1321
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:51,640
you take its lethality up one order of magnitude, it still wouldn't, especially if it has a long

1322
02:04:51,640 --> 02:05:00,360
latency, it's a devastating virus. I mean, it kills tens of millions of people. And I think you're

1323
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:04,680
absolutely right about the snake at your feet. Like there is a certain amount of political capital

1324
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:13,560
that probably exists now in 2021 to really say, okay, well, how much money is the government

1325
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:18,600
willing to spend to make sure that the next time this happens, we're not on our heels?

1326
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:24,920
Yeah, exactly. And it was funny with Lamar's committee, he ran the health committee,

1327
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:30,360
was chair of it, the health committee. And he took a lot of heat. I listened to it. I love not being

1328
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:35,720
there because I can sit there, listen to the hearing and give my testimony. But half the

1329
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:39,960
people would say, Lamar, this is crazy, looking for the next pandemic, seeing what we should do.

1330
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:45,240
We've got a pandemic now. And he said, well, of course we do. And we're doing everything we can,

1331
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:51,880
but look what history has led us to. And there are clearly things to do, but how you get people to

1332
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:59,960
stay on it and understand. And there's simple things, infrastructure. Right now, things like

1333
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:04,680
vaccine distribution, which has been so challenging, that's the sort of thing,

1334
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:10,440
and public health infrastructure locally, there are fewer public health people on full-time payroll

1335
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,640
in our communities today, wherever you are right now, than there were eight years ago.

1336
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:23,960
Public health people, public health has been the stepchild of health and welfare and healing. That

1337
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:28,360
is inverted now in people appreciate it, but we're going to actually deliver on it,

1338
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:33,240
not just next year and not just put more funding in it, but really do it over a period of time.

1339
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:41,880
And that's the challenge. And again, getting people to these bodies and opening those bodies up to,

1340
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:46,840
whether it's more scientists, more thoughtful people, people getting other experiences from life

1341
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:50,200
and having them participate in supporting them in those positions.

1342
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:55,960
So I want to kind of go back to just this broader topic of the political world we live in today

1343
02:06:55,960 --> 02:07:00,680
versus the political world you entered and left, which is in some ways not that long ago,

1344
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:07,720
but yet seems like an awful long time ago, frankly. If you think about the historical arc of politics,

1345
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:15,480
which I frequently try to do and think back to the worst of times, and maybe this isn't so bad, but

1346
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:21,560
help me understand, gauge your level of optimism for me in terms of this infrastructure, right?

1347
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:27,880
Which is the two-party system, the systems that are in place that have rewarded the extremes

1348
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:35,080
and punished the compromises, the tools that amplify it, social media, cable news, all these

1349
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:39,720
other things that we could, everybody can rattle off all the things that could be broken today.

1350
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:46,520
How optimistic are you that if we can both agree that where things are today is suboptimal,

1351
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:54,040
it's going to get better? Yeah, you know, I, on my podcast, I ask people the sort of optimism

1352
02:07:54,040 --> 02:08:00,680
question a lot and 90 out of 100 say they're optimistic about things. That's really interesting.

1353
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:06,200
And so I'm slowly going to answer it because I think you have to be really, really careful

1354
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:12,440
on the, first of all, I am optimistic. And again, it's my nature and I tend to get involved in things

1355
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:17,240
that seem to be challenging and I love just working with them and bringing people in and

1356
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:23,800
things tend to work out pretty well. So I feel good about it. I think the next few years are

1357
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:31,080
going to be really difficult and probably not get a lot better and may get worse. I think if you look

1358
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:38,920
at structures that are contributing to it, we're going to figure it out. And I don't blame social

1359
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:47,560
media, but it's an accelerant and the way we are going to figure out in some way to curate

1360
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:54,120
social media in a way that still allows freedom of expression and free speech,

1361
02:08:54,680 --> 02:09:01,560
but where it can't be used in the negative ways, whether it's in partisanship or misinformation.

1362
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:08,920
I feel good about that. And part of it is in discussions with people in the sort of Facebook

1363
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:16,040
direct world and the Amazon world and the Google world and the Netflix world. It's going to take a

1364
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:19,800
little bit further. I think we're going to get better there. When we get better, that will put

1365
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:23,240
us in much better standing because if we're still on the curve of getting worse and it may get worse

1366
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:28,600
and other, you know, this world populism, it may get a little bit worse, but it will get better.

1367
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:34,920
And I'm optimistic about that. Leadership, I think it's going to take a while. I'll tell you

1368
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:40,280
just a real quick story. When I was in the Senate, things are partisan again. We don't want to

1369
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:46,600
idealize the past, but President Bush and President Clinton did not do this as much,

1370
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:53,880
but President Bush came in and we were in sort of this, you know, 9-11 sort of world, but came in

1371
02:09:53,880 --> 02:10:01,320
and every other Friday would take three people from the Senate leadership or four, two Republicans,

1372
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:07,880
two Democrats, and from the House leadership. And every Friday do breakfast with them quietly,

1373
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:13,480
no press right off the Oval Office. And it was uncomfortable. You'd have the,

1374
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:18,600
I shouldn't mention anything, but you'd have the people who are the leaders around the table. And,

1375
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:24,920
you know, people like Nancy Pelosi and President Bush sit side by side for breakfast for an hour.

1376
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:31,800
There's a little bit of attention there. But I, and this was before the Iraq War and things got

1377
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:39,000
really complicated in so many ways, but for that period of time, things seem to be so much better.

1378
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:43,880
Really uncomfortable and people, I don't know if people have talked about that either,

1379
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:49,640
but what I say that and preface that because I do think if you have a president of the United

1380
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:56,360
States, President Obama didn't do it and President Trump didn't do it. President Biden, it looks like

1381
02:10:56,360 --> 02:11:01,880
he would do something like that, but you know, you just don't know. But I do think if you had,

1382
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:08,600
at that level, not at the level of Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, you know, it's too ingrained

1383
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:13,960
there. But at that level, you pull people together and said, I'm willing to lose my next

1384
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:18,360
election as president of the United States. And again, take, take President Biden or President

1385
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:23,720
like soon to be President Biden out of it. If you had somebody like that who stayed with it,

1386
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:28,600
it would make a difference. It gives cover for people below. It gives cover for the majority

1387
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:34,600
leader and a minority leader and the speaker and the Democratic leaders in the House. And that's

1388
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:41,800
not that hard. I mean, that kind of makes it sound simple to do, but sort of my experience

1389
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:47,960
in my thoughts, it could be as easy as that to begin the turn the tide. And I think we'll,

1390
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:51,400
we'll see that. I don't know if we've been the short term or long term or how long people will

1391
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:56,040
be around, but it takes that sort of courage to do it, to say, I would, you know, I'm willing to

1392
02:11:56,040 --> 02:12:01,880
sacrifice a second term or something like that. That's a big sacrifice though, isn't it? I mean,

1393
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:06,440
that's not something to take lightly. Yeah, it is. But you know, it's gotten to the point that,

1394
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:12,200
you know, how you elect somebody who really will do that from a very partisan group, it's makes it

1395
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:17,800
hard, but it's doable. And we're talking about regular people and people who, you know, can be

1396
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:23,240
reasonable and not always, it depends on the individual. But for those two reasons, I'm

1397
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:27,720
optimistic because I think it can be done. I think it probably will be done, but I, and it can be done

1398
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:35,080
pretty quickly. I think there's a real call from people for this sort of bringing people together.

1399
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:39,480
Doesn't mean sacrifice your principles. It doesn't mean sacrifice your party. It just means come to

1400
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:46,120
the table and be able to have a discussion and have a disagreement and leave, you know, as we did sort

1401
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:50,280
of more of my first term than in my second term in the Senate, sort of shaking hands after you have

1402
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:54,280
a big debate on the floor of the Senate. You know, there's so many other things I wanted to chat

1403
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:59,320
about and we're really, we've gone a lot longer than I thought we would to this chapter, but we

1404
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:03,960
really have only covered a couple of the chapters of your life. There's an entire chapter that

1405
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:09,800
follows what you did in the Senate, which is in some ways the busiest chapter of your life

1406
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:18,440
in the last 15 years. I guess just for the sake of brevity, what has been the most interesting

1407
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:22,840
project you've worked on? Because you've, you know, you're, you're doing venture capital,

1408
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:29,240
you're on the board of for profits, not for profits. You're a part of the bipartisan

1409
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:33,640
policy center, which is an organization I'm quite familiar with and quite impressed with. I mean,

1410
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:40,120
your commitments span so much. What has been the most interesting and I guess,

1411
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:44,440
what have you brought from the two previous chapters to it?

1412
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:48,760
Yeah, that's a great question because people, it's a little bit like they look at you probably,

1413
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:53,400
if you look at your past, you know, you've done different things and you've tried different

1414
02:13:53,400 --> 02:14:00,200
things and is there any sort of narrative or thematic that sort of goes through that? And

1415
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:08,200
for me, it goes back, I'm sure, to this whole image of healing and health and hope and all and,

1416
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:13,560
you know, it sounds a little bit gimmicky and all, but it does come back to that. In my mind,

1417
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:19,400
learning to be a doctor, sort of practicing the transplant world, that was 10 years learning and

1418
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:25,320
10 years delivering and then 10 years and 12 years in politics and then 10 years in sort of

1419
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:31,800
the private equity world and then the last five years in venture capital, all of it's around health

1420
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:37,240
and healing. Everything I do, everything. And so what I did when I left the Senate, I said, now,

1421
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:42,360
what is the next step? I, you know, smartly said 12 years in the Senate. So I said,

1422
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:47,720
putting together my past experiences, what if there's one thing that could be done

1423
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:52,920
to change the course of history? And this is thinking big and it's not the sort of thing you

1424
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:59,400
tell anybody at the time. What would it be? And, you know, based on 20 trips to Africa and the

1425
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:06,920
global experience and all and HIV AIDS globally, and I came back to one thing and it was K through

1426
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:16,200
12 education and globally, probably K through 12 education for girls. And if you're going to spend,

1427
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:22,440
you know, a increment of time with my experiences, where would it be? So what I did is started a

1428
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:27,960
foundation. It's called State Collaborative on Reformative Education. It's by far the biggest

1429
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:33,480
thing in the state. Now I started, but got really smart people and good people, dedicated people to

1430
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:41,240
run it. And with that, it has had an impact where Tennessee has for the last 10 years shown

1431
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:45,480
dramatic, dramatic improvement in K through 12 education and been recognized as such.

1432
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:53,320
So that is a little bit out of health care, but the nexus between health and education is so real.

1433
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:58,360
The health feeding into being better educated, the more educated sort of better health,

1434
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:05,320
it just feeds together and I see it and the data is good. So that's sort of the one big bucket that

1435
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:11,000
I've made a conscious decision. If you look in the investing world, what I do is focus on mission

1436
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:18,120
directed health service companies, not pharmaceutical companies, not molecules, not devices, not, you

1437
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:25,720
know, all of that. And so I start around companies, I start companies and support companies that have

1438
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:32,280
a mission of taking people, usually vulnerable populations and lifting them up. And the one that

1439
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:37,160
I'll just mention, because you asked for one, is one that kind of comes back to the things we've

1440
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:45,400
talked about is palliative health care. In our country today, most people do not die the way

1441
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:51,720
they would want to die. Hospice the last seven days, four days, three days is really good in

1442
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:58,760
America. Finally, after, you know, 50 years is really good. But in this world of chronic disease,

1443
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:05,240
where people are living and as you described so well in your talks, you push that down slope on

1444
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:09,960
the chronic disease and the aging out as far as you can. But at some point you come to those graphs

1445
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:15,160
that you draw and you're going to bring things to a close in its chronic disease. So think of it at

1446
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:20,840
that last year of life, that last eight months of life, and it's called palliative health care in

1447
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:28,040
hospitals. Traditionally, if you're at Vanderbilt or Stanford or Mass General or your local hospital

1448
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:33,560
of people listening today, you can get good palliative health care. But if you live 30 miles

1449
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:39,400
away or 50 miles away or 100 miles away, you can't. And you're sitting there with a chronic disease,

1450
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:43,560
you're going downhill, your family, if you have family local that don't know what to do.

1451
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:52,280
And so what we did is create from scratch a company that focused and is now the largest

1452
02:17:52,280 --> 02:18:00,040
palliative, non-hospice related palliative health in communities in the country. And it started with

1453
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:05,880
this full circle sort of thing. It started with when I mentioned that I had hundreds of people

1454
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:10,040
being referred to me back in those early transplant years right over here at Vanderbilt.

1455
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:14,840
They were coming in, but I can only transplant one every four or five days. I didn't have enough donor

1456
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:20,440
hearts. So I had 50 or 60 people coming in who were going to die within six months flying in,

1457
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:24,920
coming in, saying, we need a transplant. And I say, I don't have enough donor hearts. And so I had to

1458
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:30,440
learn how to take care of them, prolong their life and getting the stuff right, the nutrition right,

1459
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:36,680
the exercise right, the mental health, the spiritual health right. All of a sudden they

1460
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:40,520
started living not just six months, you know, they wouldn't come here if the doctor hadn't

1461
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:46,760
told me six months, but they live eight months, nine months, 12 months. So seeing that, and then

1462
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:51,000
I lost my mind and went to the Senate. And then I got out of the Senate, I came back and we're still

1463
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,240
in the same place. Nobody had developed a palliative health care system for the last year, eight months

1464
02:18:57,240 --> 02:19:03,960
of life that looked at the spiritual, that looked at the mental, that looked at the nutritional,

1465
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:11,160
that looked at the exercise and sort of general acute care, medical care as well. And so that's

1466
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:16,840
sort of a good example of the sort of companies that I believe in. It ties things together,

1467
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:20,680
there are needs that are out there, there are lots of other areas, you know, like that out there.

1468
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:27,480
The area of the frail elderly today who don't need palliative care is doing another company

1469
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:33,560
right now, just a year old, because they've got social determinant, $35,000 of that cost

1470
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:39,320
plus $35,000 of medical cost, but nobody's put all that together to treat them holistically.

1471
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:44,440
So you know, those are the sort of examples that are exciting to me that are really no different

1472
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:50,760
than the innovation of the new ideas and the execution, which is most important, of doing

1473
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:55,880
a heart transplant and figuring out how to, you know, some way figuring out that cardiac biopsy to

1474
02:19:55,880 --> 02:20:01,880
determine inflammation and then developing a new drug like cyclosporine, which revolutionizes that

1475
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:07,080
field. It's doing it in the business world where you have access to capital, you can move fast,

1476
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:10,520
you're not slowed down by government. So it's pretty exciting.

1477
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:16,360
Bill, if ever there was a Renaissance man, you are that man. And I still think in many ways,

1478
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:19,640
I know you don't agree with the idea of term limits and maybe that's not the answer, but

1479
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:26,200
there really is something to be said for having people in the government who haven't spent their

1480
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:30,600
entire lives in government. And I don't know, I think the trajectory of your career is very

1481
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:34,200
interesting and maybe we'd all be better served if you were still in government, although I don't

1482
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:38,920
know that you'd still want to be in government. I can tell by the look on your face, you're probably

1483
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:42,280
glad you're not. Yeah, I'm just fine.

1484
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:48,040
Now it's been a pleasure speaking with you today and thanks for all your service.
