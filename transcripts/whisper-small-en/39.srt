00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,720
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,800
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,560
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:43,440
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,320
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,720
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,720
with this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,680
is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,560
lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,080
podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,240
is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,960
this information with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,600
In fact, we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,560
feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,560
to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know, the tried and true way

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,880
to do this is to sell ads, but after a lot of contemplation, that model just doesn't

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,800
feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,080
I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,000
ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,280
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,680
ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,640
that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,720
with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,840
support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,800
and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,360
matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more than you give.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,920
So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,240
other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,240
These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,960
of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,280
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,760
also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,200
really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,600
that I love. And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,640
like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,160
already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,760
will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one,

45
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,800
the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members to support us

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,480
at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,520
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider

49
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,840
My guest this week is Dr. Ted Schaeffer, the chairman of urology at Northwestern University

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,960
in Chicago. He's a urologist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate

51
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,000
cancer. His high quality work has earned him the trust of people like Ben Stiller, who

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,080
he's operated on and who have spoken very publicly about his own battle with prostate

53
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,440
cancer. In this episode, we go through all of the current and basic best practices for

54
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,920
the screening and treatment of prostate cancer, from the latest drugs to the surgical options.

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,960
The conversation naturally leads to our evolving understanding of cancer and the most exciting

56
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,680
areas of research in prostate cancer specifically. We also touch on the controversy around the

57
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,600
role of things like testosterone replacement in the development of prostate cancer and

58
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,320
even the controversy surrounding prostate screening using things like the PSA. And finally,

59
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,280
if you're an MD PhD student, which I realize might not be many of you, you'll want to listen

60
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,680
closely as Ted has some of the most pertinent and in my opinion, most important advice for

61
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,240
those who are deciding on how to thread this needle of being clinicians and scientists.

62
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,280
So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with one of my closest friends

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,080
from residency, Dr. Ted Schaeffer.

64
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,560
Hey man, how are you?

65
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm great. Good to see you.

66
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
Dude, it's kind of weird when I go and visit my friends from residency and I see them in

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,320
their grown up clothes and their grown up offices. It kind of makes me feel like I failed.

68
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,600
Well, your office is stunning. The view over the lake in Chicago and admittedly, this might

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,080
be the best month of the year to be in Chicago, but it's like we're in the elevator coming

70
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
up here and I'm, I feel like we're supposed to be goofing off like we always did. And

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm like, wait, we can't goof off. He's now the chairman of urology. We got to be serious.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,320
It's true. When I, when I look at, I'm looking at you here doing this recording and I can't

73
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,660
help but just chuckle.

74
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,960
So we'll get to all the med school stuff or the residency stuff, because that's obviously

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,440
where we met, but let's talk a little bit about your decision to even do a PhD. And

76
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,680
you know, you have kind of an interesting story there because you weren't on the typical

77
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,440
MD PhD path, right?

78
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,920
Yeah. I, you know, people ask me about my life and how I got to where I am. And there's

79
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,640
a couple of principles I think about and they're common themes that we share together.

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,360
But one of the things I teach or talk to my trainees about is, you know, you never walk

81
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,000
by an open door without looking inside. And so that's how I ended up being at the NIH,

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,040
doing my PhD. But even before that, I think the way my brain was built was that I always

83
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:53,040
wanted to see what was inside the open door, inside the alarm clock, inside the watch.

84
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,360
And so conceptually, as I moved through my training, I liked biology because I wanted

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,280
to understand how things worked. I loved organic chemistry. I loved putting the puzzles together,

86
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,200
making things happen. And so as an extension of that, when you're in medical school and

87
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,600
you're learning about the pathology of why things, you know, fail, understanding that

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,320
at a cellular level just always appealed to me. And I loved the ICU. I loved the, you

89
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,560
know, the physiology of the human body and how you can measure all that. And so I think

90
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,960
about that a lot because I, you know, read and been following your blogs and your life

91
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,120
and how you analyze everything you do. And so for me in medical school, it was a lunchtime

92
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,920
thing. I went by this open door and there was this opportunity to apply for a scholarship

93
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,060
through Howard Hughes Medical Institution to really go study science at the NIH. And

94
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,700
I had started college and school early. So I had about a, I felt like I had a year to

95
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,860
kind of play around and see what was interesting to me. And it was something that was out of

96
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,240
the box for me, but I just, you know, when you find something that makes sense, it's

97
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,700
no longer risky to you. You're not exposing yourself to anything. It's really just exploration.

98
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,860
And so that, that came very natural because I'm not the type of person who likes to take

99
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,020
on risk, do different things. But for me, it wasn't a risk to just leave medical school

100
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,340
and go to the NIH. It was an opportunity.

101
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,060
When you were in college, did you know you wanted to go into medical school?

102
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,260
I think so. Yeah. I loved, I loved biology. I loved understanding the way things were

103
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,420
and how they worked. And you know, the most complex of all those things is the human body

104
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,620
and just a living organism, a multicellular organism is just incredibly fascinating to

105
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,420
me. So I was always attracted to that. And so I thought, you know, that was a natural

106
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:44,420
extension of it. I remember when I was in college, there was a very famous anthropologist

107
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,780
at University of Chicago who was one of these dinosaur hunters. And so I just, you know,

108
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:56,540
I loved, I loved the idea of just discovery. And I love that idea of anatomy and discovering

109
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,220
what dinosaurs were like and how they did that. I remember I talked to my father, who's

110
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,180
a physician, and I said, you know, I think I want to go off to grad school and be an

111
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,340
anthropologist. And he's like, you're gonna do what? You know, but that concept of discovery,

112
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,140
innovation, figuring things out, it's just something that I've always had in me. So you

113
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,940
don't just go to NIH. How did you wind up in the lab of a Nobel laureate? Well, it was through a

114
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,340
friend of mine. So when this program I was in, you know, you went and you interviewed in different

115
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,140
labs and you basically decided what you wanted to do. And some people, it was an incredibly

116
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:38,540
talented group, it was about 40 medical students from all over the country. So some of these people,

117
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,340
they're just amazing. They knew what they wanted to do. They knew what field, who they wanted to

118
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,180
work with and so forth. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to pursue this

119
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,180
idea of discovery and pursue it at a high level. And I remember there's a guy named Jonathan

120
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,300
Ashwell, he was an immunologist. And I thought, well, maybe I should do immunology mostly because

121
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,220
I didn't really understand immunology very well for my medical school class. It was a weak kind

122
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,940
of class for me. So I went and talked to him and he said, you know, he's a really tough guy,

123
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,500
very successful hardcore scientist. And at the NIH immunology there was just really, really,

124
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,540
you know, just amazing. And he said, listen, you just got to pick a guy. He was really tough. He

125
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,820
just said, look, just can a man up pick something and you'll get into it and you'll love it. And I

126
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,540
thought, you know, that was actually good advice, you know. And so I was shopping around for somebody

127
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,740
who was motivated, who was driven and who was smart to work with. And a good friend of mine,

128
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,020
who's actually here at Northwestern, Grant Barish, you should look at this, go talk to this woman,

129
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,140
Pam Swartzberg. She's a postdoc in the Varmus lab and she's looking for a student and she's

130
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,740
really good. And so I went and interviewed with her and she was exactly what I wanted. I'm a

131
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,260
brilliant scientist and she happened to be in the Varmus lab. But, you know, the Varmus lab was a

132
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,340
bunch of postdocs who would be effectively associate or full professors at any other

133
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,620
university. They were just incredibly smart people. And I got to, you know, these individuals

134
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,860
are just amazing. So I met her and then worked through her with him. And the plan was always to,

135
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,060
she had already been offered a position as a researcher at the NIH and she was waiting to

136
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,580
transition to her own lab. So we, yes, technically I was a Varmus lab member for six or nine months.

137
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,380
And, but all along I was mentored by this woman, Pam Swartzberg, who was just a brilliant scientist.

138
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,780
And when she was a tech in her lab at Columbia, she was making, you know, she was had covers of

139
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,700
cell, you know, she was just brilliant. So Harold attracted people like this in his lab group and we

140
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,380
stayed part of his lab group, although independent throughout my kind of experience there. And I

141
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,260
always considered our group to be equal, but part of his group. So it was, it was a lot of fun to

142
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,620
interact with him on a weekly basis during lab meetings, just to see how he thought. I mean,

143
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,300
you know, like you, I like to surround myself with people who are just incredibly smart.

144
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,380
And by being a member of his lab team, I by default did that, not just him, but many,

145
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,380
many other people. So it was really fun. For the listener, of course, Harold Varmus and Michael

146
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,220
Bishop shared the Nobel prize probably in the late eighties or early nineties. It was like 88,

147
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,900
89, 90, something like that, right? They basically were the first people to elucidate the relationship

148
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,540
between viruses and oncogenes. Is that correct? Right. Yeah. So the concept of their, their prize

149
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,940
was, and I'll probably butcher this and the real scientists out there will kill me for it. But,

150
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,900
you know, the idea was that they described that there's this, you know, you could pass on a cancer

151
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,100
through a viral induction. And so these viral oncogenes was what they described. So they were

152
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,540
an active alteration in the cells, normal machinery to, to induce a cancer. You know,

153
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,140
I've never met Harold, but I did have the privilege of having dinner with Michael Bishop

154
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,660
once a few years ago. And it was a very intimate, you know, there's like four people there,

155
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,260
but everyone was either a Nobel laureate or will be a Nobel laureate sort of thing. You know,

156
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,660
Lou Cantley, David Sabatini, Michael Bishop. And, you know, it's just one of those nights. Like you

157
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,180
don't want it to end. You can't believe that, you know, cause we were at a steakhouse and we were

158
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,500
sort of sequestered in our own little room. And we probably spent like five hours there just talking

159
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,300
about their work. It was amazing. You said something a second ago that I love. I didn't

160
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,220
know this about you actually. So this is the fun thing of interviewing your best boys is you still

161
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,100
learned something. Part of the reason you retracted immunology is you felt it was a weakness. And

162
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,340
having spoken with a number of very good scientists, I find that to be a very common thread.

163
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,620
The great ones seem to go towards their weaknesses rather than away from them. Steve Rosenberg,

164
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,940
who was my mentor at the NCI, I always talked about the reason he did. He always knew he wanted

165
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,540
to be an immunologist, always non-negotiable, but he did his PhD in biophysics because he didn't want

166
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,940
to be intimidated by these differential equations when he read papers. Like he really wanted to

167
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,380
understand a field of science that didn't come, you know, sort of easily to him. So that's sort

168
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,500
of an interesting aside about you. Yeah, it was funny. I had a great mentor and worked hard and

169
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,140
on paper had a great PhD. And I remember was degree granted through the University of Chicago.

170
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,940
So again, I wasn't in a formal PhD program. There was an open door for me to do this great

171
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,540
program and opportunity at the NIH. I went there for a year. I just loved it. I loved the research

172
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,900
environment. And from there, I petitioned to stay an additional year and I didn't really know what

173
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,980
it meant to have a PhD. I mean, I wasn't going there for a PhD. I was going there to do science.

174
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,820
But I had friends that were in formal MD PhD programs at University of Chicago. And they were

175
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,620
like, man, you know, what you've done is PhD students would die for. And I was like, well,

176
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,260
I don't know. I'm just doing my thing, you know. So at that time I was an idiot and I was kind of

177
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,500
ballsy. So I wrote a letter to my Dean and I said, well, I think I should be, I should be,

178
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,300
someone should give me a PhD for this stuff. And they said, well, why don't you fly back and why

179
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,300
don't you give us a talk? And I did. And they were like, okay, yeah, you do know what you're

180
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,700
talking about. And what you had published, you have actually a very similar story to another

181
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,900
good friend of mine who, you know, was in a similar situation where he basically was in

182
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,300
the right place at the right time, right? Was in a great lab, very well mentored, great project,

183
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,420
and was willing to like go to the wall for it and ends up getting a first authorship in science and

184
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,900
nature. And it's sort of like, you just have to hand those in and that becomes a PhD.

185
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,860
That's the idea, you know. And so yes, all the critical thinking and how to develop and

186
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,660
come up with a hypothesis and test it. I did all those things. So I mean, I met all the formal

187
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,180
criteria for it. I just did it in a, I wasn't in a structured way. It just happened to be in a good

188
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,060
environment. What was the most interesting question you were asking during your time at NIH?

189
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,860
Well, I mean, I think immunology and really I think I was more in a cell signaling lab. And

190
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,340
so a lot of what we did was biochemistry. And the idea was, you know, well, you would take a

191
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,940
single protein and you'd knock it out or turn it on or whatever, and it would have a huge effect.

192
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:03,020
And I think at that time people were thinking really very linearly, you know. I had, I mean,

193
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,860
my PhD was pretty much the most amazing experience you can imagine. So on my floor in building 49,

194
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,340
it was- This was in the old center.

195
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
This is before- Before the new

196
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,940
middle center was built, which was-

197
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,780
But building 49 was a genome Institute. It was across the street from the NCI

198
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,180
buildings, which I think were 35 and 37 or something like that. So on my floor was Harold

199
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,780
Varmus, you know, Varmus lab. I was technically in our own lab with Pam, but we shared the

200
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:37,180
last space with Francis Collins. So, you know, it was just, I mean, you couldn't just pick a better

201
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,300
floor to have just people on. And so at that time genomics and transcriptomics and-

202
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,900
This is the mid 90s.

203
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,900
This is 97 to 99. So, I mean, people were just starting to do homemade microarrays and looking

204
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,940
at expression. And I remember people would like take a muscle cell and they compare it to a fiber

205
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,540
blast and they would be like, oh my God, you can see these different expression changes in these

206
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,900
homemade microarrays. And so that's when everything was just taking off. I remember Lou Stout, who's

207
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:10,940
still at the NIH, who was working on, there was a Howard Hughes student working on lymphomas and

208
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,500
just characterizing the different genomic phenotypes of them. And people still use that

209
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,020
stuff today. It's pretty amazing. And so I was there when all that was happening. I remember

210
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,740
when I went there, you know, at University of Chicago, people really weren't on the internet.

211
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,380
And then I show up and I go to the lab and there's T1 lines at the NIH and the internet. And

212
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,140
I remember downloading the Clinton debacle, you know, and reading that in detail. And so like,

213
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,580
there's all these just amazing things that happened in science and happened in

214
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,940
technology that were going on at that period of my life and that period in the world. It was pretty,

215
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,780
it was pretty amazing. So, the thing that's a long answer to the concept that when I went there,

216
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,660
I think people were still focused on single gene, single change. They're still looking for the like,

217
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,740
well, you have this mutation, you get this cancer, this mutation, you have this phenotype.

218
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,980
And you know, the human body is a polygenetic organism.

219
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,540
Yeah, at last count, if there's 20,000 human genes, I believe there's something like 73,

220
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,500
but I could be wrong. Let's just call it a hundred and round up. There were about

221
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,100
only a hundred disease states that result from single gene mutations out of 20,000 genes.

222
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,140
Yeah. So, you know, that was the big thing, the big transition in Francis Collins was really leading

223
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,940
that where there were people hunting for the gene for type 2 diabetes at the time I was there. And

224
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,540
of course, now we understand it's a complex equation. And so within immunology, when I was

225
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,780
there, it was also a transition. So, it turns out that the tyrosine kinases that I worked on in my

226
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,940
PhD are really involved in fine tuning the T cell receptor signaling. They're really rheostats.

227
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,460
They really fine tune the signal. It's not off or on just like, you know, you have a mutation in X,

228
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,620
Y, or Z off or on. And so I think one of the big themes of what was evolving at the time I was

229
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,820
there was this concept that was a fine tuning. And I remember we would do immunology retreats in the

230
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,340
road. So, another way to explain this maybe for the listener, because of course I hear rheostat and

231
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,740
I think about rheostats because I'm an engineer. Digital is a signal. It's on or off. That's right.

232
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:18,860
Zero or one. Analog is like the volume button on your radio. You can go from nothing to full blast,

233
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,300
but an infinite number of iterations in between. And that's what you mean by modulating the signal.

234
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,900
Right. And I think that that was a period of transition in science where maybe people

235
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,420
always thought that that happened, but people were developing the tools to begin to test that

236
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,940
and understand that. And you think about cancer immunology and the Rosenberg lab was a huge

237
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,940
player on campus when I was there, which was 10 years before you were there and they were

238
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,100
hunting for single tumor antigens, right? But then they were realizing that it's a complicated

239
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,260
thing and there's multiple factors that come into the role and into play there. So,

240
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,980
for me, that was maybe conceptually something people had always thought about,

241
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:06,940
but the tools to explore that, the tools to test that on multi-gene levels were kind of coming

242
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,420
online in science at that time. So, it was a pretty fun time to do that.

243
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,340
Talk a little bit about a tyrosine kinase. I mean, these are so ubiquitous in biology

244
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,980
and they just come up over and over again. So, explain to someone who doesn't understand what

245
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,060
that is, what it is, and why it's relevant and maybe where it shows up.

246
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,260
You have your DNA, everybody's born with it. It's in every single cell in your body,

247
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,140
but the skin cells in your body make a certain amount of melanin that make you darker than I am.

248
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,380
And so, within between different people, there's variability in what the individual cells do with

249
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,820
the DNA and then within the human body, there's different cell types and they use the DNA,

250
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:57,340
the code differently. That code then is incredibly, it's modified by exposure to the environment and

251
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,300
that's the epigenetic change and what results is a protein. And so, once you have a protein,

252
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,780
that's really what kind of constitutes a lot of what's in our cells in our body,

253
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,500
but they're not inert. They're constantly changing. And so, one of the ways that they change and one

254
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,460
of the ways that the signals change within an individual cell, how the cells communicate with

255
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,060
each other, etc., is by having kind of temporary modifications to those individual proteins. And so,

256
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,940
one of the ways that happens is through these kinases and there's different pieces of the

257
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,500
proteins that can be modified. So, one of them is a tyrosine kinase, but there are other types of

258
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,420
kinases and these are temporary modifications that happen within a protein, within a cell,

259
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:47,660
to typically transmit a more acute or change within the cell or between two cells and so forth.

260
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,020
And of course, these have become a very attractive target for drugs.

261
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:59,340
Yeah. So, one of the, obviously the idea in cancer biology is to find alterations, to find mutations,

262
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:06,220
to find changes that you can quote unquote target to do precision oncology, precision medicine. And

263
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:13,020
so, these are one of the ways that we're beginning to think about advancing the kind of medicine in

264
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,940
that special way. GleeVac targets a tyrosine kinase, doesn't it? It does. It targets a specifically

265
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,540
altered fused gene. So, it's not just a random tyrosine kinase. It's a tyrosine kinase that's

266
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,460
altered by specific mutation within a cancer. I mean, that was how I was originally described.

267
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:36,140
And so, yes, it will target those and have a specific effect and that was work done

268
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,740
on the West Coast in part by Charles Sawyer's who's now a memorial who's an idol of mine,

269
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,300
but he wasn't the only one involved in kind of identifying this fused mutation.

270
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,780
It's sort of one of those exceptions to this rule, right? Where if you have that mutation,

271
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,420
which basically is, if I recall, is only showing up in CML and GI stromal tumors, correct?

272
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,980
That's right.

273
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,380
Then you do have the one hit wonder. You do.

274
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,700
This drug is, at least in the CML, it seems curative. I don't recall if it was actually

275
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,460
curative in GI stromal tumors or if it was just basically could render it a chronic disease.

276
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,780
For the GI stromal tumors, it's not my space, but yeah, it works. But there is resistance

277
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,180
that develops, I think, in both models now. But in general, for the liquid tumors, it's

278
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,900
much more durable. And for the GI stromals, it does help to suppress the growth of those tumors.

279
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:30,380
Some of them do recur and come back. And that's the concepts of how we manage and we've converted

280
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,100
HIV AIDS from a lethal disease to a chronic condition, really, those basic principles of

281
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,020
multi-targeting of the particular cell. So for cancer, a single agent like Levek

282
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,780
isn't going to work because the cells change and alter, but doing double or triple targeting will

283
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,860
be an effective long-term approach for those, just like we've learned from HIV management.

284
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,340
I'm sure today, you're now the chairman of Urology, so you encounter lots of residents

285
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,660
and medical students. And if one of them came to you and said, hey, Ted, or I guess they'd have

286
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,540
to call you Dr. Shafer, but I'm really thinking about doing a PhD. And what advice would you

287
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,380
give them to select a good lab? In other words, you describe so much of your trajectory is you're

288
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,380
the beneficiary of having been exceptionally well mentored. And you've talked about PAM

289
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,020
now and before. I know we've talked about just when you have an amazing mentor, it's like

290
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,740
everything works out. And yet there are countless students who go into labs that just couldn't waste

291
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,380
more time. They don't actually learn how to think properly. They come out as dumb as they were when

292
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:38,220
they went in and the field has not advanced. So in as much as surrounding yourself by the right

293
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,660
people is the best first step you can take, what guidance would you give somebody to, what questions

294
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,300
should they be asking? What things should they be looking for, either positive or negative, to help

295
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,900
them think through that? Well, I think you've had an opportunity to interact with brilliant scientists

296
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,300
all along. And for me, it's the brilliant scientists, it's brilliant clinicians, it's just

297
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,620
brilliant people. So what are the essence of those people? That's how I would think about it.

298
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:08,300
And mentorship matters, obviously, brain power matters, motivation matters. So, you know, why is

299
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:14,220
it that some PhD students are not successful? Sure, you can attribute some of it to mentorship,

300
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,220
but I really think that it has to do with motivation and drive. And that's such a critical

301
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,340
part of it. So then you'd say, well, why is somebody not motivated? Why aren't they driven?

302
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,620
I mean, I guess some people are biologically built that way. But I also think maybe, you know,

303
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,300
if you wanted to be nicer about it, you could say, well, maybe they just haven't found what

304
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:40,140
they're passionate about, because I think that drive, passion, they're very, and then they come

305
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:47,340
from the same part of your heart or your brain. And so I think part of that is just that, you know,

306
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,580
have they found the right area? Now there are still, having said that, there are people that

307
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,380
are just super passionate about something and they want to do it and they just can't, you know,

308
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,540
maybe they just need to kind of move along. But I think that in my experience in grad school is that

309
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,980
there are, usually you can, it's not that hard to identify grad students that aren't successful.

310
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,060
It's pretty easy to find out, well, they're missing a major, one of those components.

311
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,260
So you head back to University of Chicago, you wrap up your last two years of medical school,

312
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,180
at which point you have to decide what you want to be when you grow up and you pick urology.

313
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:25,340
Yeah. So I went to University of Chicago undergrad. So I spent 11 years at University of Chicago.

314
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,740
And the first four years were the toughest years of my life, for sure.

315
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,300
The undergrad.

316
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,060
I learned only one skill set and that was how to use my brain, how to think, how to think

317
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:42,140
critically. You know, that's why we became, I think friends instantly at Hopkins was that I feel

318
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,300
like that's how your brain is built too. And you've simplified that throughout your whole career.

319
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,220
So for me, I went there, I learned how to think, I decided I wanted to pursue biology at a deep

320
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,740
level and I wanted to pursue human biology. So then I went to medical school. Now for me,

321
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:06,220
I think one of the key components of having an effective research career to data, I guess,

322
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:12,300
would be that I had a clear understanding of this idea of translation. So you can do science

323
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,820
for science sake, but to me, to make really big impacts, you have to be able to translate that

324
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:24,060
to the human condition. So I did three years of medical school before I left. So I went away

325
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,980
after my third year and then I came back. So you already had a year of clinical medicine under

326
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,460
your belt. Yeah. And so for me- So that's also very unusual. It's definitely different,

327
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,420
but I encourage all students who are MD PhDs to do clinical time before they do their PhD.

328
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:43,020
So that might be the nugget of the podcast right there, because I don't think I knew a single MSTP

329
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,660
student who didn't go straight into their PhD after the preclinical phase. Right. So for me,

330
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:55,020
it was just so impactful to be, I guess if you say in hindsight, well, what was the distinguishing

331
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,020
factor of the Varmus lab crew? They're all MD PhDs. They had all done clinical. So they knew

332
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,060
really key nuances that were important questions to ask. And it doesn't, you don't have to be an

333
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:12,540
MB to get that. One of my good friends is his PhD who developed a genomics company that we may

334
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,420
talk about later. And he's a straight PhD. He shouldn't know prostate cancer like he does,

335
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:23,420
but he really gets the nuances of it. So I did three years of my med school. I went to the NIH.

336
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:30,300
I did pure science. I didn't think about humans at all. Thought about mice and signaling in mice

337
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,420
and T cells in mice and so forth. But in the back of my brain, I was always like, okay,

338
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,660
how are we going to change? How are we going to think about the human condition, human disease,

339
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,100
breakdown, rebuilding, all that. So from my perspective, I had a jump on the other straight

340
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:53,260
PhDs in the group because I had an idea. Now, why did I choose urology? Well, this goes back to

341
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,300
just an early childhood imprinting. So there's a couple of facts. Number one, my dad is an

342
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,780
incredibly famous urologist. My father was the chair of the department of urology at Northwestern

343
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:12,380
for 25 years before I took over the job. And he's an incredibly successful scientist, doesn't do

344
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,660
cancer biology. And I didn't really even know he was a urologist as a kid. I just knew him as my dad.

345
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,580
But one of the backstories was that when I was in seventh grade, eighth grade, and beginning high

346
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,700
school, we used to go visit my dad's parents. They lived in Northern Indiana, which is about

347
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:36,060
an hour and 20 minute drive from where we were. And over that time, my grandfather got sick.

348
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:42,780
And I have these vivid memories of seeing him and there are really snapshots in my brain,

349
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:50,300
I recall weekly, of just becoming sicker, becoming more frail, becoming bed bound, and then dying.

350
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,620
And I never really asked what he died of. And I don't think I was, I don't think I could have

351
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,500
processed it what it would have meant anyway, if I had asked. But when I was in medical school,

352
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,100
and I was doing my PhD, I asked my parents what he died of, and he died of prostate cancer. So

353
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:14,300
I was at the NIH, I was doing science, I had done some clinical work. I realized what people in DC,

354
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,620
not in science, but in politics were interested in, they're interested in cancer biology.

355
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,220
And they were interested in prostate cancer. So I saw what other people were interested in.

356
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:31,420
And I had this very vivid memories of my, you know, that my father, my grandfather having

357
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,100
prostate cancer and dying from it. And I decided that that's what I wanted to do.

358
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,940
So when I came back to medical school, I knew already that I wanted to be,

359
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:47,660
to be a prostate cancer biologist and understand the disease. I also knew that I wanted to be a

360
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,060
surgeon. And so I didn't want to be a medical oncologist, although that appealed to me a lot.

361
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,500
And I'm always flattered when people think I'm a medical oncologist, because those guys were

362
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:00,300
smart. But I knew I wanted to do something. I love working with my hands. So for me,

363
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:07,420
the idea of being a surgeon scientist was just, it just made sense. I love the biology. I love,

364
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,140
but I still love the idea of not just conceptually deconstructing something and putting it back

365
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,540
together, but actually physically deconstructing something and putting it back together. So it was

366
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,700
a perfect fit for what I wanted to do. For the listener to put some things in context,

367
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,900
at the time that you and I began our residencies, I don't really think there was any debate about

368
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,620
what the best urology program was in the United States. I think there was a good race for number

369
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,860
two. There were lots of programs that would have competed to be the second best urology program

370
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:41,020
in the country. But, but Johns Hopkins was hands down in a league of its own and they only take two

371
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:48,540
residents per year. So if there are 400 or 500 medical students graduating who want to go into

372
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,420
urology, only two of them get to go to Hopkins and you were one of them, which perhaps isn't

373
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,540
surprising. Did you want to go to Hopkins for reasons other than it was the best program? Was

374
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:04,620
there something about the environment there that drew you to it? Yeah, it was the people. It's an

375
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:11,660
amazing place that I think about it all the time. So I interviewed there and the chair of

376
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:17,340
the department at the time was, is the godfather of my field. He made all the contemporary modern

377
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:22,300
discoveries in prostate cancer. And it was real simple. He looked me in the eyes and he said,

378
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,980
I looked at your CV. I know what you have the ability to do and I want to help you get there.

379
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,340
So Pat, we all selected you in as much as you selected Hopkins.

380
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,980
I guess you could say that. Yeah. You know, it was a perfect fit because as we've talked about

381
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,220
mentorship is just so much of everything. It's everything in life really. If you're motivated

382
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,420
and you have drive, it's, you know, even if you're not motivated and you don't have drive,

383
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,900
you need a good mentor. So for me, I showed up for the interviews. I'd interviewed all over the

384
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,300
country. You know, there was places I could have gone that I could have made a good opportunity,

385
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,260
good experience for me to be trained. But when I showed up at Hopkins, I was like, okay, this is,

386
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,580
I got to go here. So, you know, I think it was a good fit. He was interested in having me train

387
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,580
with him and I was interested in training with him. So it was perfect. Did he know your father?

388
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,180
He must have. They must, I mean, they're both chairman. Yeah. It's an interesting story. He,

389
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,740
I met him at a, I met him at a function in the fall before I started. So before I had interviewed

390
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,300
and he was, I was at a function with my father. And so my father introduced me to him and he said,

391
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,980
well, you know, and what do you want to go into when you finish your medical school? I said, well,

392
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:31,020
I'm actually interested in neurology. He said, really? And he said, well, where are you applying?

393
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,620
And I said, well, I've applied to all the great programs. So, and he said, well, did you apply to

394
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:41,420
Hopkins? And I said, I sure did. And he said, that's wonderful. And then I find out from my father

395
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,780
that he grabbed my dad when I had walked away and he said, I just learned that Ted applied

396
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,300
to our program. Did we give him an interview? And so I made me feel good that, you know,

397
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,700
I had gotten this interview at the best place in the country without using my father's coattails

398
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,340
to kind of get the job. And then I showed up and it was just an amazing, I mean, Hopkins was an

399
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:09,340
amazing place. I know, I know you have many fond memories of the place and I'll never forget just

400
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,660
the pursuit of excellence is something I think about all the time. And that was really the

401
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:18,940
epitome of Hopkins for me. It was the pursuit of excellence among everybody there, to be honest

402
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:25,020
with you. Even the chairs of the departments, they pursued excellence and, but it trickled down,

403
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,300
you know, it trickled down to the everyday employees, the physical plant people, the people

404
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,420
who clean the floor, they had a pursuit and a passion for excellence that at the time that we

405
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:42,460
were there was amazing. I remember also being so struck by that when, you know, when I arrived,

406
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,460
because of course we're each thinking about it through the lens of what we're going to do. You're

407
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,380
going there because of urology. I'm going there because of general surgery, the neurosurgery guys

408
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,380
were going there, but we all had this common first year. We were all, I don't remember how many,

409
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,300
there must've been 28 of us doing internships in general surgery. Six of us would go on to do that

410
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,900
track. Two of you would go on to do urology. There might've been three guys in ENT and ortho

411
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:13,420
and neurosurgery, et cetera. But within about a week, I was like, oh my God, this is like the

412
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,900
all-star game. Like these three guys that, you know, and I still remember everybody's names, like

413
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,100
those three guys that were our classmates who went on to be neurosurgeons were out of control. They

414
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,980
were so good. The ortho guys, you know, ortho guys get a reputation of being kind of the jokers.

415
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,620
These guys were fantastic. Yeah. You know, they were, everyone was just so exceptional. So yeah,

416
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:37,180
you're right. It's, you pay a little bit of a price. You got to go to Baltimore. Yeah.

417
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,020
Call us pay to spade. That's right. Although we both met our spouses there. So,

418
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,700
I had my kids there. So there are some upsides to it, but the reality is that, you know,

419
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,100
it's funny because Pat Walsh, my mentor there always would talk about that. He would always say,

420
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,820
well, it's negative selection. People come here because they want to pursue excellence. They don't

421
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,460
come here because there's a good nightlife. They don't come here because of X, Y, or Z. They come

422
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,740
here for that single reason. And that's- That's a great point. I never really thought about that

423
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:09,020
way, but it's so obvious because I remember being so sad about having to leave California to train

424
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,180
there, but at the same time realizing and talking a lot about it with Steve Rosenberg,

425
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,540
that was like who had done his MD and PhD at Hopkins, that, you know, you only get one

426
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,780
opportunity to train at this. This is the phase of your life to do this. So go to the best place

427
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,860
you can go that fits with how much you want to work. Let's talk for a moment about Pat's work,

428
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,260
because I don't think it can be overstated. And I don't think, I mean, in many ways,

429
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,420
I think Pat Walsh was a very unique mentor to you specifically, but in many ways, the field of

430
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,700
urology today is different because of him. And I don't think, and I've thought about this,

431
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,220
knowing that we were going to talk today, I've spent the last couple of weeks thinking about this.

432
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,060
And I have a hard time coming up with people in the modern era that rival him,

433
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,020
John Cameron potentially being one with respect to pancreatic surgery. But I can't think of someone

434
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:08,220
in the last 30 years that has so fundamentally changed the course of one operation, its impact

435
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,500
on one disease as Pat. Now, am I missing an obvious example? Well, within urology, I think,

436
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,900
I think I can't think of anybody within urology. And the other point is, I'm sure that there are

437
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:26,940
brilliant outstanding people that have changed an operation in a way that alters the course of those

438
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:33,100
individual patients. But one of the things I think about a lot is that Walsh would always tell me,

439
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:38,220
you know, you can't make important discoveries unless you work on important problems. So

440
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:44,380
prostate cancer is an important problem and it's an incredibly prevalent problem. So yeah,

441
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,700
there's probably some guy out there who came up with the best way to do a knick-knack, whatever

442
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,420
surgery, but if it doesn't have a high impact, it probably is not noticed. So yeah, I think that

443
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,580
what he did in our field was, you know, really was never been done before and probably won't

444
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,940
be done again. And he did it for a problem that was incredibly important. So let's talk about the

445
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:12,620
state of prostate cancer surgery for men prior to Pat's work. If a man had prostate cancer,

446
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,620
what would be back in the early 70s, even late 70s, right? What were the treatment options for him?

447
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,180
Well, at the time that Walsh was training, very few people with prostate cancer had surgery.

448
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,300
And that was because it was a potentially life-threatening operation. People would die

449
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:34,940
from extreme blood loss. People were incontinent. People were for sure impotent. Let's stop there

450
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,940
for a second because this is one of those things that I think if, unless you've been in an operating

451
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,940
room, it's hard to understand why the blood loss from prostate cancer surgery could be so deadly.

452
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,420
It's the same reason until you see a trauma where somebody is shot through the pelvis. You can't

453
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,580
understand how did that person die? People get shot in the chest and they walk away sometimes if

454
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:59,180
it's, you know, not through the heart or a pulmonary artery or vein. And yet a cross pelvis

455
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,620
gunshot wound is often quite fatal. What is it about that anatomy that makes it so deadly?

456
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:10,300
It's the large number and variable distribution of veins in the pelvis in general.

457
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,140
And why is it the veins, not the arteries?

458
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,860
I love that. I love that. I get to do this with you.

459
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:24,140
I mean, you know, the vein is just the wall of a vein is as thick as a piece of paper. So it's

460
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:30,300
prone to tear and it's hard to repair it if you do tear it. And an artery is much thicker. It has

461
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,180
much more resiliency to it and it has to do with the amount of flow going through both of them and

462
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,980
pressure. So yeah, there's a lot of veins in the prostate, in the pelvis. There's a lot of veins

463
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:46,700
around the prostate and the distribution, the exact location is incredibly variable. So there

464
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,220
are more like venous plexuses versus an actual vein that you can name. But if you get into the

465
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,980
inferior vena cava, man, you're in trouble too. There's no doubt about that. That's happened to

466
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,940
me a couple of times. So point is that anytime you, you know, an artery is the real deal, but it's

467
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,580
just easier to control it. And oftentimes if you cut an artery, it'll go into spasm and it won't

468
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,460
even, it'll just stop bleeding on its own. And that's not true for veins. So for one, and then

469
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,900
also there's the depth, right? There's the actual exposure is really tough in the pelvis. You know,

470
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,020
it's one thing to, you know, look at the kidney where even though it's in the retroperitoneum,

471
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,100
you can be staring it straight in the face without too much work. That's not really the case in the

472
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,620
prostate. Yeah. So, I mean, the way that Dr. Walz describes it is that, you know, people had done

473
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:36,060
anatomic studies for many, many years, right? I mean, for decades before surgery for the prostate

474
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:43,500
kind of was attempted to be performed. But the anatomy, when you fix a body and you study it,

475
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,660
it really compresses a lot of these sinuses. And so you don't really fully appreciate where they

476
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:53,580
are and what's happening and so forth anatomically an artery is preserved, but these kind of venous

477
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:59,980
plexuses were not. So the anatomy of the pelvis was not appreciated. But I will say that in 1904,

478
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:06,540
at Johns Hopkins, the first radical prostatectomy for cancer was performed by the chair there at the

479
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,580
time. And he did it through a perineal approach, which is the space between your scrotum and your

480
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,420
anus basically. And when you do the surgery that way, you avoid... And the reason is that's the

481
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,540
closest place that the prostate gland is to the outside world. That's right. And if you do it that

482
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:29,100
way, you avoid a lot of the veins that bleed just, you know, catastrophically when you approach

483
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:35,660
the prostate from kind of above versus from below. And so that operation had been, was in, you know,

484
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,700
was being performed and it was considered to be, you know, it was definitely safe. I mean, this

485
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,860
life-threatening blood loss did not occur. And the problem was it wasn't a very good cancer

486
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,420
operation. Why is that? Well, it had to do with exposure. Number one, I mean, you're doing,

487
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,180
you know, the prostate is very deep in the pelvis. So for the lay people, the way I explain

488
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,500
Wolber is the prostate. I explain to people that the pelvis is like a ring of bone and off the ring

489
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:05,020
hang a bunch of muscles and those muscles form a hammock. At the bottom of the hammock is the

490
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,940
prostate. And so it penetrates through the muscles and then that's where the urethra, the tube that

491
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,020
you urinate through comes through the pelvic floor muscles and then goes out of the body.

492
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:21,180
So it's deep in the pelvis. It's hard to access. It's hard to access from the perineum and it's

493
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,580
hard to see what you're doing and it's harder to kind of excise tissue widely in that area.

494
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:31,340
The exposure is tough when you do it from above, but it's even tougher from below. So the life

495
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,860
threatening bleeding wasn't there, but part of the reason that the bleeding didn't occur when you

496
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,940
did a perineal approach was because they were leaving part of the prostate kind of in place.

497
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:43,180
They were staying away from the area where the big veins were. And so when you do that,

498
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,220
it would be safer for the patient, but less oncologically sound.

499
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,180
So, and I can't believe I'm blanking on the forefathers, obviously Halstead, Osler, Kelly,

500
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,980
who was the, and Kelly was the gynecologist, obviously Osler, the internist,

501
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,300
Halstead, the surgeon. What was the name of the urologist?

502
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,980
The first urologist at Hopkins was one of Halstead's trainees that was Hugh Hampton Young.

503
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,900
So Hugh Hampton Young was a Halstead trainee. And so people probably don't realize, but many

504
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:16,700
subspecialties of medicine came out of the Halsteadian era at Hopkins. And so orthopedics,

505
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:24,860
radiology, urology, these were all subspecialties that basically were Halstead telling Hugh Hampton

506
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:30,540
Young, I think we should start an institute or program for people with urologic problems.

507
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:37,100
Now Kelly was doing some of that also at Hopkins, just more on the female side, but that concept

508
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,700
came out of Halstead really assigning Hugh Hampton Young to do that. And the story is that he

509
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,060
literally bumped into him in the hallway and told him, you're going to go work on this. And

510
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,220
he didn't really want to do it because at the time it wasn't very sexy, but he did. And so

511
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,620
from there he really began the whole specialty of urology. Yeah. That's sort of the other thing

512
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:02,060
about Hopkins that never got old actually was to walk through Blalock and look at the photos of

513
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:08,620
all of these old photos of people who literally created the field of surgery. The lineage there

514
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:14,700
was sort of staggering. Yeah. I think one of the things that you, I certainly didn't appreciate

515
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,460
was to really take it all in at the time. I mean, I had the pleasure of being at Hopkins.

516
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,460
It's hard to when you're sleeping, I think an average of 28 hours a week or wherever we slept.

517
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:30,220
Right. Exactly. But the idea of what we did was pretty amazing. I mean, remember we had Sunday

518
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,900
school, right? Yeah. Oh, I loved Sunday school. We would show up. Can you explain to the listener

519
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,740
what Sunday school is? You and I might've been two of the, there weren't many people that probably

520
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,380
loved Sunday school, but you and I had adored it. It was great. So when we were interns at Hopkins,

521
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:48,060
there was no work hour limit. And the expectation when you got there was that you'd work seven days

522
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,020
a week. You would work eight days a week if there are eight days in the week. And so Sundays was the

523
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,860
day that you would go in and you'd sit with the chair of the department, one of the most famous

524
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:05,100
surgeons of all time, really. And he would lead the discussion on a topic for the day. It often

525
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,660
started with history, right? We would do history of surgery, history of surgery at Hopkins. And

526
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:16,300
that was, those are some of my most favorite kind of discussions was him just talking for 45 minutes

527
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,500
about somebody. And then we would present cases and then we would talk, we would practice our

528
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:27,260
suturing. I remember we, I remember I think Julian Sosa, who's the chair at UCSF now was taught me how

529
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:33,500
to tie a square knot. You know what I mean? And also once a year, we each took a turn presenting

530
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,060
something back to the group. I still remember what I presented on. I presented on the war in

531
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,940
shunt, which was an operation that I never got to see because even by the time we were residents,

532
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,900
interventional radiology had completely nullified the need for that operation. But

533
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,220
as a medical student, I became obsessed with the history of that operation because of how

534
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,860
dangerous it was and how complicated it was. This was an operation for the folks who maybe

535
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,940
don't spend a lot of time on the at war and shunt Twitter handle. There's probably no such thing.

536
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,460
Hope someone creates one after this. It's an operation that was done for people with elevated

537
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,980
pressures in the liver. And this is something that happens when people get cirrhosis. So

538
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,460
this was basically an operation that would alleviate that by creating a shunt in the liver.

539
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,340
But I still remember that. And I remember typing it up. And this was back in the day when I would

540
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:26,940
cut pictures out of textbooks and tape them on and make photocopies. This was old school.

541
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,900
Yeah. So that was eight to 10 every Sunday morning, right?

542
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,780
Yeah. And so those kinds of things, I wish I could just, people say, I wish I could go back

543
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:40,380
to high school, wish I could go back to college. In many ways, I mean, I'd do an internship all

544
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:46,860
over again. I would. I mean, we were there at what, 130 to 136 hours a week. But man, I would

545
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,580
do it all over again. It was awesome. We did have amazing times. And I feel fortunate. I mean,

546
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,940
there was just a great group of people we met. You and I met immediately on day one and then

547
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,660
worked together. We were together September, September of our intern year, we did pediatric

548
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:08,700
surgery together. And Karen Cling was our fellow. She is now in attending in San Diego. I bumped

549
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,060
into her in the grocery store like a year ago. She was great. She was incredible.

550
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,820
Yeah. She was awesome. John Vogel was our senior resident.

551
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:22,940
Taught me how to put an NG tube in that served me, an asiogastric tube for the listener is a tube that

552
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,740
you sometimes have to put in a patient's nose down behind the pharynx and then into the esophagus and

553
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:33,020
into the stomach. This is something that is so ubiquitous in surgical care, but so wildly

554
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,620
uncomfortable for a patient because the patient is usually wide awake when you're doing this.

555
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,980
And I remember one day Vogel, I remember where we were. It was just at the ground level of CMC.

556
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,700
He sat us down there in the playground and said, look, you two knuckleheads,

557
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,940
you have got to learn how to put an NG tube in without killing somebody. And he didn't mean

558
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,180
literally killing, but he just meant tormenting. And do you remember the Vogel technique?

559
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,260
I do still. I remember him telling me. It was like, because everybody thinks that you're

560
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,900
supposed to put the NG tube up the nose, right? And he's like, it's straight back.

561
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,700
That's exactly right.

562
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,580
And so he's like, you get the cup of ice, you get the ice water cup, you put the NG tube in,

563
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:15,660
you put a wicked bend on it, you put the lidocaine jelly in, and that's exactly the key point. Do not

564
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:21,340
go up, go directly back, and you curl it down and then you give them a little straw and you tell

565
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:29,740
them exactly once you hit the back of the oropharynx, take two big sips. And this was a game changer,

566
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,300
Ted. It was. For the rest of my residency, I was throwing NG tubes in. If you looked at me,

567
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:40,540
you got an NG tube and it didn't hurt. The thing that the listener will not appreciate is the

568
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,100
layer of comedy associated with this, because this was done in what you described as the

569
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,220
first floor of the pediatric hospital, which was called the zoo, right? Yeah.

570
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:54,460
And so this is a brilliant surgeon, John Vogel. He's the head of colorectal surgery

571
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:02,220
in Colorado, teaching Peter Attia, brilliant surgeon Ted Shafer, just getting by in front of

572
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:08,940
life-size stuffed animals of giraffes and lions. It was hysterical, right? It was just comedy.

573
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,180
Yeah. That entire, that might've been certainly the best month of my internship.

574
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,180
Yeah. That was fun in terms of-

575
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:15,660
I had great-

576
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,380
Many great months.

577
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,340
Yeah, pure jokes. So let's go back to Pat. I got us a little off topic. Actually, I got us way off

578
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,020
topic because we were talking about the bleeding, but there was this other enormous complication

579
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,780
of a prostatectomy, which was it virtually guaranteed that a man would not be continent

580
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:36,940
with respect to urine and would not be able to regain erectile function. And so I'm guessing

581
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:42,140
that many men when faced with an operation that's going to leave them in a diaper, unable to have an

582
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:49,740
erection might opt for not having surgery. Yeah. So people had radiation and radiation has changed

583
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:55,500
a lot too. So it was bad radiation or a bad surgery effectively. But when you can actually

584
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,460
see what you're doing, just for the listener, doing something when it's pitch blackout versus

585
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:05,820
daylight, it makes all the difference in the world. And so you would go into the operating room with

586
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,100
him and he had just a mastery and he could control, he understood where the veins were. He

587
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:16,140
controlled them by suturing them before they started bleeding. And by doing that, you could

588
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,940
actually see everything. And once you could see everything, it was obvious. You'd be like, hello,

589
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:27,020
why aren't people doing this or that? Now, the ability to maintain potency and preserve

590
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:33,580
sexual function was something that it's not so obvious how to do that. But he figured that out

591
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:39,340
by working with some anatomists and really just studying and talking to his patients and listening

592
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:45,580
to what they had to say. He also recorded all of his cases, which I do now too, and I study them.

593
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,980
And he learned how to kind of- I didn't know that about Pat. He would record all the operations and

594
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,740
study them. And I didn't realize that you were doing that either. I do now. It's much easier now

595
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,540
for us. I mean, we just hit the button, but every single case I record it. And we're working on,

596
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:07,260
I'm working on with one of my residents just making a photo video library. So what was hard for him

597
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,380
and he's published and he put out on DVD his operation, you can see it on YouTube and it's

598
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:18,460
a brilliant thing. But one of the things that makes doing any surgery fun is that there's so

599
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:25,260
much variability in anatomy. So what I'm working on now is a video library. So 10 bladder necks,

600
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:30,780
15 of these, because there's so much variability in how the tissues present themselves to you.

601
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,900
And then how do you handle that? And that's part of what taking a surgical skill and hours in the

602
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,940
cockpit do for you. So we're doing with one of our lab residents this year, we're just taking all

603
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:46,380
these videos. And so whenever I do a case and the anatomy was really nice for X, Y, or Z,

604
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,940
I'll tell them, they pull that case and it's in the third 20 minute clip and pull it and make

605
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,300
a short, just make a clip of that for particular steps of the procedure. Was there a moment when

606
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:02,460
Pat realized he was onto something and that this was, we were basically witnessing a paradigm shift,

607
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,540
which is such an overused term, except here it's not at all. It's actually an understatement here,

608
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,500
but such a paradigm shift and how an operation was going to be done. I mean, this would have been

609
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,300
in the early eighties, I'm guessing. It was, yeah. Well, mid to late eighties or late eighties,

610
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:20,060
early nineties. And so it was, I think he knew all along he was onto something and he was very

611
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:25,740
confident. He's not a shy guy and he'll tell you that. So he was incredibly confident that he was

612
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:31,340
onto something and that what he was doing was the right thing to do and was very convinced of that

613
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:36,540
and was convincing of that when he spoke about it publicly. I think that the general community was

614
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:43,420
less convinced that that was what he had done was really happening. But I mean, I saw it. I mean,

615
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:49,020
I was really training there at the heyday, the peak of Brady Urology, Johns Hopkins Urology. And so

616
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:55,020
I got to see it in real life and I never saw bad surgery. That's the thing. I mean,

617
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,420
we trained at this place and it didn't really rarely did you see people do a bad operation. So

618
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,180
part of learning is to see the good stuff and the bad stuff and put it all in the perspective. And

619
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,100
we didn't have most of the time that didn't happen there. So I saw it and I think he was

620
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,540
convinced of it from the get go. So you're saying it just kind of took a little bit of time for the

621
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:17,500
day to speak for itself. I mean, the results. So if a patient today goes to a highly trained

622
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:24,140
or competent urologist and is going to have a prostatectomy and this, it's a 60 year old man.

623
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:30,300
What can you guesstimate about his probability of regaining sexual function? It's not a hundred

624
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:37,260
percent and it's not a hundred percent because it used to be zero, but now it's, well, the nerves

625
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,820
that we preserve at the time of surgery to optimize recovery of sexual function are not

626
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,460
myelinated. So they're incredibly sensitive to any kind of manipulation, any kind of trauma.

627
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:52,380
So one of my good friends is a hand surgeon and he does microvascular nerve graphs all the time

628
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,260
and the nerves regenerate and regain function. They do that because they're myelinated and

629
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:02,220
incredibly protected. I didn't realize there were such thing as non myelinated nerves.

630
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,700
Are there other places in the body where these exist besides the prostate? I'm sure there are.

631
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:12,380
I just, I'm below the belt guys. So I don't know. Is there an evolutionary reason that those would

632
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,540
not be myelinated? I don't know, but we can, I'll call Pat Walsh up when we finish this and he'll

633
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:22,380
tell me for 20 minutes what an Indian I am and how I didn't know that. Can we record that discussion?

634
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,660
We could.

635
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,660
Okay. So that's a very interesting point that I actually was unaware of and I can see now why

636
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:33,180
that makes it that much more difficult. Right. Because you can preserve this tissue and you can

637
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:39,580
do it in a way that's minimally traumatic for the tissue, yet it's not a guarantee that there'll be

638
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:45,020
a hundred percent recovery of function or any function recovery. Right. And so that is the

639
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,740
variable and that's the fact that it still hasn't changed. You know, like Dr. Walsh would always

640
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:55,420
tell me if, if we could do the perfect operation, there'd be no dispute about doing prostate cancer

641
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:03,500
surgery, perfect operation, 100% cancer control and no side effects. So I think in this day and age,

642
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,980
you can be nearly perfect for kind of urinary control. You're never going to be perfect. So

643
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,980
when people say that none of their patients have urinary leakage, it doesn't make any sense

644
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:19,420
because if you actually survey 60 or 165 year old guys, 4% of them will have urinary leakage.

645
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,020
I mean, so incontinence is something that happens. It's much more common in women,

646
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:31,100
particularly aging women, but it's also occurs in aging men. So to say, well, I do a hundred percent

647
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:35,340
of my cases and there's no urinary incontinence, that's kind of means. Yeah, it's better than the

648
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:40,060
baseline. So it's hard to believe. Yeah. But you can get people up to very, very close to that

649
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:46,060
number. So I always tell people for me personally, 98% of my patients are totally dry, wear one small

650
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,140
pattern line or day, which often people just wear for protection when they're out and about,

651
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:58,060
functionally totally fine. Now for a 50 year old man, I think there's over 90% chance that you can

652
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:04,860
recover. Sexual functioning. Yeah. But with each deck member, erectile dysfunction is a disease

653
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:11,340
of the aging male. So for each decade that somebody gets older, there's decline in sexual function.

654
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,460
So even if people say that they're totally potent and they're 70,

655
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,860
they'll tell you if you ask them, oh my yeah, I'm not as good as I was when I was 20.

656
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:24,540
So there's that component of things. And the other factor is prostate cancer. And it's not like

657
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:30,540
there's the prostate, there's five millimeters of tissue. And then there's this nerve bundle.

658
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:37,500
There's the prostate. There's no capsule or lining encasing the prostate. And then there's

659
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:45,180
the neurovascular bundle of Walsh named after Dr. Walsh. So you have prostate. The prostate itself

660
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:49,820
has different zones or different regions. Prostate cancers develop in the peripheral region or

661
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:55,100
peripheral zone. So right at the edge of the prostate. So you have a tumor at the edge of

662
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:59,900
the prostate, and then you have the nerve bundle. And so you're talking about one or two cell.

663
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,540
So that's kind of a cruel trick of fate is to have the cancers not develop centrally.

664
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:10,460
They don't develop centrally, they develop peripherally. So I understand why patients by

665
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,740
listeners just say, well, I don't, you know, why don't you just, you know what, I don't get it.

666
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:19,180
Because in many cases today, we I've published on this a lot now, you know, there's prostate

667
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:24,460
cancers that we pick up today are just bulkier, they're more aggressive. And so when you have a

668
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,220
tumor that you know is going to be outside the prostate, you know, it's extra prostatic.

669
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,260
It's involving the nerve bundle a lot of the times. And so you have to remove part of it.

670
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:37,740
You have to remove, you know, the tissue around it to try to clear your margins. And so

671
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:42,140
when you do that in a 65 year old guy, and you take out half of his nerve on one side,

672
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:47,900
it's unlikely that he'll be able to regain sexual function on his own. Now these days,

673
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,940
I try to be very upfront about that. And I try to set appropriate expectations.

674
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,180
We can we have special tools that we have in neurology that will enable a man to get

675
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,060
total satisfaction sexually. So we can maneuver around that, so to speak. And these days,

676
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:10,380
many of the people I see have very aggressive cancers that are, quote unquote, the real deal.

677
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,460
So we really have to be careful and you know, our number one goal for doing cancer surgery is to

678
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:19,100
get the tumor out. Let's talk a little bit about prostate cancer, because it's not a cancer that

679
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,180
comes without its controversy. So let's start with the biggest controversy, certainly one of the

680
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:28,060
biggest controversies or things that would confuse the layperson, because about every year,

681
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:35,580
the advice changes on this thing called PSA. So what is the prostate specific antigen?

682
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:42,300
PSA is a protein, it's made by the prostate. And its normal function is to liquefy semen.

683
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:47,740
So it's highly expressed in the process. So the way I explain the prostate to people,

684
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:52,700
it's the best analogy I can come up with is if you think about it like a sewer system,

685
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:58,540
you have the main sewer leaving the city. That's the urethra, that's the tube that we normally

686
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:04,780
urinate through. But this channel also delivers semen out the tip of the penis. Off this main sewer

687
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:10,060
are slightly smaller sewers that go to different neighborhoods. Within the neighborhood,

688
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:14,940
there's a sewer that comes out of the individual house. And the individual houses in this analogy

689
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:21,500
are prostate epithelial cells. They make components of the semen. And the semen is used to

690
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:28,300
give nutrients to the sperm while it's trying to fertilize an egg to enable the sperm to

691
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:33,740
penetrate the cervical mucus, these different functions. PSA is a protein that breaks down

692
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:40,540
the semen and liquefies it. And people think it's important for this whole process of fertilizing

693
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:47,100
an egg. So that's what it does. And if you look in the semen, the PSA numbers are 100 million

694
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:52,860
per ml. I mean, the numbers, the amount of this protein in the semen is astronomically high.

695
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,820
So that's what it is. That's what it does. So how do we use it as a tool to screen for prostate

696
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:07,260
cancer? Well, we check the values of the PSA in the blood. So since the prostate is a sexual gland,

697
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,020
if you check the values of a PSA in a eight year old boy, it would be zero because there's no

698
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:18,540
testosterone in that boy. There's no sexual development in that boy. And therefore there's,

699
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:24,700
I mean, there's some, but effectively no. Before puberty, there's very little levels of testosterone.

700
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:31,020
There's no effectively prostate epithelium and there's no PSA. As a boy goes through puberty

701
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:38,140
to become a young man. And then as he goes through the aging process, his prostate develops. And then

702
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:44,780
it starts to produce PSA as part of the components of the semen. Now, there is a certain amount of

703
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:51,340
leakage of the PSA fluid into the bloodstream. It's not quote unquote supposed to leak into the

704
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:56,460
bloodstream, but it can. And as the prostate gets bigger. So think about this concept of this

705
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:01,820
underground sewer system, the New York city sewers, right? They're getting older, they're getting

706
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:08,060
leakier. And the bigger the prostate gets and the prostate gets larger as we get older, some of these

707
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:15,260
pipes get leaky and some of the PSA leaks into the blood. So it was discovered in the eighties

708
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:22,060
that there's this prostate specific protein that you can pick up in the semen and you can also see

709
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:29,340
in the blood. And so it is not cancer specific. It's prostate specific. And it's actually a very

710
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:35,820
good biomarker for prostate size. The bigger the prostate, the more leaky it is, so to speak.

711
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,340
And the leakier it is, the higher the numbers can go in the bloodstream.

712
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:45,740
So there's two variables that can progress over time. The size itself, which you could talk about

713
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:51,420
that independent of size. So two 30 year olds, one guy's got a five gram prostate, the other guy's

714
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:56,140
got a hundred gram prostate just to make it extreme. You should see a difference, but also

715
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:00,620
two guys with the same size prostate that are two decades apart, you might see a higher PSA

716
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:06,300
in the older. That's right. So, and if you do, for example, like we were always taught in

717
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,540
residency, even though I wasn't a urologist, you still once in a while have to, we still did a

718
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:16,300
urology rotation. If I recall, you wouldn't check a PSA on a man right after doing a rectal exam on

719
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,780
because in theory that could artificially have raised the PSA, presumably by creating more of

720
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:26,220
an insult and increasing that flow. Pushing some of it into the blood, the bloodstream. So what can

721
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:33,020
make the PSA rise besides just having getting older and having a larger prostate? Well, if you

722
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:38,140
get an infection in your prostate. So think about that. Like you got your city, you have your sewer

723
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:42,620
network and there's an earthquake. All the pipes are ratted a little bit and they all are extra

724
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:48,140
leaky. And that's what an infection is. It's not infections in the prostate or either all or none,

725
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:53,420
really. They're not focal. So the whole prostate gets more leaky and the PSA number can go way up.

726
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:58,140
The other way to think about it is if you have a cancer and the analogy would be, well, there's

727
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:04,060
a city block that has the pipes, the sewer systems clogged. There's more backflow into the

728
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:08,140
bloodstream and that's how I pick it up. That's not really how it happens, but that's a good way

729
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:15,340
for patients to think about it. So what is a normal PSA? Well, a normal PSA is age adjusted.

730
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:23,100
So a normal PSA for a 40 year old is around 0.5 to 0.6 nanograms per ml. For a 50 year old, normal,

731
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:28,940
meaning this is the median for all the population. For a 50 year old, it's one. And so it kind of goes

732
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:36,460
up stepwise by decade. So there are age adjustments that we do for the PSA number. Now, what are PSA

733
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:42,620
numbers that tell you you don't have a cancer? There's no PSA number that is 100% no cancer.

734
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:51,500
But there is a proportional rise in cancer detection with rising PSA numbers. So originally,

735
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:58,220
the cutoff was set at a PSA of four. We think about things more based on the individual

736
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:04,380
scenario. So if you're a younger person, if your PSA is more than 2.5, that's usually considered

737
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,020
to be abnormal and you may need further workup. You don't need a biopsy right away these days,

738
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:13,900
in my opinion, but you need further workup. So it depends on the age of the patient and depends on

739
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:18,860
how also their prostate size. Now, many guys will go and when they get their PSA checked,

740
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:23,180
there's another thing that gets checked called the free PSA. And then a number is reported,

741
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:28,860
which is the percentage free, which is obviously that if their PSA is three and their free PSA is

742
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:34,380
one and the percent free is reported as 33%. What does that mean? These are different ways for

743
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:41,980
urologists to try to fine tune this prostate specific antigen test to make it more a cancer

744
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:49,260
specific test. So again, PSA just goes up when you have an every man has, it's not cancer specific.

745
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:56,300
So percent free PSA was the first way that urologists began to look at, well, what's the chance

746
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:04,300
that a PSA of four is coming from a cancer versus a PSA for coming from just benign overgrowth.

747
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,420
So remember, there's a lot of factors in play. One would be, if you had a man whose prostate

748
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:16,620
volume was 80 grams, that's big, and his PSA was four, well, that's a low ratio. That's something

749
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:22,700
called PSA density, how much PSA is made per gram of tissue. So you'd say, well, that guy,

750
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:30,700
it's very low chance that he has a cancer. That guy would also have a high percent free PSA.

751
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:38,140
So percent free PSA is another way to just look at how much of the PSA is produced from benign

752
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:44,300
cells versus cancerous cells. So if two guys have a PSA of four and one has a free of one,

753
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:49,980
so he's 25% free and the other guy has a free of three, which is 75% free,

754
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:55,900
what's the different physiologically in those situations? Well, there's less bound PSA in the

755
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:01,740
lower percent free, and that's more often associated with prostate cancer. So that's just a correlation.

756
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:06,700
So it's not like it means that... In other words, it's hard, we can't infer what, because I would

757
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:11,500
have assumed that the binding protein is in the periphery. It's in the plasma, right?

758
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:17,180
Yeah, it's bound up when it comes out of the epithelial cell. So it's just how it's processed.

759
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:23,900
So PSA's process is not a full length protein when it's born. And so the other way that we now... So

760
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:30,140
just for the listeners, so we have absolute cutoffs for PSA for an older man, 2.5 and younger man,

761
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:35,260
but they're all really case specific in my opinion. Percent free PSA was the first way to say,

762
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:41,340
let's try to fine tune what the PSA means. So a high percent free PSA is associated with a big

763
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:49,420
prostate, less of a chance of prostate cancer. A low percent free PSA is associated with a higher

764
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:55,820
likelihood that that PSA is produced from a gland with prostate cancer in it. The other variables

765
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:01,740
that we use are PSA density. So that's highly predictive of what's going on in the prostate.

766
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:07,100
So an easy threshold or cutoff for you Peter, we talk on the phone about some of your patients.

767
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:14,620
Percent free PSA density more than 0.1. It raises a little bit of a red flag. A PSA density of more

768
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:22,060
than 0.15, that raises a red flag. So think about it. And that median prostate volume for a 60 year

769
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:30,220
old guy is 40 grams. So 40 gram prostate PSA less than four. It's probably, it's pretty safe.

770
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:35,820
A PSA of six, six, that raises red flags. And you know this from your own patients that, okay,

771
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:41,180
that guy probably has something going on. So that's how I think about it. Now think about the 80

772
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:46,460
gram prostate with the PSA of four. Oh, you have these patients in your practice. They don't have

773
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:52,460
cancer on average, right? Percent free PSA helps with that. There are two other new tests that.

774
01:07:53,420 --> 01:08:00,780
Yeah. So you got me onto the 4K two years ago and I really consider it a game changer for the guys

775
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:06,140
like me who were in the peanut gallery. So I don't, you know, I make it my job to know as much as is

776
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:11,660
knowable with the time that I have about every possible disease that could afflict my patients.

777
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:15,740
But that means I need to spend as much time thinking about colon cancer as I do coronary

778
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:22,700
artery disease as I do prostate cancer. So for me, the 4K, which again, you didn't, I mean, you did

779
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,820
me a great service. Not only did you get me interested in it, but you introduced me to Andrew

780
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:29,180
at Memorial Sloan Kettering. I'm blanking on Andrew's last name. Andrew Vickers. Vickers, yeah.

781
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:33,660
Amazing guy. Yes. And I mean, the guy couldn't have been more generous with his time. I mean,

782
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:38,700
he just gave me the schooling tutorial on this topic. He's a brilliant guy. So good. You know,

783
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,060
we put together a patient handout on this thing and he even edited it for us.

784
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:49,020
I feel like not, I'm worried not enough patients understand that and I'm worried not enough primary

785
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:54,140
care physicians understand the importance of the 4K test. Can you explain how that has changed

786
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:58,140
the way we do things? So this test you're alluding to, and there's another test that

787
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,980
performs equally well called the Prostate Health Index or PHI test. These both leverage off this

788
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:12,460
idea that prostate cancer cells make PSA differently than benign prostate cells.

789
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:20,860
And so the 4K score is the four calicrine tests. It takes PSA, percent free PSA, intact PSA,

790
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:28,540
and HK2. It takes those four prostate specific proteins produced and it has a calculator to

791
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:36,620
really just discriminate between a cancerous cell and a benign cell. PHI uses the similar concept.

792
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:42,540
It uses something called minus 2 Pro-PSA, which is PSA for all the scientists out there plus two

793
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:49,340
amino acids on the five prime side of it. So minus 2 Pro-PSA, right? And you measure those specific

794
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:55,980
PSA based proteins in the blood. And the 4K score is great because Andrew Vickers and Hans

795
01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:01,580
Lillia developed it with this other great urologist, Peter Scardino Memorial. And what they

796
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:06,940
looked at was, well, what's the chance that this person is diagnosed with and has high grade

797
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:11,980
aggressive lethal prostate cancer? And it gives you a percentile chance. So when you get the 4K

798
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:17,900
report, it's actually a really nice report. It'll say 2% chance, 20% chance, and so forth. And so

799
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:23,500
now as you start using this in your practice, they now also give you the PSA. So you can see the PSA

800
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:28,300
and then you can say, wait a second, this guy's PSA is six, but it's 4K scores two, it's safe.

801
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:34,540
What I really like about it is, and so when we do our, usually with our patients in their second

802
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,540
year, sometimes in the first year, but usually in their second year, we do a cancer screening

803
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:42,860
program where we kind of walk them through every single cancer that you could possibly die of.

804
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:50,380
And then we go cancer by cancer, risk by risk. And it's a very lengthy process on the back end.

805
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:55,260
For the patient, we simplified it, takes about 90 minutes to go through it. But for the males,

806
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:00,700
when we come to this, I always view this as one of the better, I said, I wish every cancer had a

807
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:06,780
test like this because as we'll come back to, pretty much every guy is going to die with prostate

808
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:12,460
cancer, but fortunately most men will not die from prostate cancer. Our job is to figure out

809
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:16,060
when a guy has prostate cancer, as you alluded to earlier, is this the bad one?

810
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:16,380
Yeah.

811
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,100
Or is this the one that if you muck around with it too much?

812
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:23,500
And so what I guess Vickers and his team have been able to do is figure out that there's now

813
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:31,260
enough data that you can basically turn this into a binary test, so PSA would be a continuous

814
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:35,820
variable. And when you want to test the sensitivity and specificity of a continuous variable, you have

815
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,980
to use something called a receiver operating characteristic curve, and it becomes quite

816
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:45,340
complicated because the question becomes what cutoff? And as you alluded to, it's very difficult

817
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:50,700
with PSA because it has to be age and volume adjusted. So now it's a three dimensional

818
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,660
receiver operating characteristic curve where you would have a different AUC area under the curve

819
01:11:55,660 --> 01:12:04,300
for each point in time and volume. I mean, that becomes almost inconceivable. And yet the 4K has

820
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:10,780
basically allowed us to say the following, if your 4K score is less than 7.5%, and I might butcher the

821
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,620
numbers a little bit, but- That's the right number, yeah.

822
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:18,700
But if it's less than 0.5%, the probability that you will be alive, the probability that you will

823
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:22,860
die of metastatic prostate cancer is 1.6% in the next 20 years?

824
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:28,220
Yeah, it's almost the lifetime of the patient. And that's based on this data from Andrew's

825
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:32,380
partner, a co-developer Hans Lilja, where they had this incredible-

826
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,180
They had a database.

827
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:33,340
Yeah.

828
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,820
From Malmo, Sweden. So they could track it.

829
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:42,300
And then the reverse is if you're greater than 7.5%, I think it's like 16 or 17% chance in 20

830
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:48,380
years. The binary cutoff is 7.5%. But it's a continuous variable. But above that, it's

831
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:53,500
continuous. It's not like if you're above that, it's a 50%. So it varies based on the number.

832
01:12:53,500 --> 01:13:01,180
So where are we today? Let's take a journey backwards in time. In the late 1980s, 40% of

833
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:07,900
men who were coming in with prostate cancer had metastatic at the time of presentation.

834
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:15,500
Just like a lot of cancers, other cancers that we diagnosed today. And that was how it was then.

835
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,980
There was an epidemic of deaths from prostate cancer. We were getting a better handle on how

836
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:24,940
to control cardiovascular deaths. People were coming in with aggressive advanced

837
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:32,780
cancers. Prostate was one of them. Tom Stamey took this PSA test, and he first made the

838
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,500
observation that you could use it to actually follow men after their cancer treatment.

839
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:42,860
And if the number went up, gosh, that meant that their cancer was back. It was just a game changer.

840
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:48,140
This is the first time this was ever done. And then Bill Catalona, who's one of my partners here,

841
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:52,620
one of the other godfathers in the field, he said, why don't we use it to screen people to

842
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:58,300
pick up cancers when they're early and curable, not when they come in in advanced. So the change-

843
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,140
And what year was that? That would have been-

844
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:08,060
1990 FDA approval. So they set up arbitrary cutoffs. This is what this idea of mass screening

845
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:14,460
took off. And it's been sold to the public. Will the urologists route there just to make money?

846
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:19,260
This is what we are doing and to get rich? No, it wasn't that. It was because at the time the test

847
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:25,260
was developed, it was the first biomarker for cancer. Pick up a cancer early if you pick it up,

848
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:32,140
treat it and cure that patient. Now over the 1990s and early 2000s, what we realized is, well,

849
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:37,900
guess what? We're picking up a lot of cancers. We're treating a lot of cancers. Number one,

850
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:43,740
we're increasing and reducing the deaths from prostate cancer. We're reducing the incidence

851
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:51,820
of metastatic prostate cancer at presentation. It was 40% in basically 1990, 40% of men coming in

852
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:59,100
with prostate cancer metastatic at the time. By 2000, it was 4%. Now the skeptic is going to say,

853
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:03,500
and this is such a controversial topic, so it's so good that we're doing this. The skeptic will say,

854
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:08,620
well, that's just lead time bias. I mean, all you did was catch a bunch of men earlier. So you have

855
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:14,700
a much bigger funnel, right? Right. So by the way, the same controversy exists on mammography. So I

856
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:18,780
can't wait to actually sit down with the Ted Shafer equivalent of breast cancer at some point,

857
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:23,340
because I realized that an episode like this is probably a little bit more geared towards male

858
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:28,700
listeners or probably the female listeners who have male spouses or people that care about going

859
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:33,820
through this. But it's interesting to watch the rise of mammography and the rise of PSA go through

860
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:39,420
this parallel thing. And colonoscopy though, to a slightly lesser extent, but really being the big

861
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:43,820
three mass employed screening tools. Well, it's been written about. Peter.

862
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:47,820
And you've written about this. Well, Peter Albertson is another Hopkins alum. He's a

863
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:52,380
chair at Connecticut and he's an anti-screener effectively for prostate cancer. And he wrote

864
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:57,420
about this and he showed that if you just look at incidents of metastatic prostate cancer,

865
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:02,540
incidents of metastatic breast cancer, there's no change with the implementation of mammography.

866
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:07,740
There's a huge drop in the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer with the implementation of PSA.

867
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,940
So why is he an anti-screener? Well, he just, he was historically, he wrote this paper

868
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:20,460
and showed that there was a huge difference. So now with screening, you have increased detection

869
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:25,820
and what we've learned is unlike, let's say pancreatic cancer, where most of the time,

870
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:31,580
if you picked it up early, if you did nothing, you would die. Not everybody who has prostate

871
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:37,980
cancer has a lethal variation of it. And so initially we developed a biomarker to pick up

872
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:43,740
all prostate cancers. That was the PSA blood test. We picked them up, we treated them,

873
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:49,180
we reduced deaths. We also over treated people, people who had a cancer that would never have

874
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:54,380
been lethal in their lifetime. That's the dying with, not the dying from. And this is something

875
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:59,660
you and I used to talk about nearly 20 years ago. I remember sitting in the cafeteria,

876
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:05,820
because even though we were still interns and basically two knuckleheads, you knew you were

877
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,540
going to do this and you were always head and shoulders above everybody else in terms of what

878
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:13,260
you understood. I remember asking you, I was like, I don't get it. Why do some guys get prostate

879
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:21,180
cancer? And it seems to be relatively uninteresting. And then other guys get it and they're dead in two

880
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:26,540
years and it's as devastating as pancreatic cancer. What is it about the biology of that?

881
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:33,020
Because it strikes me as more a function of the biology than the environment or the host,

882
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,940
but I could be wrong, of course. But I remember talking about this a lot and really coming away,

883
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,900
scratching my head thinking, I don't have a clue what's going on with this disease.

884
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,900
Yeah. I mean, I'm still scratching my head about it because that's what my whole research program

885
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:48,380
is all about is, well, what's the molecular biology of lethal prostate cancer? So we'll talk

886
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:54,540
about that in a second. But to circle back to our story, so we diagnosed many men with prostate

887
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:59,020
cancer. We treated men and we saved their lives and reduced deaths from prostate cancer period.

888
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:03,580
It's not debatable, but along the way, there were people that were pulled in and were treated

889
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:08,300
who did not need treatment. But there's a lot of smart people who have studied the biology of

890
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:13,340
prostate cancer and we realized that not everybody who was diagnosed with it needed to be treated

891
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:21,420
from it. And so the 4K score and the prostate health index help us identify men who have

892
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:26,300
life threatening or potentially lethal prostate cancers. And so those are great

893
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:30,780
screening tools. They're not considered or the government doesn't like them as first line

894
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:37,420
screening. So they recommend you do a regular PSA blood test if it's at all abnormal. Remember,

895
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:43,980
70% of men have normal PSAs if they're such a thing. And by the way, do we have a sense of what

896
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:49,500
percentage of those men can still harbor a lethal prostate cancer? Well, Vickers would know that

897
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:54,460
data and they've published on that. It depends what you say normal and not normal is. Yeah.

898
01:18:55,180 --> 01:19:00,300
I mean, a PSA below three, there are still men that have, if you just do one test, it's...

899
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,780
Assuming it's not a lab error or you miss something. Yeah. No, no, below three, I still

900
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:11,980
think the 4K data says it's somewhere around, I want to say 10 or 15%. So it's not a single

901
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:17,020
digit thing. And another big opposition in the screening world is the quote unquote unnecessary

902
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:21,260
biopsies. And I say quote unquote, not because I'm diminishing or minimizing that, but the idea is,

903
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:25,980
look, a prostate biopsy is a transrectal procedure for most men. It's a morbid procedure,

904
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:29,660
it's not comfortable. And just as it's not comfortable for a woman to have a needle put

905
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:35,660
into her breast. And the fear is, hey, we're doing too many of these. I want to circle back to that,

906
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:43,260
but my view on that today is diffusion weighted MRI and the MRIs that we have today have really

907
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:47,660
cut back on those biopsies. But I want to get your... That's just my take as a non-neurologist

908
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:53,740
with my patients, but I want to come back to that. Well, so the government said in 2008, first

909
01:19:53,740 --> 01:20:01,260
for people over 75, and then in 2012 for all men that you shouldn't do PSA testing. And when the

910
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:05,740
internist got to go ahead and not do it, I mean, it's easy to not do it, right? You just don't do

911
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,980
it. So what would you predict would happen if you stopped screening for prostate cancer? Well,

912
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:14,220
you would predict it would go up and it would depend on the time horizon of the disease.

913
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:19,580
So if you stop screening for prostate cancer, you'd predict that the detection of prostate

914
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:24,620
cancer will go down, right? You're not looking for it. But you're going to have a greater number

915
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:29,420
of late presenting diseases show. More lethal disease. So we published, and some of my good

916
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:34,700
friends in neurology have published that, yes, that in fact has occurred. So if you look at

917
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:40,780
starting in 08 or in 12, when these two big shifts occurred, since that time, there's been a rise in

918
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:49,260
the incidence of more advanced prostate cancer. So the cancers that are picked up today, even with

919
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:53,900
this short window where we stopped screening aggressively with the internists, that there's

920
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:58,940
now more aggressive, more lethal disease. As of today, I still believe that the formal

921
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:04,300
recommendation for screening for prostate cancer is each physician and patient should discuss

922
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:08,540
together. There is no formal recommendation because when we go through each cancer with

923
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:15,020
our patients, we show them what the ACA, what the American Cancer Society says, the US task

924
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:20,140
force on preventative services, the NCI, the New England Journal of Medicine did a review on every

925
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:25,420
cancer and there's one other group. Oh, the CDC is the fifth body to weigh in. And we show them,

926
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:30,860
here are the recommendations from all five of these for every cancer. And I remember when that

927
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:36,060
shift changed to for prostate cancer, there's no more recommendation. Well, the recommendation is

928
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:40,300
talk about it with your doctor, which is a bit of a pass the buck. Besides the, I think the American

929
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:47,340
Academy of Family Practitioners and they don't recommend PSA screening still. I'm not sure why,

930
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:53,180
but that's a different discussion. But the bottom line is that almost all the guidelines now say

931
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:57,020
it's a shared decision making process, which I think makes perfect sense. That's how I view

932
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:01,500
modern medicine. Yeah, it does. In theory, it makes great sense. What I worry about, Ted, is

933
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,820
there's a bunch of patients that get caught. They don't have doctors like you or me who are

934
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:10,540
willing to be able to have the luxury of the time and the ability to educate themselves to do that,

935
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:15,580
because I still see a lot of patients that show up and they're not getting screened because their

936
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:21,020
doctor's basically saying, well, obviously this is quote unquote controversial. I sort of remember

937
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:24,300
hearing that we shouldn't have been screening, so we're not going to do it. And that's sort of my

938
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:29,820
fear with these things. Well, I think shared decision making, it requires... Well, so then

939
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:35,260
to me conceptually, it makes a lot of sense. In reality, what does that actually mean? Well,

940
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:39,580
that's the next question. That's the next unknown, right? Is well, how's our shared decision making

941
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:44,700
process? How does it occur? And when a patient sees you, that's different than when a patient

942
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:51,260
sees an average internist, let's say, and it's different when a patient doesn't see any doctor.

943
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:57,180
So, the idea that there's the bus that rolls up that just does your blood work and sends it back

944
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:01,580
to you in the mail, that's terrible. I mean, I did that when I was a resident, they paid me 50 bucks

945
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:06,700
and go man, the bus and do that. That's not really doing that patient, those individual men,

946
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:12,940
they're not helping those people because you don't know their whole health history and all that.

947
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:19,180
So, I experienced that and I got into it with Otis Brawley about screening and he raised that

948
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:23,500
point and it's valid. I did that when I was a resident because I was told to do it and it wasn't,

949
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:27,980
that's a mistake just bringing up the bus and doing blood tests in the Walmart parking lot.

950
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:33,660
That's not a good answer. Having a discussion with the physician is, their internist is a good

951
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:38,300
answer because I have many patients. What were the bus parameters by the way? Men between age?

952
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,900
Any guy who showed up. Literally any dude who shows up could get a free PSA.

953
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:46,220
Yeah. You know, and then they'd say, how did I not know you were doing that?

954
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:49,660
I did it once or twice, you know, when I was a lab year resident and they'd say,

955
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:54,220
go ahead and do you want to earn 50 bucks? And remember I drove to some civil war

956
01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:01,500
town in Northern Virginia. It was a cool town. I did it on a Saturday for half day and I did it

957
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:05,740
and it was like in hindsight, you say, okay, I get it. It was worth doing because now I understand

958
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:11,020
how bad that was and what a mistake that was. Now, conversely, I have a lot of patients that

959
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:18,540
rolled in. They're super healthy, 68 year old guys with PSAs of 20 and they have a bad rectal exam.

960
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:25,980
They had a PSA when they were 60 and it was three and they'd come in and I've had a couple of

961
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:30,940
experiences where the spouse is just hysterical because she's like, how could this guy,

962
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:36,780
her husband's internist just stop the test and not discuss it with us?

963
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:41,980
And to be clear, where is the screening recommendation on rectal exam? Well,

964
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:49,020
it's variable. I mean, I think a rectal exam adds value. Many of the internist societies say that

965
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:53,020
you don't necessarily need to do it. I do think it requires experience, but I think it's part of the

966
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:57,820
physical exam. So you should do it. If you do it enough, you'll get an idea for what's really bad

967
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:02,620
and what's not. And so I have a lot of really good internists that still do it and they do a great

968
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:07,980
job. And so I think it's regional and it's also varies by the country. I could probably use a

969
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:12,380
tutorial on it, but I do it a lot and I realize that it's-

970
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:15,420
Can you insert like a zipper noises? I'll show you how to do it.

971
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:20,380
Perfect. I want the technique, but I can see that if it's something you're just not doing

972
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:24,460
frequently, if it's something you would only do on someone who shows up with a high PSA,

973
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,260
you're not getting the reps. You got to sort of know what normal feels like.

974
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:27,900
The same thing is-

975
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:28,860
What does a 20 year old prostate feel like?

976
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:29,820
Listening to a heart.

977
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:34,460
You don't need a 20 year old prostate exam, but you listen to the heart of everybody and that's

978
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,020
how you know when you detect pathology. It's the same-

979
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,380
But in trauma, you got all of those.

980
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:39,340
You did.

981
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,260
Yeah. In trauma, you got to see a lot of normal

982
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:41,900
prostate.

983
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:46,380
So I think that the guidelines have come to a medium. The pendulum was both ways.

984
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:54,620
I think that prostate biopsies are these days a relatively safe procedure. They're not overly

985
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:59,340
traumatic for men. There are some men that have complications. I think that that's a little bit

986
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:03,260
overly dramatized by people who are anti-screeners. The other thing that

987
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:09,020
urologists are doing today is now doing transparanial biopsies. So they're not transrectal anymore.

988
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:13,420
So if a patient's listening to this and they need to go and get a prostate biopsy, one of the things

989
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:18,620
I always tell patients is you should always... It's one thing to know what the average

990
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:21,980
complication rates are, this risk of infection, this risk of bleeding.

991
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:26,700
It's also important to ask your practitioner their personal risks because medicine is not

992
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:31,580
homogeneous. It's quite heterogeneous. So what would we say nationally would be the risk of

993
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,660
infection or bleeding from a prostate biopsy?

994
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:38,700
Well, I tell people most men have some degree of bleeding after the biopsy. When you have a bowel

995
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,220
movement, there may be a little bit of blood.

996
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,820
Let's say bleeding that requires...

997
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:48,460
Yeah, right. So that's my point. So if you go on blogs about non-anti-screeners, they'll say,

998
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:54,540
oh, 80% of men have bleeding in their rectum and 100% have blood in their urine. Yeah, sure. There

999
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:58,060
may be a little bit of pinkness or redness, or if you do a microscopic exam on the urine,

1000
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:02,300
there's blood. That's ridiculous. Of course, you can have that. But is it requiring admission

1001
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,860
to the hospital? We wrote a paper on that looking in the Medicare age population.

1002
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:12,380
The numbers, it's hard because you look at these big data sets, it's hard to know granularity.

1003
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:17,580
They say about 7% of individuals will be admitted to the hospital or seen at the ER within 30 days

1004
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:23,660
of a biopsy. That number seems high to me. I tell people at our institution, we monitor our biopsy

1005
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:29,420
infections, it's 0.4%. Got it. So somebody shows up at Northwestern knowing that seven out of a

1006
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:33,340
hundred guys are going to be back in the hospital a month, and you can say, actually, in our hands,

1007
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:37,740
our series, it's four out of a thousand. You feel a heck of a lot better. Yeah, with an infection.

1008
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:43,420
I would say that it's probably about one to 2% show up at the ER, something for an evaluation.

1009
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,900
Because you can have some problems urinating because your prostate can get a little bit swollen.

1010
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:55,100
So overall, it's low. You tell them the results. And as you alluded to before, in my practice,

1011
01:27:55,100 --> 01:28:00,460
I don't biopsy everybody. I biopsy people who I think have clinically significant prostate cancer.

1012
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:04,220
So I start with the PHI test. We have it within our system here.

1013
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,820
And so I use the 4K. Yeah, that's the same.

1014
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:09,260
Is there any reason to switch from one to the other? Are you pretty agnostic?

1015
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:14,700
No, Hans Lillian and Andrew Vickers show that they perform identically in the same serum.

1016
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:20,700
What patients, so the 4K was developed on a cohort of what sounds like pretty

1017
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:25,660
homogeneous patients, right? What was the PHI developed on? What was their cohort?

1018
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:29,500
Similar. I mean, most of these tests are done and developed in Caucasian men.

1019
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:34,140
I was going to ask you, do we run a risk here if I have an African American patient,

1020
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:38,460
and can I be misled by his 4K? Shouldn't I be-

1021
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:44,060
Well, that was a good question. And the OPCO team just published a paper based on

1022
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:48,700
validation cohort of VA patients where there was 50% African American,

1023
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:54,380
and it performed as well or slightly better. One of my partners here has a prospective trial.

1024
01:28:54,940 --> 01:29:00,380
It's him and myself looking at PHI and African American men, and the early take-home messages,

1025
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:04,700
it looks like it performs as well or better. So this is a gift. I mean, you don't normally get

1026
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:09,900
this in biology. This is exactly the kind of test that can go awry because you can get fooled by

1027
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:14,220
differences. And so I'll give you an example, right? You look at non-alcoholic fatty liver

1028
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:18,860
disease and FLD. I mean, if you want to study that disease in Hispanics and then try to make

1029
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:23,900
even the mildest inference about what's going on in African Americans, you're hosed. I mean,

1030
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:29,100
they're not even the same disease. In fact, even diabetes is quite different across races. So to

1031
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:33,020
think that something as ubiquitous as prostate cancer, even though it might be a different

1032
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:36,300
disease, because I know that African Americans, we're going to talk about this, I'm sure, have

1033
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:40,460
a different disease. But even from a screening standpoint that they could be, you could have

1034
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:45,900
one tool that is so good in both is fortuitous. Yeah, they're good tools. And then so after,

1035
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:52,860
if there's an abnormality in the PHI or 4K score, then I moved to an MRI. And then there's been good

1036
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:57,980
data. And can you just, because I mean, we geek out on this stuff because I'm super nerdy about

1037
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:02,380
what type of MRI to do for what thing. But for a patient listening to this Ted, who's going to go

1038
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:07,180
to their doctor and whose doctor is hopefully cooperative enough, what do you recommend? Because

1039
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:11,660
not all MRIs are doing the trick here. Yeah. I mean, on paper, what you want is a

1040
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:18,220
multi-parametric prostate MRI. The most important phase, the most important parameter in the

1041
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:25,500
multi-parametric MRI is actually the diffusion weighted imaging, which is the most operators

1042
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:32,300
dependent. So it really requires a skilled technician and a skilled interpreter radiologist

1043
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:38,220
to look at those DWI images. That's the most important one. So we do give patients contrast,

1044
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:44,300
but people have shown you can get a lot of value out of just a non-contrast DWI based.

1045
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:50,140
The one we use, no contrast, but it's their DWI is exceptional. I've sent you the images. I think

1046
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:54,780
if they're Schaeffer approved, I'm happy. They're very good. Yeah. T1, T2, DWI,

1047
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:59,980
multi-planar MRI. So if you're listening to that and if your doctor refuses that, I think those

1048
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:03,580
are the kinds of things that make me think you need another doctor. Because at this point,

1049
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:07,340
and look, your insurance might not cover it. You may have to foot the bill for that. And that's

1050
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:11,980
horrible if your insurance wouldn't cover that. Well, that was true, but there's recently reported

1051
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:18,620
a large multinational prospective clinical trial looking at the utility of MRI to use for screening

1052
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:24,300
for prostate cancer. And the study was half the men got an MRI. And if there was a suspicious

1053
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:29,580
lesion, they got that lesion biopsied and they increased the detection of high-grade cancer,

1054
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:34,780
reduced the over-detection of low-grade prostate cancer. So it was a quote unquote positive study.

1055
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:39,580
We haven't had problems in the Midwest and Illinois getting MRIs approved, but that

1056
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:44,780
randomized trial based out of reported out of the UK, that really has changed a lot about what

1057
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:50,540
companies are approving for MRIs for screening. That's great to hear. So if somebody has an MRI,

1058
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:55,420
if there's an abnormality on the MRI, I'll recommend a biopsy. Now, there's a lot of data

1059
01:31:55,420 --> 01:32:01,580
that says you shouldn't just sample the suspicious lesion, that you should do the suspicious lesion

1060
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:07,340
plus doing a sextant biopsy or kind of what I tell patients is right, left, top, middle, bottom.

1061
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:13,740
That adds value, not just in the detection of cancer, but if someone is going to move to

1062
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:18,220
surgery, for example, and I don't do a biopsy in a 90 year old guy, even if they have an abnormal MRI,

1063
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:23,420
do it if I think that person's going to live long enough to benefit from treatment. In those

1064
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:27,740
scenarios, I do those systematic biopsies because I want to know exactly where the extent of the

1065
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:32,940
cancer. And one of the problems with MRIs, it doesn't actually see the true boundaries or true

1066
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:37,340
borders of the tumors within the prostate very well. So they're often- Especially the DWI,

1067
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:41,500
because it's not really an anatomic test. The way a T1-weighted image is anatomic.

1068
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:49,500
So if you take the lesion on T2, for example, it often undersizes the tumor by between 5 and 10

1069
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:55,100
millimeters. So pretty significant for a prostate, which is generally pretty small. So I do those to

1070
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:58,780
get a better roadmap. I put it all together and then I'll talk to the patient about what the

1071
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:04,620
treatment should be. So my algorithm is if you have an MRI done and you have an abnormality,

1072
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:13,020
you need a biopsy. If you have an MRI done and it's negative, no lesion, but this is your quiz

1073
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:21,100
for the day, Peter, but what is high? Your PSA density is high, so you have nothing suspicious

1074
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:26,700
on MR, but a high PSA density, you need a biopsy. And sorry, in that situation, Ted, do you further

1075
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:32,140
stratify by 4K? Well, I've done the 4K or PHI upfront. Which is high enough. So you were already

1076
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:35,580
talking about a subset of patients who have a high enough. I think something's going on based

1077
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:41,980
on the blood test because 20% of the time, MRIs false negative. Got it. So now you're using the

1078
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:45,980
prostate density. And you and I actually shared an email exchange over this about six months ago.

1079
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:54,540
PSA density is so easy and it is so good. So high PSA density, usually I would say more than 0.15

1080
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:59,180
depends. Sometimes it's 0.1, depends on the age of the patient and their scenario.

1081
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:04,700
They need a biopsy anyway and 20% of the time MRIs are negative. But if they have an MRI,

1082
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:11,180
no lesion, high PSA and a low PSA density, they don't need a biopsy. So we published our series

1083
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:16,700
on that. It's not a randomized trial, but what we showed was that when we looked and compared

1084
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:22,540
the doctors that use that algorithm and those that did not, you reduce biopsies by about one third,

1085
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:26,620
you reduce detection of low-grade cancer by about one third, and you actually don't compromise the

1086
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:32,700
detection of higher grade disease. So again, we have great tools building off of this very

1087
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:38,220
simple PSA blood test to, I think, offer people very sophisticated screening for their prostate

1088
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:41,900
cancer. We've talked about that a bunch. Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about the biopsy because

1089
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:46,540
every patient here who's had a biopsy or knows somebody who's had a biopsy, there's this word

1090
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:53,340
Gleason. What's your Gleason? That could be like a t-shirt. So Donald, you guys need to do a

1091
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:56,940
fundraiser here. That could be the urology fundraiser at North West. There's a lot of things

1092
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:01,180
you could put on t-shirts. Yeah. I mean, let's take a step back from it. So as you know, one of

1093
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:06,060
my best friends from medical school, my roommate from medical school, Matt McCormick, is now an

1094
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:11,420
excellent urologist up in Reno. And I just saw Matt a couple of weeks ago and we were kind of just,

1095
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:16,940
we have a patient in common by total luck. So the patient came to see me and he lives in Reno. And

1096
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:20,140
I said, oh, that's so funny. My roommate from med school is up in Reno and his name's Matt

1097
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:25,580
McCormick. And he's like, Dr. McCormick is my doctor. I couldn't believe it. What a small world.

1098
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:30,140
But I remember in medical school, like one of the things that drew Matt to urology,

1099
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,940
because we all thought Matt was going to be an orthopedic surgeon. There was just,

1100
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:36,460
it's like the most amazing athlete in the history of civilization. Like this guy's going to be an

1101
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:40,700
orthopod because that's what you expect your athletes to do. But then when we all started

1102
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,460
our doing our rotations, he sort of fell in love with urology. And I think a big part of it had to

1103
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:49,980
do with two, there were two things. One was, it's a field where you can't take yourself that

1104
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:55,740
seriously. Like in the end, it's a funny, funny field. Like there's just a lot of dick jokes.

1105
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:59,980
There's no way around it. And if you find that, if you don't think that's funny, like you're not

1106
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:05,420
going to want to be in that. You got to make it funny. And the second thing was the patients are

1107
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:09,020
so grateful. And again, I think if you're a medical student and you're listening to this,

1108
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:14,140
you've got to be able to think about what kind of patients you want to interact with. That has a

1109
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:19,580
lot to do with your chosen profession. I remember there were people in my class who loved being

1110
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:23,900
around older patients and they wanted to go into cardiology for that reason because they're like,

1111
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:29,260
look, my bread and butter, the patient I'm mostly going to see is going to be like my grandmother

1112
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:32,700
and my grandfather. And that's why I came to medical school. That's what I love. And that's

1113
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:37,660
what I want to do. And there's just something about that urology patient. And again, urology

1114
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:42,620
is a broad field because there's male urology, female urology, cancer, non-cancer. But for the

1115
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:48,140
most part, as you said, you get to fix things in people that are causing them real trouble. And

1116
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:52,460
again, I'm not minimizing the stuff that I was interested in, which is like pancreatic cancer.

1117
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:56,940
But when you take a person's pancreatic cancer out, they don't necessarily feel any better.

1118
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:59,420
That's true. They usually feel worse because it's a big surgery.

1119
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:04,060
It's a huge operation. And it's a lethal, I mean, I think that there's a lot of urology that,

1120
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:09,980
I mean, look, the patients that we take, the people in urology are great. And so going to

1121
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:14,700
work every day is just a blast. I mean, everybody's smart. Everybody's fun. They don't take themselves

1122
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:20,540
too seriously. That helps. The patients are wonderful people. They're incredibly grateful.

1123
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:27,500
And then urologists also, you know, we own the diagnosis. So a lot of other surgical specialties,

1124
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:32,220
let's say colorectal surgery is an example. Very few of the diagnoses come from the colorectal

1125
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:39,580
surgeon. And therefore, if you own the diagnoses, you own the pretreatment, the pre-diagnostic work,

1126
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:44,060
you do the intervention and you follow the patient afterward. And so one of the nice things

1127
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:49,420
in urology is that you have this great longitudinal care with patients. And so many of my patients

1128
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:55,180
followed me from Baltimore. And you know, my nurse, Marie, who's fabulous, she hates me because,

1129
01:37:55,180 --> 01:38:00,140
you know, I'll have like a 15 minute return double book, but it's one of my old Hopkins patients,

1130
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:02,700
you know, I'm in the room for two hours, you know, and she's like, what were you doing in there?

1131
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,900
I'm like, oh, we're talking about their kids or the goats or the whatever, you know. And so

1132
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:09,660
that part of it really makes it super fun. I forgot about the goat.

1133
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:13,020
Yeah. I love the goats. Yeah. So I've been trying to get goats.

1134
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:13,660
Goats are...

1135
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:15,420
I've been trying. I'm not winning.

1136
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,500
They're not allowed in your town?

1137
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,060
No, I just, I can't convince the family to get the goats.

1138
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:24,460
Oh my God. You got to go to, pig me goat, cutest thing ever. They're so cute. They stink,

1139
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:29,820
but they're super cute. And they're incredibly smart and they're very social. So they do not

1140
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:34,460
like, you can't just get one goat. They really, they actually, they don't, they do terribly if

1141
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:39,260
they're just by themselves. So anyway, so, you know, that's the fun part about urologists. You

1142
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:42,860
get, you know, you get these patients and they all have a mate. I mean, I learned, I love just

1143
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:48,460
talking to my patients. Dr. Walsh, he had a way to do a history. And one of the second thing he

1144
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:53,580
asked is what they did for a living. And it wasn't to kind of do a checkbook check. It was just to

1145
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:58,140
say how are you going to talk to this person? And for me, it's, I like to ask them that because I

1146
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:02,300
love to just learn about what they do. There are so many cool jobs out there, you know, so,

1147
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:07,260
you know, sound engineer for a big theater in Chicago, this or that. It's just awesome. Super

1148
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:12,140
cool. Yeah. You've had quite an illustrious career that's not even close to being over,

1149
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:16,220
which is also includes, and I know, I know you don't think much about this and I think it's more

1150
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:20,780
of a nuisance than anything else, but you've also now basically become the urologist to

1151
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:26,780
anyone in power that seems to need, you know, just as Pat was basically when we were at Hopkins,

1152
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:33,500
every VIP on the planet came to Hopkins. And I can't even as a general surgery resident rotating

1153
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:39,900
through urology, I can't believe the people that walked through that hospital, which was also true

1154
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:44,620
in pancreatic surgery and, you know, all sorts of other surgeries. But, and so of all of the,

1155
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:48,780
the sort of people I don't, I, again, I don't want to use names because I don't know how many of them

1156
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:51,900
have ever publicly talked about it. The only one who I know has publicly talked about it is Ben

1157
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:55,980
Stiller because of course you and Ben went on Howard Stern together. So how did you even get

1158
01:39:55,980 --> 01:40:00,220
introduced to Ben Stiller? And I know Ben was very private about this for a couple of years. You

1159
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:04,860
guys went, if my memory serves me correctly, it was probably a year or two after his surgery that

1160
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:09,420
you guys even went on the show together, right? Yeah, it was two years or so after that. And I

1161
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:14,860
met him through his internist, this great, really one of the best internists I've ever interacted

1162
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:18,540
with Bernie Kruger. You're telling me like, I don't know who he is. I am. I know. I'm just saying it

1163
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:23,020
for the audience. Bernie's great. So for the listener, Ted introduced me to Bernie four or

1164
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:27,740
five years ago when I was starting to practice in New York. And he said, Bernie's the best

1165
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:32,780
internist I've ever had a referral from, probably because he trained as a medical oncologist,

1166
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:37,340
but he said he's really freaking smart and he knows his stuff. And if you're going to be in New

1167
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:42,540
York, you got to meet him. So you introduced us. I went to meet Bernie. We hit it off like

1168
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:47,420
in seconds. Yeah. And he just said, why don't you just come in my office? And so to this day,

1169
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:53,100
I still sit next to Bernie. Bernie's great. So Bernie was taking care of Ben and Bernie was

1170
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:58,140
the guy who did all the right stuff. He did the blood work and it was abnormal for him and his

1171
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:04,380
age and got biopsied in New York. And then he came and met, he met with Dr. Walsh because Dr. Walsh

1172
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:09,900
wrote this, has this amazing book, Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer and Ben had

1173
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:14,620
gotten it. And so he came down to meet with Walsh, but Walsh wasn't operating anymore at that time.

1174
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:20,060
And so that's how I met him was through Bernie and through Walsh. I have a copy of the book for

1175
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:25,660
you by the way, because I convinced Dr. Walsh to do a final edition of it. Just came out in May.

1176
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:29,820
It's really, really good. So all the listeners out there, it's a great resource. So that's how

1177
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:35,020
we met. And then he had interviewed with a bunch of folks and he decided to have surgery with me,

1178
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:41,020
which was, I was honored to be able to do. And then he did great. And so he's been an amazing

1179
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:45,980
person for the field because he's not afraid to talk about his journey and what he did. And

1180
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:52,220
he really, he's an amazing person. He's just a down to earth good guy. So for me, I view each

1181
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:59,180
of my patients as VIPs, you know, really honestly in my heart of hearts do. And so yes, I take care

1182
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:04,460
of people who are, you know, important in many different professions and walks of life. And so

1183
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:09,580
it's fun to help all of them. And it's fun to go on Howard Stern with Ben Stiller. That was a great

1184
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:15,580
experience. Yeah. So by the way, it sort of occurs to me when you say this that you were still

1185
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:20,140
relatively junior as a urologist. You'd probably only been out of your training for six, seven

1186
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:26,060
years when you operated on Ben. Did that ruffle any feathers at Hopkins that you became the heir

1187
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:32,860
apparent? I mean, people tell me it did. You know, I never really thought about age in that way.

1188
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:38,700
You know, I've always pushed myself to be the best surgeon I can be and always tried to

1189
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:44,940
measure up to Pat Walsh or one of my other mentors was this guy, Val Carter. These guys

1190
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:50,300
were the brilliant surgeons at Hopkins. And so to me, it didn't matter that they had been doing

1191
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:55,260
it for 20 years and I had done it for one year. I wanted to be as good as they were just like,

1192
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:59,500
you know, you were the same way. And so that's how I always viewed it. Right. And so,

1193
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:05,740
and it was just the environment I surrounded myself with. So for me, when Walsh said, you know,

1194
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:10,220
listen, I want you to become my partner and eventually want you to take over my practice.

1195
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:16,540
When I started quote unquote, as his partner, he was still top of his game and was the man. And I

1196
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:21,740
benefited from that because he was so busy. I, you know, he would refer me cases. And at the very end

1197
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:25,740
of, you know, our relationship or time at Hopkins, you know, he wasn't operating anymore. And so I

1198
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:30,540
would, if he had patients that needed surgery, I would do it. And everybody, I think on the outside

1199
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:35,740
thought that this was this easy thing. It was a gig. But listen, when a guy you operate on,

1200
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:40,620
not only reports to you how he's doing, but how to Pat Walsh, how he's doing, then that's serious.

1201
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:44,460
You know, you got to be on your game. Yeah. It's like an eternal fellowship that you never left.

1202
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:49,740
Right. Right. So, you know, he would call me and say, you know, so-and-so says his incision is

1203
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:53,980
crooked. And I'm like, Oh my God, you know, so like, you know, you couldn't get away with anything.

1204
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:58,140
And so it makes you better, right? It definitely makes you better. So let's go back to the t-shirt

1205
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:02,460
raffle thing. And what's your Gleason? So what is this Gleason score? So Donald Gleason is a

1206
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:07,260
pathologist. He was a pathologist and many people, including the folks at Hopkins, were coming up

1207
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:14,700
with a way to grade prostate cancer. So we grade cancers and that's a way to measure how aggressive

1208
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:19,900
they are. And usually cancers are kind of high grade, low grade, or a one, two, three kind of

1209
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:27,260
system. And Gleason came up with a way to grade prostate cancer based on the appearance of the

1210
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:33,100
gland. So if you go back to our analogy or discussion of the sewer system, effectively,

1211
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:38,860
you know, there are these channels that the prosthetic fluid comes down and out of. And

1212
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:45,020
these channels will grow abnormally in a cancerous state. And so Gleason was describing how these

1213
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:50,380
channels appeared under the microscope. Now, one of the interesting things about it was,

1214
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:55,180
unlike a lot of other cancers where they would describe the grade of a cancer based on a high

1215
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:01,100
power view, like a very, very close view, Gleason graded his prostate cancers in a lower power

1216
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:06,620
view. So he got a better sense of the- More of an architecture. It's an architectural thing.

1217
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:11,020
So it's the tree, not the leaves. Whereas a lot of grades are the, what does the leaf look like?

1218
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:15,420
Yeah. What's the edge of the leaf look like? So he did it. And so the way he did it was,

1219
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:21,180
he said, well, what's the most common looking abnormality? What's the most prevalent abnormality

1220
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:26,700
on the view of the tumor? And then what's the second most common kind of glandular architecture?

1221
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:32,540
And so the Gleason sum is those two things, the most prevalent and then the next most prevalent.

1222
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:38,700
And that went from, and so it was a one to five scale. So the lowest Gleason score originally,

1223
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,700
Gleason sum- So there are 10 combinations.

1224
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:46,220
Yeah. The lowest Gleason sum would be a two, the highest Gleason sum would be a 10. That was how

1225
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:51,100
it started out. But then over time- So meaning a one plus one or a five plus five.

1226
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:57,500
That's right. So over time that evolved and the lowest Gleason sum would be a six, a three plus

1227
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:01,980
three was the kind of typical read. Meaning because if you're already at the point where

1228
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:05,740
you're doing a biopsy, you're not going to see ones. You shouldn't be seeing ones and twos if

1229
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:11,980
you're doing a biopsy. Is that the thinking? I think that there were some general organizational,

1230
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:17,660
architectural features that everybody just agreed were low grade, not aggressive. And yes,

1231
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:22,860
you could occasionally, occasionally even at the Hopkins, I'd see it on final pathology report

1232
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:27,340
a Gleason with some pattern two in it. And they would try to explain to me the subtleties of the

1233
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,860
difference between a pattern two and a pattern three. I think most pathologists call it a,

1234
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:37,020
they would just call it a three. So that's where it was for a long time. But there are some subtle

1235
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:42,460
differences in the Gleason sum that actually have real big differences for what the patient's

1236
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:50,140
outcomes would be. And so in 2015, in late 2014, the International Society for Urologic Pathologists.

1237
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:56,380
So we're talking about dork central here. I mean, real super geeks, but really good pathologists,

1238
01:46:56,380 --> 01:47:01,500
they are kind of people. Yeah. They got together along with RadOnks, radiation oncologists,

1239
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:07,260
medical oncologists, urologists, and said, we need a better way to transmit this information to

1240
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:13,500
patients and to internists in a way they can understand. So now there's a great group. And

1241
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:19,980
the great group goes between one and five. The original kind of old school Gleason sum of six,

1242
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:26,540
that's a one. A Gleason three plus four equals seven is a two. A four plus three equals seven

1243
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:33,420
is a three. A four plus four equals eight is a four. Four plus five equals nine, or five, five

1244
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:40,620
is a five. So this stepwise gradation into five bins of aggressiveness called the great group

1245
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:47,980
actually translates very nicely into stepwise clinical outcomes. So that's the new kind of

1246
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:51,820
way that we talk about it. I talk about with my patients, just the great group. So you're a great

1247
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:57,660
group one, two, three, four, or five. So do you do any other testing? Do you use oncotype or any

1248
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:03,340
of these other genetic testing algorithms to further stratify or do those only become things

1249
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:09,340
that are done post-surgery to determine adjuvant care? So I think that they can, yeah, that's a

1250
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:15,660
good question. So I generally speaking don't because I think I know what the patient, what they

1251
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:20,940
need. So what do I mean by that? Well, you taught me when we are interns, you don't order a test,

1252
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:25,500
don't do a test unless you know what you're going to do. Well, and yeah, it's so funny,

1253
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,660
I was just having this discussion with a patient yesterday. Don't order a test if it will not

1254
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:34,540
alter your management. Right. So I don't do a prostate biopsy in a 95 year old guy who's got

1255
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:45,820
an LVAD. I don't do it. The urology consult to this coronary ICU. So I don't do the test unless

1256
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:50,140
it's going to change what I recommend for the patient. So prostate biopsy, I'll do it if I

1257
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:54,540
think I should change something. So I don't do the test unless it's going to change something

1258
01:48:54,540 --> 01:49:01,500
I recommend. And for me, there's not many cases where it will change what I recommend. So meaning

1259
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:06,860
what do I mean by that? Well, again, we don't actively treat all prostate cancers today.

1260
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:13,740
People who have grade group one prostate cancer, generally we recommend active surveillance,

1261
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:18,940
monitoring the tumor to see if it becomes more aggressive versus... And to be clear, these are

1262
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:24,380
patients who, these are the quote unquote Gleason 3 plus 3s. That's right. And we're saying we're

1263
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:31,180
going to actively monitor you. And once you have the pathology in your hand, that grade group or

1264
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:36,860
the Gleason score, does anything before that matter anymore? In other words, does it matter

1265
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:45,580
in your thinking that this guy had actually a 4K of 7.5% versus 20%? Yeah, it does matter. And the MRI

1266
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:51,820
results matter. So this is the ultimate Bayesian experience. Yeah. I mean, you know, that's why the

1267
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:57,420
genomic test, it's funny, if you measure and you compare a genomic test, and there's a bunch of

1268
01:49:57,420 --> 01:50:04,060
them out there, head to head with PSA density, PSA density performs pretty much identically well.

1269
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:10,380
Right? It's pretty amazing. And do you get the grams? I mean, the MRI does a great job at doing

1270
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:14,060
that. Can you get that? Can you get that off ultrasound? If patient has an MRI? We measure

1271
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:17,420
at the time of the biopsy, we'll measure it. But the, you know, generally speaking-

1272
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:22,860
Yeah, we get it off the MRI. MRIs is what I use. So a Gleason 6, I generally will recommend

1273
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:26,540
surveillance unless they're super high volume 6. And I know in my brain that-

1274
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:30,540
And that's independent of age. So a 40 year old, I mean, we have a mutual patient who

1275
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:38,460
was a Gleason 7, I believe, at the very young age, like 45, correct? Yeah. Did his age,

1276
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:44,460
being 45 versus 65, change the way you managed him? Well, so he came in with a single core

1277
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:49,820
7 and really wanted to do surveillance. And that would be one opportunity to say,

1278
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:54,860
let's do a genomic test on this individual. And let's see how aggressive the tumor looks

1279
01:50:55,900 --> 01:51:01,980
under the true microscope, the molecular profile of the tumor. And so we talked about doing that

1280
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:06,860
and his biopsy, the molecular test was favorable, but you don't forget about those patients. You

1281
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:14,220
actually follow them active surveillance. So we rebiopsied him after a repeat MRI and he had a lot

1282
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:21,260
more. His MRI was actually pretty favorable. This was an MRI invisible lesion and he had multi-core

1283
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:26,540
7. So we then, we took him to surgery and he did very well. Yeah. I always think of his case as

1284
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:30,780
just one of those examples of, I don't know what the term is, because I don't want to use the term

1285
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:35,020
precision medicine because that's become so stupid and meaningless. And I don't even want to use the

1286
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:38,540
term multidisciplinary because it really wasn't multidisciplinary. It was mostly Schaeffer

1287
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:44,940
disciplinary. But I guess it's just the nuance of the field. That's the medicine. That's right.

1288
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:50,940
Yeah. That's the hard part. That's the part that you don't necessarily figure out in residency.

1289
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:54,780
It's so easy, I think, to go through residency, learning the technical stuff,

1290
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:59,980
learning the surgical judgment. What do you do if this person's got a post-operative bleed versus an

1291
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:04,380
infection and who do you sit on? Who do you take back to the OR? Those are very important skills.

1292
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:11,820
But this is like next layer judgment stuff that aside from talking with your colleagues and

1293
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:15,900
surrounding yourself by people who are, you try to surround yourself by people smarter than you,

1294
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:21,580
how do you continue that evolution of learning? We have what I call adult-only journal club every

1295
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:28,380
other Friday morning. So it's all the oncologist in our group, med-onks, rad-onks, urologists,

1296
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:33,020
urologic oncologist. And I call it adult-only because it's not really for the residents. It's

1297
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:37,740
during their teaching conference. And we just pull articles that come up every day. So every

1298
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:43,740
Friday morning, I get a feed from the NIH about new prostate cancer articles. Any article with

1299
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:50,940
prostate cancer in it, I get that link. It's about 180 to 200 papers a week. I review that list,

1300
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:54,460
and anything that looks good, I pull it, and I'll look at the abstract error. I'll pull the paper.

1301
01:52:55,100 --> 01:53:01,260
And so I send those to the group. And on Friday, two days from now, we'll go over my prostate

1302
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:06,700
articles, plus my partner's bladder cancer articles or kidney cancer articles. I don't read those.

1303
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:11,820
So I have them tell me what's important in those fields. So that's how I... It's really fun,

1304
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:15,340
because it's just like, you know, what we... It's being in school again. It's being in school.

1305
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:21,100
It's this idea of continuous learning. So that's how I think about it and try to keep on top of it.

1306
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:25,900
Meetings are okay, but I think that people get bogged down in just the politics of a meeting.

1307
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:30,860
So I think reading is what I try to do most of. So let's pivot to another topic that's germane to

1308
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:35,420
prostate cancer, which is kind of a two topic that goes hand in hand. The first is the role of

1309
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:39,740
testosterone. The second is the role of dihydrotestosterone. So we can explore this in any

1310
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:46,460
order, but I want to definitely touch on the notion that is there a real or perceived effect

1311
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:51,020
of patients who are on five alpha reductase inhibitors? So for the listener, males make a

1312
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:57,100
hormone called testosterone. Testosterone is converted via an enzyme called five alpha reductase

1313
01:53:57,100 --> 01:54:03,260
into a very similar molecule called dihydrotestosterone, abbreviated DHT. DHT is actually

1314
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:10,220
a slightly more potent steroid and in men who... 15 times more potent. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a big

1315
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:17,340
deal. In men who are susceptible to baldness, DHT drives that process. DHT also probably plays a

1316
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:21,980
role in the enlargement of the prostate. Is that correct? Most of the five alpha reductase enzyme

1317
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:29,820
is in the prostate. So yes, reducing androgens in the prostate by reducing, effectively reducing

1318
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:36,780
DHT production reduces the size of the prostate. So a lot of guys take medication to reduce DHT,

1319
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:41,260
either to reduce prostate volume size, so something called benign prosthetic hypertrophy,

1320
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:46,140
or to minimize hair loss. And it's usually the exact same drug given at slightly different

1321
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:49,900
doses. And then sometimes even come up with different names for the same drug. So Proscar

1322
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:55,820
is finasterid at five milligrams and I think Propecia is the one milligram. That's right.

1323
01:54:55,820 --> 01:55:00,540
Okay. Now I remember many years ago, and I'm sure this has been revised a hundred times,

1324
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:06,460
but maybe 10 years ago, maybe less. But a paper came out that said, look, in guys who have

1325
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:12,620
suppressed DHT levels, when they get prostate cancer, they're more high grade. Am I remembering

1326
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:16,780
that correctly? Yeah, there's been definitely case reports of that. It's hard to really study that

1327
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:20,140
over a big number. I got it. So what is the current thinking on

1328
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:25,740
five alpha-productase inhibition and that relationship to prostate cancer? Well,

1329
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:32,380
there was a very large randomized trial to see if you could take that medication with the idea

1330
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:37,900
that if you reduced the relative amount of androgens in the prostate by preventing the

1331
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:45,740
production of this potent androgen, DHT, could you reduce the risk of prostate cancer in those men?

1332
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:50,220
And the answer was if you took that medicine that reduced potent androgen, you could.

1333
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:55,180
There was a study. I'm sorry, this was in men starting out who did not have cancer?

1334
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:58,300
That's right. So it was called the prostate cancer prevention trial.

1335
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:04,220
And it was over seven years that the trial was conducted. Ian Thompson was the PI on the trial,

1336
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:08,620
it was a big study. It did reduce the chance that a man would develop prostate cancer

1337
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:14,940
over a reasonable amount of time. But one of the problems was that there was increased

1338
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:21,980
detection of more aggressive cancers in the men who are taking the finasteride. And so then the

1339
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:29,180
question was, well, what is that from? Is it inducing a more high-grade cancer? And whether

1340
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:33,660
or not that's true or not is true. Or is it selecting for it because any cancer that comes

1341
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:39,020
out of a low DHT environment? Well, yeah. So I personally think that what you were just saying

1342
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:44,620
is true. So yes, and there's case reports that people with low testosterone or for example,

1343
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:49,500
people with low PSAs because PSA is only made when there's testosterone around, for example,

1344
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:55,020
that those individuals have more aggressive cancers. Now, this is what I've been focusing

1345
01:56:55,020 --> 01:57:01,100
on in my lab for like the last four or five years now. And so one of the cool things we did

1346
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:06,620
in this collaboration with this company, Genome DX, and this great scientist, Eli DaVincioni,

1347
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:11,500
was to look at the biology of prostate cancers, how aggressive they were,

1348
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:18,620
and compare the aggressiveness of the prostate cancer with the androgen output of the tumor.

1349
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:21,340
Another nuanced way to normalize things a bit.

1350
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:27,980
Yeah. And so we had this hypothesis that the tumors that had the most amped up androgen

1351
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:34,780
signaling, the most androgen output because prostate cancer is an androgen driven tumor,

1352
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:39,340
that they would be the most aggressive. And I say it that way because you know, the answer

1353
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:46,300
is the exact opposite. The tumors with the lowest androgen output are the most aggressive tumors.

1354
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:52,700
So it somewhat relates to PSA, but not entirely like it's not a true linear correlation.

1355
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:59,980
So the high androgen output tumors, they can be aggressive, but they are not as aggressive

1356
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:04,540
as the ultra low one. So it's this bimodal distribution. And this is a good way to segue,

1357
01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:08,620
talking about these molecular tests, because this is a commercially available test from Genome DX.

1358
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:11,180
Can I tell a funny story about Eli before we go down there?

1359
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:11,420
Sure.

1360
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:17,180
I've told this story before, but now we get to put a name to it. So I hope he doesn't like,

1361
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:18,860
like, I hope I don't upset him that I'm telling this story.

1362
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:19,420
He'll love it.

1363
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:24,620
It was, Eli's the guy who called me one day when I was in the airport. And he's like,

1364
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:29,740
Peter, my wife just got me this book. It's a great book and you're in it. And I was like,

1365
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:33,900
what? I had no idea what he was talking about. And he goes, yeah, it's called Biggest Tools.

1366
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:39,340
And I was like, wait, do you mean Tools of Titans? He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it.

1367
01:58:42,380 --> 01:58:42,860
That's great.

1368
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:44,860
That was Eli. I know I've told that story.

1369
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:50,220
So to this day, like anytime I'm talking with Tim Ferriss, like I'm like, look,

1370
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,940
I expect to be referred to as the biggest tool.

1371
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:54,940
That is, I love that story.

1372
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:58,700
He called me too. He's like, dude, I'm reading this book, but he didn't call it Biggest Tools.

1373
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:03,580
That's awesome. That's really funny. So Eli started this company that was,

1374
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:08,380
genomically transcriptomically. So looking at the RNA levels within prostate cancers. And so

1375
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:13,340
he has a commercial product that's very, very good to just tell you the aggressiveness. It's

1376
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:17,500
basically a genomic Leason score. It's more sophisticated than that, but that's effectively

1377
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:22,860
what it helps you to do. But when he looks at each tumor, he captures about 1.4 million data

1378
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:31,580
points on each tumor. He uses 21 of them for his test, but we use the other 1.3999 million of those

1379
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:37,100
data points. And so we developed this algorithm to look at this. The thing that's pretty cool is

1380
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:43,020
we've been able to model and show with Eli's group that, because it's one thing to have a kind of

1381
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:49,500
prognostic biomarker, like your prognosis is good or bad, but precision medicine is really the

1382
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:54,940
predictive stuff. So we've been able to take all this data. We've been able to show that these

1383
01:59:54,940 --> 02:00:01,260
low androgen output tumors are the most aggressive tumors. Now high androgen output, very high

1384
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:06,700
AR output tumors are also aggressive, but as you would imagine, the tumors are sensitive to

1385
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:13,020
different drugs. So a high AR output tumor, they're exquisitely sensitive to androgen deprivation,

1386
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:17,820
which is one of the main states of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Low androgen output

1387
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:23,500
tumors are not dependent on it. They don't use it as their fuel for growth. And we've been able to

1388
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:29,500
model other compounds that they are sensitive to. And so we're moving those things into clinical

1389
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:34,620
trials. It's actually pretty exciting times. So what is the current state of the art or the

1390
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:41,020
current thinking on testosterone replacement therapy? And again, I'm referring to this in

1391
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:44,300
the confines of what we would call physiologic testosterone replacement. So you've got a guy

1392
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:49,020
who's walking around with a free testosterone at seven nanograms per deciliter on a lab where the

1393
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:55,500
upper range would be 25 and he's replaced to 20. My reading of the literature says I'd have a very

1394
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:59,260
hard time making the case that's increasing his risk of prostate cancer. I agree with that.

1395
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:05,340
And I think my data suggests that the tumors that we don't know how they develop, but the tumor,

1396
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:10,380
we segued like five times. But the idea is that our data shows us that the most aggressive tumors

1397
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:15,580
are the ones that have low androgen output. Now, does that mean that they developed in a low

1398
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:18,620
androgen state? Maybe. We don't know.

1399
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:19,100
That's my question.

1400
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:25,020
We don't know. But for sure, it's telling me that I don't, and like you said, the literature that

1401
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:30,460
we've discussed on the phone many times, I don't see any clear evidence that physiologic replacement

1402
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:36,780
of testosterone is going to accelerate or cause a cancer to develop. What do you think the role is

1403
02:01:36,780 --> 02:01:44,300
of estradiol in this? Some have argued that as estradiol is going up, that may be playing a greater

1404
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:50,540
role in prostate cancer, either through its direct interaction or indirectly through its receptors.

1405
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:56,620
I think I don't know the answer to that question, but I do know that it's not just a testosterone

1406
02:01:56,620 --> 02:02:04,220
thing. Remember, when we just talk about benign urologic conditions, testosterone values decline

1407
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:11,020
over time. And I oversimplified the whole PSA discussion earlier. So remember that PSAs rise

1408
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:17,820
over time, but at that same time, testosterone values are declining. So I do think that a lot

1409
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:24,780
of the prosthetic growth, not cancerous growth necessarily, but benign growth are influenced by

1410
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:32,220
the ratios of T to E, so to speak, testosterone to estrogens, androgens to estrogens, which ones-

1411
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:36,300
Yeah, because it seems to me that you're at your highest risk when your testosterone is going down

1412
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:41,900
and your estrogen is going up. Yeah. Now the question is, what's the lag time? So in real time,

1413
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:47,340
yes, that's true, but we know that all cancers, prostate cancer for sure among them,

1414
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:54,620
is something that occurs from mutations to the DNA from decades prior, probably. So yes, at the

1415
02:02:54,620 --> 02:03:01,500
time of diagnoses, there's probably higher estradiol, lower T, but I think about it like,

1416
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:06,140
well, what happened to that in that patient 10 years beforehand or 15 years? Is there anything

1417
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:10,620
about the mitochondria in the prostate? I mean, the prostate has so many odd things about it,

1418
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:14,380
and we're going to talk about the difficulty with immune surveillance in a moment, but

1419
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:18,140
is there anything about the mitochondria within the prostate that are unusually

1420
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:23,820
either ramped up or ramped down relative to other epithelial cell-derived tissues?

1421
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:26,060
Yeah, it's a great question. And-

1422
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:28,940
And I hope you know, I try to ask great questions here, man.

1423
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:34,860
I say that because we just had, last Saturday we had our kind of a prostate cancer working group

1424
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:39,740
meeting where all the kind of deep thinkers get together, we got together on a Saturday.

1425
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:42,780
Yeah, I was just about to say, the fact that you guys do this on a Saturday is just another

1426
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:47,340
bit of evidence to the level of obsession here that I love.

1427
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:53,260
Yeah, so I roped in this brilliant radiation oncologist named David Gaius. He works on

1428
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:59,260
hormonal dependency in breast cancer, and what he focuses on is on the mitochondria,

1429
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:04,780
and specifically these superoxide dismutases that really get rid of reactive oxygen species.

1430
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:10,860
And so he has a whole model and he knows about luminal B breast cancers and how they can become

1431
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:17,100
resistant to tamoxifen and so forth. And it's driven by basically the mitochondria.

1432
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:17,900
And so-

1433
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:21,740
Do the mitochondria in the prostate cancer follow the Warburg effect? Do they

1434
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:27,740
favor anaerobic metabolism over oxidative phosphorylation?

1435
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:34,540
You know, it's hard. People don't, we don't know. People don't know a lot about the metabolic

1436
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:39,500
environment of the prostate. I've had a lot of thoughts about where, what about the, I mean,

1437
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:45,340
it's a very dense organ. There's not a lot of blood vessels in it. It's not a big blood supply.

1438
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:52,620
And so I thought a lot about just, for example, are there regional differences in the pH within

1439
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:57,340
the prostate? And is that what's causing these? Because I think about it in relationship to these

1440
02:04:57,340 --> 02:05:03,980
androgen dependent tumors. My brain has defaulted to this idea that, well, the high AR output tumors

1441
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:08,860
are ones that are occurring in oxygen rich parts of the prostate. I mean, I don't know why,

1442
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:13,580
just assume that, you know, and that these lower AR output tumors are occurring in regions of the

1443
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:20,140
prostate that have lower PAO2s, different pHs, and they're forced to use an alternate growth

1444
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:24,460
pathway. It's hard to test that. You know, I've thought a lot about it. There's nothing published

1445
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:30,620
on it really. It's hard to test it, but this guy, David Gias, has a lot of really interesting data

1446
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:37,420
looking at the sirtunin pathways through mitochondria, regulating the hormonal dependency

1447
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:42,540
or hormonal regulation of prostate cancer. It's a brand new area for him. So in other words,

1448
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:48,140
the sirtuins, which of course can either turn on or turn off genes, the idea is, and this is SIRT2

1449
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:53,180
or a different SIRT3. SIRT3. I see. So it could be up-regulating or down-regulating

1450
02:05:53,180 --> 02:06:00,140
antigen production, basically. He has a SIRT3 manganese superoxide dismutase pathway worked out

1451
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:07,180
and it regulates resistance to tamoxifeniluminal B breast cancer. So, and he's made these

1452
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:14,460
observations. He first published this in Cell in, I want to say, 07-08 on sirtunin 3 in breast,

1453
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:19,500
but he's had some data in there in prostate. So I kind of, we hang out with him when I want to

1454
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:24,300
hang out with like a deep thinker. So he has this preliminary data and he has some more interesting

1455
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:28,140
data that there may be a role for this. So I do think that there's something about

1456
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:35,660
metabolism in the prostate. I think it's hard to study. It's a tough, it's hard to model that

1457
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:41,420
in a mouse at all. Like you can't do it. You cannot model in a mouse. I do think that there's

1458
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:45,500
some good people on campus here who think about it and are going to be able to study it well.

1459
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:50,540
He's the guy. I'm seeing Nav Chandel tomorrow who is a mutual friend. Didn't you go to med

1460
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:54,060
school with Nav? No. He was in grad school when you were in med school or something.

1461
02:06:54,060 --> 02:07:00,300
He says that he was my TA in undergrad, but I just know, you know, known him. I think we figured

1462
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:06,540
out I've known him in 19, I met him in 93 or 94. So he's really one of my oldest friends I have.

1463
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:10,460
Anything I should know about Nav? I know him of course, because we played

1464
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:13,980
paddy cakes on Easter Island for a while. Do you know what his nickname is?

1465
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:16,860
No, that's the thing. There was a nickname. What's his nickname?

1466
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:21,580
Well, just for the listeners, Navdeep is this, he's about what, 6 foot 3?

1467
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:26,620
Yeah, very suave, good looking guy, long hair. So his nickname was suaveep.

1468
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:37,340
I've never seen a TA class where it was like 90% women who had questions for him afterward.

1469
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:41,900
You know, it was awesome in med school. He's great.

1470
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:44,380
And did you also go to school with Matthew Vanderheiden?

1471
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:47,100
I did. He was the smartest kid in my med school class.

1472
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:50,700
Yeah. Matthew, I mean, I know Matthew, obviously not as well as you, but-

1473
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:55,020
I don't know him that well. I just know him and Nav really broke open the field of cancer

1474
02:07:55,020 --> 02:08:00,140
metabolism. Yeah. I'll be, I gotta get out to Boston to see Matthew, who actually works

1475
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:03,420
and collaborates very closely with another very, very close friend of mine from medical school

1476
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:06,620
named Mark Pomerance, who's a medical oncologist. Yeah, I know Mark. Yeah, he's great.

1477
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:13,580
All of these independent circles of my life have overlapped in prostate cancer and cancer in general.

1478
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:20,140
Yeah. What is the most exciting area of research that you think of with respect to prostate cancer

1479
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:26,220
specifically? Maybe I'll even prime the question by saying immunotherapy seems to finally be coming

1480
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:30,780
into its own a little bit with some cancers. But of course the prostate is kind of a weird

1481
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:37,340
immune protected odd organ. Like does immunotherapy play a role in this or are we talking

1482
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:43,500
metabolic therapies or is it all going to be coming down to earlier detection of lethal cancers?

1483
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:48,300
Certainly, early detection of lethal cancers is important. I think the most exciting stuff in

1484
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:54,860
urologic oncology is really moving beyond these prognostic biomarkers to predictive biomarkers.

1485
02:08:55,500 --> 02:09:01,420
And so there's a lot of really cool new things that are great. So there are some

1486
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:06,860
predictive biomarkers that you can pick up in the DNA of a tumor or the DNA of a patient,

1487
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:13,180
particularly BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM lost these different kinds of DNA damage repair pathways

1488
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:17,100
that people didn't really think matter for prostate. We now know within the last three

1489
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:21,340
years that they really matter. So I didn't, that's news to me. I never really understood

1490
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:25,740
that BRCA1 and BRCA2 should be looked for in males as well. I mean, I did from a breast

1491
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:31,980
cancer standpoint, but not from a prostate cancer standpoint. Yeah. So there's one of my heroes in

1492
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:39,100
urologic oncology is this guy, Pete Nelson. He's at the Hutch in Seattle and he published a paper

1493
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:44,380
and they looked at the germ lines of men with metastatic castrate resistance. So at the most

1494
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:50,620
end states prostate cancer. And what they showed was that in contrast to the general population of

1495
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:57,900
men, that mutations in these different DNA repair pathways were significantly enriched in individuals

1496
02:09:57,900 --> 02:10:02,620
who had metastatic prostate cancer. So about 11 to 12% of men with metastatic castrate resistant

1497
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:09,900
prostate cancer had mutations, particularly BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM, RAD51, these different pathways that

1498
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:15,580
are involved in DNA damage repair. If you look in the tumors of men with metastatic castrate

1499
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:21,660
resistant prostate cancer, it depending on where you look over one third of the tumors, the cells

1500
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:27,100
will have mutations in these pathways, which makes them incredibly sensitive to PARP inhibition.

1501
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:33,100
So that's a huge game changer. The other thing that people now look at is kind of the total

1502
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:38,060
genomic score or the alterations in the genome of the individual cancer cells. And will that make

1503
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:43,180
them more sensitive to immunotherapy or not? That's more coming online. But the idea that

1504
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:49,340
there are things in the somatic DNA of the tumor cells and in the germline of individuals

1505
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:56,380
that you can use to screen for not only prostate, but breast, pancreas, etc. That's a huge game

1506
02:10:56,380 --> 02:11:01,660
changer. And then as we touched on earlier, those are not just prognostic biomarkers, but they're

1507
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:07,340
predictive of drug response, which is pretty amazing. And then I think Eli's test, the version

1508
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:13,340
2.0 or the beta version of it, which has a lot of these built in biomarkers that predict response

1509
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:18,220
to drugs that now are being tested in clinical trials with the idea that let's test the ability

1510
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:24,300
to predict response. It's pretty amazing stuff actually. So obviously you specialize in prostate

1511
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:28,540
cancer. The field of urology is so much bigger than that, right? We haven't even talked about

1512
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:34,860
renal cancer, bladder cancer, and to do so would only be to do it in injustice. Given that we've

1513
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:38,940
been talking for a little while, and I know you've got a hard stop here in about 20 minutes,

1514
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:43,740
I want to talk a little bit about benign stuff. So I'll tell a very personal, maybe somewhat

1515
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:47,820
embarrassing story, but it's a good illustration of this. So-

1516
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:51,180
Is that when you were treated at the extra large penis clinic that happens?

1517
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:52,700
Is the micro-penis-

1518
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:52,700


1519
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:52,700


1520
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:53,500
... reduction surgery.

1521
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:53,740
Yeah, yeah.

1522
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:54,060
You had the penis-

1523
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:55,100
... reduction surgery clinic.

1524
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:58,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. See, those are the kind of jokes we can only tell in the urology office.

1525
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:02,460
So about two years ago, I remember calling and I was like, Ted, I don't know what's going on,

1526
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:08,460
man. Every time I pee, it's just burning like crazy. I did a quick check. I don't have a UTI.

1527
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:13,100
I've never had a UTI. It seems unlikely I would. I've been fumbling around and I'm wondering,

1528
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:19,020
I must have prostatitis, right? And I guess my question is, Ted, what antibiotics should I take?

1529
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:25,260
And I remember I was actually in Baltimore at the time, but I was heading up back to New York,

1530
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:30,300
because I was going to work in New York that week where I spend quite a bit of time. And you said,

1531
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:35,980
well, first of all, you're in luck because my dad wrote the paper on prostatitis. And I forget what

1532
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:40,620
year it was, but it was in the England Journal of Medicine. And I downloaded the paper and I read

1533
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:45,340
it on the train ride up to New York or maybe I was still in Baltimore because I remember you had,

1534
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:49,180
anyway, you'd written me for some Flomax. Well, the long and short of it was I came away from

1535
02:12:49,180 --> 02:12:53,660
reading the paper and I said, well, my takeaway on this is I need a prostatic massage, not an

1536
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:59,980
antibiotic. And you said, yep. So go ask Bernie to give you a prostatic massage. And I had been

1537
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:06,060
in pain for a month. And he did that to get a sample from the prostate, because when you do a

1538
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:11,180
urine check for an infection, you're sampling predominantly the fluid, the urine, and the

1539
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:17,260
bladder. So I said, yeah, fine, your urine culture is negative, but let's check your prostatic fluid

1540
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:23,020
for an infection. I think it was clear. It was clear. And here's the amazing part of the story.

1541
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:28,860
I had been suffering for a month and Bernie being the great Bernie, he didn't just give me a little

1542
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:35,020
bit of a prostatic massage. I mean, he eviscerated me. It was one of those Chevy Chase moments where

1543
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:41,420
I was like using the whole fist there, doc. Moon River. Actually, I will say it was one of the

1544
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:46,780
most painful things I'd ever experienced. This was a different level of pain because it wasn't the

1545
02:13:46,780 --> 02:13:51,340
rectal, it was like the prostatic massage to generate the fluid. It's very sensitive, yeah.

1546
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:55,820
Especially when you're inflamed, as I would later come to realize. Well, here's the most amazing

1547
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:59,740
part of that story. Within about three days, everything was better. I didn't need a single

1548
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:07,500
antibiotic. And somehow that massage probably somehow turned over some of that inflammation.

1549
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:12,860
There was something, yeah. I mean, we had you on some anti-inflammatories and we had you on some

1550
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:18,140
other symptomatic stuff. But yeah, I mean, it definitely... So we don't really call it

1551
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:25,020
prostatitis anymore. It's kind of binned into kind of this chronic pelvic pain syndrome kind of

1552
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:32,140
concept. But within that concept, you can get acute bacterial prostatitis. That's what happens

1553
02:14:32,140 --> 02:14:37,580
for people after prostate biopsy. So they get very, very, very sick. High, high fevers, 103,

1554
02:14:37,580 --> 02:14:42,860
104, like, you know, bad stuff. That's an incredibly rare thing. But what you can get is

1555
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:47,660
basically non-bacterial prostatitis, inflammation in the prostate.

1556
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:52,460
That's the thing I think a lot of people don't understand. Itis means inflammation.

1557
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:53,180
That's right.

1558
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:58,620
You can get itis with an infection, but itis does not imply inflection. So prostatitis, mastitis,

1559
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:02,140
these things don't necessarily imply that there's a bacterial infection that can be sterile.

1560
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:08,940
Right. So people will have acute inflammation in your prostate, which is what I thought you had

1561
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:14,860
on the phone. I said, look, have Bernie do an actual culture of the prostate. Then typically,

1562
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:20,300
for most people, that goes away. We don't know what causes it. We don't know what it is that's

1563
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:24,540
causing that inflammation. That's what my father, who's a very prominent researcher in this field,

1564
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:30,860
that's what he works on. But we know we try to treat the symptoms and ride it out. And then we

1565
02:15:31,580 --> 02:15:35,900
try to adjust risks that we prevent it kind of from coming back and so forth. So some of the

1566
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:42,460
things that can cause it, we talked about this constipation. So one of the ways it's easy to get

1567
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:48,540
constipated is just go on a transcontinental flight because the air is dry and those little subtle

1568
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:54,220
changes make a big difference. So those things come into play. Now, that falls within this

1569
02:15:54,220 --> 02:16:02,140
greater scope of something called chronic pelvic pain, which is a field that has some work in it,

1570
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:05,500
but it's still evolving. It's really just been recently described. My father was one of the

1571
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:12,220
people who described that with some other folks. And so that involves just burning or pain in the

1572
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:17,820
urethra and the bladder. Women, it used to be called interstitial cystitis in women. So

1573
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:22,460
some foods will trigger these things. We don't have a good handle on it at all. So we try to

1574
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:28,220
manage the symptoms. And then from there, we try to just prevent. What's the state of the art with

1575
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:33,500
using injections within the bladder of Botox to alleviate women who have interstitial cystitis?

1576
02:16:33,740 --> 02:16:34,500
I don't think.

1577
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,100
There's some discussion about that.

1578
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:42,700
Yeah, it's not. We use Botox in the bladder for people who have hyper contractility of the

1579
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:47,980
bladder, but we don't use it for people who have interstitial cystitis. For people, there are people

1580
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:54,700
that have deep seated infections in their prostate that we can document or sometimes we can't document,

1581
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:59,900
but we have a suspicion of them. And in those individuals, you can actually directly inject

1582
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:07,260
antibiotics into the prostate. Or in fact, my feeling is that actually the typical

1583
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:11,900
nidus for this persistent infection is actually the seminal vesicle, which is attached to the

1584
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:17,900
prostate. So we'll have these individuals who have recurrent bacterial infections, same bacteria,

1585
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:23,740
same sensitivity to the drugs, so they don't become resistant. They're equally sensitive all

1586
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:24,060
along because-

1587
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:27,740
So there has to be a bacteria that you aren't clearing that's outside of the field of scope.

1588
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:33,820
That's right. And so I feel like those are often, or you can't get the concentration-

1589
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:34,780
High enough into that.

1590
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:38,940
Into that tissue. And so those cases will do intro-

1591
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:40,540
So is it difficult? You do that-

1592
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,820
Transrectally.

1593
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:43,180
Transrectally or perineal.

1594
02:17:43,180 --> 02:17:45,180
But it actually works.

1595
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:46,380
Under ultrasound guidance.

1596
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:48,780
And how easy is it to hit a seminal vesicle?

1597
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:51,020
Super easy. Even you can do it.

1598
02:17:51,020 --> 02:17:51,660
Even I could do it?

1599
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:51,980
Yeah.

1600
02:17:51,980 --> 02:17:52,460
That's hard to believe.

1601
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:53,660
Let's do it. Let's go across the street.

1602
02:17:53,740 --> 02:17:58,220
I was going to ask you about that, so thanks for bringing that up. I was going to ask you about

1603
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:00,060
interprosthetic injection.

1604
02:18:00,060 --> 02:18:01,980
You need to come do a share day with me.

1605
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:02,860
Wouldn't that be awesome?

1606
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:03,580
Oh, that'd be so much fun.

1607
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:05,180
You've never actually been on the robot, have you?

1608
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:05,580
No.

1609
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:07,180
We got to do it. Oh, man.

1610
02:18:07,820 --> 02:18:08,540
How many?

1611
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:11,820
Yeah, going back to that for a second. So I mean, we didn't really get into the deep

1612
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:15,980
surgical technique, but I do want to link to any videos that we can. But what percentage of your

1613
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:18,860
prostatectomies do you now use the robot for versus open?

1614
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:19,340
100%.

1615
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:20,860
You're 100% robot now?

1616
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,500
Yeah.

1617
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:27,580
And Moe's 100% robot, obviously. So most men now getting their prostate removed will do it

1618
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:28,460
via the robot.

1619
02:18:28,460 --> 02:18:32,380
I mean, I think that there are very few people out there that actually can comment on which

1620
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:38,860
one is better robot versus traditional open. But I've done, I don't know, 1,500 opens and

1621
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:42,300
2,500 robots. So I have a good idea for which ones are better.

1622
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:43,900
When was the last time you did an open case?

1623
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:46,300
Three years ago, two years ago.

1624
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:50,940
Is there a party that's sad that if you went back and did an open tomorrow, you wouldn't be as good?

1625
02:18:50,940 --> 02:18:57,020
I wouldn't be as good, but even when I was good, robots, I'm better using the robot. It's just

1626
02:18:57,020 --> 02:19:03,660
incredibly precise. I'm just a super type A guy. You get four arms to control. I only got two hands.

1627
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:10,060
So you can just retract everything exactly the way you want it. The magnification, the optics are

1628
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:15,500
just unbelievable. And you would just die. It's just like wearing-

1629
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:16,700
Is it still the Da Vinci?

1630
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:21,900
Yeah. It's like wearing 20X loops. You think about it, you had your 2.5s that you used to

1631
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:25,660
walk around with. Hey, I upgraded to 3.5.

1632
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:30,220
Those are tough. I had some 4Xs and it's harder. But it's amazing, right?

1633
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:31,020
Well, it depends on the case.

1634
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:38,860
But even anything, I mean, I wear my loops for every open case I did. But even the difference

1635
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:42,780
between 2.5 and 3.5 is a big difference. So think about 10X.

1636
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:49,420
I just put a 4X magnifier on my bow. So you have a clarifier that sits in the peep,

1637
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:55,340
and then you have a magnifier that sits on your scope. And I'd been shooting probably up to 70

1638
02:19:55,340 --> 02:20:01,100
yards naked. And then I went to a 2X and I was like, oh, this is good. And then I went to the 4X.

1639
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:05,740
And I just don't know if I could ever go back. That's the thing. One of my mentors,

1640
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:10,940
surgical mentors is this guy, Bal Carter. And he always did his cases without loops.

1641
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:17,580
And then Pat made them switch. And so we would talk about it. And he said, it's just literally

1642
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:23,100
a different operation. And so people who do open prostates without loops, I don't know what they're

1643
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:28,780
doing. Because you just see everything, right? You see it all. Now, think about the robot. I mean,

1644
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:32,540
I can dissect out individual little arteries that are one, two millimeters.

1645
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:34,940
Has this made it difficult to teach residents?

1646
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:38,220
It's easier to teach them. You got to come by tomorrow. I'm doing a case.

1647
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:39,260
Seriously.

1648
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:41,660
I'm talking to Nav tomorrow. How am I supposed to do that?

1649
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:44,060
Not at 7 AM. That boy doesn't roll out of bed before 9.

1650
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:48,220
I'm going to have to take you up on that.

1651
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:48,780
Yeah.

1652
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:51,660
There's a lot of other stuff I want to talk about. I know we're getting real close to you.

1653
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:55,660
You've got a hard stop in 10 minutes now. Do you know anything about male contraceptives?

1654
02:20:55,660 --> 02:21:00,700
Is this a topic that... Is there a male contraceptive on the horizon outside of a vasectomy?

1655
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:06,300
I mean, the only way to really prevent sperm production is to block testosterone in the

1656
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:12,860
testicle. So that's the way to do it. And there's a couple that are coming online. They've been

1657
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:16,540
tested in smaller groups of men. I don't know if they're really ready for prime time. And I don't

1658
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:20,380
know if men are ready for that. What about vasectomies?

1659
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:23,580
They work. What's the reversal rate on them if you need to worry about that?

1660
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:29,020
Well, I mean, I have a partner here, Bob Brannigan, who's one of the top three guys in the country.

1661
02:21:29,020 --> 02:21:35,820
And yeah, if the vasectomy was done correctly the first time by a professional, so to speak.

1662
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:40,140
So not in the parking lot. There's a surgeon. I'm not going to do it.

1663
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:44,300
What do you mean by a professional? Who else is doing vasectomies out there?

1664
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:49,740
GB. There's a guy who just think about... There's a surgeon at Hopkins. You know what I'm talking about?

1665
02:21:49,740 --> 02:21:53,980
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm not saying he did them, but if there was a urologist like him...

1666
02:21:53,980 --> 02:22:02,460
Yeah. Yeah. Nickname Hodad. Hands of death and destruction. Any Hopkins resident from our era

1667
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:05,900
listening to this knows exactly who we're talking about.

1668
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:08,300
That's right. So as long as you don't have a Hodad...

1669
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:10,700
Yeah, they can be reversed, but the reality is that...

1670
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:12,220
That's what, 80%, 90%?

1671
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:17,820
The patency is, yeah, I think it's over 90% for a good microvascular...

1672
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:23,900
So if you're a guy who's deciding who's sort of waffling on this, it seems to me that donating

1673
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:28,940
a bunch of sperm, putting sperm into a bank, having a really good person do the vasectomy

1674
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:31,260
is a surefire way to just go ahead.

1675
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:36,860
Yeah. I mean, most of the time, you can have... I mean, the reproductive technology is just

1676
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:43,660
ridiculous. So individuals who have Klein filters where they really almost have no sperm production

1677
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:49,820
who were told 10 years ago, you can't have a child. Now you can do these procedures under

1678
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:54,380
the microscope where you can find individual nests of sperm within the testicles of these men and you

1679
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:56,540
can allow them to have kids, which is amazing for them.

1680
02:22:56,540 --> 02:23:01,260
I had no clue someone with Klein filters could do that. And then of course, you're doing it anyway

1681
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:03,260
because you want to be selective for... That's right.

1682
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:04,460
Make sure you're getting the right chromosome.

1683
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:09,500
Right. So I mean, I think there's nothing wrong with vasectomy. It's a very effective way to do

1684
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:15,340
contraception. I think if you're single and you're dating around, I think you should also use

1685
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:18,220
protection, not just contraception. So to me...

1686
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:22,220
So this will be our public service announcement, not to be confused with the other PSA. This will

1687
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:29,820
be the shape for PSA on where a condom... Yeah. I think not just for protecting or not having

1688
02:23:29,820 --> 02:23:34,780
children, but for all the other reasons to do it. Is there anything else that we can talk about in

1689
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:39,740
five minutes that's not going to get one of us in trouble? Well, there's lots of fun things that we

1690
02:23:39,740 --> 02:23:45,980
can talk about, like watches or pens or cars. Yeah, you and I have shared that from the beginning.

1691
02:23:45,980 --> 02:23:48,380
That's five minutes isn't going to work. It's not going to cut it.

1692
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:54,700
All right. So on each of those, if someone walked in the door today and said, Ted, I'll buy you

1693
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:59,420
any watch you want within a reasonable price frame, don't just pick the most expensive watch. But is

1694
02:23:59,420 --> 02:24:05,260
there a watch you'd love to just have sitting on your desktop when you walk back into your office,

1695
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:10,380
courtesy of some Santa Claus? I notice you're wearing a beautiful Hulk today.

1696
02:24:10,380 --> 02:24:16,300
I do. I wear that on my non-clinical days. I do like it. I didn't wear it a lot. I would say,

1697
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:22,460
I'm in the market. See, I always just ask you, I'm in the market for an elegant dress watch.

1698
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:30,300
That's the thing. I have to say that I'm pretty satiated from watches these days. I'm good.

1699
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:36,220
But I don't know. I want an elegant dress watch, but I could travel with it and it would have GMT.

1700
02:24:36,220 --> 02:24:39,740
That's my challenge to you. Oh, for heaven's sakes. You had to throw the GMT.

1701
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:44,700
Because I want to be able to wear a dress watch to a meeting and I want to be able to go to the

1702
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:50,060
meeting, change my time zones. I want to go to the meeting and now have nobody know what the watch

1703
02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:56,300
is. Because I can get that in a Rolex or whatever, but sometimes it's nicer to just not know.

1704
02:24:56,300 --> 02:25:01,580
I will take this on as a personal challenge. If you're willing to give up the GMT, I'm really,

1705
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:07,340
I don't have it. I might never have it, but I'm really obsessed with two Vacherons out there.

1706
02:25:07,340 --> 02:25:13,500
One is the Ultra Thin and the other is the 1921, which is a remake of the famous driving watch.

1707
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:17,260
Yeah, those would be, but you're not going to get a second time zone on either of those.

1708
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:23,340
I just think you travel a lot too, right? It's so nice to just know what your time zone is at home.

1709
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:27,020
And that's what I like about that. I like that. That's my newest thing. I love that.

1710
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:36,220
So I'm looking for a GMT watch because that to me is so important. So if you could get home

1711
02:25:36,220 --> 02:25:41,660
to San Diego and find any car in your garage, what would it be?

1712
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:46,220
It's a tough question. And I assume you mean a car that will only be driven on the street is not

1713
02:25:46,220 --> 02:25:50,700
going to be on the track. I'm not taking it to the track. This is for you, for San Diego.

1714
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:58,540
You've definitely got me more and more interested in Porsche. And I think that the 911 Turbo,

1715
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:03,500
so when that, I don't know, let's just say I could, if I could get an early jump on a 992 911 Turbo,

1716
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:06,620
that might be- Yeah, that's a great vehicle.

1717
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:11,580
That's so well engineered. Yeah, they're really special cars. And they're so drivable. I mean,

1718
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:17,340
other cars that I know you and I have driven, we have friends who have beautiful cars that have

1719
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:22,940
given us their 488s and 458s and all those things. And they're incredible. I mean, I actually,

1720
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:27,420
I love the 458, but you're not going to drive that car every day. And there's something else

1721
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:32,780
that comes from it, which is, I guess I just deep down always feel a little self-conscious,

1722
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:39,180
pulling or driving around in the bright red Ferrari. And I don't think you just don't have

1723
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:43,020
that same level of being self-conscious driving around in certain other cars. But that said,

1724
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:49,580
the 488 is a blast. See, I don't fit in. I have a long torso and I can't get the seat right. So I'm

1725
02:26:49,580 --> 02:26:55,660
not looking at the head, the head red, the A pillar. Yeah. So, but it's a great car and there

1726
02:26:55,660 --> 02:27:02,300
are great cars out there, but as a daily, you just can't, I mean, that 911 Turbo's, they're

1727
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:06,700
pretty amazing. Yeah. I've never actually driven a McLaren. I don't know if you've-

1728
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:12,700
I haven't, but I've heard those are really fun too. Yeah, I have a couple of friends that have

1729
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:16,860
them and I always have an open invitation to go visit them and drive them McLarens in other cities.

1730
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:21,100
And those look like really special cars, but part of that's emotional too. I think I just

1731
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:24,060
have an emotional connection to McLaren because of Senna. Yeah. So-

1732
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:26,940
I don't like the Senna though. I don't like the looks of that car.

1733
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,500
Oh, I think that thing's going to be just a beast. I can't wait to see it perform.

1734
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:34,380
It's a beast, but I mean, it just, it doesn't, I like the functionality that they put in their cars.

1735
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:37,820
Do you think that the Senna looks better or worse than the P1?

1736
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:42,540
I think the P1 looks better, but I haven't seen either of them in real life. I've seen a 720 in

1737
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:45,260
real life. It's a cool car. Really cool. Yeah. The arrow.

1738
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:47,260
720s look great. The arrow in that car is a cool one.

1739
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:52,780
I saw a P1 in person once in New York City of all places, which I've never understood that lot.

1740
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:56,620
Yeah, right. What would possess you to- It wouldn't matter how much money you have. What

1741
02:27:56,620 --> 02:28:00,860
would possess you to drive a P1 in Manhattan? Yeah, it's crazy.

1742
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:10,060
It's like a Tomahawk. I knew somebody who had a law, had a 918 and a P1, and he sold one of the

1743
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:15,500
three because he said it just wasn't fun to drive around. Let me see if I can guess. I don't know,

1744
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:21,980
maybe the LaFerrari? The P1. Because it's just too much of a race car. So he said that you just,

1745
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:28,300
you know, on the track, it's just ridiculous, but he said that he sold it because on the streets,

1746
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:32,780
we couldn't even begin to enjoy it. Wow. It's so cool though. I actually think all of those

1747
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:38,300
hyper cars, like I love watching Chris Harris take those cars around. So for the listener,

1748
02:28:39,580 --> 02:28:44,780
certainly the last generation of hyper cars were those three cars, the Ferrari, LaFerrari, the

1749
02:28:44,780 --> 02:28:50,540
Porsche 918 and the McLaren P1. Only one of them ever broke a minute 30 on Laguna Seca. Do you know

1750
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:58,140
which one? I would guess the P1, but I don't know. No. It was the 918. Went one minute 29 seconds

1751
02:28:58,460 --> 02:29:05,740
0.89 seconds. By 11, 100 seconds, the 918 broke a minute 30 on Laguna Seca, the only production

1752
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:12,380
car to ever do so. Now, my favorite little tidbit. And I'll tell you, so the 911 Turbo S

1753
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:21,420
is faster than the 918 at the ring. I know. So unbelievable. Unbelievable. But then of course,

1754
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:28,060
there are $50,000 track cars that'll go a minute 19 on that Laguna Seca, which again,

1755
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:31,820
is always the great thing for people to understand the difference between track cars and street cars.

1756
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:38,300
Yeah. Ted, this was awesome. I know this was a bit more of a male centric episode, but I think one,

1757
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:43,180
guys will get a lot out of this. But also I think for women who know a man who's going through this,

1758
02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:47,500
or will go through this, I mean, I think there's a lot here and we'll be sure in the show notes to

1759
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:52,380
link to a ton of the stuff that was discussed. It would be great to be able to link to any videos

1760
02:29:52,380 --> 02:29:57,900
that you have on your surgeries. If people want to learn more about you, I mean, obviously at

1761
02:29:57,900 --> 02:30:02,460
Northwestern, the website will link to your bio, your CV and all that other stuff. If they Google

1762
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:08,540
Dr. Edward Shafer, they'll get all the links. But NM or Northwesternmedicine.org is a good way to find

1763
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:14,620
me. DR-Shafer.com is another way to find me. Okay. Do you do anything on social media?

1764
02:30:15,580 --> 02:30:21,820
My handle is at Edward Shafer. Okay. Cool. Ted, this was awesome. Thank you for making the time

1765
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:25,580
