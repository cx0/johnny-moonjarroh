Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,400
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,480
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,760
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,960
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,920
today's episode. My guest this week is Erin Mikos. Erin is an internationally known leader

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,560
in preventative cardiology, women's cardiovascular health, and cardiobstetrics. She's an associate

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,320
professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,080
the joint appointment in the department of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,720
School of Public Health. She's also the director of women's cardiovascular health and the associate

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,360
director of preventative cardiology with the Johns Hopkins Center of Prevention of Cardiovascular

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,760
Disease. This is an episode that covers a topic that is obviously valuable to understand given

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,760
that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death worldwide. And while

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,800
as the topic we've covered in detail in the podcast before, I think it's an important episode

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,000
because we focus this conversation around cardiovascular disease and lipids specifically

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,840
through the lens of female biology. We discussed the prevalence of ASCVD in females as they age,

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,440
the importance of making interventions early in life, the risk of ASCVD over the course of lifetime,

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,080
as opposed to the traditional view, which is to only really consider 10 year risk. We then probe

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,680
the ins and outs of CVD, lipids, and various lipid lowering medications across a female's lifetime,

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,560
including the premenopausal state changes during the perimenopausal state, pregnancy, and menopause

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,680
and beyond. We also touch on a number of other subjects that affect a female's risk of ASCVD,

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,080
specifically polycystic ovarian syndrome, contraceptives, GLP1 agonist nutrition, metabolic

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,040
health, familial hypercholesterolemia, statins, stress, HRT, and more. So without further delay,

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:34,120
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Erin Mikos. Thanks so much for making time, Erin. Look forward

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,360
to this discussion. We have a lot to talk about, but before we do it, there's one thing I wanted

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,440
to just check. Going through your bio, I realize when did you do your residency in medicine? Because

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:52,200
you also did that at Hopkins, correct? Yes. So I've been at Hopkins 22 years. I did residency 2000

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,800
to 2003, and then stayed on for cardiology fellowship and then joined the faculty. So I've

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,360
been on faculty over 15 years now. I did my general surgery there. I was there from 01 to 06,

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,920
which made me realize the probability we haven't passed each other somewhere in the emergency room

34
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,880
during residency is exceedingly low, right? I'm sure we must have interacted because I was there

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,240
all during that time, overlapped with my residency and my fellowship. I always am amazed when I run

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,620
into people who I know I was there with. And there are certain medicine residents I remember

37
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,360
very well, but just by coincidence, you're always in the ER together, but obviously it's a huge

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,400
program. So when you went into medicine, did you know you wanted to do cardiology? When I went into

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,800
medicine, I did in college, actually didn't know that I was going to go into medicine. You know,

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,840
there's no doctors in my family. So I'm the first one. So I didn't really know what a career in

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,760
medicine would be about. So I started out my undergrad studies at Northwestern as a molecular

42
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,040
biology major. Through that I interacted with so many pre-med students who are my classmates. And

43
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,480
their enthusiasm about entering the field was really contagious. And I was doing a lot of bench

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,600
science, which is really a good experience. I think anybody entering science and medicine should have

45
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,520
some bench lab work experience. But I began to long for more direct clinical research with direct

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,840
patient exposure. So kind of late, I switched to being pre-med kind of my last year of undergrad

47
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,520
and applied actually to both the PhD and medical programs. And then when I started medical school,

48
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,800
I really fell in love with cardiology, even as a medical student before medicine residency.

49
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,760
I have a real interest in diet and nutrition and exercise and lifestyle. And we think that over

50
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,200
90% of cardiovascular disease is due to preventable, modifiable risk factors. And there's, you know,

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,480
so much we can do for prevention. And this is why I really love being a preventive cardiologist.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,880
So when I entered medicine residency, I already had my eye towards cardiology fellowship.

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,400
You did the full three years of medicine and then you did three years of cards.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,840
I did four years of cards.

55
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,320
Oh, you did?

56
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,000
So no, I was on the slow track.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
You were on the slow track.

58
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,520
I did three years of residency, which is standard. And then our cardiology fellowship program was

59
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,720
four years because we emphasize research. So I did two years of research on a T32 program

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,360
and cardiovascular epidemiology. And that's where I got my master's in health science.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,600
You said something at the outset that I completely agree with. And I feel like sometimes I'm banging

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,080
my head against the wall trying to make this point. You said, correct me if I misquote you,

63
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,920
but something to the effect of 90% of cardiovascular disease is preventable when you consider

64
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,360
modifiable risk factors. Was that kind of the gist of what you said?

65
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,720
Yeah, that's the data from the inner heart study that 90% of mild cardiomyvarction risk was due to

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,040
preventable risk factors. One of the things I tell my patients is that both in the United States and

67
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,560
globally, ASCVD is the leading cause of death. In fact, I was surprised somewhat recently,

68
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,760
like in the last year, to realize how much bigger the gap is between ASCVD and cancer

69
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,640
globally than in the US. It's number one in both. But when you look at the entire world,

70
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,760
I believe it's about 18 and a half to 19 million deaths attributed to ASCVD versus about 10 or 11

71
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,960
million to cancer. It's almost 2x delta. And when you take into account what you just said,

72
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,160
that between smoking, hypertension, and controlling APO-B, you could basically turn

73
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,280
that into a disease that would barely rank on the top 10. Does it surprise you that this doesn't

74
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,560
get more attention? Yeah, it surprises me. And I'm also really concerned that we're reversing

75
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,120
these trends. The first statin, lobostatin, was approved in 1987. After that, along with

76
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,400
efforts in smoking cessation and blood pressure treatment, there was a significant decline in

77
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,760
cardiovascular disease mortality in men. During this time, unfortunately, CBD mortality was rising

78
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,640
in women till around the year 2000 when this came to attention that we need to prevent cardiovascular

79
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,840
disease in women as well. And after that time, there was dramatic decline in cardiovascular

80
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,040
disease mortality in women and continued decline in men. But unfortunately, in recent years,

81
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,280
we are no longer making these strides in progress anymore. In fact, we're no longer even stagnated.

82
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,160
There's been a frank uptick in cardiovascular disease mortality in both men and women

83
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,840
due to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases. In fact,

84
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,760
cardiovascular disease mortality is on the rise in younger women. And when you look at rates of

85
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,800
change, the fastest growing heart disease death rate is in middle-aged women age 45 to 64. So,

86
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,240
this is a particular group that needs more focused attention. So, we really need to double down on our

87
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,080
preventive efforts. And it's really disheartening to see that we're no longer making the progress

88
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,960
that we used to. So, if these trends are not overturned, you know, heart disease is set to

89
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,080
overtake cancer as the leading cause of death in younger women as well. I'm really glad you

90
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,760
made that point because when you look at what these things called in our practice, we have these

91
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,640
things called death bars, which is just an analysis that shows mortality sliced and diced in different

92
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,640
ways. But, you know, sometimes a graph just says things in a way that it's harder to describe in

93
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,840
words. And one of the things that does emerge from this analysis is that in middle-aged cancer

94
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,200
is still the biggest killer. And, of course, overall cardiovascular disease is, and in old age

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,800
cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease dominate. But what you said is very

96
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,560
distressing if indeed now cardiovascular disease would eclipse cancer in even middle age.

97
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,960
So, overall, and focus on women's health, so cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,960
death in women. You know, women more often fear breast cancer, which is a terrible disease. My

99
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,960
mother had breast cancer, but far more women are likely to die of cardiovascular disease than

100
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,720
cancer. But notably, you know, in younger individuals under the age of 65, cancer is

101
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,920
still the leading cause of death in women. But one of my studies that we published in the European

102
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,600
Heart Journal, we track death rates in younger women under the age of 65 in the US looking at

103
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:16,200
CDC wonder data over a 20-year period from 1999 to 2019. And we showed during this time that

104
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,800
actually cancer mortality has been declining in younger women, which is a good thing. But since

105
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,280
2010, heart disease mortality is no longer declining and is factually rising in these

106
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,920
younger women at 0.5% per year. So, it's actually narrowing the gap between cancer deaths and heart

107
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,360
disease deaths in the younger female population as well. So, if these trends are not overturned,

108
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,000
as I mentioned, you know, heart disease is set to overtake cancer as the leading cause of death in

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,840
younger women, which is really discouraging considering that we have so many more tools now

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,240
for prevention. And what was also really disheartening, I don't know if you saw this American Heart

111
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Association survey that was published in 2021, but the American Heart Association has sent out

112
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,040
surveys over the years to women about their awareness of heart disease being the leading

113
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,080
cause of death in women. And back in 2009, you know, 65% of women reported that they knew that

114
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,920
heart disease was the leading cause of death. But in 2019, the more recent data, 10 years later,

115
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,280
only 44% of women reported that heart disease was the leading cause of death in women. They were

116
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,120
more likely to report cancer as the leading cause of death. So, this lack of awareness is worrisome,

117
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,040
and it was particularly prominent among non-Hispanic black women and among Hispanic women,

118
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,320
and also among the younger women demographic that we're talking about, who arguably we can do the

119
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,280
most for primordial prevention would be most effective if started earlier. I also think

120
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,240
there's kind of an emotional thing to this, which is even if you don't pose the question directly,

121
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,840
like a multiple choice question, I just find in speaking with my female patients, so young female

122
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:04,840
patients, I think there's a greater fear of breast cancer than ASCVD, even though the mortality from

123
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,280
heart disease is somewhere between eight and 10 times greater than that of breast cancer. It's

124
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:16,600
amazing to think that they would be more afraid of something that has a log lower difference in

125
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,760
mortality. What do you think explains that? And again, you can answer this both through a personal

126
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,680
lens through the experience with your mother, but also professionally given what you study.

127
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,760
I think there's still this lingering notion that somehow heart disease is a man's disease.

128
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,280
The problem is, women have historically been under enrolled in randomized clinical trials.

129
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,600
So, we previously had limited data on efficacy and safety of therapies in women. So, both women

130
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,120
think that they're at lower risk than they really are, but also clinicians. So, clinicians, even when

131
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,400
given the same 10-year estimated risk or burden or risk factors, clinicians are more likely

132
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,520
to perceive women to being at lower risk, and this leads to under treatment. And particularly,

133
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,280
I see this with women who have FH, amylo-hypokalestralemia, who are under treated,

134
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:13,160
because on average in the non-FH population, women tend to develop cardiovascular disease about 10

135
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,520
years later than men, somehow thought that premenopausal women of reproductive years are

136
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:26,280
somehow protected. But we don't see this in FH. FH affects 1 in 250 individuals. It's autosomal

137
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,960
dominant, which means women are equally affected as men, and it's associated with a 20-fold increased

138
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:39,800
risk of CBD. Women with FH have an earlier onset of ASCVD about 20 to 30 years earlier than women

139
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,520
without FH, and they continue to be under treated. But notably, in the FH population, women have the

140
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:54,120
same age, early age of onset, as CBD as men do. So, they are not protected. They don't have this

141
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,720
premenopausal advantage, and it's still really disheartening to me to see that these women who

142
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,680
have very high genetic risk are not being treated because of concerns about pregnancy, which you can

143
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,520
talk about our management around there. But it's better to even have short interruptions in treatment

144
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,200
than to let these women who have genetically high, very high LDLs be marinating in this

145
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,760
atherogenesis for decades and decades untreated, which, you know, dooms them to earlier onset

146
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,360
morbidity and mortality if not treated. Let's put some of these numbers to folks. I don't know if

147
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,040
these are still the correct data, but the last time I looked, this was sort of a directionally

148
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,200
correct. We use 65 as the dividing line between quote-unquote young and old, and the data basically

149
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,240
suggested that if you consider all the people who are going to suffer a major adverse cardiac

150
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,520
event in their life, and you consider men and ask the question, what fraction of men will experience

151
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,240
their first event? Of the men who experience a major adverse cardiac event in life, what fraction

152
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,200
will experience it before the age of 65? The answer was fully half. Again, this is to dispel the notion

153
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
that cardiovascular disease is an old person disease, because I don't think most people would

154
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,680
consider someone who's 60 years old to be old by today's standards. And even in women, to your point,

155
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:22,280
who have this time shift of about one decade, still one third of women who will experience a major

156
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,400
adverse cardiac event in their life will do so before the age of 65. Those were the data about

157
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,360
five or six years ago. Do you believe that that is still the case? Yes, unfortunately. You know,

158
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,880
women of reproductive age are still at risk for ASCBD. They may be lower risk on average,

159
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,120
but they're still at risk, and they're less likely to be treated. You know, when you look at the data

160
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,080
from like the YUMMI, Young Myocardial Infarction cohort, before the onset of their myocardial

161
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,520
infarction, you know, women were less likely to have been treated and perceived to be at lower risk.

162
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,080
So this is really concerning about the under treatment of women and this presumption that

163
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,280
they're lower risk. We know that smoking and diabetes, in addition to the FH, as I mentioned,

164
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:12,040
also eliminate any premenopausal advantage. It's not only really the magnitude of LDL elevation,

165
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,520
but it's the duration of exposure. So even exposure to mild or moderately elevated LDL

166
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:25,000
for a sufficient number of years has increased the risk of ASCBD to an earlier onset compared to

167
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,920
individuals who have had lifetime low LDL. And so by waiting to treat individuals until later of life,

168
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,640
you know, you've left atherosclerosis propagate unchecked during this time. It's never too late

169
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,720
to implement prevention, but prevention is better implemented when started earlier.

170
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,800
Yeah, there's two ways I try to explain this to patients, and usually at least one of them works.

171
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,920
So sometimes patients will come in with some recollection of calculus, and you can remind them

172
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,640
about the area under the curve and the integral, and you can sort of explain that an enormous

173
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,320
driver of atherosclerosis is indeed exposure to APO-B. On my podcast, the listeners are very

174
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,720
astute. They understand that we're really talking about APO-B, which includes of course LDL, but also

175
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,520
VLDL, et cetera. And we say, look, it's really the time is the X axis and APO-B concentration is the

176
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:21,320
Y axis. You want to minimize the area under that curve. And to your point, that means starting

177
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,960
earlier and lowering APO-B or LDL cholesterol more. And the longer you wait, the more it puts

178
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,720
the burden on you to really lower that APO-B. So if that doesn't resonate, I think the other

179
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,360
way that resonates with people is to think about saving for retirement, which is in an

180
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,480
ideal world, you'd start saving in your twenties and you wouldn't have to save an enormous amount

181
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,560
if you were saving in your twenties, but you'd be chipping away at it and building up your coffers

182
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,520
and generating a slow and steady incremental return and letting the effective compounding

183
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,640
take its toll. Of course, if you wait until you're 40 or 50, you're going to have to be more

184
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,360
aggressive in your savings and you're going to also require a higher rate of compounded return

185
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,520
if you want to have the same amount when you retire. And of course, if you wait until you're

186
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,840
60, it doesn't mean that you can't have some sort of financial independence in your seventies, but boy,

187
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,240
you've got to really sock away a lot of money and you've got to really hope for some

188
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,720
pretty impressive returns in the stock market. And so usually somewhere between those two

189
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,560
explanations, people start to understand what you're saying and what people like Peter Libby

190
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,520
have said, which is it's time exposure to APO-B. Do you get the sense that it also works that way

191
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,960
with blood pressure and some of the other really clear causative agents for ASCVD?

192
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Yes. You know, you wouldn't take someone who has a younger adult who has a systolic blood pressure

193
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,600
of 160 and say, oh, you know, your 10 year risk is low in the next 10 years because you're only

194
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,240
30. So, you know, we're not going to treat you. We're going to let this high blood pressure continue

195
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,000
on and damage your arteries and cause, you know, silent vascular damage. No, you would treat a 30

196
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,600
year old who have elevated blood pressure. So this problem with these 10 year risk in younger adults

197
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,600
is that, yes, younger adults are going to have a lower short term risk over the next 10 years,

198
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:18,520
but they have a high lifetime risk and that we do them a disservice by ignoring these high values

199
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,200
because they haven't crossed some kind of theoretical 10 year threshold with the exception

200
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,000
of guidelines say, well, FH, we treat if it's above 190, but a lot of patients have mild to moderate

201
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,240
elevated cholesterol in younger age years that is not being treated. You know, I tell my patients,

202
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,120
I'm not just concerned about preventing a heart attack in the next 10 years. I want to prevent

203
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,000
them from having a heart attack over the next 40 years. And so this is where we need to have much

204
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,680
more focus on prevention. And this does emphasize the role of lifestyle as well and healthy dietary

205
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,360
changes and really healthy lifestyle should really begin in utero. You just took a real page out of

206
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,280
Alan Snyderman's JAMA paper from a few years ago where he really just took aim at this ridiculous

207
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:10,280
notion of 10 year risk being remotely helpful in young people. One of the exercises I like to do

208
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,720
with patients is take them to the Mesa risk calculator page and basically demonstrate for

209
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,920
them how much it's driven by age. If you go to the lowest end of that calculator, which I think is 40

210
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:28,840
or 45, there's almost no variable you can put in there that gets you to a high enough 10 year risk

211
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,600
that you would trigger treatment. Five percent 10 year risk. Okay, now we need to act. Conversely,

212
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,040
at a high enough age, there's almost no variable you can put in there for which the risk is low

213
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,160
enough. In other words, age is the biggest driver of risk. How do you think we got here? Because

214
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,720
you've clearly, I think, identified the jugular issue, which is the time horizon of risk.

215
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,560
And yet somehow when it comes to lipids, we stick to it. And yet when it comes to smoking and blood

216
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,760
pressure, we don't. We treat the causative agent when we're dealing with blood pressure and smoking,

217
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,720
and yet we somehow ignore the causative agent of APO-B when we're talking about lipids and focus

218
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,240
instead on time horizon. Well, I think part of the problem is randomized clinical trials do serve as

219
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,560
our primary evidence base for guideline recommendations. And they're very, very important.

220
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,960
But randomized clinical trials are expensive. And so you run them over generally a short time

221
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,920
period, five years, and you want to enroll high risk people that are going to have events over

222
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,000
the next five years. You really can't feasibly do a randomized clinical trial for decades and decades.

223
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,400
And so by nature, these lower risk individuals in younger adults are not included in these trials.

224
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:50,040
And then it comes down to the fact that we don't have data specifically for treatment in this

225
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,200
population. But I definitely hone down on lifestyle changes, particularly in younger adults. And I

226
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,120
think we're going to get into women's specific factors a little bit later and talk about

227
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,520
pregnancy. But high adverse lipid panel, elevated triglycerides, elevated total cholesterol,

228
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,680
and chronic hypertension and obesity, these cardiometabolic risk factors.

229
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,920
If women are entering pregnancy in poor cardiometabolic health, which the data shows that

230
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,120
there's been an increase in this, they're more likely to have these adverse pregnancy outcomes

231
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,120
like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes that not only increase their risk of short term

232
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:35,640
complications at delivery, but also impact their risk even decade or more after their index pregnancy.

233
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,960
Really, we need a shift improvement in cardiometabolic health earlier in life,

234
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,840
which means in young adults and women of reproductive age.

235
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,200
I agree with that completely. And I want to come back to it in more detail. But I still feel like

236
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,320
there is a double standard going back to what we talked about earlier in that we don't have a study

237
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:03,160
that says not smoking if you're aged 30 to 40 is going to reduce your risk of cardiovascular

238
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,600
disease. But yet there's not a physician out there that doesn't recommend smoking cessation

239
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:15,560
to a person the minute they pick up a cigarette. Why? It's because we've identified causality.

240
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,600
Once you identify causality, that's all that matters. The same is true with blood pressure.

241
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:27,160
We don't have a hypertensive study that looked at people aged 25 to 35 or 35 to 45, where we

242
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,240
reduced blood pressure and showed a dramatic reduction in events because they probably weren't

243
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,080
going to have the events in the time horizon of the study. And so the reason it's very easy for

244
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,600
any physician to treat hypertension in a 35 year old is because they're treating the causal agent.

245
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,720
And that's where I'm frustrated, Aaron, is we have the same level of causality for APO-B.

246
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,080
There is no ambiguity about this. And yet we somehow have this double standard where we

247
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,280
ignore the causal agent. I agree with you. We have overwhelming evidence that LDL is a causal factor

248
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,560
in atherosclerosis. We have data from observational studies, from genetic studies, from

249
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,320
interventional trials. It meets all the criteria for a causal factor. You just asked me to speculate

250
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,520
I'm not sure why that there hasn't been a greater uptick about treating in younger ages. And this

251
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,520
focus on 10 year risk scores, I'll point out though in randomized clinical trials, none of the

252
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,920
randomized clinical trials enrolled people on the basis of a 10 year cut point. The pooled cohort

253
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,160
equation has never been tested in a randomized clinical fashion about treating people based on

254
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,920
a full cohort equation cut point versus another cut point that was never been tested. The trials

255
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,200
have specific enrollment criteria and they really weren't based on 10 year risk scores. They were

256
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,800
based on other factors. And so this over-reliance on 10 year risk scores. But I will say that we

257
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,440
have made some progress. And I was really pleased. I was a co-author on the 2019 ACCAJ primary

258
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,600
prevention guidelines. We do acknowledge the limitations of these 10 year risk scores. They

259
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,920
can both overestimate risk in certain populations, such as older adults and those with higher

260
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,360
socioeconomic status. And they can underestimate risk in other populations, such as those with more

261
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,360
social deprivation and these other unique risk factors that are not captured in these 10 year risk

262
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,920
score. And so they acknowledge this, they still feel like you should do some kind of risk assessment

263
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,680
as a starting point and very low risk individuals, less than 5% 10 year risk lifestyle may be enough

264
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,880
and high risk individuals above 20% 10 year risk. You don't want to use your high intensity stat in

265
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,040
the lower LDL by 50% or more. But they do allow more room now for the borderline intermediate risk

266
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,720
to consider these risk enhancing factors of which April B and like portal A are some of them. But I

267
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,120
also was really pleased that they've acknowledged these female specific factors that we'll talk

268
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,520
more about early menopause and adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia. And so the presence of

269
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,560
these risk enhancers and those of borderline intermediate risk would favor the initiation of

270
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,000
statins. And then if there is still uncertainty about risk, even after you estimate 10 year risk

271
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,640
and consider those risk enhancing factors, you can get a coronary artery calcium score

272
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,400
to help refine risk a little bit better and guide shared decision making. So my practice, I use a

273
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,080
lot of coronary calcium scoring and particularly for elevated score, I'll even treat individuals

274
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,880
similar to secondary prevention population. But we know that even that doesn't work very well in

275
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,160
the younger population that we're talking about less than 40 because it takes time for plaque to

276
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:46,360
calcify. And so a zero calcium score, a young adult isn't as reassuring as a zero score in an

277
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,920
older adult. You know, they get they might be at low risk the short term for sure, but they may

278
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,880
still have a lifetime risk. We've gone back and forth in our practice about how to use calcium

279
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,880
scores and I think come to the same conclusion you have, right? Which is that in a young patient,

280
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,600
frankly, I would say younger than 50 truthfully, I don't know that a zero calcium score tells me

281
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,440
much. First of all, we know that 15% of zero calcium scores are false negatives. Anyway,

282
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,480
if you do a CTA, a CT angiogram listener, you're going to see a calcification that was missed

283
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,600
because the CTA has much finer slices than the CAC, or you're going to see soft plaque. In fact,

284
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:28,520
one series found that I think almost 2% of zero scores on CACs actually had hemodynamically

285
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,880
significant lesions on CTA. Even if you put aside the false positives or the false negatives,

286
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,880
rather, to your point, the physiology of the disease tells us that's the wrong metric to

287
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,200
care about. It's more interesting, I suppose, when you have perfectly clean CTAs in 70 year olds with

288
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,640
hyperlipidemia to which you can say, well, look, clearly this person has other factors that are

289
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,200
protective. We might not understand what they are and this is a patient in whom aggressive

290
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,440
treatment probably isn't necessary, especially if they don't feel that if the patient themselves

291
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,760
doesn't want it. Let's now talk about this thing that you've brought up on two occasions, which I

292
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,840
think is really important if I'm understanding you correctly, which is if we think about the lack of

293
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,240
progress or the regression in progress, I guess, that's been made over the past decade.

294
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,360
Am I understanding you correctly that it has been less about a reduction in treatment

295
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,360
for the preventative measures of ASCVD and more about the increase in the background

296
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,040
metabolic dysfunction or have both of these things been happening together?

297
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,640
Both of these things have been happening together. In terms of treatment, individuals are still

298
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,600
undertreated. We see this over and over again in registries. If you look at even the highest risk

299
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,360
patients, that's just those with ASCVD from the gold registry in the US and the Santorini

300
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,520
registry in Europe, patients are not at goal with their LDL and they're undertreated. In the gold

301
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:59,320
registry of US patients with ASCVD, more than two-thirds remained with an LDL above 70. We can

302
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,360
argue that maybe they should have been up there. LDL is as low as 55, but we even use a threshold

303
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,000
of 70 as the goal for initiating a non-statin therapy to a statin. Two-thirds were above this

304
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,480
goal and over a two-year period, only 17% had their lipid lowering therapy intensified.

305
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,840
There's this credible inertia. Patients are not at goal. The use of combination therapy,

306
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,120
including PCS-canine inhibitors, is very underutilized. There's something like 6% in this cohort.

307
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,920
We're certainly not treating with the tools that we have, which is really disheartening.

308
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,240
But also on the backdrop of this, we've all seen the US maps about the epidemic of obesity.

309
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,560
Along with that comes diabetes and other disorders related to insulin resistance,

310
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:53,800
including worrisome trends with increasing maternal mortality, rising rates of gestational

311
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,040
diabetes, which is increasing worldwide. The cardio metabolic health of the US population

312
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:06,200
is getting worse over time. We're shifting more morbidity to younger and younger age groups,

313
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,680
which is not a good thing at all and likely going to affect anticipated life expectancy trends to

314
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:18,760
reverse. Aaron, obviously, these trends that you're observing, the increase in obesity,

315
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,600
the increase in insulin resistance, the increase in type 2 diabetes,

316
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,840
although you didn't state it, it's embedded within here, the increase in naphthal D and

317
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,680
NASH, the increase, as you said, in gestational diabetes. I mean, all of these things are

318
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,160
basically growing out of metabolic syndrome. You could argue now, I don't know the latest stats,

319
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,680
but do you know what fraction of people in the United States now have metabolic syndrome?

320
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,640
I don't know. I've had my head for metabolic syndrome, but it's huge. We know that diabetes

321
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,280
rates are certainly going up with over one in 10 US adults having diabetes. And many with diabetes

322
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,560
don't even know that they have it. So there's a latency and diagnosis. So this is all really

323
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,560
alarming trends, especially when we have a lot of therapies we can do for prevention.

324
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,920
But of course, one of the most important prevention therapies I can prescribe for my patients is

325
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:11,320
lifestyle changes. Even modest weight loss can have a pretty significant impact on proglycerides

326
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,880
and blood pressure reduction. So it's always important that we can talk about all the new

327
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,680
exciting therapies we have for weight loss, like the GLP1 receptor agonist and the dual agonist,

328
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,920
but really still emphasizing healthy lifestyle from childhood is still such an important

329
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,360
strategy for prevention. So we know it's multifaceted. I don't think any serious

330
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,560
commentator on this will point to one thing and say that's the culprit for why we're seeing this

331
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:45,720
epidemic. But how do you rank order these things? So what is the causative driver in your mind for

332
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,560
weight loss? How much of that do you think lies at the feet of lower exercise levels versus

333
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,480
food availability, hyperpallatability, specific elements within the diet? How do you start to

334
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,280
disentangle this? Because I think without some level of granularity there, it becomes difficult

335
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,720
to say lose weight. An overweight person shows up and you tell them to lose weight. That's not a

336
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,040
particularly helpful insight. So in other words, to prescribe something insightful, we have to have

337
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,480
some sense of what the etiology is. So how do you think about that? First of all, I'm trying to

338
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,160
prevent or reverse the trends of obesity on a population basis. And so we put too much

339
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:29,160
blame on the individual, but we have major societal and population problems with the

340
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:36,600
easy access to poor quality food, these highly processed foods that are extremely palatable,

341
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,920
but contain a lot of saturated fats and other additives and sugars. The way our jobs are

342
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:51,160
structured to be more sedentary and long commute times, having access to safe places to exercise

343
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:57,880
and having time to do so and the increased stress levels in life. I mean, there's so many social

344
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,080
determinants of health that have led to this problem. And there's huge parts of the country

345
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,520
where there's food deserts, where there's not access to fruits and vegetables or food swamps

346
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,520
that are just really only available, cheap and easy foods are these highly processed packaged foods.

347
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:20,360
So as individuals, we do have some responsibility for our own life choices. Larger issues should be

348
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,440
placed in regulation and policy on a population level. And then, you know, once an individual is

349
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,520
already obese, it's much harder than to lose weight. We certainly talk about lifestyle changes,

350
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:40,600
but obesity is far more complicated. There is all kinds of hormonal regulations, and it's not just

351
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,240
as easy as calories in, calories out. The good news for these individuals is that at least now,

352
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,760
we do have some new pharmacological agents that are beneficial in weight loss that do not have

353
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,040
cardiovascular harm, like some of the older weight loss drugs, and may actually be

354
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,160
cardiovascularly beneficial. We know the GLP1 receptor agonist, at least in patients with type

355
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,880
2 diabetes, you know, reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and stroke.

356
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,080
And so while we do have an outcome trial ongoing right now in persons who were overweight and

357
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,920
obese, but without diabetes with the GLP1 receptor agonist, I'm anticipating this will also be

358
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,280
beneficial for cardiovascular disease. So we have new options to treat obesity, but really trying to

359
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,320
focus on prevention of obesity in the first place, because it's certainly not feasible to treat

360
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,760
two thirds of US adults are overweight and obese. The statistics are astronomical,

361
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,240
they're astounding. So we really need to focus on population interventions.

362
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,600
Which GLP1 agonist are we looking at now? Is it semiglutide or trisepatide?

363
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,160
So they're different. So semiglutide is a GLP1 receptor agonist, at least in patients in type

364
00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:00,040
2 diabetes. We have cardiovascular outcome data for the injectable, the subcutaneous dose.

365
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:07,480
There is an outcome data ongoing for the oral formulation, but we don't have that data yet.

366
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,720
So usually I prescribe the injectable form. Now, so receptor bide is a new kid on the block.

367
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:21,000
It's a dual agonist, a GIP, GLP1 receptor agonist. This has been approved also for

368
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,360
diabetes, although the outcome trial for diabetes is ongoing, the CIRM-out outcome trial.

369
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:35,400
But it also has been evaluated for weight loss and really showed dramatic weight loss,

370
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:41,560
up to 50 pounds in the highest dose, which is really remarkable. We can't compare trials

371
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,600
head to head because they were not compared head to head, but in the STEP trials with

372
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:51,720
semiglutide, there was about a 30 or so pound weight loss. So triseptebide is not yet FDA

373
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,800
approved for weight management, although it will likely have this indication soon, but it was,

374
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:04,600
it is approved for type 2 diabetes. Semiglutide is approved for both type 2 diabetes for reduction

375
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,920
in major adverse cardiovascular events, but it also has a separate weight loss indication

376
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:17,080
for persons who are obese with BMI above 30 or overweight with a BMI over 27 in the setting of

377
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,600
one or more obesity related cardiovascular risk factors who need additional weight management

378
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:28,280
after diet and lifestyle attempts. So we have new agents now, which is really exciting, but getting

379
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,120
back to we need to do in a larger population to reverse the overall trends of obesity.

380
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,400
Before we leave the GLP1 agonist and the dual receptor agonist, what is your best guess as to

381
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,760
the mechanism by which they also reduce cardiac events if it indeed is beyond weight loss? In

382
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,320
other words, do you think it's all due to the benefits of weight loss, which of course bring

383
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,240
with it an improvement in metabolic health, or do you think there's something specific there

384
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,080
that's going on? And I would ask the same question eventually, although we don't have to discuss it

385
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:03,800
now with SGLT2 inhibitors. The GLP1 receptor agonist, I don't know that we fully understand

386
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,800
all of the benefits on the mechanisms for benefits, but we know that the benefits of

387
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,800
reducing major adverse cardiovascular events are independent of its A1C lowering. These are

388
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,240
interesting agents that in persons with elevated glucose, such as diabetes, they lower blood

389
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,680
glucose. But in persons who don't have elevated glucose, such as those with who are overweight

390
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:35,160
obese who don't have diabetes, GLP1s don't cause hypoglycemia solo agents. So they only lower blood

391
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,520
glucose in a glucose dependent fashion. But the benefit on base reduction, which has been shown

392
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,800
to persons with type 2 diabetes, is independent of A1C lowering. It may in part be related to

393
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,120
favorable changes and other risk factors, such as reduction in blood pressure and weight loss.

394
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:58,760
There's improvement in the lipid panel. It's being investigated also in NAFLD as well. There

395
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:05,480
may be anti-inflammatory effects. There may be anti-atherescrotic effects. There also may be some

396
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:12,120
effects in the kidney. We do see a reduction in albinuria with these agents as well. So there

397
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:18,920
really an interesting class of drugs. So let's now turn our attention to specifically the physiology

398
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,000
of women as it pertains to lipids and ASCVD. So I think we should maybe to make it easier,

399
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,080
at least start with premenopausal women. What's happening in a woman's body when she's 25,

400
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:38,840
that's different from a man's body when he's 25 as it pertains to sex hormones and the interaction,

401
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,720
therefore with lipids and other factors that impact the simmering process of ASCVD?

402
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,320
Sure. First, I just wanted to give a broad statement. I'm glad that we're having this

403
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,160
discussion about lipids in women and ASCVD in women because there are differences. Women are

404
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:01,880
not smaller men or have unique risk factors. Even among traditional risk factors, diabetes and

405
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,720
smoking confer a greater relative risk in women than in men. And then women have unique risk factors

406
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,120
that we'll talk more about throughout their lifespan that men do not related to menarchy

407
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:17,800
when earlier late and polycystic ovary syndrome and infertility, spontaneous pregnancy loss,

408
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,960
parity, adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia, lack of breastfeeding and early menopause.

409
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,600
And in addition, chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are more

410
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:34,200
prevalent in women. So women have these unique risk factors that are female specific or female

411
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,320
predominant. And cardiovascular disease also can be different in women, which is why we need more

412
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:45,640
trials in women. Women are more likely to have ischemia with non obstructive coronary disease

413
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,440
from coronary microvascular dysfunction or coronary vasospasm. They're more likely to have

414
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,800
SCAD, spontaneous coronary artery dissection and more likely to have stress cardiomyopathy than men.

415
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,040
So we really need more data about treating cardiovascular disease in women.

416
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,560
But let's talk about the life cycle that you alluded to in the beginning with your question.

417
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,160
Estradiol is the predominant female sex hormone in women of reproductive age that seems to have

418
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,920
the beneficial effects with lowering LDL and conferring some cardiovascular protective properties.

419
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,320
But I should mention there's actually three types of estrogen. So estradiol, which is the predominant

420
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,720
one in women in childbearing age, and this is the most potent form of estrogen. So estradiol is E2.

421
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:40,120
So estriol E3 is the main estrogen produced during pregnancy. And then estrone E1 is the only estrogen

422
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:46,280
produced after menopause. It's also the weakest estrogen. So you know, starting with puberty,

423
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,120
puberty is a process that starts in the brain. So the hypothalamus in the brain suddenly begins

424
00:39:52,120 --> 00:40:00,200
secreting gonadotropin releasing hormone or GNRH. FSH and LH levels gradually increase during puberty,

425
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,000
which stimulate the follicle maturation and estrogen production and the ovaries,

426
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,280
and also the secondary sex characteristics like breast changes and changes in body composition.

427
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,560
This gets to the point where then there's the onset of menarche or the first men's

428
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,360
yeast. And so this is typically, you know, around age 12. And it's important to note that, you know,

429
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,240
I treat adult patients, but why I even ask adult women about the onset of menarche

430
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:32,600
is because both early menarche before the age of 11 and also late menarche after the age of 17 has

431
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,360
been associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk later in life. And there's likely

432
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,040
hormonal and adipokine and cardiometabolic imprinting that's related to this. There's

433
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,680
lots of factors related to the onset of menarche, but both socioeconomic and environmental factors

434
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:57,960
as well as genetic factors. But elevated BMI is a risk factor for early onset menarche, which is why

435
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,160
again, it's so important that we think about healthy lifestyle starting in childhood.

436
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,360
And I'll talk a little bit now about the menstrual cycle, because many people don't know, but the

437
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,000
lipids do change throughout the menstrual cycle difference in little cholesterol, you know, as

438
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,280
much as 10 to 12 milligrams or deciliter difference. And so while most women are reproductive age who

439
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,440
have lower LDL, this is not probably clinically significant in terms of atherogenesis. It does

440
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,360
matter when thinking about the timing of measuring a lipid panel during the menstrual cycle. I think

441
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:38,520
that's important to note. So during the menstrual cycle, you have the hypothalamus is releasing GNRH,

442
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,760
which causes the pituitary gland to release FSH. So FSH is acting on the ovaries to mature the

443
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,840
follicles. And that the follicles of the ovaries is what secretes estradiol. And so estradiol causes

444
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,840
the maturation of the egg and the thickening of the uterus lining and preparation for a fertilized

445
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:03,080
egg implant. And then the increased estradiol triggers the release of LH, which induces ovulation

446
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:09,320
and release of the egg. And so ovulation ends the follicular phase. And then after ovulation,

447
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,800
you're in the luteal phase where estradiol with progestin prepare the womb for implantation. But

448
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,560
if the egg isn't fertilized, the corpus luteum, which is secreting the progesterone breaks down.

449
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:27,240
So this leads to a drop in progesterone level in the beginning of the menstrual period. What does

450
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:34,200
this mean for lipids? So after menses, you know, total cholesterol and LDL increase rapidly after

451
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,400
menses. And so they really peak during this follicular phase. And then this is followed by

452
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,320
a decline in the luteal phase, which corresponds to the rise in the peak concentration of estrogen

453
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:51,240
and progesterone. So when estradiol is the highest in the menstrual cycle, this leads to the fall in

454
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:58,760
total cholesterol and LDL. HDL is highest around ovulation. Triglycerides didn't really have a

455
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,040
consistent pattern during the menstrual cycle. So there isn't specific guidance. And so just to

456
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:11,160
make sure I understood that, Erin, the difference between the peak and nadir of LDL cholesterol

457
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,000
is about 10 to 12 milligrams per deciliter, or is that total cholesterol?

458
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,840
That was total cholesterol, but it mirrors the difference in LDL as well. So this was a study that

459
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:32,520
published on average, total cholesterol may go from 158 to 168, where LDL on average went from

460
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:40,120
97 to 102. So, you know, they're not dramatic changes, which is why we don't worry about this

461
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,320
too much in women of reproductive ages who don't have a lipid disorder. But it's, you know,

462
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:52,200
interesting to note. But if a woman is very high risk, like has ASCBD, and we're trying to target

463
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,440
these really intensive thresholds, like LDL is less than 70 or even lower, it's useful to know

464
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,920
that they do change throughout the menstrual cycle. So while there's no specific guidance around this,

465
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:09,720
you know, I generally recommend clinicians measure the lipid panel during the menses so that it's

466
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,680
ideally measured, monitored and compared at the same time during the menstrual cycle. So usually

467
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:20,360
the menses is easiest to benchmark to. We do that when we're concerned with, as women become

468
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,080
perimenopausal and we want to start getting a sense of what's happening, we always use day five.

469
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,960
So if the initiation of menses, even if it's spotting is day one, but we always just pick day

470
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,720
five. And that way we have a really consistent view specifically of FSH and estradiol, progesterone

471
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:42,120
is zero at that time. But the FSH and the estradiol really give us a sense of how close she's

472
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,360
probably getting to menopause. And then we correlate that with symptoms to sort of start

473
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,760
to think about initiating HRT, but as a whole other topic, which I'm sure we'll get to.

474
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,000
You know, in terms of lipid panel, it's good to be measuring around the same time each month. So if

475
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,760
you're following the serial lipid panels in a woman for a reason, so timing it around day five,

476
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,720
especially if you're measuring other hormones. But yeah, so FSH would be at the highest during

477
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:11,800
the early follicular page and then declines after ovulation where LH is low during the early

478
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,560
follicular phase and then peaks around an ovulation, which stimulates the egg to be released.

479
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,520
At this point in a woman's life, she still enjoys this for all intents and purposes,

480
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:31,080
decade advantage over men in terms of ASCBD risk. So a 40 year old woman who is still

481
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,880
ovulating is at a cardiovascular standpoint is a 30 year old man. Is that directionally what we

482
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:44,040
would say prior to menopause? Yeah, I mean, on average, and again, people are not averages,

483
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:51,640
people are individuals, but on average, there is a about 10 year offset of ASCBD in women

484
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:57,480
developing it later than men. And this may be because we'll talk about when we get to menopause,

485
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,920
you know, with the loss of estradiol after menopause, LDL levels rise after menopause.

486
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:09,400
And so that women may have higher LDLs a little bit later in life. You know, many women's tell me,

487
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,720
oh, you know, I've always had good lipid levels. And now they're higher, you know, after menopause.

488
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,640
And so when we get back to what we started with about the integration of duration of LDL exposure

489
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,080
in terms of cholesterol years, they may have had lower number of cholesterol years during their

490
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,640
childbearing years and then higher levels later in life. And that might be why they have this

491
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:36,360
offset. But again, you don't see this in FH, and we don't see this as well in diabetes. And so each

492
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:43,320
person is an individual. And so we do women a disservice when we presume that all women somehow

493
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,520
are lower risk or protected during their menopausal years, because we started out this podcast talking

494
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:54,600
about that we absolutely see myocardial events, not just things like SCAD, but we see actual

495
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:01,000
atherosclerotic myocardial infarction events in younger women too. So they're at lower risk,

496
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
but not zero risk. And so we take each person as an individual. And then there are things we need

497
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,880
to consider related to contraception and PCOS that can also affect the lipid profile as well.

498
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,800
Let's take each of those then, because I think they're both incredibly fascinating and highly

499
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,920
prevalent. So let's start with PCOS. Tell folks what it is, maybe what the prevalence is, what we

500
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,640
think the etiology is, and of course, what the impact is on metabolic health and ultimately lipids.

501
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,120
So polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS is the most common endocrine abnormality of women of

502
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,120
reproductive age. Estimates are about 5% to 13% of women in the general population. And it does

503
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:46,600
affect women of all race ethnicities. It's categorized sort of by this triad of hyperandrogenism,

504
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:54,440
ovulatory dysfunction, so irregular menses or anovulatory cycles, and polycystic ovary

505
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,040
morphology. So just having cysts in the ovary in itself is not enough for the diagnosis. You need

506
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:06,680
to have these other criteria. It is a heterogeneous disorder in that there are differences in risk

507
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,280
with PCOS. But really, if you talk about the classical PCOS that has the hyperandrogen form,

508
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,480
this seems to be the one that is the most strongly linked with cardiovascular risk and the

509
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,720
cardiometabolic phenotype. So we really think that insulin resistance is hallmarking under the

510
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,920
pathogenesis of this, that there is molecular defects and insulin activities and PCOS that

511
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,440
leads to impaired glucose tolerance and glucose insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.

512
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:42,200
Studies have shown that about 95% of obese women with PCOS and about 75% of lean women with PCOS

513
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:49,880
has insulin resistance. So there is a lean PCOS phenotype. While most women with PCOS do have an

514
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,120
elevated body mass index, not all women have an elevated body mass index. But this insulin

515
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,800
resistance is probably driving a lot of the cardiometabolic complications, so elevations

516
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:08,200
in blood pressure and dyslipidemia patterns. So we see this, the triad of dyslipidemia with the

517
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:15,560
elevated LDL, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL, this metabolic syndrome pattern. PCOS is

518
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:20,920
associated with hypertension and insulin hypertension, and this is actually independent of BMI,

519
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:27,720
but obesity increases the risk and makes the risk greater. And there is an association not only with

520
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,440
increased subclinical atherosclerosis. I recently published a meta-analysis where we showed that

521
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,560
women with PCOS were twofold more likely to have coronary calcium. They're also more likely to have

522
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:42,520
parotid plaque, but they're also associated with increased cardiovascular disease later in life.

523
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:49,240
And the variable estimates have varied across studies, and this is likely because how PCOS was

524
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:55,240
defined and how cardiovascular disease was defined. And so they're not quite consistent across every

525
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,960
study, but on average about 30 to 50% increased risk that we saw in an umbrella review of a

526
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,040
meta-analysis of future cardiovascular risk. Now there's a little bit of debate about whether PCOS

527
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:16,120
is causally related to CVD. This excess risk that we see seems to be more of women during reproductive

528
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:23,160
age. Once women's already after menopause, having a prior history of PCOS doesn't seem to confer the

529
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,320
same level of risk, and likely because of all of the increased risk after the menopause transition

530
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:36,040
with the low estradiol and the more androgen phenotype after menopause probably outweighs or

531
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,040
overshadows any prior risk related to PCOS. But there does seem to be this long-term risk, but when

532
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:48,520
you look at Mendelian randomization studies, that does suggest that the elevated testosterone,

533
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:54,040
the hyperandrogen, the obesity, the higher insulin levels, insulin resistance, and lower levels of

534
00:50:54,040 --> 00:51:00,520
sexual rebinding globulin do appear to have a causal relationship with PCOS based on genetics.

535
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:06,440
And so it may be that these are the mediating factors that link PCOS with future cardiovascular

536
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,920
disease risk. Obviously there's an enormous impact on fertility. Are multiple pregnancies

537
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,040
associated with an increased risk of ASCVD or decreased risk based on the estrogen? PCOS

538
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:23,000
is associated with infertility, and this is one of the mainstay of treatment of women PCOS who are

539
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,640
not wanting to become pregnant, of course, is oral contraceptives to kind of reduce the

540
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:35,160
hyperandrogenism. We recently published, though, a study looking at national data of pregnancies

541
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:40,760
at delivery, and we did show that women, you know, with PCOS who did become pregnant, you know, they

542
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:46,760
were at greater risk for preeclampsia and many gestational diabetes and many cardiovascular

543
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,360
complications compared to women with PCOS. So it's important to, you know, note that not only are

544
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,080
they at increased risk, have decreased fertility and trouble getting pregnant, but once they do

545
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:02,680
become pregnant, they are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications and delivery.

546
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,960
So it's really important with PCOS, again, that we optimize healthier lifestyle and weight

547
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,720
management may be really important to mitigate some of the cardiometabolic risk. I'm interested,

548
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,440
you know, in women who are not trying to become pregnant or not pregnant, GLP1 receptor agonists

549
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,680
may be promising to help with the weight management and the insulin resistance, you know,

550
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,920
we talked about that class of drugs, and even statin therapy may reduce some of the testosterone

551
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:35,000
or the androgen associated risk. So that's what PCOS, but I think that you asked about parity in

552
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,720
general. So when you look at parity or the number of live births, there does seem to be a J point,

553
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,880
J shape relationship with higher parity, particularly more than four or five live births,

554
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,920
being associated with subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease. The reason for this

555
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:59,080
is not quite known. I showed in the MESA study that women who had a histogram multiparty, you know,

556
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,840
were much more likely to be in poor cardiovascular health later in life, middle aged, older age,

557
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:11,160
compared to less parous women. You know, women tend to gain weight with each pregnancy,

558
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,480
but there may be also dysregulation of adipokines that sets the stage for later

559
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,440
cardiometabolic complications. And so this is why it's really important that we try to optimize

560
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:28,920
women's cardiometabolic health before pregnancy and enter pregnancy between pregnancies to try

561
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,120
to prevent these long term complications. So I mean, I wouldn't tell a woman that they can't

562
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:39,080
become pregnant a certain number of times, but I would really try to work with them to try to

563
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,840
optimize their cardiometabolic health. I feel like your intuition is right there,

564
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:49,480
Aaron. I've always found the epidemiology on number of pregnancies and disease X to be

565
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:55,640
completely full of confounders, such to the point that I think the epi provides no insight.

566
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,600
Whereas I think the confounder you mentioned is the most obvious one, right? Which is the more

567
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:06,680
pregnancies a woman has, the more likely you could believe that she's having difficulty getting back

568
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:12,520
to her pre never pregnant state of metabolic health, not just weight, but overall metabolic

569
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:17,720
health. And that would strike me as a greater risk factor. Again, I, one can't know this without

570
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,960
randomization. We're obviously not going to have that. So it probably shouldn't factor into

571
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,880
decision making. I will mention that there are a couple of studies. So the problem is most

572
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,840
epidemiology studies don't ask men the parody history. They don't ask men these questions,

573
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,760
you know, they only ask them of women, but there were a couple of studies where they assess

574
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:40,680
number of children and men and parody is actually a risk factor for CBD and men too.

575
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:48,040
So this likely gets to your point about compounding by social economic factors and cultural factors,

576
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,200
education factors that might lead a family to have more children rather than less. But the risk does

577
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,640
seem to be a little greater in women suggesting that there may be some true biological effects,

578
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,760
maybe weight mediated beyond just confounding my social economic and cultural factors.

579
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:10,280
Let's talk about the impact of oral contraceptives, even outside of the case of PCOS. So if you have

580
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:16,280
a young woman who wants to use OCs as a form of birth control, what is the impact that that,

581
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,840
if any, has on her lifelong risk of a CVD via the, let's just say she's going to go on it for a

582
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:29,800
decade, age 25 to 35, and then have kids 35 to 40, and then goes through menopause at 50.

583
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:35,880
Is there some impact that that decade being on an OCP has on her down the line?

584
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,800
You know, women of reproductive age may be initiated on contraception for various reasons.

585
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:48,360
So it's not just pregnancy prevention, but maybe for treatment of menstrual cycle disorders, PCOS,

586
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,960
acne, there's lots of reasons why they might start oral contraceptive therapy.

587
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,640
The risk likely depends so much based on formulation and type. So we can't link

588
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:07,800
all contraceptives in one bin. Oral combined hormonal contraceptives, the older formulations

589
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,720
had much higher doses of estrogen. And so estrogen can increase triglyceride levels.

590
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,960
It can lower LDL, which is a good thing, but it can increase triglyceride levels.

591
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:24,440
What's the net effect, Aaron, on ApoB? Because certainly the analysis I've seen suggest that

592
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,320
once you correct for ApoB, triglycerides below 400 milligrams per deciliter really don't mean

593
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,560
anything. Obviously above that level, you have to start worrying about pancreatitis, but that

594
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,560
ApoB was capturing that risk. And it's interesting, of course, if you're only looking at LDL-C and

595
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:44,040
triglyceride, it's possible that a rise in triglyceride is problematic because that could

596
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:50,200
actually raise ApoB as you now have to obviously increase the potential number of both cholesterol

597
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,120
and triglyceride trafficking particles. I'm guessing that analysis isn't done, but do you

598
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,240
have an intuition around it? No, I mean, of course, pregnancy also increases triglyceride levels a lot

599
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,520
too, as we'll talk about. So preventing an unwanted pregnancy outweighs any slight change,

600
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,720
risk for these lipid changes with oral combined contraceptives. I think the changes are relatively

601
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:16,760
modest, especially since we're using typically now the lower estrogen formulations because it's

602
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,960
really the more estrogen that a combined hormonal contraceptive contains has the greater impact of

603
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,400
increased triglycerides. So I don't have that number for you because it really depends on the

604
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:32,520
formulation. It's unlikely to have much impact in most women, but women who already have high

605
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:39,240
baseline triglycerides to begin with, it can trigger severe hypertaglyceridemia above 500.

606
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:45,080
So this probably would not be the agent you'd want to use if your patient already had high

607
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:51,960
triglycerides. Now, the transdermal combined oral hormonal contraceptives, the patch, is less likely

608
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,480
to cause clinically relevant elevations and triglycerides. There's, of course, other types

609
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:03,160
of contraceptives, and very high risk women with established cardiovascular disease or women who

610
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:10,280
have FH, who have very high LDL levels. These tier one methods, the long acting reversible methods

611
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:16,040
like the IUD and the implant are safe and effective for most women who even have high

612
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:22,840
risk, who have established cardiovascular conditions. The progesterone based ones like the

613
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:31,720
Marina with the progesterone releasing IUD system, they can marginally, associated with lower HDL,

614
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:38,600
but usually these revert back to pre-insertion levels by one year. Most of the time for the IUDs,

615
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:44,520
the triglycerides and LDL and the cholesterol ratios remain pretty stable. So I really don't

616
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:50,840
think that the lipid changes are so much impacted by that, and that's why we do tend to recommend

617
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,760
the IUD for women who have FH or cardiovascular disease that are high at risk.

618
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,680
Let's talk a little bit about pregnancy. I guess there's two things I want to chat about. The first

619
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,880
is obviously what's happening to a woman during pregnancy. So probably share a little bit more

620
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,680
than my wife wishes I would, but I sort of use myself and my wife as a guinea pig from time to

621
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,640
time and just love checking labs all the time. During, I don't know, one of the pregnancies,

622
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,520
maybe it was our second child, I probably checked her, you know, did a very thorough

623
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,520
look at her lipids and lipoproteins and everything all the way through her pregnancy.

624
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,960
I was shocked at how much her lipids rose during pregnancy. My wife is sort of one of those people

625
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:37,400
who genetically has very low burden of APO B. So her baseline LDL cholesterol is probably 60 to 70

626
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,720
milligrams per deciliter or HDL cholesterol might be 80, 90 milligrams per deciliter. So triglycerides

627
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,360
of 40 milligrams per deciliter, right? So from a lipid lipoprotein standpoint, she's pretty

628
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:53,800
uninteresting. And I want to say by the third end of second, beginning of third trimester,

629
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,880
you know, she looked like she had metabolic syndrome without the triglycerides. But just

630
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,600
from the standpoint of some of the other stuff, tell me what, and I know we hate talking about

631
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:07,480
averages, but can you give me just sort of a general sense of what's directionally happening

632
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,440
to a woman during pregnancy with respect to her lipids and lipoproteins?

633
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,680
Yeah, so absolutely, there's changes in lipid panel, which is why women with known lipid

634
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,960
disorders are recommended to have consultation with a lipid specialist prior to pregnancy.

635
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:28,040
But you know, even at normal pregnancies, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol,

636
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:35,320
lipoprotein A and HDL cholesterol levels all gradually increase. And as pregnancy proceeds,

637
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:41,160
you know, they peak during the third trimester. So you can have about a 25 to 50% increase in total

638
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:47,240
cholesterol can be as much as 150 to 300% increase in triglycerides, probably, you know, relative

639
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:55,560
increase the most, and LDL increased by 66%. And so this is normal physiologic changes because

640
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:01,320
it's designed to promote accumulation of maternal fat stores, that's going to be a source of calories

641
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,280
for the mother and the fetus during later stages of pregnancy and lactation. You know,

642
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:12,360
the cholesterol increase is needed for utero placental vascularization, placental steroid

643
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:18,920
synthesis, placental transport function. These are important physiological effects. But these

644
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,480
changes when someone like your wife who started out, so it's such low cholesterol levels,

645
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:28,600
these are generally felt to be non-athrogenic because they really do fall precipitatively to

646
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,840
pre pregnancy levels following delivery. So pregnancy is not a good time really to get a

647
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:39,800
baseline lipid panel because it's not going to be representative of what a woman's typical lipid

648
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:46,120
panel is. But in women who have concern for lipid disorder, having a baseline lipid panel before

649
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:52,600
pregnancy is helpful so that you can know what to expect. In women with FH, you know, they have the

650
01:01:52,600 --> 01:02:00,520
same relative increases, but they're starting with such a high baseline level that the magnitude of

651
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:06,040
elevation is even greater. You know, I realize I've been delinquent in letting us talk shop a

652
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,080
bit too much. We haven't defined FH other than to note that it's familial hypercholesterolemia.

653
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:16,520
We also noted, I think the incidence or prevalence of about 1 in 200, but we've been a bit delinquent

654
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:22,200
in giving people the magnitude of what it is. Can you just tell folks a little bit about how high

655
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,760
a total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia typically has

656
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:33,080
and what the lifetime risk of AOCVD is in that population? I think we mentioned at the beginning

657
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:39,080
that it's about 1 in 250, 1 in 250 people have FH and it's being autosomal dominant that women are

658
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:47,800
equally affected as men. So the FH phenotype LDL above 190, you know, there are different scoring

659
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:54,280
systems that you can look with additional criteria based on family, personal family history of AOCVD

660
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,280
and genetic tests are available when there's apps that you can download to determine the

661
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:04,040
likelihood that your patient has, you know, a definite or probable FH. Just even having the

662
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:10,920
phenotype of having an LDL above 190, which is not all monogenic FH, that is still associated

663
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:18,200
with increased lifetime risk with a 20 to 30 year earlier onset of AOCVD in females. But if they have

664
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:26,680
the genetic mutation, you know, having the monogenic mutation, their increased risk is even greater than

665
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:34,280
their LDL value. So that's why genetic testing is really helpful, not only for cascade effects for

666
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,280
determining the risk of their first degree relatives and their offspring, but also because

667
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:45,000
they have a greater risk even beyond their absolute LDL value. But so 30% of women with an untreated

668
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,400
FH will have a mild cardiomyfarction before the age of 60. And this is why it's so important that

669
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:55,400
we can't ignore FH. We need to know FH, we need to screen for FH and we need to treat FH. Women

670
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,320
get the same onset as men, they don't have the female advantage. And probably because they're

671
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:05,480
losing many years of statin therapy, because this concern about pregnancy, women with FH are

672
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:11,000
undertreated. I should note that women with FH don't have an increased risk of congenital

673
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,600
malformations or pre-clampsia, which is good. They may have a slight increased risk, greater risk

674
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,720
from aacronal infarction. So we can talk about shared decision making about treatment during

675
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:27,800
pregnancy versus withholding for a short period of time during pregnancy and lactation. But

676
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:33,480
interestingly, in some countries, you can actually test for the mutation in cord blood and lipid

677
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:38,520
levels in children with FH are similar, whether they inherited the gene from their mother or the

678
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:45,640
father. But for contraception, because of their increased risk for atherosclerosis, we would want

679
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:53,480
to avoid any higher estrogen compounds, either use low dose estrogen, oral contraceptives, or preferably

680
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:59,160
IUDs or barrier techniques, especially if they're over the age of 35 to kind of avoid the estrogen

681
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:05,720
oral agents, even low dose and consider the IUD for contraception. So of course, most people with

682
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:10,840
FH, we don't really know the genetic cause of this. You know, last I checked, there were probably

683
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:16,520
more than 2,500 different genetic mutations that produce that phenotype. So this is an interesting

684
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:20,600
point that there's still value in looking. In other words, just having that phenotype,

685
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:26,920
how many of the genetic drivers of FH do we know and contribute to that very interesting point you

686
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:32,120
made, which is identifying that specific genetic driver carries with it even greater risk than is

687
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,400
embedded within the LDL. When I see patients clinically for evaluation of FH, I do send them,

688
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:43,080
they're willing for genetic testing, trying to discern whether they have the monogenic FH

689
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:50,520
from a mutation in the LDL receptor or APOB or PCSK9. Of course, polygenetic risk can have a similar

690
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:57,480
phenotype to FH. We certainly want to reduce their lipids. So this comes up, because we were talking

691
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:05,000
about pregnancy and there had been so concerned for so long about avoiding statins in pregnancy.

692
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,960
For a while, I had that category X. And so this actually led to overabundance of caution with just

693
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:17,640
not treating women of reproductive age with statins at all because of fear that they might

694
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,840
accidentally become pregnant. And we really, of course, do them a disservice of a third of them

695
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:27,080
are going to be at risk for an MI before the age of 60 if they have FH and we don't treat, especially

696
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:33,960
because now we have more data suggesting studies of women who did become pregnant while on statins

697
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:40,520
that did not show the teratogenic effects. And so statins are probably not teratogenic.

698
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,040
You know, we don't have a ton of data here, which is why we still have some caution, which

699
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,960
most women who are planning a pregnancy, you know, we do generally still stop the statins

700
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:59,320
during conception, during pregnancy, and during breastfeeding as shorter term interruptions

701
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,280
is better than, you know, not treating them for decades and decades. But with the removal of the

702
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:10,600
frongus warning label by the FDA, this does give us some more flexible options. So in patients at

703
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:16,120
very high risk, such as women who've had a recent acute coronary syndrome, as part of shared

704
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:22,200
decision making, we could consider using statins during pregnancy. But you know, we still have

705
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,560
less data. So for most women, we're still stopping the statins. But if they do become pregnant, you

706
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:33,240
know, I usually reassure them and we just stop the statin once pregnancy has become aware. But I think

707
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:38,520
there's a really interesting body of work now about whether statins can actually prevent

708
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:44,680
preeclampsia. So in the setting of preeclampsia, there is this abnormal trophoblast invasion,

709
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:50,280
and this leads to impaired spiral artery remodeling. So essentially what's happening

710
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:56,200
is there's placenta ischemia, and this sets off a whole cascade of adverse hormonal and

711
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:02,360
anti-inflammatory markers. So we have this increase in S-flip 1 and a decrease in placental

712
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:08,600
growth factor. There's, you know, this increased sensitivity to angiotension 2. There's other

713
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:15,080
inflammatory and oxidative stress. And this sets the stage not only for complications during the

714
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:20,680
pregnancy like preeclampsia, but also is likely contributing to vascular damage that increase

715
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:26,600
a woman's risk, you know, long-term after delivery. So statins are being, you know, investigated for

716
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,480
preeclampsia prevention because we know in animal studies, they can decrease S-flip 1,

717
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:36,440
they can improve endothelial function, they can decrease inflammation and oxidative stress.

718
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:43,400
So they seem promising. There was one study that was published where they gave women who were

719
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:49,320
pregnant who are increased risk of preeclampsia, paravastatin starting at 35 weeks gestation

720
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:54,280
and didn't show any benefit in preventing preeclampsia. But this isn't really surprising

721
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:58,840
because it was just given way too late. You know, if you know anything about the pathogenesis of

722
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:04,200
preeclampsia, you know, preeclampsia can generally start after 20 weeks of gestation. So you likely

723
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:09,160
would have to intervene, you know, much earlier in the process. So there is a randomized clinical

724
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:14,520
trial ongoing now enrolling about 1,500 women who are high risk because of a prior history of

725
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:21,240
preeclampsia. And they're starting the statin, paravastatin versus placebo earlier around 12

726
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:26,840
weeks of gestation. So right after the first trimester, the primary outcome is going to be

727
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:31,720
proportion that develop preeclampsia or retinal loss and maternal death. And they're looking at

728
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,280
other things like preterm delivery. So it'll be really interesting to see those results. We don't

729
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:42,520
have those results yet, but it may be a whole pendulum switch from this absolute avoidance

730
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:48,840
of statins during pregnancy to maybe actually using statins for preeclampsia prevention if

731
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:54,520
this trial is successful. Do you think broadly we're seeing a greater trend towards statin?

732
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:59,560
I don't know, phobia for lack of a better word. Well, yes, even in sort of the non-pregnant state.

733
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,080
I meant even more broad. Yeah, exactly. I meant just across all of your patients.

734
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,960
First of all, I think there's some misconceptions out there that I still hear people cite this

735
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:15,080
false statement that statins don't work in women in primary prevention. And that's completely not

736
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:20,520
true. In the older studies, they just didn't enroll enough women in trials. And in primary

737
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,160
prevention, they're at lower risk, so they're less likely to have events during the short

738
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:31,320
terms of the trials. But now we have enough trials, the data's in, and meta-analysis that included

739
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:38,760
over 18 randomized clinical trials, over 40,000 women have shown that statins benefit women in

740
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:44,360
both primary and secondary prevention without interaction by sex. So meaning in similar risk

741
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,640
individuals, women benefit from statins just as much as men in both primary prevention,

742
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:55,080
where there was a 15% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, as well as for every one

743
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:00,360
millimole per liter or 39 milligrams per deciliter lowering of LDL. And in secondary prevention,

744
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:05,400
at a little bit greater, 22% reduction, as well as all cause mortality was lower in women with

745
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:11,880
statins. So women benefit from statins. What's the NNT on both of those, Erin? I would have to

746
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,800
get back to you from the meta-analysis, I don't know offhand, but of course, the NNT is going to

747
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,120
depend on primary prevention versus secondary prevention. And of course, the women that were

748
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,600
enrolled in these trials were at higher risk. But the important thing is that they benefited

749
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:30,040
similarly to men with no effect interaction. That's what I was kind of getting at. Was it

750
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:36,200
in the ballpark of men where your primary preventions could be anywhere from 60 to 100,

751
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:42,360
and your secondary preventions might be 30 to 50? Does that sort of... Those numbers kind of ring a

752
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:47,400
bell to me. That sounds about right. I just don't have that data right in front of me, but that

753
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,280
sounds about right. I can look that up for you. But despite the evidence clearly showing that they

754
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,480
benefit, to get back to your original question, women are less likely to be offered a statin.

755
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,800
We saw this from the Palm Registry. And if offered, women are more likely to decline or

756
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:07,960
discontinue. In the usage registry, women were 30 to 50% more likely to report statin-associated

757
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:14,360
muscle symptoms and stop statins for this reason. Even in secondary prevention, studies of individuals

758
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:20,680
who have post-mile cardiomyfarction, young women under the age of 55 were significantly less likely

759
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,520
than men to be on a statin two months after their MI. And these are the highest risk individuals,

760
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,080
the recent MI, and women are still less likely to be on a statin. One of my own studies,

761
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:35,800
using nationally representative data from the medical expenditure panel survey,

762
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:41,400
it's weighted to represent US adults with ASCBD. So it's weighted to represent 11 million women

763
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:47,240
with ASCBD. Women were 45% less likely to be treated on a statin than with men. So we know

764
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:53,480
there's lots of... And Aaron, how much of that do you think is on the shoulders of the physician

765
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:58,040
for either being ignorant or just, I guess, ignorant would be the only excuse,

766
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:03,560
not offering the statin versus how often is the physician doing the right thing and the patient,

767
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,720
as a woman specifically, is saying, you know what, this is not the right thing for me?

768
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,840
So the Palm Registry shows women are less likely to be offered. And so this is on the physician

769
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:19,880
side. We see this across all kinds of subgroups, both in primary prevention, secondary prevention,

770
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:25,480
and also whether they're treated by a cardiologist or primary care, women are less likely to be

771
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:30,440
on a statin. But if offered, if the clinicians do the right thing and offer, women are more likely

772
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:36,600
to decline or discontinue. This is a combination of things. Women may still perceive themselves

773
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:43,560
to be lower risk. Women may be more fear adverse. They also, women are report more likely to have

774
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:49,720
statin-associated muscle symptoms. And so this gets down to how much is real versus the nocebo effect.

775
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:55,000
Is it biological differences related to women's smaller body size,

776
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:01,960
influenza hormones, or is it that maybe women are more socialized to report symptoms or

777
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:08,840
read these warning labels or a possible symptom that could happen or be more concerned? I mean,

778
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:15,240
we have overwhelming data about the safety of statins. Serious muscle injury is one in 100,000.

779
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,920
In randomized clinical trials, there's no difference of muscle symptoms between treated

780
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:25,160
and placebo. We know in real world practice, up to 30% of statin-treated patients report

781
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:31,240
muscle symptoms. So there's this tremendous nocebo effect in trials like the SAMHSA trial,

782
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:37,560
up to 90% of statin-associated symptoms was elicited by the placebo too. So patients were

783
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:42,760
having symptoms on the statins, but 90% of those symptoms were also elicited on the placebo. So it

784
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:48,600
really wasn't as more the act of taking the medication compared to the medication itself.

785
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:54,600
So we know the nocebo effect is real, but the problem is that this can be challenging to

786
01:14:54,600 --> 01:15:00,280
counsel. There's a lot of medical misinformation out there. And when an individual, the symptoms

787
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:06,200
are real to them, and if they're convinced they're having these symptoms, it can be hard to break

788
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:11,560
that mindset. My practice is all about building trust and we build a relationship over time. And

789
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:17,560
sometimes I start slow or do alternative doses every other day or three times a week and trying

790
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:22,600
to get individuals back on their statin and show that they tolerate them and have them take a muscle

791
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,120
symptom survey and show that a lot of the aches and pains that they have, you know,

792
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:31,160
were unrelated to the statin. But the good news at least is that we're releasing an error

793
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:36,440
that we have more options than we did before. Though all individuals who have report statin

794
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,080
associated muscle symptoms or statin intolerance, you know, really should be given a re-challenge

795
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,720
for our highest risk patients. We have other things. Zetimine, we have the PCSK9 inhibitors,

796
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:53,160
we have clizarin, mepidobic acid, and more things in the pipeline. So we have ways to get to LDL goal

797
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:58,120
if patients are willing to work with us. And, you know, while these other therapies are meant to be

798
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:04,120
as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle and maximally tolerated statins, for some patients, the maximally

799
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:09,640
tolerated statin is zero statin. And so sometimes we have to move to some of these other agents to

800
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:16,200
get their LDL under control. Aaron, what's your statin workflow? How do you work through a patient

801
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:23,000
with a statin? So my behavior on this front has evolved a little bit in part just due to experience,

802
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,600
but also in part due to the arrival of these other agents that you mentioned, the big three being

803
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:33,800
zetimide, PCSK9 inhibitors, and most recently, pepidobic acid. But these days I really find myself

804
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:38,920
only fiddling with about three statins truthfully. And this excludes patients who show up on one

805
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,560
already that they inherit. So a torvostatin or something like that. But in terms of a naive

806
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:49,160
patient, I would say it's really mostly two. It's really resuvastatin and then pitavastatin with

807
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:54,440
occasional pravastatin. You can imagine obviously the order in which we do that based on symptoms

808
01:16:54,440 --> 01:17:02,040
and need. Walk me through your thinking specifically for women. So woman comes in, doesn't have FH,

809
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:09,400
family history is notable for atherosclerosis, but nothing incredibly premature before the age

810
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:18,840
of 60. Her APO B is the 70th percentile concordant with her LDL C. And after months of being your

811
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:25,960
patient, she says, you know, okay, I sort of buy this thesis, which is I'm 40 years old, my LDL is

812
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,800
only going to go up from here. So let's start to take preventative measurements. So this is

813
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:37,080
true primary prevention in a relatively low 10 year risk patient. And you have no reason to

814
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,720
be concerned with anything else. So what's your first line agent? What dose and how do you proceed

815
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:46,040
if there was issues? The highest risk patients, we'll get back to your primary prevention patients,

816
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:51,160
highest risk patients with ASCVD, you know, we want to get as low as possible as quickly as

817
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:56,840
possible, lower for longer for faster. And so we do a lot of disservice by starting these really

818
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,760
low dose statins, and they don't come back for six months to a year, and then they never get

819
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:05,640
intensified and patients don't get to goal. So in the highest risk patients, starting with a high

820
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,560
intensity statin, if you start up front, that's more likely the dose that they'll stay on,

821
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:15,720
and use of combination therapy early. So you know, just like blood pressure, if it's above 160,

822
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:19,720
you know, we're thinking combination therapy for blood pressure. And I have the same approach

823
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:25,800
really for lipids, or very high risk patients, such as the ones with a recent coronary syndrome,

824
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,360
that you know, we know what their starting LDL is and where we want to go. And I always try to aim

825
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:36,040
for at least less than 55 optimal LDL is probably, you know, around 30 or lower these patients,

826
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:41,320
you know, if where you need to go high intensity statins will lower the LDL by about 50%. But if

827
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:46,840
you need a greater reduction, thinking about combination therapy up early, we have some data

828
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:52,440
now about the safety of giving PCSQ9 inhibitors even in the hospital setting after an acute

829
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:58,200
myocardial infarction can have important changes in plaque stabilization and plaque reduction. So

830
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,520
being very intensive about those treatments. I want to make the plug about using combination

831
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:08,360
earlier and more aggressively. And your lower risk primary prevention patient that you started with,

832
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:13,880
the modern intensity statin would be fine. I mean, it depends on their age. If it's a man over 40 or

833
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,840
women over 50, get a coronary calcium score. You know, if they're above the 75th percentile,

834
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:25,800
also thinking high intensity statin and aiming for an LDL less than 70, which is also consideration

835
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,480
of PCSQ9 inhibitors, even in primary prevention patients, if they have significant plaque,

836
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:37,400
you know, very high calcium scores above 300. But you know, in a lower risk person where we're just

837
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,480
trying to shift them some lower. And sorry, just going back to that, Aaron, I know it wasn't my

838
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,440
question, but since you brought it up, is your preferred two line out of the gate,

839
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:51,240
resouvastatin and azetamide? Is that your typical starting one, two punch?

840
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:56,920
I mean, again, it depends where they are and where we start with. They're very high risk. They have

841
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:02,040
ASCVD and they're very high risk. You're going to go PCSQ9 plus. Yeah, especially if they have

842
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:07,800
elevated liporatidyl A because statins, azetamide, bimpedoic acid don't lower liporatyl A. So if they

843
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:14,760
had an ASCVD event, it used to be to get the PCSQ9 and prove that you had a beyond statin and azetamide

844
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,400
before you could get the PCSQ9 approved. So I used to use both just knowing that I'm going to move

845
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:24,280
to PCSQ9. Now it's a little bit easier to get the PCSQ9 approved, even if you don't have azetamide

846
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:29,880
on board. So these very high risk patients, because azetamide, you know, you can lower LDL

847
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:35,320
by about, you know, 16 milligram per deciliter, but you want to really get the LDL way down in

848
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:40,600
these very high risk patients. I'm moving pretty quickly to PCSQ9 inhibitors, but in lower risk.

849
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,760
Do you have a preference by the way between Praglutin and Rapatha?

850
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:49,240
You know, so they were never compared head to head. So they have a lock a map and all

851
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:55,480
rock a map had a similar 15% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in their respective

852
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:01,080
trials, the four year at Odyssey trials, and they had similar reduction of liporatidyl A as well.

853
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:06,200
I tend to use, I mean, I use whatever one I can get approved. So it often depends on the patient's

854
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:11,400
insurance. Mostly if all things being equal, either one being approved, I probably tend to

855
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,760
use more of a lock a map because you don't have to do the dose adjustment. The short click pattern

856
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:22,120
is really easy. We have our nurse and our clinic teaches patients and I have lots of patients on

857
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:28,200
all rock a map as well. Closer in, you know, we're just starting getting experience with onboarding.

858
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:34,040
Tell folks what that is. So the PCSQ9 inhibitors that we were talking about, the eva lock a map

859
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:42,840
and all rock a map are monoclonal antibodies. So PCSQ9 is a hepatic protein that's involved with

860
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:48,600
LDL receptor degradation. And this was really interesting how quickly we moved from understanding

861
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,600
from genetic studies, all the way to translational studies and the bedside, you know, we know that

862
01:21:54,600 --> 01:22:04,040
individuals with PCSQ9 genetic mutations that were loss of function, these individuals had very

863
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,880
low LDLs and very low risk of cardiovascular disease of a lifetime, were gain of function

864
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:18,920
PCSQ9 at high LDLs and increased CBD risk. So by inhibiting this protein, by inhibiting the PCSQ9,

865
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:25,240
it prevents the LDL receptor degradation so that there is an upper regulation of LDL receptors on

866
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:31,720
the surface of the hepatocyte, which leads to greater clearance of LDL out of circulation.

867
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:37,800
Those were the monoclonal antibodies and we have not only do they lower LDL by about 50 to 60%,

868
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:44,840
they also have some modest lipo-bertal A lowering around 25%. But we have two outcome trials,

869
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:49,880
Fourier and Odyssey, Fourier being in stable ASCVD and Odyssey in patients with recent acute

870
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:54,760
coronary syndrome that show that they also reduce major adverse cardiovascular events,

871
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:01,480
as we would anticipate. And we now have longer term data for follow up, which shows even after

872
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:09,400
these trials end that earlier exposure to a Velocimab to exposure to a lower LDL has a legacy

873
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,120
effect with continued lower risk of events. So I think that the trials were pretty short,

874
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,880
around two years and the curves were just starting to separate. So I think with longer

875
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,480
treatment, you would have had even a greater reduction. As we're talking about women,

876
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:27,160
I will just mention, unfortunately, both of these trials, women were only about 25% of participants.

877
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:34,200
Women start out with higher LDLs for various reasons. After menopause, women tend to have

878
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:41,320
higher LDLs compared to men, but that they had a similar reduction in LDL with PCSQ9 inhibitor

879
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:48,440
therapy. In terms of mace reduction, there was no interaction by sex, meaning that women benefited,

880
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,360
these high risk women who either have ASCVD or recent acute coronary syndrome,

881
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:57,640
benefited to a similar degree as men did. There was no major adverse event difference between

882
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:02,040
the sexes, although women are more likely to report injection site reactions. So those have

883
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:07,240
been available for a while and they're in the guidelines now as an add on to statins in high

884
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:12,840
risk patients with ASCVD or heterozygous FH who need additional LDL lowering. I also use them in

885
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,440
high risk primary prevention, such as those with high calcium scores who need LDL lowering. But

886
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:24,760
in closer is the new kid on the block. So this inhibits PCSQ9, but through a different mechanism.

887
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:33,400
It's a small interfering RNA, so it prevents the translation of the PCSQ9 protein from being made.

888
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:42,120
We have data from the Orion 9, 10, and 11 trials, which was looking at LDL lowering,

889
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:47,720
showing that, again, women had higher LDLs at baseline, but they had similar reduction

890
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:52,920
within closer in. Notably, the mechanism of this little difference is that it's a subcutaneous

891
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:58,200
injection, but after the first baseline in three months, it's given every six months. So it's

892
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:03,160
designed to be given in a clinic setting as opposed to the monoclonal antibodies, which people give it

893
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:09,400
home. And the frequency of every six months may be attractive for adherence because you give it in

894
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:16,440
the clinic only one more time a year than a flu shot, and you can lower LDL by about 50%. So it

895
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:23,000
may be helpful for adherence. It has been approved for LDL lowering, and we're starting to onboard it

896
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,600
throughout the country in our clinics. But it should be noted that we don't yet have the outcome data.

897
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:36,280
The Orion 4 is the cardiovascular outcome trial that's ongoing. I anticipate with a 50% reduction

898
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:41,320
in LDL that this will certainly translate into a reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events,

899
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:46,680
but we don't have that data yet. But these are all potential options for patients that need

900
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:53,400
more intensive LDL lowering. You can also mention bempedoic acid to round out the new drugs that are

901
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:58,200
available. This one also might be interesting in women. So bempedoic acid is an oral drug,

902
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:05,880
and so it blocks ATP citrase lyase, which is an enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. So

903
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:11,560
it's upstream of HMG-Coase reductase, which statins inhibit. Kind of works like in the pathway where

904
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:17,240
statins work, where it blocks cholesterol synthesis. And so by blocking cholesterol synthesis, this

905
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:23,080
leads to upregulation of the LDL receptor on the surface of the liver and more clearance of LDL

906
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:28,520
out of circulation. But what's notable about this is that prodrug, the enzyme to activate it,

907
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:35,320
it's only in the liver, not in the muscle. So it does not have the same reported muscle symptoms

908
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:40,920
that have been seen with statins. And also interestingly, it doesn't seem to have the

909
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:46,840
risk of new onset diabetes or the increase in glucose that we see with high intensity statins.

910
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:53,640
So alone, bempedoic acid lowers LDL about 18%. So kind of in your range of azetamide,

911
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,520
a little bit more lowering if it's used as monotherapy without statins, about 21% in statin

912
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:06,200
intolerant patients. It does come as a fixed dose combination with azetamide. And together with

913
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:12,120
azetamide, you see kind of greater, about 36% reduction in LDL. So you're kind of getting in

914
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:17,720
the range of your moderate to high intensity statins. Notably actually in pooled analyses

915
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:23,880
from the clear studies, which were the studies looking at the LDL lowering effects of bempedoic

916
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:30,040
acid, we see that in ASEVD and FH patients that women seem to actually have a little bit even

917
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:35,960
greater LDL lowering with bempedoic acid than men. And they were more likely to achieve a 30%

918
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:41,080
reduction in LDL with bempedoic acid than men. Since women are more likely to have statin

919
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:46,360
associated muscle symptoms, and this agent doesn't cause that, this may be a good choice

920
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:52,440
as an oral therapy for women who can't get their LDL control on a statin or don't tolerate a statin.

921
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,880
So just for the audience, we don't have outcome data yet for this either. It's been approved for

922
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:03,880
LDL lowering, but the big cardiovascular outcome trial clear outcomes enrolled a population with

923
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:09,720
statin intolerance. And I was really pleased that nearly 50% of trial participants were women,

924
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:14,520
likely because women are more likely to have statin tolerance. So this has been closed out

925
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:20,920
and we're anticipating we may hear the results maybe in March of 2023, hopefully.

926
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,760
Is this secondary prevention, Erin? No, this is high risk patients that have statin intolerance.

927
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:31,480
So high risk primary prevention, statin intolerance. Yes. And secondary prevention patients with statin

928
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:37,400
intolerance. I got you completely off topic from our original question, which was low to moderate

929
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:42,520
risk, low to moderate short-term risk. Obviously long-term risk, everybody is high risk. It's

930
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,680
important to say that long time horizon, we're all high risk. Everybody gets atherosclerosis if you

931
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:51,560
live long enough. But we've got our woman whose LDL cholesterol is 130 to 140 milligrams per

932
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:57,960
deciliter and she's in her 30s. She gets it, right? She says, look, nothing's going to happen to me in

933
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,040
the next decade, but I'm playing the long game here. I don't want to have atherosclerosis in my 80s.

934
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,240
What's your algorithm for statin choice out of the gate? I tend to use one of the high intensity

935
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:13,240
statins that can, you know, a bit more potent LDL lowering like a Torva or Resuva. So if they don't

936
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:18,840
have CKD, because it's important to note that Resuva does need to be dose suggested if patients

937
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:22,520
have chronic kidney disease, but assuming, you know, otherwise healthy individuals. Yeah, say she

938
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:27,960
doesn't. I use a lot of Resuva. In my experience, they tend to have a little bit less muscle

939
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:34,920
associated symptoms. Psychologically, the doses, if you do five, 10, 20, you know, patients feel

940
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:39,480
like they're taking a lower dose when compared to the Adorva, you know, 20, 40, 80, you tell

941
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,960
patients you can't compare milligrams from one agent to another agent because they're completely

942
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:49,000
different drugs. People think they're taking lower drugs, so lower doses. So sometimes there's a lot

943
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,440
of buy-in and I have a lot of patients refer to me because if they're a little bit statin reluctant

944
01:29:54,440 --> 01:30:00,920
or statin hesitant. So again, this is all in a background of lifestyle changes, but if they are

945
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:06,920
concerned at all, sometimes I use just Resuva 5. It's more about buying their trust and getting

946
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:11,400
them used to the idea of taking a statin and we know even in statin intolerant patients, even if

947
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:17,400
we do Resuva 5 milligrams, three times a week, we still can have if again LDL lowering compared to

948
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:22,760
no statin at all. So for patients that have been statin intolerant, statin reluctant, just getting

949
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:27,160
them to take a low dose and then seeing a little bit as believing. And so when we got getting their

950
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:33,960
numbers back and making progress, often then we can adjust up there based on how things are going.

951
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,880
You know, high-risk patients, you know, I started the highest dose right out the bat. Sometimes

952
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:44,680
patients kind of check vitamin D and thyroid levels and hit coenzyme q10. There really isn't

953
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:50,280
very good data that coenzyme q10 prevents statin-sociative muscle symptoms, but if my patients

954
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:54,520
want to take that because it makes them feel better with the concept of taking a statin,

955
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:59,320
I don't object to it, but I don't actively prescribe it because it really isn't good data

956
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:04,840
that it really blocks this. The same thing with vitamin D. There really isn't good data that

957
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:10,680
taking a vitamin D supplement can prevent statin-associated muscle symptoms, but many patients,

958
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:15,080
you know, want to take that. And you know, my philosophy is if I could get them on the statin

959
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:19,160
and get their LDL lowering, you know, I'm willing to work with them on some of these other things,

960
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:24,360
really trying to get their buy-in to get them on a therapy that will lower their LDL.

961
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,800
And it's really important that I do refer them to our, we have a preventocardiology

962
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:32,760
nurse who discussed this nutrition because I don't want them to think that I don't value

963
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:37,400
diet and lifestyle. You know, we know that a lot of lipids is predominantly genetically determined,

964
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:42,600
but there is influence in diet. And I want to emphasize to my patients that this is really a

965
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,160
combination approach and that I do take diet and lifestyle, you know, very seriously as well.

966
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:53,800
What type of an impact do you think you can see with manipulating diet, presumably mostly through

967
01:31:54,360 --> 01:32:00,280
the types of fats they're consuming, but more broadly, is there how aggressively can you use

968
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:05,720
dietary manipulation, especially in a woman who for whatever reason, be it pregnancy or just

969
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:11,480
reluctance, is hoping to minimize, if not avoid the use of lipid lowering medication?

970
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:18,040
No, about three fourths or 80% of LDL is synthesized by the liver. So there's, you know,

971
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:23,400
is a strong genetic component. I have lots of patients that are strict vegan and do everything

972
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,760
right. And they still have high cholesterol and they get so frustrated. And I, you know,

973
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:32,440
this is genetically determined. And if they had a bad diet, their numbers would be so much worse.

974
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:37,960
And so it's important to note all the good things that they're doing for the diet, but also

975
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,240
acknowledge that sometimes they're going to need a little help with pharmacotherapy because of the

976
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:47,560
strong genetic determination. But, you know, around the other 20% is influenced by diet. So diet

977
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:53,000
does matter, particularly in younger adults. We're thinking about adolescents in young adults,

978
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,560
you know, especially wanting to start earlier in life. If we can shift everybody a little bit lower

979
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:03,160
in their LDL by following a healthy diet, really, since, you know, early childhood, if we can shift

980
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:09,160
everybody lower on LDL, this will reduce the total burden of years with LDL elevation. So, you know,

981
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:14,760
we counsel about reduction in saturated fats and focusing on the healthier fats, the polyunsaturated

982
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:21,880
and the monounsaturated fats, increasing fiber, fruits, vegetables, whole grains into their diet,

983
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:27,400
really trying to avoid processed foods, which are the worst, especially processed meats.

984
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,840
There's some patients that have already have a CBD and they don't want to take a medicine. And,

985
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:37,480
you know, at this point, it's like too late, you know, diets important, but you already have plaque

986
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,760
in your arteries, you're pretty far along in the process. And we need to do everything to

987
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:48,520
prevent further progression and even reverse. And we know from, you know, the IBIS studies that

988
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:55,080
high intensity statins and significant LDL lowering can cause atheroma volume regression.

989
01:33:55,080 --> 01:34:01,800
So it's really a combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes. But for a very low risk

990
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:06,440
young adult, I push as hard as we can with healthier lifestyle changes.

991
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,320
You know, it's sort of funny, I've gone back and forth on this stuff so much,

992
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:14,120
Aaron, and I probably sound like a heretic at the moment, but I just sort of went through and

993
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:21,240
reviewed as many of the Cochrane collaboration meta-analyses as I could sort of stomach on all

994
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:26,200
of the different fatty acid impacts on cardiovascular disease. So if you look at the Cochrane

995
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:31,800
collaboration in 2019, that looks at the role of PUFA's and then the one in 2020 that looks at

996
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:37,800
the SFA substitution with PUFA and MUFA. And if I came away from this with anything, it's that I

997
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:42,360
don't know how much any of that stuff matters once you're in energy balance. In other words,

998
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:48,680
in the context of over-nutrition, I think it all is bad. In the context of adequate nutrition,

999
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:58,440
the ambiguity in these data were enormous. And, you know, I was left basically thinking,

1000
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:05,880
look, on the basis of PREDIMED and the LION heart study, in addition to some epidemiology,

1001
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:12,520
MUFA is probably the most important fatty acid, and therefore, let's just call it 50% of your fat

1002
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:18,840
intake should probably be MUFA. And, you know, probably after that, looks like PUFA is a little

1003
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:25,080
bit better than SFA, but I certainly couldn't find a shred of evidence to suggest that aggressive

1004
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:31,320
restriction of SFA was in any way protective. Now, of course, the opposite, which was you do see

1005
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:36,920
people that are consuming massive amounts of saturated fat and who have incredible hyperbeta

1006
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:43,640
lipoproteinemia, you know, I think that's a clear problem. But, you know, when I think about all of

1007
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:49,000
the lifestyle factors, I wonder if the one that gets the least attention that has the greatest

1008
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:55,480
impact is stress. You know, because we don't have a pill for it. We can offset the harm of

1009
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:02,120
nutrition so much easier with pharmacotherapy. And yet, a person walking around with simmering

1010
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:07,960
hypercordicillemia and the effect that that's having on their endothelium and, you know, their

1011
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:13,080
sympathetic nervous system, I feel like that's the one that I wish we had a better handle on as far

1012
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:17,720
as how to help people. Because again, we don't have a pill right outside of blood pressure

1013
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:21,480
management. We don't really have a pill for that. What are your thoughts on the role of

1014
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:27,320
stress? It's such a dumb buzzword that I hate it, but I really think physiologically it's problematic.

1015
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:33,480
Well, first of all, I didn't say about aggressively low saturated fat diet. The guidelines,

1016
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:38,040
the HAACC guidelines really are talking more of a moderate fat intake diet. And really,

1017
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:42,120
a Mediterranean style pattern, as you alluded to, is what I recommend to my patients. You know,

1018
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:46,520
maybe I'm biased because I'm half Italian, I'm married to a Greek, but we do have both

1019
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:51,720
observational data and clinical trial data. A Mediterranean style diet is pretty palatable,

1020
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:57,240
and it's pretty easy to follow without getting too crazy. And it's, you know, generally low

1021
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:03,080
unsaturated fats and generally higher in the unsaturated fats, lots of fruits and vegetables,

1022
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:08,200
but it's also the Mediterranean lifestyle with increased physical activity, more social

1023
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:12,760
connection and reduced stress. And I'll add in there the importance of physical activity,

1024
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:19,720
although exercise maybe has less impact on lipids per se than diet, it has significant

1025
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:25,160
impact on overall cardiovascular risk with both helping with weight maintenance, but also

1026
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:30,840
increased levels of fitness is being more fit is one of the strongest favorable factors for lower

1027
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:36,200
cardiovascular risk. So I definitely encourage regular physical activity as well. So I do think

1028
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:40,120
mental health is very important that we also address. You can't talk about cardiovascular

1029
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:46,440
health without talking about mental health. And I was a coauthor on the American Heart Association

1030
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:51,640
statement that came out last year about the mind heart body connection. We really talk about

1031
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:57,800
both positive psychological factors and negative psychological factors, both influence cardiovascular

1032
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:04,120
health, both in indirect ways and direct ways. So what do I mean? So in indirect ways, so

1033
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:10,040
individuals with more negative psychological factors like anxiety, stress, depression, anger,

1034
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:15,240
you know, they might be more likely to have poor coping habits, such as they might be eating more

1035
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:21,800
poorly and not getting physical activity and having more smoking or more alcohol intake,

1036
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:27,320
you know, and less follow up with preventive interventions. So sort of the indirect mechanisms

1037
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:32,280
where the positive psychological factors as individuals may be more likely if they have a

1038
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:37,720
sense of purpose and more optimism to be, you know, eat healthy and exercise and take their

1039
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:42,760
medications apart with preventive visits. But there also may be direct mechanisms as well,

1040
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:49,960
that stress leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate, increasing

1041
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:55,720
blood pressure, increasing release of stress hormones like cortisol that can lead to more

1042
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:01,880
insulin resistance, more fat deposition and the visceral cavities, and more low grade chronic

1043
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:07,640
inflammation. And we know that inflammation can also be a trigger for plaque rupture. So I do

1044
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:12,440
think it's important that we think about the whole person and, you know, we can make all these

1045
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:17,480
recommendations about managing their lipids and things, but if we don't take into account some of

1046
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:22,040
the challenges that they have in their personal lives and social determinants of health, you know,

1047
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:27,240
we may not be able to effectively deliver preventive interventions. Completely agree with

1048
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:31,640
everything you said. And sorry, didn't mean to apply that you were suggesting a low saturated

1049
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:35,880
fat diet. I was sort of saying that more just as broadly you kind of hear these extreme views.

1050
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:41,960
I guess what I'm getting at building on what you would say is when I think of the five pillars

1051
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:48,760
through which we can impact a person's health, so nutrition, exercise, sleep, emotional and mental

1052
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:54,520
health and pharmacotherapy, the lowest impact in my view on cardiovascular disease is through

1053
01:39:54,520 --> 01:40:00,120
nutrition. I think the other four trumpet all day, every day and twice on Sundays. I don't even think

1054
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:06,280
it's close. And the reason I mention this and the reason I'm on my soapbox about this is I think

1055
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:11,080
the general public seems to think that nutrition is the most important lever in controlling

1056
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:16,520
cardiovascular disease risk. I see this a lot, right? I see the person who ostensibly is eating

1057
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:22,680
quote unquote, a healthy diet. And yet they still have these biomarkers that are horrible and or

1058
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:27,320
they even have evidence of clinical disease. They have a calcification on their calcium score. They

1059
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:32,200
have soft plaque on their CTA. And they sort of say, but look, doctor, I eat this, I'm on this

1060
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:36,360
diet or that diet and clearly I've got it under control. And I sort of want to say to them, no,

1061
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:40,040
you don't even have it close to under control and your diet's not even remotely helpful at

1062
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:44,920
controlling this. And if it is, it's rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic at this point.

1063
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,920
Those other four things are going to move the needle far more in different amounts,

1064
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:53,000
in different people. There are some people for whom I think the stress thing doesn't play a role.

1065
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,720
And there are other people for whom I think it plays an enormous role. And every time I'm in

1066
01:40:55,720 --> 01:41:00,120
Europe, I come to the same conclusion you do, which is especially in amazing places like Italy,

1067
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:05,400
which is hands down my favorite place in Europe. They're way more active, they eat less,

1068
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:12,760
and they just don't give a damn. Like there's just a sense of it's all okay. They're not so

1069
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:18,840
wound up the way we are. And I think that counts for, I don't know. I think that's 90% of it right

1070
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:23,880
there. Let's shift gears for a second. Let's talk about LP little a it's come up a number of times.

1071
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:28,040
And obviously the listeners on this podcast know the ins and outs of LP little a, we've had a number

1072
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:33,800
of guests talk about it, but we've never spoken about it through two lenses. One is specifically

1073
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:39,240
through the lens of women versus men, anything we need to know. And also I want to now talk about

1074
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:43,560
the role of LP little a you already alluded to it in pregnancy, you know, it is an acute phase

1075
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:47,960
reactant in a way. So you wouldn't surprise me that LP little a goes up during pregnancy,

1076
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:50,600
but I also want to talk about what happens after menopause, if anything.

1077
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,520
Sure. I'll talk about that. And then I do want to talk more about menopause. Cause I think we

1078
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:59,880
talked about menstrual cycles and pre menopause and PCOS and pregnancy. And then we didn't get to

1079
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,280
really dive into menopause. So yes, I want to go back. That's where I want to go next. So yeah,

1080
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:08,200
I want to go from this directly into menopause and then HRT as well, but I wanted to just close

1081
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:14,680
the loop on LP little a so lipoprotein little a. So I know you've talked about this a lot, but just

1082
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:20,600
in case there's any new listeners, I'll just briefly recap. It's an LDL like particle that's

1083
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:26,920
comprised both of an Apo B, which is, you know, Marker, the bad moieties. So it shares protein

1084
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:33,400
with other atherogenic lipoproteins. And then it also has an Apo lipoprotein A moiety. And that's

1085
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:39,720
what distinguished lipoprotein A from LDL. And this Apo A is kind of unique cause it has these

1086
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:45,560
10 subdomains of these Kringle four domains and the Kringle four two can expand two to 40 times.

1087
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:51,720
And so that's leads to a lot of heterogeneity in the population. You know, 80% or more of

1088
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:57,320
individuals actually carry two different isoforms of Apo A, you know, one inherited from each parent.

1089
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:01,400
And so it's important to recognize this heterogeneity in the multiple isoforms. Cause this

1090
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:06,200
accounts for some of the differences in cardiovascular risk that we see by race, ethnicity,

1091
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:11,240
with higher lipoprotein A levels being seen in black and South Asian individuals compared to

1092
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:16,680
white individuals. But in terms of women, there are sex differences. So lipoprotein A

1093
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:22,440
generally is five to 10% higher in women than in men, but there's changes over the life course

1094
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:28,520
where lipoprotein A is relatively constant in men, where in women it tends to increase after menopause.

1095
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:34,440
So it does increase during pregnancy, normal pregnancy between 10 to 35 weeks with about a

1096
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:40,840
doubling of the value during pregnancy. And we think since the levels fall back to their

1097
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:45,960
pre-pregnancy baseline after delivery, that the short increase is probably not atherogenic,

1098
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:51,320
but it does rise during pregnancy. So why don't we care about lipoprotein A? Well,

1099
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:56,200
it's pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic, and it's associated with

1100
01:43:56,200 --> 01:44:00,760
cardiovascular risk. And as likely from Mendelian randomization studies, you know,

1101
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:07,160
causally related to both ASCBD as well as calcific aortic stenosis. And even in individuals

1102
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:13,960
who have LDLs less than 70, like in the Copenhagen general population study, lipoprotein A above 50

1103
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:19,080
milligrams per deciliter is still associated with risk of cardiovascular events. So it's still

1104
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:25,160
associated with risk even when the LDL is low. And you really need to, you know, measure it because,

1105
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:29,880
you know, if you think your LDL is low, you may be missing some residual risk depending on,

1106
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:35,240
you know, whether lipoprotein A is making up a significant component of that. And so Mendelian

1107
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:41,560
randomization studies do suggest that it is causally associated with cardiovascular risk in women,

1108
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:49,000
but the impact of therapies in lower lipoprotein A and what that translates into actually lowering

1109
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:55,160
cardiovascular risk, you know, is a little bit uncertain. And right now we have apheresis for

1110
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:59,160
an option for patients with very high lipoprotein A who have progressive cardiovascular disease.

1111
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:04,280
And we mentioned the monoclonal antibodies of allocumab and alloracumab as well as encloserin

1112
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:10,040
can lower lipoprotein A about 20 to 25%. And it seems that actually in those trials that

1113
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,120
individuals who had the higher lipoprotein A levels actually

1114
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:19,000
derive the greatest benefit from those therapies. So it is something that, you know, if somebody's

1115
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:25,000
elevated lipoprotein A, I kind of think about moving quickly to PCSK9 if they have another

1116
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,200
indication such as elevated LDL. And the reason, you know, why to measure it, we talked about it

1117
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:36,200
being a risk enhancer, but also because of these exciting new therapies that are being studied

1118
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:43,160
right now in trials, the pellicarcin, which is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting lipoprotein A

1119
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:50,840
and opusarin, which is a small interfering RNA also targeting the synthesis of lipoprotein A.

1120
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:56,040
And there's some other ones being studied as well, another small interfering RNA. So we'll have to

1121
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:59,720
see, you know, there's a cardiovascular outcome trial I'm going right now for pellicarcin,

1122
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:06,360
the horizon trial to determine how much does lowering lipoprotein A actually translate into

1123
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:11,640
reduction in MACE. And that one trial is enrolling high risk secondary prevention population with

1124
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:17,480
elevated lipoprotein A. Any concern that we're going to see a rebound increase in LDL with an

1125
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:25,000
antisense oligonucleotide? So when you knock out LP little a, all of those additional LDLs that

1126
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,360
would have been LP little a has just become LPL. So your APO concentration stays the same,

1127
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:35,880
even though you've shifted the distribution from between LP little a and LDL.

1128
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:43,000
I mean, I think this is why we need the trials. So with LDL, there's a pretty linear relationship

1129
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:49,080
that we can anticipate with the degree of LDL lowering, you know, by one millimole per liter or

1130
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:54,360
30 milligrams or deciliter with reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events being 20 to 30%.

1131
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:59,640
And this is why therapies like bempedoic acid and clisarine got approved based on their LDL

1132
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:04,200
lowering properties, even without outcome data, because we have a pretty good sense of what

1133
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:10,600
lowering LDL is associated with reduced events. We really don't have that data for lipoprotein A

1134
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:15,800
other than modeling data. Certainly it's associated with increased risk. But you know,

1135
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:20,520
some modeling data says, you know, you might need to reduce lipoprotein A as much as 50 to 100

1136
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:25,640
milligrams or deciliter to have a meaningful reduction in ASD in the short term. And other

1137
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:32,200
therapies, for example, you know, niacin lowers lipoprotein A, but was not shown to have clinical

1138
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:38,200
benefit in two outcome studies, albeit those studies didn't, you know, enroll based on lipoprotein A.

1139
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:42,120
But you know, we're not using niacin. Same thing with hormone replacement therapy,

1140
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:47,400
estrogen therapy or hormone replacement therapy does lower is associated with lower lipoprotein

1141
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:53,160
A levels. But we're not recommending it for the sole purpose of lipoprotein A because particularly

1142
01:47:53,160 --> 01:48:00,120
in high risk individuals with ASCVD or who multiple risk factors or many years out from

1143
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:04,600
the menopause transition, this therapy has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk.

1144
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:10,360
So, you know, we really need the data. We know that these agents, pelocarcin and

1145
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:16,920
alphacirin can reduce lipoprotein A by, you know, 80 to 90%, which is remarkable considering,

1146
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:21,880
you know, statins, bempedoic acid, azetamide, you know, don't lower it at all. Statins may even

1147
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:27,160
increase it. You know, PCSK9 is only lowered by 25%. So that's remarkable that we now have therapies

1148
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:32,840
that work in terms of lowering lipoprotein A. But what does that mean in terms of vet reduction?

1149
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:38,760
And I think we've been burned from other studies like the CTIP inhibitor and other studies that

1150
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:43,560
biomarker data is sometimes not enough and that you actually have to show that it can meaningfully

1151
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:51,080
actually reduce risk. And so maybe offsetting some of the LDL increase, maybe offset any reduction

1152
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:56,440
in benefit. The other thing I think which warrants further study is in epidemiology studies of very

1153
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:01,640
low lipoprotein A levels may be associated with increased risk of diabetes. So what does that mean

1154
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:06,120
if you lower it to very low lipoprotein A level? I don't know. So we really need the trial data.

1155
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:12,120
Super interesting. I feel like Tom Dayspring recently sent me an analysis of Odyssey,

1156
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:18,280
which demonstrated that the greater the reduction in LP little A through the use of

1157
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:22,520
praluent, the greater the reduction in mace. Am I remembering that correctly?

1158
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:30,600
Yeah. So both in Fourier and Odyssey, individuals who experience the greatest reduction in lipoprotein

1159
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:37,240
A had greater relative and absolute reduction in mace, major adverse cardiovascular events. So it

1160
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:46,520
seems to be that lowering lipoprotein A may in part be an important mediator in the benefits that we

1161
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:51,320
see with these agents. And it may just not be all due to their LDL lowering effects, but maybe also

1162
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:57,400
due to lipoprotein A lowering effects. So that's very encouraging when we think about these new

1163
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:04,760
agents. But you know, this is modeling post hoc analysis from these trials and the PCSK9 inhibitors

1164
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:11,640
also lowered LDL. So when you now think about agents that really only target lipoprotein A,

1165
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:16,360
is that going to be sufficient enough to have a meaningful, significant reduction in major

1166
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:21,080
adverse cardiovascular events? I mean, I'm hopeful. I'm really hopeful because I think it's causal.

1167
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:25,480
We know it's associated with risk. I'm really excited about the therapies in this area,

1168
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:28,760
but I've got to show me the data. I've got to see the outcome data results.

1169
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:33,800
Well, let's talk about menopause. You know, I'm amazed it's taken us this long into a podcast

1170
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:39,640
to get to it because it's such an important issue. It plays such a huge role in women's health,

1171
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:46,360
whether it be dementia, sarcopenia, osteopenia, you name it. But I don't think I've done a dedicated

1172
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:54,120
podcast where we look at the effects of menopause on ASCVD. We've certainly danced around it today

1173
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:58,920
and we've shown our hands a little bit here, which is this is an accelerator of risk. Can you

1174
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:04,120
say a little bit more about why? Is there anything more to it than simply the loss of estradiol

1175
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:09,480
leading to an increase in LDL? And if so, what's the actual mechanism by which that's happening?

1176
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:14,520
You know, we started off the program talking about hormone levels. So estrogen levels start

1177
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:20,760
dropping during perimenopause. And perimenopause can actually last several years before menopause.

1178
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,560
Menopause is one of those things you don't really know it's happened until it's after it's happened

1179
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:32,200
because it is officially sort of diagnosed when you haven't had a menstrual cycle for 12 months,

1180
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:39,560
which usually happens around age 51. But earlier onset of menopause before the age of 45 or before

1181
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:44,680
the age of 40 is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. You know, with the primary

1182
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:50,680
estrogen of women of reproductive age, estradiol drops dramatically. And then there's the change

1183
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:58,600
to estrone E1, which is the weakest type of estrogen formed in the adrenal glands and other adipose tissues.

1184
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:05,640
By the way, Aaron, am I remembering my biochemistry correctly? Estrone exists in three variants or it

1185
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:13,400
can be converted into four hydroxy, eight hydroxy and 16 hydroxy or two, four and eight, 16 hydroxy

1186
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:17,640
estrone. Does that ring a bell at all? And the reason I only bring it up is I feel like one of

1187
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:23,720
those was more thought to be involved in the creation of breast cancer. I'm not sure I can

1188
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:30,120
speak on that. I'm mostly familiar with just the three major subtypes, the E2 estradiol, the E1 and

1189
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:36,840
the E3 among estrone types. I apologize. I don't know that data except that it's no worries. Okay.

1190
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:41,800
It's a very weak type of estrogen. And so essentially, you know, women after menopause

1191
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:47,000
really have very low levels of estrogen. In fact, women have lower after menopause have lower levels

1192
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:52,920
of estrogen than men do. Men have higher estrogen levels because of they have much higher testosterone

1193
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:57,560
levels and they have increased peripheral conversion of testosterone estradiol. Actually,

1194
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,360
men have higher estradiol levels than women after menopause. Do you know my other favorite stat?

1195
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:06,680
That's a great one, by the way. The other favorite stat of mine is that even pre-menopause,

1196
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,240
women have higher testosterone than estrogen if you actually convert the units to the same units.

1197
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:17,160
I think some people think after menopause, the ovaries are just not active anymore. But that's

1198
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:21,880
not true, actually. After menopause, the ovaries continue to just don't make a survival, but they

1199
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:27,960
continue to produce androcynone and testosterone. So they keep making androgens really up to

1200
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:33,160
significant amounts until age 80. And these androgens are what get converted in fat and muscle tissue

1201
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:38,280
into estrone. So I mentioned this because a lot of my research has been about sex hormone levels

1202
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:43,960
after menopause. And we've previously shown that postmenopausal women who have higher androgen

1203
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:51,000
levels, who have higher testosterone to estrogen ratios, had a more male-like pattern. They had

1204
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:56,200
greater risk of developing ASCVD and heart failure over the next 12 years. And this was even after

1205
01:53:56,200 --> 01:54:01,400
we adjusted for risk factors like blood pressure and lipids and diabetes. And we did a number of

1206
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:05,960
studies as well in the MESA study, the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis. But we also showed

1207
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:11,640
that women with higher androgens had more coronary artery calcium progression. They had

1208
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:18,040
worse endothelial reactivity. They had increase in concentric remodeling, all this adverse

1209
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:23,400
cardiovascular phenotype. And also, as I mentioned, we started out talking about PCOS earlier,

1210
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:31,480
but in PCOS, the riskier phenotype is the hyperandrogenism state and testosterone

1211
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:37,960
and androstenone in higher LH levels in PCOS as a marker PCOS. So getting back to menopause,

1212
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:43,240
a lot of things happen related to these hormonal changes. You have more visceral fat deposition in

1213
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:49,880
the abdomen and more insulin resistance. And this leads to this dyslipidemia pattern of increased

1214
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:55,960
triglycerides, increased LDL, and decreased HDL. There's more endothelial dysfunction,

1215
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:00,360
increased blood pressure, increased sympathetic tone. So where a lot of cardiovascular risk in

1216
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:06,520
women is more linear with aging, so for the most part, blood pressure and diabetes risk tends to

1217
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:12,440
be more of an aging effect rather than an ovary effect. Lipids is one thing that really seems to

1218
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:19,400
be an ovary effect that we do see relatively acute changes in the lipid panel following the final

1219
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:25,160
menstrual period with this rise in total cholesterol and LDL. I think we alluded to earlier that it's

1220
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:30,600
maybe one of the reasons that women tend to have risk a little bit later in life and after menopause

1221
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:35,720
is because they tend to have this more dyslipidemia pattern a little bit later in life. Now this

1222
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,640
pattern, this increased risk, you know, had led this whole body of work about, well, these changes

1223
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:46,360
are harmful. Maybe giving menopause hormone therapy would be beneficial. And of course, you know,

1224
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:51,160
we did this for years. My mother used to be in hormone therapy. This is all, you know, well before

1225
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:55,640
the women's health initiative study, because we just felt that, you know, oh, well, you must give

1226
01:55:55,640 --> 01:56:01,640
these hormones back. There are favorable and unfavorable changes that we see with hormone

1227
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:06,760
therapy, especially this combined therapy. So some of the favorable therapy changes, if you do give

1228
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:13,080
women estrogen, you will lower their LDL and it can increase the HDL and estrogen can have.

1229
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,120
And are you talking about oral estrogen or topical estrogen?

1230
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:23,400
Systemic estrogen, which is oral and to some degree transdermal, vaginal estrogens don't have

1231
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:28,280
much systemic absorption. So they're a really good option for women. You know, I'll talk about

1232
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:33,560
which women to use hormone therapy in, but for women who just have the genital urinary symptoms,

1233
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:39,400
even a women with cardiovascular disease or history of stroke, or you can use vaginal estrogens

1234
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:43,800
safely. And sometimes I think there's this concern about using them in high risk women,

1235
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:47,480
but you can use the vaginal estrogen. So I'm really talking about oral estrogens here.

1236
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:51,320
They dilate the blood vessels through a nitric oxide effect, which, you know,

1237
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:55,880
may be all cardio protective, but keep in mind, estrogens also have unfavorable properties. So

1238
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:03,320
we know that estrogens can increase CRP. So women have higher CRP levels and estrogens are prothrombotic.

1239
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:09,000
I mean, this is why there is some increased risk with oral contraceptives, particularly in women

1240
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,120
who are older of reproductive age and combined with smoking and also during pregnancy,

1241
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:19,880
that estrogens can increase prothrombin decrease anti-thrombin three. And we also talked about the

1242
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:24,600
estrogen effects with triglycerides. Same thing with oral contraceptives, which have higher estrogen

1243
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:29,640
levels, hormone therapy, all code increased triglycerides. So in higher risk women,

1244
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:35,880
particularly those that are farther out from the menopause transition or those with established

1245
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:43,480
cardiovascular disease, these adverse changes, you know, may outweigh any favorable benefits.

1246
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:48,840
And that's why probably the women's health initiative who had the mean age of 63,

1247
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:53,080
most of these women were quite far from the menopause transition. And the women's health

1248
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:59,720
initiative also used an oral conjugated equine estrogen with progestin formulation that we saw,

1249
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:04,040
you know, an increased risk, including a twofold increased risk of venous thromboembolism.

1250
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:08,840
So this is why, you know, the guidelines all changed and we don't recommend hormone therapy

1251
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:13,240
for the sole purpose of cardiovascular disease prevention, because we have many other things we

1252
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:18,520
can use for prevention like statins. But you know, the pendulum doesn't have to swing so far away

1253
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:25,800
that you look at sub-analyses of these trials of women that were closer to the menopause transition,

1254
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:32,440
younger women, we didn't see this excess harm. And so while a lot of women are quite symptomatic at

1255
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:39,080
menopause, you know, vasomotor symptoms can be very disabling for many women with the hot flashes

1256
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:44,440
and the brain fog. In fact, vasomotor symptoms end up themselves when frequent or persistent

1257
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:50,200
are associated with cardiovascular risk. And so for symptomatic women who are under the age of 60

1258
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:55,960
or within 10 years of menopause who have symptomatic menopausal hot flashes or night sweats,

1259
01:58:55,960 --> 01:59:00,760
you know, consider hormone therapy. Women who go through menopause early, if they don't have other

1260
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,760
contraindications, menopausal hormone therapy is recommended to at least the natural age of

1261
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:10,120
menopause or age 51. But generally, we're not recommending it if a woman's more than 10 years

1262
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:16,200
out from menopause or over age 65. This is where the increased risks are emerging in these trials.

1263
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:21,640
And we want to avoid oral estrogens in women with a history of cardiovascular disease, blood clots,

1264
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:25,880
hydroglycerides, gallbladder disease, or prior breast and inter-metrial cancer,

1265
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:29,880
particularly the oral estrogens. There's probably a little bit less risk with

1266
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:34,440
transdermal estrogens, which are still systemic, but they don't have the first pass effect.

1267
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,040
But I, you know, very work really closely with our menopause clinic as part of doing

1268
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:42,440
cardiovascular risk assessment prior to use of menopausal hormone therapy. So when risk is

1269
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:47,240
uncertain, you know, I get a coronary calcium score to make sure that they don't have any

1270
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:53,160
calcified plaque, their score is zero. I feel pretty comfortable with using hormone therapy in

1271
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:57,560
them for treatment of their vasomotor symptoms. But if they have significant atherosclerotic

1272
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:03,560
disease, you know, I tend to not recommend it. And again, if they're only having genital urinary

1273
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:08,920
symptoms, topical estrogen is fine. You know, the risk, it really probably depends on a lot of

1274
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:15,000
factors. It depends on when you start the hormone replacement, you know, your age and initiation,

1275
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,840
how many years you've been since menopause, your menopause age, how long you take the therapy,

1276
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:26,040
the duration, the type of therapy, the dose, and the route of administration.

1277
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:29,400
And probably your incoming health. The other thing I'm hearing here,

1278
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:35,560
Aaron, is this is another reason for young women, women who are in their 30s, for whom menopause

1279
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:41,560
isn't even on the radar. This is another reason to be as healthy as possible and to do as much

1280
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:46,520
preventative work as possible. Because if for no other reason, it gives you more optionality in

1281
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:52,520
menopause. My calculus on this is looking at a few things. And, you know, obviously quality of

1282
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:59,800
life is one bone health is another muscle mass, brain health is a huge one. So I'm kind of looking

1283
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:05,960
at it as heart health is not even on the radar. Because to your point, we have so many better

1284
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:12,920
tools to reduce the risk of ASCVD that we don't need to rely on estradiol as one of those tools.

1285
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:18,040
It's basically a pea shooter in a bazooka fight when we have big, big guns to reduce the risk of

1286
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:24,360
cardiovascular disease. So while we're really asking of HRT is to not hurt somebody, while we let it

1287
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:31,720
do its bazooka like work, which is going to be on the brain, bone health, vasomotor symptoms,

1288
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:37,880
eventually vaginal atrophy and things like that, for which we don't have alternatives. And so to

1289
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:43,480
your point, the difference between a 50 year old woman who shows up with a beautiful CTA that's

1290
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:47,800
crystal clear, where we're going to have no ambiguity about this line of treatment, versus

1291
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:54,440
a woman who shows up with a worrisome CTA. And yeah, maybe even if we go to transdermal, there's

1292
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:58,760
going to be more hesitation, there's going to be more concern. And maybe that slight increase in

1293
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:03,720
risk if it exists, is something we now have to weigh in the balance. Again, it all comes back,

1294
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:09,160
in my mind, listening to you to prevention is the key. It's just start early and be aggressive.

1295
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:11,720
And all you do is give yourself more options later in life.

1296
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:18,040
Yeah, absolutely. The risk is in women with established cardiovascular disease. So trying

1297
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:23,160
to prevent that plaque in the first place, if there's no atherosclerosis, then the

1298
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:31,240
vase of dilatory effects and the lowering of LDL may be helpful in preventing the

1299
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:36,920
initiation of atherosclerosis. But a woman who already has disease and the slight increase in

1300
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:41,880
inflammatory markers and a pro-pharmatic effect may tip them over to having a vascular event.

1301
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:47,320
So all in favorable about improving cardiovascular health earlier in life. Really, how we live the

1302
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:52,040
first half of our lives really influences our freedom for morbidity and mortality the second

1303
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:58,280
half of our lives. Any relationship with progesterone and lipids once we get into that

1304
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:04,600
menopausal state, obviously women who are on estrogen need to either take oral progesterone.

1305
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:10,040
Usually these days it's done micronized or we're even seeing them use progesterone-coated IUDs if

1306
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:14,760
they can't. But let's just talk about this systemic progesterone. Does that have any bearing

1307
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:21,960
positive or negative? Yes. I mean, we have to use progesterone if they have an intact uterus. This

1308
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:28,200
may influence some of the, again, we're not using these for cardiovascular benefit, but whether

1309
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:33,880
it offsets the benefit that we see from the estrogen. You mentioned, again, something at

1310
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:39,240
the outset of the podcast, which I think is an enormous problem in all of medicine, which is the

1311
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:46,600
disproportionate shortcoming or shortfall rather of women in clinical trials, women as subjects.

1312
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:51,880
You said something funny earlier that's only funny because it's not true, which is women are not

1313
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:55,880
little men. Do you see that changing? I guess I'd just ask you to sort of think about it in your

1314
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:59,480
field. I don't expect you to speak about it in terms of fields in oncology or things like that.

1315
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:04,040
When you think about cardiovascular medicine, be it on the lipid side, the hypertensive side,

1316
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:10,600
all fronts of cardiovascular medicine, are we seeing a more equal, i.e. 50-50 distribution

1317
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:16,840
of patients into clinical trials today? Or are we still seeing it be more male focused and therefore

1318
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:22,840
more underpowered to understand the effect of interventions on women? For background, women

1319
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:28,280
are historically under enrolled in cardiovascular clinical trials, usually only 25 to 30 percent of

1320
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:33,560
trials. I previously published analysis where we reviewed the literature of lipid-lowering trials

1321
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:39,560
between 1990 and 2018. This was just through 2018, so it doesn't reflect the more recent trials.

1322
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:44,360
We showed the overall representation of women was only 29 percent in those trials.

1323
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:50,520
Now, for some things like acute coronary syndrome, the prevalence is less common in women than in men.

1324
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:57,240
We benchmarked it to something called a participation to prevalence ratio, where a ratio of one would

1325
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:03,800
be adequately representation to their prevalence of the disease in the population. We showed that

1326
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:11,400
women were underrepresented with a prevalence to participation ratio, generally 0.5 or less,

1327
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:15,960
meaning that even though if they had lower burden of disease, they were still under enrolled in

1328
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:22,360
trials related to this. We showed also another analysis looking at cardiometabolic drugs through

1329
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:28,360
2017 that had gotten FDA approval for new molecular entities, and again, showed women

1330
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:33,640
only made up like 36 percent of those trials. In an editorial we wrote, we looked at all kinds of

1331
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:38,520
different things, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, hypertension, and women throughout

1332
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:43,800
all these disease entities were under enrolled in trials. Some things are getting better. I mean,

1333
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:48,040
there are, you know, I mentioned clear outcomes, which is nearly half the participants are women.

1334
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:53,320
I think this is because it's enrolling a statin intolerant population. There was some of the

1335
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:58,600
GLP-1 studies like REWIND, which studied de-laglotide. That was largely a primary

1336
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:04,280
prevention trial that had like 46 percent women, so those were encouraging. So I think there's

1337
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:10,280
some examples of some improvement, but women still, for the most part, you know, we still see trial

1338
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:15,640
after trial being published presented at ESC or AHA ACC, and we're like, where are the women? Why

1339
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:20,920
are women continually to be under enrolled? And one of the things I'm passionate about is I think

1340
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:26,040
that there's unfortunately under involvement of clinical trial leadership. These steering

1341
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:30,920
committees to these trials have a dearth of women cardiovascular investigators. There was a paper a

1342
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:35,240
couple years ago that looked at major cardiovascular trials, you know, published in the leading

1343
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:40,520
journals, New England Journal, JAMA, Lancet. You know, only 10 percent of trial leaderships,

1344
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:45,880
committees, were women, and more than half, about 56 percent of these trial leadership

1345
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:50,840
committees had no female representation on the trial. One of the trial steering committee were

1346
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:56,360
women investigators, and less than 10 percent had a woman in the first or last author position,

1347
02:06:56,360 --> 02:07:01,560
which would indicate a senior leadership position. We know from other studies that

1348
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:07,000
the likelihood that a study will report a sex and gender specific analysis actually has, you know,

1349
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:12,280
increased when there's more women authors of the study and more first and last authors women. I

1350
02:07:12,280 --> 02:07:17,400
think women tend to publish more about science related to women. So I do think it matters. There

1351
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:24,200
is some data from my work and some other work from other authors that have shown a modest correlation.

1352
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:30,280
It's not perfect, but a correlation between the proportion of women authors, the trial steering

1353
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:36,040
committees, and enrollment of women participants in trials. For example, we did this for AFib,

1354
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,920
and we showed that for every one percent increase in women authors, there was a 19 percent higher

1355
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:46,680
enrollment of women participants in the trials. I mean, there's a lot that we can do to tackle this.

1356
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:53,400
One of them is having more representation in by diversifying study team and investigators.

1357
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:59,000
I think also we need to include more patients in trial designs, include more women in trial designs,

1358
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:04,760
patient centered designs. You know, we hear that women are approached, but often are declined

1359
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:09,560
participating in trials. And I think women tend to be a little bit more risk adverse. And this is

1360
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:15,240
where it's really important to provide education, dispel misconceptions, emphasize the benefits.

1361
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:20,520
Even if we don't know if a drug is going to be beneficial or not, there's a lot of benefits with

1362
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:25,240
being part of a trial because you have more access to gold standard care and more access to study

1363
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:31,400
investigators. And it's really important to include women in the design and try to understand

1364
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:36,920
some of these design issues, which may be not so obvious, you know, such as making sure there's

1365
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:42,840
no hidden costs that often people are paid for the drug or device. But there can be things related

1366
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:48,920
to transportation or time off work or providing, you know, for childcare or other responsibilities

1367
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:55,000
by having more flexible follow up, more pragmatic trials or having a follow up being online or by

1368
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,840
phone or by PCP that may get over some of the barriers to enrolling women in the trials, which

1369
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:06,440
I think can be really helpful. And making sure that the study designs are not so restrictive in

1370
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:11,960
terms of the inclusion exclusion criteria that we shouldn't just exclude women of childbearing age,

1371
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:18,600
if they have a plan for preventing pregnancy, have an adequate contraception, you know, women should

1372
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:23,880
be eligible for these trials. Not to mention, we actually need more trials in pregnant women too.

1373
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:29,000
It's just so important to understand what works and what's safe. And so there's a lot of barriers

1374
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:34,440
to overcome. And this barriers need to be both with trial teams and trial designs with the funding

1375
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:40,040
agencies, institutions, and even the journals that publish these trials should be questioning

1376
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:44,200
why there's not enough women in the trial. So we all need to do better. As a randomized clinical

1377
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:50,200
trials is our largest evidence base. And we want to make sure that something is efficacious, but

1378
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:55,480
safe in women and that women benefit to a similar degree as men do. Karen, you've run how many

1379
02:09:55,480 --> 02:10:01,960
marathons? Oh, slowly. I'm not very talented at it, but I've done like 38 marathons and I was trying

1380
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:07,800
to do one in every state as a goal. I'm really slow at running. So my only goal for these is just

1381
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:13,480
finishing as an accomplishment in and of itself. Are those 38 in 38 different states? I've done

1382
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:18,440
about 36 states. And then there was a couple of states like Maryland, where I live that I've

1383
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:24,680
repeated more than once. Is that still a goal? You still want those other 14 states? Yeah. So

1384
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:30,520
unfortunately I had taken a little bit, you know, I set back during the COVID. I had four marathons

1385
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:36,520
planned for 2020 and they all got canceled due to COVID. And without a marathon on the calendar,

1386
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:41,320
I got a little bit out of the habit of running with these long distances because I didn't really

1387
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:46,280
run by myself. I do it for the social support with my running groups. And so without people

1388
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:52,040
or groups to run with. And then in 2021, you know, the marathon I registered for was canceled as well.

1389
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:57,400
And so I've gotten sort of out of it for a while, but I... It's really good that we're canceling

1390
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:03,240
outdoor exercise during COVID because I can't... Well, it's back now. So events are back. So I am

1391
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:10,040
registered for a marathon in October next month. It'll be my first marathon again in three years.

1392
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:14,680
So I'm hoping to get state 37. Which state? It's New Jersey and most of the East Coast,

1393
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:19,880
but this one I haven't done yet. And I've been back doing other races. I just did a 12 miler

1394
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:26,360
here in Baltimore on Saturday last weekend. So races are back and they're fun. And I just like

1395
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:31,480
participating. You know, you don't have to be good at a hobby to enjoy it. So I'll never have any age

1396
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:36,600
groups or probably never qualify for Boston, but you know, sometimes it's just the act of doing

1397
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:41,960
something and setting goals for yourself. And I love it. It's just, it's fun. That's fantastic.

1398
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:46,360
Well, I have such fond memories of Baltimore. My wife is from there, so there's an additional

1399
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:50,600
fondness to it, but I guess more than anything, it's the time I spent there. It's great to catch

1400
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:54,360
up with you and it brings back memories by proxy at a minimum. I want to thank you for your time,

1401
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:59,240
Aaron. This was really insightful. I learned a lot. I think this is a podcast where obviously

1402
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:03,080
women will have learned a lot, but hopefully men as well, because if you're a man listening to this,

1403
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:07,640
you certainly know a woman and therefore you should be just as concerned with her risk of

1404
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:12,280
cardiovascular disease as your own. Thank you very much for this input, making the time and

1405
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:16,840
your continued work. Thank you for having me on your podcast. Thank you for listening to this

1406
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:21,480
week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss,

1407
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:26,200
we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content

1408
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:31,400
without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price

1409
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:36,760
of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally

1410
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:42,440
kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss

1411
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:48,840
on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or

1412
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:54,200
Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed

1413
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:59,640
that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this. The Qwally's,

1414
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:04,280
which are a super short podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the

1415
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:09,000
best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great

1416
