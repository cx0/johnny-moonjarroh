Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,280
today's episode. I guess this week is Dr. BJ Miller. BJ is a hospice and palliative care

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,360
specialist. We talk a lot about what that means. The reason I wanted to speak with BJ is I've been

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,760
really thinking a lot about better understanding what end of life means and how understanding the

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,880
end of life could help us better understand, frankly, what we want out of life. And by an

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,480
amazing coincidence, BJ and I met very, very briefly many years ago in medical school,

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,200
although I don't think he remembers it. But when I saw him again giving a TED talk several years

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:31,640
ago, I immediately realized, hey, that's the guy I met at a party 20 some odd years ago and became

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,880
really interested in his work and then reached back out to him and said, hey, would you be

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,800
interested to sit down and talk about this? And so in this discussion, we talk a lot about his

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:47,000
personal story because you can't really avoid it. And frankly, his personal story is a big part of

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,880
why he ultimately chose the life path he did, which is doing something that many of us,

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,000
including people who go into medicine would find just too difficult to do, which is basically help

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,720
patients die as a means to reach this culmination of their life. We get into all sorts of things,

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,000
the difference between death and dying, the difference between palliative care and hospice,

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,600
the differences between loss and regret, what the medical system that we're a part of is good at and

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,120
what it's not so great at. We talk about what really happens at the end of life, how enlightened

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,440
or transcendent is it? And he tells a number of stories that are quite moving about patients and

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,520
also from his own life. And finally, we conclude with a discussion on both the hastening of death

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,240
and also what he's most optimistic about, including the use of psychedelics. This is another one of

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,080
those episodes that I think people at the surface might think, gosh, I don't really have an interest

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,880
in that. I would encourage you to push through that. I think it's natural to find this topic

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,680
unpalatable. And I think that's exactly why people need to listen to this.

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,400
So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with BJ Miller.

32
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,280
Hey BJ, it's a real honor to be sitting down with you, even though we're not in person together.

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,640
Thank you, Peter. I appreciate you having me, but I'm looking forward to this.

34
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,960
Now, I don't know if you remember this. In fact, you can't have remembered this because

35
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm not memorable in the way that you are, but we've met a few times at parties in medical school.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,680
You went to UCSF and I went to Stanford. And I don't know if we were the same class,

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,000
but we were pretty close. What year did you matriculate at UCSF?

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
Ninety-seven.

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,280
So we were the same class. And I don't recall you guys ever coming down to Palo Alto,

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,320
but we sure as hell went up to San Francisco a lot.

41
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,480
For social reasons or for school?

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,000
No, just for social reasons.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,480
Oh yeah.

44
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,120
We just had friends in common and stuff like that. And so it's almost 25 years ago. And I remember,

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,080
one of the things that stood out was you had a dog, right?

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,920
What was your dog's name? I don't remember.

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,880
His name was Vermont, like the state.

48
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,760
I got it.

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Yeah. Wow. I'm so psyched you remember him, Peter. He was a huge part of my life. I can

50
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,280
tell you that's beautiful.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,800
So I will admit something, BJ, which is that I never had the nerve to come up to you and say,

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,280
hey, what happened?

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,440
Because it wasn't subtle, right?

54
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah, no, it's pretty, it's pretty pleadingly obvious. Yeah.

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,080
So as I would learn later, your life changed shortly after Thanksgiving in 1990, right?

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,440
That's right. You got it, bud. Yep.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,560
And that change, which I think on the surface would sound like a change for the worst,

58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,120
maybe wasn't for the worst after all. Can you tell folks what happened that night?

59
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah. I mean, it was a big moment in my life as you're pointing to Peter. Yeah. I mean,

60
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,640
and there's a lot to talk about it. So I'll try to just kind of parlay the basic facts and then

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,480
we can talk about any of it. So just back from Thanksgiving holiday, and I was very happy to see

62
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,000
my friends. We were all kind of that early college. We were basically in love. We couldn't wait to see

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,600
each other. Being away for Thanksgiving break was a bummer, really. So anyway, we got running back

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,880
and we immediately decided to go, a handful of us would go out and have a drink and just run

65
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,320
around. I was actually on my way to the computer lab to print a paper when it kind of got intercepted

66
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,480
and off we ran to go have some fun. Nothing crazy. It was, we didn't go nuts though, but we were

67
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,400
heading to the Wawa Market, which on the East coast is sort of like a 7-11. Late, open all night,

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,880
place to get a sandwich, kind of joint chips or whatever. Anyway, so we're walking to the Wawa

69
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,120
Market and this is at Princeton University where there's a commuter train that runs right up along

70
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,520
campus because Princeton is sort of a bedroom community for New York and Philly. So this

71
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,880
commuter train was called the Dinky of all things. It was just sitting there, not operating hours.

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,720
So I was just sitting there and we stumbled across it and just decided to climb on top of it, just

73
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,960
relatively innocently for things we had done, but felt much stupider. But anyway, we decided to jump

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,680
on top of it, climb the ladder, just stand up on it like you would a jungle gym or a tree or

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,080
something. And when I got up on top of the train, I had a metal watch on and the electricity art to

76
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,600
the watch when I stood up because I got close enough to the line. And that was that. Electricity

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,600
entered the arm, my left arm, and then ground down. And eventually there's a big explosion

78
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,840
and whatever else. And that was that. I survived that, but ended up losing both legs below the knee

79
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,880
and that one arm below the elbow, very touch and go in the burn unit and living through New Jersey,

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,440
St. Barnabas Hospital for, I don't know, maybe a month or so. Then I was in there another month

81
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,120
in the burn unit and then eventually out of there and into rehab. And then a long process of

82
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,920
reentering the world. But anyway, that was my big, the thing I call the cosmic spanking, that big,

83
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,840
big moment that just came along and completely reoriented me, changed things around.

84
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,800
Do you remember the actual shock or is that sort of so traumatic? A lot of times trauma patients,

85
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,480
for example, when they're hit by cars or sustain a significant gunshot wound, especially if it's

86
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,040
followed by a prolonged period in the ICU, they suffer some antigrade amnesia. So they forget

87
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,240
things in front of them, not so much behind them. But a lot of times that includes the actual event.

88
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,320
So what is the last thing you remember? Do you remember actually climbing up on the train?

89
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,720
I don't know. I remember the night is all very fuzzy. I remember sort of snippets from the hours

90
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,600
proceeding, but I don't have any recollection of approaching the train or getting on top of it.

91
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,840
This is just pieced together through stories from my friends who are with me. But the first memory I

92
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:10,280
have around the accident itself that night, I can picture a lot of it again because my friends have

93
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,640
told me, but my own memory really began in the hospital that night. I was taken to the local ER

94
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,480
where they just did basic things that are called fasciotomies, which as you know, with electrical

95
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,640
burns, you burn from the inside out. So you've got all this heat running around in your system

96
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,360
and it'll keep burning you. So they've got to vent that heat. Basically the local ER, they cut

97
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,440
these fasciotomies to vent me and then stuck me in a helicopter to go to the New Jersey's one burn

98
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,000
unit at St. Barnabas. I can remember being loaded into the helicopter vaguely. I was very

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,320
tall. I was almost six five and I just remember the pilots. There's this awkwardly trying to get

100
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,160
me into the cockpit because I was too long. So all the amputations I had were surgical. So at that

101
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:05,240
night my legs were burned. I still had them. So then you get to a burn unit and you're with

102
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,520
now a team of doctors and nurses who have seen the worst of things for what it's worth, just as

103
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,520
a bizarre coincidence in general surgery, which is what I went to do after medical school. You

104
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,640
rotate through all the different disciplines of surgery. It's quite random. You'll spend a month

105
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,400
on this, a month on that, a month on all of these different things. And my very first month of

106
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:35,160
internship was in the burn unit. I had never done any of that during medical school. So to show up

107
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,440
on day one at sort of the premier burn unit of Maryland, which basically meant it was the referral

108
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,240
center. So if you got burned in Pennsylvania, you were still coming down to Hopkins. I mean,

109
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,280
it was another world. You got it. I mean, it was very difficult to get used to doing

110
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,880
dressing changes on patients and just seeing the amount of pain people were in when they suffered

111
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:09,080
these burns. And the other thing that was remarkable, at least to me, was how otherwise

112
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,080
alive people could look when they came into a burn unit, but yet how poor their prognosis could be

113
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,200
based on the amount of surface area that was burned. We basically had actuarial tables that

114
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,520
would say, well, he has this much of third degree and this much of second degree. And even though

115
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,320
he's sitting here actually able to even communicate with us, this person has a very high likelihood

116
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,160
of not surviving this injury. Yep. It's interesting that you say that because one of the early

117
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,960
memories would piece together for me by a nurse with whom I became very close was when I landed

118
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,440
in the bay at the burn unit, this was not uncommon, but apparently the techs and the team were sitting

119
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,400
around basically taking wages on whether I was going to make it. It's probably based on very

120
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,040
much the same kind of what you were just describing. That sounds kind of harsh, but I'm sure it wasn't.

121
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,680
I think that was just, as you know, these things can depersonalize the net setting almost by

122
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,280
necessity. It's a brutal setting. But anyway, we can talk more about that. But I'm in a way

123
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:16,040
glad to know that you know what a burn unit is like. It is an other world that I've always

124
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,320
struggled to impart to people what it's actually like in there. It is a wholly unnatural place.

125
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,840
I mean, nature is completely kept at bay. Yes. And there's a reason that it's very separate.

126
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,000
I mean, in small hospitals, they do what they can. And I'm sure they don't have dedicated burn

127
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,160
units. But at tertiary care centers, they have dedicated ICUs that are exclusively for burn

128
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,720
patients that don't take other medical or surgical or neuro or pediatric cases. And it's also a very

129
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,080
special type of nurse that works there and a special type of doctor because everything from the,

130
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,600
frankly, just at times the grotesque nature of the disfiguration of the skin, these dressing

131
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,240
changes that we talk about doing several times per day on a patient, they require incredible

132
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,680
sterility at the bedside. Frankly, in the early days, early days of the patient's admission,

133
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:12,200
even the smell of burn tissue is a very foreign odor to people. So everything about it, it places,

134
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,000
by the way, everything I've said says nothing to what the patient and their family must be

135
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,440
experiencing as they're coming to grips with this. So when did your parents arrive? I'm sure you

136
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,120
don't remember it, but based on the stories, they came almost my poor parents, man, that they got

137
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,440
the classic in the middle of the night, they were in Chicago where I grew up at the time. So they

138
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:40,120
get a call from New Jersey at 4am or something ridiculous. And basically, not a lot of information,

139
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,960
just everything was emergent and scary. And basically, your son's here with us. He's very

140
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,840
badly injured, might not make it through the night, get here as soon as possible. Basically,

141
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,520
one of those calls. So my parents were there as quickly as could be the next morning, to your

142
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,920
point about this place. So what they've learned, burn treatment science is that infection is very

143
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,200
often the thing that kills people, hence all the sterility. So someone might look just fine, but

144
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,400
they're so exposed, their body is so exposed, that you're so susceptible. So that means whoever's in

145
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,120
your room, they're in spacesuits and whatever else. And for a while, I was not allowed many

146
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,600
visitors. There were friends who had come, but they couldn't come in to burn in it. Eventually,

147
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,120
they allowed my parents at the bedside, one at a time. That was it. But it was really powerful,

148
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,520
very potent visits. I remember them very well, as did my parents. As you describe your experience

149
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,520
as a student, as a trainee, it's not much different because it's such a foreign exotic environment

150
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,800
that works against intuition a lot of ways. The things that touch, for example, something you have

151
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,840
to avoid at all costs, smells, everything is foreign. There's just no place to rest into it

152
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,480
familiar. You can imagine if that was that way for you as a student, trainee. It was certainly

153
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,240
that way for myself and my parents. But in a way, too, that foreignness and by virtue of me being so

154
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:15,000
undeniably vulnerable, I was not moving. I was completely at their mercy. In a way, it allowed

155
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,720
me to very quickly submit to the place and to the people working there because I clearly had

156
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,440
nothing approaching an option. Very quickly, I was aware of my vulnerability and immediately

157
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,720
trusted the people working on me in a way because I had to, but also as a comment of how skillful

158
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,160
they were at their work. Do you remember the actual discussion you had with the doctors about

159
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,760
the need for amputation? Because obviously, when the fasciotomies are performed initially,

160
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,280
it's with the hope of salvaging the limbs. Presumably, at some point, they came to the

161
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,760
realization that trying to salvage the limbs was actually going to threaten your life due to

162
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,200
infection. They had to go. I've been around those discussions. Do you remember that?

163
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:11,000
I do. I do. I do. My first memory, real vivid memory besides that helicopter moment was the

164
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,960
night before my initial amputations. The part I remember about it, which was maybe five or six

165
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,880
days in, Peter, that's when I was hemodynamically stable enough. More to the point, the demarcation

166
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,600
of viable tissue versus unviable tissue was a little bit more obvious. Surgeons had a fighting

167
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:35,560
chance to remove the right amount. Dr. Mansour was the main surgeon, an amazing, amazing person.

168
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:42,200
I remember he came in the night before and said something. All I remember is an A conversation.

169
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Then I remember falling asleep. I fell asleep in my little room. Somehow, you know that feeling,

170
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,720
Peter, where you wake up from a dream and there's a moment of reorienting yourself and maybe it

171
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,800
wasn't a very pleasant dream. You take a little second and you get your bearings and you go,

172
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,360
oh, it's just a dream. Thank God. The classic thing is people show up taking an exam naked or

173
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,160
something. They're late for their wedding or some moment and you wake up and oh, thank God,

174
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,760
that was a dream. I remember I woke up in the burning and having that sensation. Strangely,

175
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,440
I remember I looked around and I had this weird feeling like, oh, this whole amputation thing

176
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:30,600
that I was just hearing about was a dream. Oh, I'm fine. Got to go to the bathroom. I, in my haze,

177
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,280
just managed to extubate myself. Not an easy thing to do. Extubate myself, pull my central

178
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:42,680
lines out of my neck, unstrap my arm from the bed. All the while, I can remember this so clearly.

179
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm looking around my room with all these cues that obviously I'm not in my bedroom. For some

180
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,000
reason, I'm just thinking, oh, yeah, this is my room. I'm just going to go to the bathroom now.

181
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,600
I got up and out of bed eventually and started walking to the door with all these alarms going

182
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,280
off in the middle of the night. Somehow, I don't know where the nurses were, but there was a gap

183
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:07,960
there. I started walking to the door just to take a leak on my crispy little feet. The Foley catheter

184
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,720
line ran out. As you know, they're usually attached to the bed. When that line ran out,

185
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,320
it yanked on that Foley. That's a pain that I won't soon forget. That catheter ball was not

186
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,520
deflated. We can explain this for your listeners. Anyway.

187
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,240
I was just about to say, we're going to hit pause and explain everything you just said.

188
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,200
But let's start with the extubation. You have a tube that is in your airway and a machine that

189
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,800
is breathing for you. The act of pulling that out means you now have to breathe on your own,

190
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,600
something you have not been doing for the previous week. That alone could have killed you.

191
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,960
Yeah, right.

192
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,800
You then pulled out a bunch of central lines, which if not compressed, so central lines are

193
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,880
very, very long intravenous lines that go into the main veins inside your body, veins that most

194
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,800
people don't even realize they have called the vena cava subclavian vein, et cetera. To pull those

195
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,400
out without the appropriate protocol of compression could also lead to internal hemorrhage and all

196
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,440
sorts of crazy things. You're dodging death. You're three for three on this.

197
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,080
Yeah. Yes. In retrospect, I smile almost with pride because it feels sounds so daring. I mean,

198
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,120
obviously, the time I had no freaking idea what I was doing. But now it sounds-

199
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,800
You're unkillable.

200
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,120
Yeah.

201
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:39,160
Right. But then the thing that finally gets you is a catheter about the size of an HB pencil

202
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:47,160
that is in your urethra up to your bladder, which stays in place with a balloon that's dilated to

203
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:55,000
the size of a very large gumball. And said gumball prevents the catheter from ever coming out. And

204
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,120
before we take these catheters out of the urethra, which is by itself unbearable, I myself have had

205
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:10,600
one, we have to deflate the ball because trying to pull a gumball sized device out of the urethra

206
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:18,200
would be tantamount to torture. But of course, you just went ahead and through the force of walking

207
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,080
towards the door, basically removed your own Foley catheter minus the balloon removal.

208
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,440
You're still alive, but all of a sudden that dream-

209
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,960
But not happy.

210
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,760
Yeah. It is amazing that you're right, that you must have done this all very quickly

211
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,680
to make it happen. So now you're sort of having that moment of maybe that wasn't a dream.

212
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:50,040
Mm-hmm. I will never forget this. It was a clarity, that world, all the haze cleared up

213
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,720
instantly when I felt that Foley dislodged from the bladder. But incidentally, it didn't come all

214
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
the way out. So it's somewhere halfway-

215
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,680
Which is even worse.

216
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,440
Yeah. It was just terrifying. So I immediately fall to the floor and I'm screaming and now a nurse

217
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,040
comes in. I don't know what the delay was. Incidentally, that poor nurse, we never saw her.

218
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,680
She was never assigned to my room again. Poor thing. Part of her explanation, she was avoiding

219
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,840
my room. She admitted in some ways because she had a son my age and looked just like me. And it was

220
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,800
really hard for her. Anyway, so eventually, so I'm on the floor now screaming, trying to break the

221
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,400
catheter line, which is impossible. But it's the only way I could, I thought I could break the

222
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:34,440
tension. But anyways, they came in, got me back in bed and all that stuff. And away it went. But

223
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,120
to your question, Peter, it was instantaneous that I realized this wasn't a dream. And all the

224
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,680
relief that had just I had experienced moments ago in the other direction just immediately went away.

225
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:51,240
And I was very, very clear on where I was and what was happening to me. Instantaneously, it was a

226
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,960
wild, wild moment. I won't soon forget.

227
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,560
So what kind of a mourning process did you go through post-operatively when you come out with

228
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,400
both of your legs amputated and your left arm?

229
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,320
Short answer is my mourning process took me a while. And my conscious mourning process was

230
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:19,160
delayed because I at that time embodied the sort of absorb the American notion that no,

231
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,640
what you do is you pick yourself up, you get back on the horse immediately. The less you acknowledge

232
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,000
what's gone on, the better. The tougher you are, the faster you'll be functional again, et cetera.

233
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,240
So early on, I didn't do any mourning, not consciously. I was kind of going the other

234
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,720
direction, joking around, making light of it. And both the moment of somewhat of denial and also

235
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,040
probably something pretty poignant too. I remember when I came out of that first surgery,

236
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,240
so I didn't know that there were people, I knew my parents were there. And oddly, Peter, I don't

237
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,800
know how this was possible. But my parents moved into the hospital. Somehow they got a room in the

238
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,600
hospital from Chicago. They lived there all the time I was there. I don't know how the hell that

239
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,160
never heard of that, but they did. Maybe they had huge wings of St. Barnum's that weren't being

240
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:11,240
used. I'm not sure. But I knew my parents were there. So I come out of the OR, come out and I'm

241
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,280
heading, they're wheeling me back. The leg amputations were what they did first. And I knew

242
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,600
whatever the cases I had absorbed, what Dr. Mansoor told me the night before eventually,

243
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:27,560
I woke up from that surgery with no surprises. But I'm wheeling back to my room. And there's a

244
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,280
brief moment where you're going from the OR suites back into the burn units, and you go

245
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,200
to this little hallway. And I come out, it was packed with people. My friends and some friends

246
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,200
had flown in from Chicago. I was so moved. I had no idea that they were there. And it was just a

247
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,680
brief second. There was no time to talk, but there was just a lot of love. I just remember

248
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,400
their facial expressions. I was very, very moved. And then I went back into the room and I remember

249
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:00,120
my mom came in and we were sitting and she was crying. And my mom had polio. She'd been disabled

250
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,520
my whole life, most of her life. And I just remember, this is going to sound, I don't know,

251
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,680
it was part denial driving it. But I just remember my thought when my mom came in was,

252
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,400
my response to her was, oh, mom, well, now we have so much more in common. Now we're both disabled,

253
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,760
almost like a cheeriness. I love my mom very much. We're very close. And I honestly felt

254
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,520
like I was joining this ranks of folks that I always knew existed and felt very much a kinship

255
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,640
with the disabled community by virtue of being close with my mother. My first response was weird

256
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,360
kind of immediate acceptance, but I had to go back and it wasn't a thorough acceptance. It was

257
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,440
where I wanted to be, but it wasn't really where I was. But anyway, that was my first statement.

258
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,560
It took really weeks. It took actually my nurse kind of trying to work on their member time,

259
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,520
maybe a week or two later where one of the nurses with whom I was very, very close,

260
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,760
Joy Varkada-Pone. And Joy came in one day and she was just really moody with me. She was just

261
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,160
like throwing, she was just strangely moody. And I was just sort of joking around. And anyway,

262
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,280
she's like throwing bedpanes around. It's like, Joy, what the hell? What is, what's wrong? What

263
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,240
are you okay? And she's just basically lit in me. She's like, I'm just sick and tired of you not

264
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,440
taking this seriously. You're just joking around. You haven't even cried. This is a big, big deal.

265
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:33,800
You're not being real. And she just let into me. She let into me until I finally cried. It was the

266
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:40,120
first time I cried. I was weeks in. It was the most magical thing, Peter. I will never forget

267
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,400
that one either. In part because there was like a dam had broke and so much came pouring out.

268
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,160
And it felt so good. It felt like such a relief. I hadn't realized. I hadn't consciously fought

269
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,160
back tears or tried to be tough. I just thought that's what I was supposed to be doing. And I

270
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,720
was otherwise on autopilot too. But what was also weird about those tears was for the moments,

271
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,480
the tears were falling. I had really no physical pain. I've never looked into this, but I wonder

272
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,760
what the connection is between the act of crying, not just feeling sad, but actually crying and

273
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,160
anesthesia. It was a fascinating moment, but it really moved me. And it began my relationship

274
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,560
with a began letting in that this was a bigger deal than I had managed to let it be. I offer that to

275
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:31,080
say the morning, the grieving was very gradual. Took me a while to wake up to my own feelings

276
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:38,760
about it all. That took months and years really. Do you think that that was mostly a sadness and a

277
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:45,720
loss that came through expectation of these are things I wanted to do that I will no longer do.

278
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,920
And I am sad as a result of that. Or do you think it was tears from a different sadness, a sadness

279
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,760
that's more born of anger? Like how could this have happened? It's such a random event. I've done

280
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,040
far stupider things in my life. Like why was I wearing that watch? You can sort of go through

281
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,800
all those things. Like do you have a sense of where you were in terms of that damn, the floodgates

282
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,600
opening? Yeah, yeah. My sense is Peter, it's a sense driven by most of where, how grief materialized

283
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,160
for me over the months and years. But my sense is for a number of reasons, I did not have

284
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,880
a lot of why me moments. And there's a lot to say about that. But to answer your question,

285
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,880
no, I think it was more like, first of all, the physical pain. I hadn't really let myself,

286
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:45,400
I had just been literally gritting my teeth. And for as vulnerable as I felt, as so exposed as I

287
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,880
felt, I was looking for anywhere where I could look or feel or act or present as strong. And

288
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,600
this is the only way I could think of I think was to kind of keep this stuff in. And so I think

289
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,360
part of it was a release around just a physical pain. And I think the rest of it, it didn't have

290
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:09,000
a lot of clarity around the object of my sorrow. But the sorrow I really think was had to do with

291
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:16,280
embarrassment for doing this for ending up here, putting my parents through so much pain, I could

292
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,200
see it in their faces, slowly began to see what it did to friends too and others around me.

293
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,560
It's the feeling I think a lot of the pain or a lot of the tears had to do with here I was taking

294
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,480
so much from so many people. I was embarrassed about that and ashamed about that. I think that

295
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,960
was a big part of it. And I think there was also an image I had just kind of come into my body as

296
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,440
a 19 year old. And I think there was a sadness. I didn't know if I would ever have sex again,

297
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,520
what women were going to think of me, what my friends would think of me, I'd been around

298
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,480
disability my whole life. And I've watched how cruel people could be and the projections they

299
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,600
make. And I think part of it was the more tears that I knew what I was going to be walking into

300
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,000
with that. I think yeah, all of those things, but low, low, low on the list Peter were the why me

301
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,680
questions. I know a lot of that to the prep work that my mother, my family life had said it,

302
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,080
it was always much more the question of why not me? If anything, I felt guilty for having too

303
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,840
perfect a life before that. Separate from all of this BJ, there's another kind of really

304
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,320
transformative event in your life that has to do with your sister. When did that take place?

305
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:35,160
So that was 10 years later. So that was. So you're in medical school. Yeah, exactly. And I want to

306
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,760
come back to how you got to medical school, but can you tell me a little bit about your sister

307
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,160
and the relationship you had with her in the 10 years that followed this and then ultimately

308
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:52,360
her demise? It's a good segue. It's a lick of the way I grew up was I was no stranger to pain.

309
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:58,920
I was around it. And there are all sorts of reasons to feel like that life was inherently hard. And

310
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:04,840
that was something about I felt almost a perversion that I could feel happy ever. That felt that

311
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,360
almost felt wrong. I don't know how to explain it, but part of my growing up was growing up with

312
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:18,120
a sister. I have one sibling, Lisa. Lisa was four years older than I am. Wild, brilliant,

313
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,720
fascinating, just intense person. And our whole family life so much centered around her and her

314
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,560
moods and her thoughts. So I was enamored with Lisa. She was my older sister. She seemed so smart

315
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,200
to me. She had emotions around things that I hadn't even thought of. And she had these developed

316
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,400
psychological, emotional responses. I just felt like she must have insights in the world that I

317
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:50,280
just couldn't see. And she had such conviction. And she was harsh, harsh, harsh, harsh. That

318
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,120
conviction, older sister I wanted, I aspired to her. So I chased her moods around. Anything she

319
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,040
told me I took at face value. I mean, she owned me in so many ways as her younger brother. And she

320
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,360
was very troubled. And part of my adulthood was coming in to realize that Lisa wasn't just full

321
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,200
of conviction. Lisa was also full of some other things. And so in my twenties, here I am going to

322
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,360
med school, I'm finally learning to have some separation from chasing my sister's moods around.

323
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,920
And then in December, December 1st of 2000, roughly almost exactly 10 years after my injuries,

324
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,920
Lisa decided to kill herself. Lisa decided to leave the planet. So yes, that was another,

325
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:42,440
one of the major, major life events for me. And that was deep into medical school. And one of

326
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,640
the things that precipitated my deciding to leave medicine, I was going to get out of medicine at

327
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,200
that point. No, I didn't know that actually. Yeah. I want to come back to this. Can we talk

328
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,760
for a moment though, just to make the connection of how you ended up deciding to go into medicine,

329
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,960
because when you were in your freshman year at Princeton, I get the impression that medicine

330
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,560
wasn't even on your radar, correct? Yeah, that's right. You got it. Yeah. No interest. That even

331
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:20,280
crossed my mind. Yeah. So after returning to Chicago, going through a very lengthy process

332
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,480
of rehabilitation, you re-enrolled at Princeton a full year later, correct? Almost. Yeah. The

333
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:34,120
following fall. So I went back in September of 1991. And you changed your major to art history.

334
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:42,760
Is that also correct? You got it. Yep. Why did you do that? I had been there to for, that's a word.

335
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,160
I had been studying Chinese language and was heading for a major in East Asian studies.

336
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:54,440
But when I was away, when I was in that, the burn unit, it's like a torture chamber interspersed

337
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:02,360
with incredible boredom. You're just so, and this was so wild. When I look back on these, I'm sorry,

338
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,600
I'm just a quick digression. So this was the first Gulf War was happening. It was so strange. I was

339
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,320
watching a war, remember it was like a televised war. Such a wild thing, bored stiff, in horrible

340
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,320
pain to and from that tank room for daily deep readment. So horrible pain interspersed with

341
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,440
slight relief and boredom. No touch with it. There's not even a window. It's such a weird

342
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,760
thing. And I would toggle between on the television between watching the war and some cooking show.

343
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,640
It was just the strangest, I don't know why I bring that up. It was just how I spent my days.

344
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,800
But now I forgot your question, brother. What were you asking me about?

345
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,120
The decision to change to art history. Oh, golly. How did I get to that? But anyway,

346
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,600
well, I know because I'm sitting in this bed, bored stiff. And of course, even with my little

347
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,160
structures that were still in place that kept me from crying or acknowledging a lot of things,

348
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,520
of course, there was no getting around some stuff. And I was beginning to let into my consciousness

349
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,480
and my daily thinking, like, you know, sort of preparing, imagining my life down the road.

350
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,840
When am I going back to school? Will anyone want to be friends with me?

351
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,120
But I'm basically bottom line is I'm sitting there very much pondering the value of my life.

352
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,080
What am I now? Am I less of a person? Do I have less to offer the world? What will people see in

353
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:34,040
me wanting me? I know. So basically questions of meaning and questions of identity. Who am I?

354
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,880
What do I do with myself now? What can I do? I found myself in that mix, just sitting there

355
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,200
pondering questions like the meaning of life, not in a recreational or intellectually kind of Ivy

356
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,360
Leaguey write a term paper way, but in a way that was very obviously relevant and therapeutic and

357
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,520
practical. These existential issues became very practical. And I that's where they belong, by the

358
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:04,360
way, I think. So sitting there, one of my friends and closest friend Justin would come visit me at

359
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,560
the burn unit eventually. And we find ourselves talking about art is this thing that humans do.

360
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,000
So I was looking for meaning making what humans how humans work with pain, how do humans work

361
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,760
with things they can't control. And that led me to thinking about art, why do human beings make art?

362
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,200
Why do we take the material of our life and create with it and fashion something from it

363
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,680
that wasn't there before but now exists thanks to us? It's kind of a stunning impulse that human

364
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,440
beings have, whether you're making art that's going to hang in a museum or you're just futzing

365
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,520
around your house. We are a very creative species. That was lighting up for me as a very important

366
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,160
and telling and that maybe, maybe the art world had something to teach me. So when I went back

367
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,680
to college that fall, I rejoined my class, I just had to finish the exam somewhere in the summer,

368
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,840
and I had a free semester. I was supposed to be in China the second semester of sophomore year

369
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,880
anyway. I didn't have to do much to jump back in with my class. And that was very important to me.

370
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,200
I wanted to be back with my buddies. That was a real driver. So anyway, I head back to Princeton,

371
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,920
join my class and change my major to art history to studying art. And that was a really consequential

372
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,000
decision when I'm actually very proud of. I've talked about it before on this show. I think

373
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,120
it's even come up during a discussion where someone asked, what's the best major that I

374
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,520
would recommend for someone who wants to go into medicine? And I don't have great insight on this,

375
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,800
but the one thing I generally suggest is anything other than pre-med. Because I think whether you

376
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,280
study art history or engineering or a foreign language and a foreign culture, you're probably

377
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,080
going to get something out of it that you would never get if you studied pre-med, yet most of

378
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,720
everything you study in pre-med, you're going to pick up in medical school. Which is not to say

379
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,240
that studying pre-med is not a good idea, but that's my two cents is that the people who came

380
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,320
in with totally different backgrounds often were people who didn't actually plan on going into

381
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:13,080
medicine as is the case in yours. The stories are usually pretty interesting. So when in the journey

382
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,160
of art history, do you then realize you want to make what I think is even probably a greater

383
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,080
stretch or leap, which is to actually go to medicine?

384
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:31,240
Yeah. So let me first see your two cents and raise a mind. Unless we want medicine to simply be

385
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,240
the stuff of technicians, of technical pursuit, which of course it is in many, many ways.

386
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,120
I teach in med school. I haven't as much lately, but I've spent a lot of time teaching in schools

387
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,560
of medicine and nursing and love it, love it, love it, love it. And if we view medicine

388
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:54,520
as a technical pursuit simply then okay, pre-med, focus, great. But the trick is of course in

389
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:02,120
medicine is our job is not just to, it's one thing to know details about molecules, how they work,

390
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,640
but it's a very different thing to know why it's amazing to have molecules in the first place. And

391
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,080
if you have not thought one way or another, it doesn't have to be art. It doesn't even have to

392
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,480
be through school per se, but you better find a way that if you're going to go into the healing

393
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:24,920
professions, the clinical professions, you better find a way to delve into why life is amazing and

394
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,720
horrifying. Why is it so hard to let go of? Why is it so hard to love life when you know it's going

395
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,120
away? What is this all about? In other words, questions around meeting an identity. One way

396
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:43,480
or another, weak physicians. And you can see what happens in a healthcare system that is somehow,

397
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,840
has crowded those thoughts out as somehow being irrelevant. You're left with a lot of zombies,

398
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,280
you're left with a lot of people with pulses, but have no idea why it's amazing to have a pulse in

399
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,480
the first place. So anyway, I can go on and on and on, but boy, I really, really, really love

400
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,600
the notion of people who study humanities then going into the healing professions. I think it's,

401
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,880
some people see that as like a left turn, like, oh, but I couldn't make a bigger case for art

402
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,440
history was some of the best preparation for medical school I could imagine. I think you're

403
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,040
bringing up really great points, BJ. I think medicine needs all of the above. You need people

404
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:28,200
who have probably gone incredibly deep on a very narrow subset of science. You need people who come

405
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,320
in with engineering backgrounds. You need people who come in with humanities backgrounds. And I

406
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,840
haven't, to be honest with you, paid much attention to how medical schools are doing these days in

407
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,040
terms of recruiting talent, but the war for talent looks like in medical school versus business

408
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,080
school versus law school versus other graduate schools. But I would hope that they've figured

409
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:55,000
out what you're saying and are making adjustments in that direction. I think they are. I know UCSF,

410
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,520
my alma mater has, they've really invited folks like myself. I didn't tell any of the pre meds

411
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,120
at Princeton. I did all the pre-med work after college. And UCSF has purposely attracted a lot

412
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,120
of folks who are starting med school a little later in life, have some other life experience,

413
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,400
et cetera. Something of a trend there. I'm with you, right? It takes all of the above. Medicine

414
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,360
is also a technical pursuit. I guess even if someone wants to be a pre-med major, take that

415
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,520
more conventional route, my advice to them was just make sure you actually love it. Just make

416
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,640
sure you love the nuts and bolts. You're not just doing chemistry just as a means to the end of

417
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,400
medical school. You find something to study that actually cultivates you loving something.

418
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,040
I think that's a major distinction. That could be engineering, that could be art,

419
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,360
that could be chemistry. Yeah. I've always felt that the history of science is also equally

420
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,640
beautiful. And so when you're studying physics and you're studying chemistry, to be able to

421
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:56,120
study it through the lens of how the people who discovered it went along their journey probably

422
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:01,000
creates or at least fosters some of that intellectual curiosity and passion that I think

423
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,560
can be found across multiple disciplines. But still, I want to get a better sense of

424
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:13,160
what made you decide to take a very bold step, which is I think to leave a comfort zone of you've

425
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,520
now spent four years doing very well. And you've got this degree in art history from one of the

426
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,600
best schools in the country. And you now decide to presumably go back and do a post-bac year to do a

427
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,640
bunch of pre-med courses to go and do something that seems about as orthogonal from that as

428
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,480
anything. I'm sure it had a lot to do with your experience, but can you speak specifically to what

429
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,920
it was and how it, for the lack of a better word, marinated over the previous four or five years?

430
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Yeah, no, absolutely. I can track this out. So one of the things the injuries did for me,

431
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,200
cut to a spoiler, one of the therapeutic endeavors here, one of the ways to get through

432
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,520
something is in some real ways to let yourself be changed by it. I knew enough that thanks to

433
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,600
my mother and the disability rights movement, that the goal for me was to not get back to where I

434
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,720
was before the injuries. First of all, practically speaking, it wasn't possible. I wasn't going to

435
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,040
get my old body back. Also, why cut myself off from all those lessons and all the experiences

436
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,920
that happened during that period? It's not something I could forget, but nor is it something

437
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:30,520
I would want to forget. It's too dang rich. So the idea was really always, I knew, versus the

438
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,560
sort of normal language and thoughts around disability, and it's something you would want

439
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,880
to overcome, put behind you. I think a lot of lay people or able-bodied people think the highest

440
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,720
compliment they can offer a disabled person is, oh, I look at you and I don't see disability at all.

441
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,360
I know what they're trying to say, and we can talk, we can open that up too, if you want it on

442
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,880
the road here. But you're trying to say, but in a way, it's not really a compliment. I don't want

443
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,960
people to ignore major parts of me just to look at me. I'm not getting over these injuries every

444
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,880
day. I'm reminded this is not something of the past, it's something I live every day. So when I

445
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,720
hear comments like that and you just feel that you're still aware that someone isn't really

446
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,800
seeing all of you, that's problematic in a number of ways. So I knew that I wanted to work with these

447
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,160
experiences. So that was a major, major theme. And medicine lit up just theoretically as a way

448
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,480
to put these experiences to use. And the linkage between studying art and studying human endeavor

449
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,880
and the study of medicine was not such a big leap. The interest, the throughline, the basocontinuo

450
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:45,320
for me was just being very interested in human beings, human pursuits, human endeavors,

451
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,560
and human creativity. Art was one application of those interests and medical science was another.

452
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,920
As I pondered what I wanted to do, I thought, well, gosh, medicine would be interesting. If a

453
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,840
doctor walked in to see me in the shoes that I'm wearing now, that would affect me. In a positive,

454
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,760
this was some way I was actively looking for an outlet where my injuries weren't something that

455
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,720
someone would look past or forgive, but were actually in some way something of an advantage.

456
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,200
And in this way, for me in medicine, I can tell you having this silhouette, having this body has

457
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,160
really been an advantage in a lot of ways. If the goal is empathizing with your patients and their

458
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,280
families, if your goal is seeing yourself as a fellow human being next to them, if you know

459
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,280
and believe that's where healing happens, then this kind of stuff is the best prop I've got going.

460
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,720
I really feel for my able-bodied clinicians who don't have some obvious source of pain and

461
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,240
suffering that imparts to your onlookers, imparts to your patients that you've been through some

462
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,960
stuff, you've scraped a barrel. So anyway, I'm going on and on about that. But to get back to

463
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,840
your question, that through line, I knew I had a hunch that that would serve me in medicine just

464
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:04,520
as it did in art and that I could apply these lessons into a therapeutic application of studying

465
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,200
perspective and meaning making. So medicine lit up as a potential thing that I could do that would be

466
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,360
fascinating, I could make a living, and I could exercise these lessons in an awful way.

467
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:23,080
So it makes unbelievable sense actually. And I suspect it changed many things for you. I mean,

468
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,520
look, if you just described yourself as a six foot four handsome guy who goes to Princeton,

469
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:36,840
you probably are a pretty ambitious guy. You're going to go off and study foreign relations and

470
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:43,720
do all sorts of cool things. And then everything kind of gets taken away in an instant. How does

471
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:50,520
that change your relationship with your own ambition or what it means to try and fail?

472
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,000
Had you ever failed at anything, by the way, athletically and sort of academically? Even

473
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,680
in the 90s, I imagine getting into Princeton was almost impossible. Yeah, I exceeded in ways,

474
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,960
but also so true. And I just had some green lights right in front of me. I had this amazing

475
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:12,040
education, I had some basic abilities. I can make a case for us that I had suffered and struggled

476
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,240
in various ways up until that point. And some things hadn't always gone right for me. But there

477
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,760
are such a such a different scale. There's such a different scale. But even as a kid, so in some

478
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,280
ways, no, I really hadn't experienced loss in some big way. But what I had experienced was lost

479
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,080
through people and others that I cared about watching Post-Folio syndrome take my mother's

480
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:38,760
physical function down, watching my sister struggle. So in some ways, part of my charge

481
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,560
as a young person was I hated that I didn't have more wrong with me. I felt there was a mismatch.

482
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,800
I felt at odds with the world, I felt this pain around me, but I didn't really feel like I had

483
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,000
my own access to it. My problem was I didn't really have anything to complain about. I knew

484
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,800
that life was really, really hard for many, many people. And internally, my life was hard

485
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,880
just imagining that. And in some ways, getting this new body. And in some ways, I have to say,

486
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:12,120
I made it such I could have cultivated this idea. But in a way, I got the body that much more mirrored

487
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:20,520
how I felt inside, fragmented, broken, confused, unintegrated, different. In some weird ways,

488
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:27,320
this body really the physiognomy of my body actually suited me in some real ways. I chose that.

489
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,440
I ran with that. It was true, but it also was a way for me to get into this body eventually and

490
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:39,480
quit wishing it were something else. By building on what this body was showing me, I knew the clever

491
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:45,240
thing was I knew what I was doing was building a case that this was the right body, that this was

492
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:52,040
a good body. This is the one for me. And then you can imagine that really cuts down on the regret

493
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:58,520
and the second guessing. And if only I had four limbs, then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's

494
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,800
the kind of mindset I was heading for and trying to cultivate. Now here again, brother, what did you

495
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:10,760
ask me that I went down on that? No, actually, I was talking about this idea of this could have

496
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,880
actually liberated you a little bit. Yes. Yes. And I think you've articulated that very neatly.

497
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,560
I want to come back to your sister. We all do this when we get to medical school is we start to

498
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:31,320
learn things that explain things we've seen in our past. For example, it's the first time you would

499
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:37,000
have learned, I suspect on some detail what the polio virus looks like and what a virus does,

500
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,560
how it is that your mom actually came to contract this virus and how a vaccine ultimately would go

501
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,240
on to make sure people wouldn't get that virus. And I would learn about the cardiovascular disease

502
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,440
that ran so deeply in my family and really understand the pathology of this. At some point,

503
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,680
did you start to suspect that your sister had whatever you want to call it, formal mental

504
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,320
illness, or did you not think that that was the case at all? Or how did you think about

505
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,400
your sister once you were in medical school and you began to learn about

506
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:15,720
mental health in a somewhat formal way? Quick answer here is no, I didn't. The only time I

507
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:21,960
actually let myself do that sort of the pathological overlay was after the fact, after she had died.

508
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,640
Leading up, it's telling, I mean, leading up to that, even through medical school,

509
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,440
studying manic depression, something that she was posthumously diagnosed with.

510
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,760
Oddly, it never registered as me reading about someone like my sister. Somehow,

511
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,200
and I referenced this a little bit earlier, was somehow the way she was or the our dynamic,

512
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:51,240
and it wasn't just me, it was my parents too, and her psychiatrist too. She was a master manipulator.

513
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,560
She could have anyone thinking exactly what she wanted them to think, and particularly me as her

514
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:03,640
little doting brother who just looked up to her. If I absorb anything from Lisa, it was that Lisa

515
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:09,240
was right. Lisa had it right, including her angst and her pain, that the world is a painful place,

516
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,080
and Lisa was reflecting that. But anything I saw, Lisa was the standard. She was right. Everyone

517
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:20,120
else was wrong. But she kind of rolled with what she was selling. I did roll with what she was

518
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:26,280
selling, and deeply, to the point where any idea of pathologizing her just completely bounced off

519
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:32,200
my head. It didn't register as relevant to her. She was the right one until she ended her life.

520
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:40,120
Then that prompted all sorts of revisiting that thinking. Also, then eventually, my parents,

521
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,520
what they did to try to make sense of all this, they went through her diaries with the psychiatrist.

522
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:51,480
It was in that act. I didn't join them in that, but I received the news, and I believe it, which

523
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:59,480
is just textbook bipolar. I mean, just outrageously textbook. Sometimes, I'd get my quitting, wanting

524
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,960
to quit medicine, did have something. This was right after Lisa died. On the list of why I want

525
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,040
to get out of medicine, I was like, Jesus, I didn't even see right under my nose. I'm trying

526
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:13,880
to become a healer person. I can't even acknowledge that my sister's sick. I just was demoralizing on

527
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,280
some level. But I also comforted myself. She had a shrink for better than a dozen years who didn't

528
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:28,120
notice this, who was somehow shocked that Lisa killed herself. Weirdly, I remember,

529
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,400
on the one hand here, I didn't see any of these signals coming. At the same time, I remember

530
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:39,240
where I was when I got the news of her death. I was with my dad in a car and my buddy Justin.

531
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:46,520
My mom called, and my dad picked up in his usual sing song, Yue, and there was a pause. Then he

532
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:54,360
immediately starts bawling. I knew instantaneously that Lisa was gone. When I heard it was suicide,

533
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:00,360
there was not a single cell of surprise in my body. That's just an observation. Also,

534
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,480
I'm telling you two things. On the one hand, I didn't see it coming. On the other hand,

535
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,440
I completely saw it coming. I don't know how to reconcile those two, but that's just the case.

536
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,040
You're in your last year of medical school when this happens. You've now alluded to this twice.

537
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,640
Were you not planning to do a residency at this point, or was this the event that tipped you

538
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,360
to not pursue your residency that following summer?

539
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,440
All through med school, I just assumed, because I wasn't so enamored with medical science,

540
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,280
per se. That was just a bag of tricks. I was interested in gaining a career in work that

541
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,640
allowed me to continue to think about these things and work with others and serve others around these

542
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,680
ideas of identity, of loss, and trauma. I just figured the best place for me to exercise that

543
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,480
would be in the rehab setting. I was beelining for physical medicine and rehabilitation.

544
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,920
Deep in medical school, UCSF didn't have a program. I went and did an externship,

545
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:05,800
rotation elsewhere at East. During that, I'd already begun to apply for residencies in rehab

546
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,560
medicine at that point. Then I heard a rotation. I had already committed to this field. I hated

547
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:17,640
it. The rotation was, I just really did not enjoy it for all sorts of reasons. One, it was all

548
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,480
mechanical. This idea of rehabilitation. First of all, the phrase is problematic. Rehab, the

549
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,640
goal would be to get back to where you were before the injury, which I've been saying, I just don't

550
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,760
believe is true. It's importantly untrue. This idea that it was so mechanical had nothing to do

551
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,640
with the personal transformations that happened. That's where I realized I was so interested.

552
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,760
That plus, I realized as I was walking out of patient's room, I kept hearing nurses say,

553
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,080
look, Timmy, you can be just like BJ. He's a doctor now. I could hear myself being served up

554
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:55,960
as a poster child. I didn't like the mechanics of the job. I didn't want to be a poster child.

555
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:02,040
Ipso facto. I was like, I got to get out of this. One of my promises to myself going into medical

556
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,640
school, having learned what I had learned was, hey, life's short, life's important, life's hard,

557
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,560
life's beautiful. I'm not going to just get stuck somewhere and have a sacrificial life.

558
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,360
I know a lot of our colleagues in medicine who went into it because their parents were doctors

559
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,640
and they hated it, but what else am I going to do now? I've gone this far or one way or another,

560
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,880
they just sign up, willfully sign up for a life of misery. I knew I wasn't going to do that.

561
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,000
I promised myself. At this point, another thing I learned from the injuries, which was so critical,

562
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,440
was the ability to, I was much less afraid now, I was much less afraid of failure. I was much less

563
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,240
afraid of falling. You asked me earlier if I had anything really go wrong before in my life. In

564
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,240
some ways, the answer is no. I was a very frightful, melancholy child, sensitive, but to which I end

565
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,960
up manifesting as fearful at times. Now, I was going the other direction, man. Fear, I had a

566
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:00,280
totally different relationship with fear. I saw falling as a skill. Anyway, the bottom line there

567
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:06,520
was I was willing to try medicine and willing to dump it. In fact, it felt empowering to do so.

568
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,320
It was a reminder that my life was bigger than just a job choice. Anyone's life is.

569
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,160
There I am deep in med school already applying for residency. I said,

570
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:21,000
screw this. As I promised myself, I called and dropped out of the match, talked to my dean,

571
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,960
said, hey, I'm finished. I'll graduate, but I'm going to do other things. She talked me into,

572
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,280
she said, okay, okay, right? I had begun to be disillusioned with medicine before my sister's

573
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,320
death, but that was the straw that broke the camel's back. As you've referenced, I think

574
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,760
we bring in idealism one way or another into the healing professions. Then you have to go through

575
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,480
this process of disillusionment where the practice of medicine isn't necessarily jiving with the

576
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,760
ideals that you bring into it. That can be very stressful. But I do think it's important for any

577
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:02,600
trainee at one point or another to go through some disillusionment. My response to that disillusionment

578
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:08,920
was to get the hell out of it, especially as I realized I did like rehab medicine. Again,

579
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,880
Lisa's death was just proof that I'm just not, I don't want to do this and I'm not cut out for it.

580
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,720
Then I got talked into doing my internship, that first postdoc year. My family was in

581
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:26,520
Milwaukee at the time. I had gone away, I had left home when I was 15. Given Lisa had just died,

582
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:32,680
given I didn't know what I was doing in some ways, I said, okay, while moving with mom and dad, we'll

583
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:38,840
recongeal as a family, spend that year together and I'll bang out my internship and just get that

584
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,480
done and be done and move on. But it was during that internship that I stumbled into palliative

585
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:50,520
care and that's where everything changed again. So, PJ, what is it that you saw during your

586
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:58,760
internship that both made you change your decision leaving medicine and also concentrated or focused

587
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:05,960
you on an area of medicine called palliative care? So a couple of things happened. One of the things

588
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,640
I just stumbled into this elective during my internship. We have basically one month of an

589
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,840
elective time if I remember correctly, maybe more, but I had spent a little time with a

590
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:22,440
hospice doc at one point. Actually, my best friend's mother was involved in hospice and she turned me

591
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,800
on to the idea. But again, I was so hell bent on rehab medicine figuring that was the place for me

592
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,840
and wasn't sure that I had anything special to offer beyond that sort of rehab setting.

593
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,200
But I had absorbed that hospice was simply just where people go for the final days of life.

594
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,880
That was, I thought I understood what that meant. But anyway, I stumbled into this palliative care

595
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,040
elective at the Medical College of Wisconsin, which just happens to have been one of the early

596
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,320
adopters of palliative care. David Weissman, an oncologist there, had built one of the early

597
00:56:53,320 --> 00:57:00,040
great palliative care programs, just happened to be there. And on that first day, we went and saw a

598
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:06,760
patient. I watched David talk to her about code status. This was in the hospital. He was a woman

599
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,880
with heart disease, advanced heart disease. And David was trying to talk to her about her wishes,

600
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,320
what kind of care she wanted for and trying to impart how serious her heart condition had become.

601
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,720
Tricky conversations, very emotionally, psychologically loaded content, really tricky.

602
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,920
The zone that medicine traditionally does not handle very well. And so I'd seen all these

603
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,080
counterpoints. But I hear I'm watching this guy sit with this woman, sits on the edge of her bed

604
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:38,760
with her, just immediately this very different rapport. He's talking to her like a human being,

605
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:46,360
not hovering over her like a superior, someone who's there to fix her. He was there as a fellow

606
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,080
human being. And it just showed it in his body language and his tone and his word choice. And

607
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:57,320
it was beautiful. And he said to her, and I just watched how she responded to him. And it was

608
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,160
remarkable. And he said something to her. He tried to get to the code status question, said something

609
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:07,160
essentially like, when you die, do you want us to help that process along and make sure you're

610
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,520
comfortable through that process? Or do you want us to really fight that? You want us to go to war

611
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:19,000
with that notion and do our best to pull you back? Something along those lines. But the magic moment

612
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,280
was him looking at her in the eye and saying, when you die, of course, as human beings, that's

613
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:30,920
a very reasonable thing to say, because we all die. It's not if, it's when. In the medical setting,

614
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,600
that is not the way these conversations generally work. I was so moved by watching this,

615
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,080
and he dared to acknowledge this woman's death. And what I saw on her face was not shock or anger,

616
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:52,360
but relief that this man was talking to her plainly about her life. And it was so gorgeous,

617
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,240
so poignant. That moment really, really stuck with me. And as I got to one home that night,

618
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,640
I remember thinking about it, it's like, well, this is what I've been looking for. This is,

619
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:09,320
in this world, we take, in the pout of care world, illness, disability, death are normal.

620
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:15,960
They're not anomalous. This field treats these life events as normal life events, which of course

621
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:21,800
they are. The starting point for pout of care is something's happening that you can't fix,

622
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:28,440
that you can't change. And that was, for me, all along, in rehab, you could see what would be

623
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,160
similar. Like rehab, the events already happened. Something's gone wrong. Now what you do. I knew I

624
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,600
was interested in the now what. But here, this field was digging into all the, it's not just

625
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,760
the angle of the joint it was concerned with, but the angle of the thoughts and the way that we see

626
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,320
ourselves and the words we choose to describe our place in the world and how we either suffer for

627
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:55,320
those words or how we really can find ourselves doing something more therapeutic. And it was such

628
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:02,840
a craft. It was such a, a stuff of words, not of an instrument. So anyway, I really was really,

629
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:09,240
really moved. But the first axis that opened up was, I'm not here to fix people. I'm here to be

630
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,760
with people as they find their way, as they deal with things that they can't control. And that was

631
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,560
a hope for me in so many ways. How would you explain to someone the difference between palliative

632
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:25,000
care and hospice, which I think many people use interchangeably, but I don't think they really are

633
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,600
interchangeable, are they? They are not. Thank you, thank you, thank you. A quick public service

634
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:36,680
announcement because it's a really big problem for a number of reasons. But palliative care is simply

635
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,800
the interdisciplinary pursuit of the quality of life. Within the context of serious illness,

636
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:47,560
palliative care is that mode of care which helps you feel as well as possible, emotionally,

637
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:53,800
physically, spiritually, you name it. My job is to help you deal with the facts of your life and to

638
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,600
feel as well as you can. There is nothing in a definition of palliative care that makes it that

639
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:04,200
you need to be dying anytime soon. Time is not mentioned. There is, death is included in this,

640
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,960
but it's not the focus. It's simply the pursuit of quality of life. And if you need to pose it,

641
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:14,920
like we do in medicine, if you need to have objects of your efforts, an enemy, as it were,

642
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,360
the thing we're after, palliative care, the thing that we treat is suffering versus disease.

643
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:27,000
There's a lot to that. We can unpack that. So that's palliative care. Hospice is a subset of

644
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,200
palliative care, which is that mode, that type of care, but reserved for the end of life, the final

645
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,480
months of life. So hospice really is essentially end of life care, is palliative care that's applied

646
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,760
at the end of life. But that's just hospice. With palliative care, there's no mention of time. You

647
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,680
just have to be struggling. You just have to be interested in quality of life. You don't have to

648
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:52,760
be dying anytime soon. This is a huge, huge distinction because of all of our death folks.

649
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,200
Because they think palliative care and end of life care are hospice are the same.

650
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,800
No one wants to talk about it. No one wants to face that because of all the baggage around death.

651
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:07,720
So consequently, people suffer for years where they could get a lot more support from palliative

652
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,520
care. But because of this misunderstanding, they don't elect palliative care because they think

653
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,600
that's only relevant for them if they're dying soon and nothing could be farther from the truth.

654
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,840
So does that make sense? It really does, yes. And I appreciate that distinction.

655
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:27,560
Good. What do you think it is about us as a species? I can only speak to us because other

656
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:33,880
species, I don't think, share our metacognition. But why are we in such denial about death? It's

657
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:39,720
been said by so many people, we are all terminally ill. And yet most of us, myself, certainly

658
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:46,600
included, don't act that way at times. We tend to fixate on things that absolutely don't matter.

659
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:52,520
For many people, there's frank denial of this thing. It's out there with some sort of abstract

660
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:58,520
idea, but it's certainly nothing that warrants any attention in terms of decisions one makes

661
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,600
today. That's really the first question I have, and then there's other things I want to explore

662
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,840
here with you. But what is your take on our just inability to look at death?

663
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:13,000
I think for starters, I know in my field and elsewhere, for folks who have kind of dared to

664
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,960
turn their attention to mortality or have been forced to, then you look back on the rest of the

665
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:23,880
world and you see a world so invested in ignoring this part of life that it can feel a little

666
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,760
perverse. And I think a lot of us are quick to say the world's Americans in particular are in

667
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:34,360
denial. And there's some truth to that for sure. But I also think we should cut each other some

668
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:41,720
slack, just physiologically, neurohormonally, we are wired to run away from death. Any threat to

669
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:49,080
our existence, we have deep wiring that makes us fight that thing or flee it or go limp. So we have

670
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:55,560
that impulse in us. And then I think on top of that, there's as old as human beings has been this

671
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:01,720
acknowledge that we die, that any adult in this world, maybe not even just adults, one way or

672
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:07,160
another, human beings eventually come to the realization that death happens, including their

673
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:13,960
own death. And I'm not sure that any other species has to live, has to walk through life

674
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:20,040
feeling that. So it is quite a predicament we humans have. It's elemental. It is at the root

675
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:26,760
of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It's a root of many religious belief systems, a lot of philosophy

676
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,600
of thought. It's at the root of song and artwork. I mean, this is a huge, huge subject that humans

677
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,640
really, really struggle to wrap their heads around. So I just want to give us plenty of

678
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:43,000
breath. And I don't want us to be ashamed that we haven't figured out this death thing. So on top of

679
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,920
those old threads, modern times, the last 150 years, medical science, we're sort of a victim of

680
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:57,640
our own success. Medical science has gotten much better. It's easy to be seduced. My life has been

681
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:03,880
saved by medicine. It's easy to believe that medicine can forestall death, perhaps indefinitely.

682
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:09,640
So you throw all these things together and social cues around anti-aging this and that, and you got

683
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:15,160
to stay healthy and beautiful forever and put all that stuff together. And we've conspired to set up

684
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:22,520
a pretty tricky relationship to this piece of our nature. No harm, no foul. But I think the reason

685
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:29,160
to push back on this is A, people die much more miserable than they need to because they haven't

686
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:34,680
dared to look at this thing called death before it's too late. And because also we have a healthcare

687
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:40,120
system that it's not an intuitive thing to navigate anymore. And thanks to our technology, it's not

688
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:45,880
impossible to end up on a series of machines and that by some definition of life, you have a pulse,

689
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,760
but that's not a life that a lot of us want to live is hooked up to machines. So we have this

690
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,720
weird technological moment that you can kind of live forever by some very reduced definition of

691
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:01,400
life. Anyway, there's a little bit of a rundown why it's so dang hard to turn our attention to this.

692
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:09,000
But when people do, and I'm coming to the climax here brother, but one of the things you learn

693
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,720
whether through religious and philosophical thinking or frankly in clinical thinking,

694
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:21,880
whether by choice or by force, once you have to actually try to stare this thing called mortality,

695
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:28,040
this thing called death in the eye, not only do you realize that, hey, maybe it's not so terrifying

696
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:34,200
after all, and that you can do it, but it has a secondary effect of once you come to terms with

697
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:40,760
your time is precious, and that time is relatively short, or at least not endless,

698
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:45,480
it has a secondary effect of helping you really, really appreciate what you have.

699
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:52,440
The fact that it ends is what makes it precious. So there are reasons why we don't look at death,

700
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,160
and there are some really good reasons to help each other find a way to do so.

701
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,480
I think that's just such an eloquent description of what I consider to be a huge dialectical

702
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:10,520
challenge, which is the problem that I focus on BJ in medicine is how to live longer, how to do

703
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:17,160
so without requiring the heroics of medicine at end of life. So just as you became disillusioned

704
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:22,680
with medicine, so too did I. But it was for a slightly different reason, which was, boy,

705
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:29,640
we sure do put a staggering amount of resources and effort into things that with probably one

706
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:35,160
tenth of this effort could have been forced all or prevented altogether. And I didn't think I could

707
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,400
do anything about it. So I left for a period of time before ultimately coming back to it.

708
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:48,120
But I think that what you said is I completely agree that we can do both, right? We can do

709
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:55,560
everything in our power to maximize our lives here, just as medicine allowed you to live that day.

710
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:02,040
There's a very good chance at a different hospital under different settings, you would have died 30

711
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:07,160
years ago, but you didn't. Now you're still going to die, just as I am, of course, and everyone

712
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:13,080
listening to this is going to die. So we can do both. We can figure out a way to live the best

713
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:19,160
life possible, the longest life possible, should we choose that to be the case. But none of that

714
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:24,920
diminishes what you've said. And I think that's the part that a lot of people don't appreciate,

715
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:31,480
is that it's one or the other and it can't be both. Amen. You just hit on a real kind of a

716
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:37,000
root cause. One of the ways we struggle so much these days is from our structures, our constructs,

717
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,160
our ways of thinking. And as long as we think it's either life or death, that either you love life

718
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:48,920
and try everything you can do to extend it, or you love death and just completely accept that it's

719
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:55,000
going to come today. This false dichotomies are the problem. And I'm so with you, and it's one of

720
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,040
the reasons I'm so excited to be invited on your podcast, but it's because our relationship with

721
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:06,040
death is maybe a problem or just under-realize. But if there's a problem here, it's the false

722
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:12,280
dichotomy. It's the either or thinking when the both and thinking is really where it's at. So I

723
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,120
love that you and others are trying to think through how to live longer and live better.

724
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:22,600
I love life. My relationship to death, even my acceptance of death, is only to do with my love

725
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:29,080
of life. It would be a real shame of a shortcut that if in order to prepare yourself for the

726
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:35,320
inevitability of death, you somehow stopped loving life. You somehow welcomed depression.

727
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:41,080
So therefore, you wouldn't love life so much. So therefore, you're ready to die because life

728
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:47,800
kind of sucks. It could be so, so much better than that. And if we can find a way to include death

729
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:53,800
into our view of reality, like I don't love death. I love reality. And reality happens to include

730
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:01,320
death. Therefore, I'll deal with death. I'm in no way concerted around it. I'm in no way incentivized

731
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:06,200
to make death happen. Again, I appreciate you having this conversation with me. I think there's

732
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:13,000
a lot to be learned by pushing past the either or of this. You've spent more time with people who

733
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,320
are closer to death than almost anybody listening to this, certainly. You're in a profession that

734
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:25,720
very few people go into. As you've pointed out, there are many reasons for that. Do you get the

735
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:34,360
sense that when someone is at the end of their life, they are more afraid of death in the sense

736
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:44,520
of being gone or the act of dying and presumably what the actual mechanism of death and or suffering

737
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:50,360
is? Yeah, it's a really great distinction, a very helpful one clinically. Presentation may be

738
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:56,280
someone's freaked out about dying or some existential anxieties. But of course, as is

739
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,200
the case with these things, it pays to look a little bit more closely and see some things out

740
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:06,520
here. And one of the major things to tease out is, are you afraid of the dying process, like you're

741
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,400
mentioning here, like the suffering you imply that must happen during the dying process? Is that what

742
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,720
you're picturing? And therefore, is that the source of your anxiety? Or are you really afraid

743
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:21,480
to be dead? Whether your belief system suggests there's a Judgment Day and a reckoning, perhaps

744
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:28,680
a hell, perhaps who knows what? Are you afraid of what may be coming next? Are you afraid to be gone?

745
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:34,920
Are you afraid to miss out? Does it freak you out that the world will go on without you? A major

746
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,040
poll here or a major divide, a crossroads, let's say, is are you afraid of dying or are you afraid

747
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:46,040
of being dead? The former, one of the reasons that it teases out is the former afraid of dying. Well,

748
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:51,880
we know a fair amount about that. There's physiology to mark. There are medications to help.

749
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:58,120
There are ways to help a body come down for a gentle landing, as I say. There's no need to be

750
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,200
miserable and in pain at the end of life. For the most part, we can do a lot with medications. We

751
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,640
can do a lot to ease the suffering at the end of life in the dying process. So the answer, if

752
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:13,560
that's your fear, then the answer is reassurance. If your concern is being dead, well, I don't have

753
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:18,840
answers for you, but I can, as a fellow traveler, I can accompany you there. We can think about that

754
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:24,440
together. We can talk about it. And then we can make a life that responds to that big question.

755
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:29,080
So if you're afraid of your belief system, as you're afraid of a Judgment Day, we'll let that spur

756
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:35,080
you to behave a little differently in the time you have left. Or let that help you wade into

757
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:41,000
non-duality. Let that help you wade into the world beyond yourself. That's my favorite response. If

758
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,520
anyone's interested in living forever, my favorite means to living forever is to think about the

759
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,240
world beyond yourself. Invest yourself in the world beyond yourself. So when your self dies,

760
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,760
that thing you love keeps going. Anyway, this is where it gets really, really fascinating,

761
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:02,280
the relationship between self and other and what to do about that, religious thinking,

762
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:07,960
spiritual pursuits. This is what can open up when you admit that you're freaked out to be dead.

763
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:15,880
It's such an interesting way you explain the idea of, again, for me, it's very clearly the latter,

764
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,120
not the former. And I guess that's just because I have the luxury of medical training. And I

765
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:26,360
understand where and when one can draw the line for themselves with respect to what measures are

766
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:32,520
taken, how heroically they are, and obviously the power of medicine to greatly reduce the suffering.

767
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:40,920
But it's this other piece of missing your family, missing out on future generations, leaving behind

768
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:46,200
people you love. To me, those are the hardest things. And of course, your point is you can

769
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:51,320
live through those things, but you have to do something about it. It doesn't happen automatically.

770
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:56,280
You have to make the investment. And the irony is the time to do that is while we're alive.

771
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,640
Amen. You just gave me chills. You just completed the circle. Yep.

772
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:06,520
Which almost suggests that palliative care needs to begin much earlier in life.

773
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,320
Amen. Which is why it's such a shame that we forestall and keep it at bay when it's this thing

774
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:17,560
that could help us so, so much, whether actually a pout of care referral or a pout of care mindset.

775
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,960
But one way or another, finding our way into this subject while we've got plenty of road in front of

776
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:29,320
us is absolutely the right best way. It seems that there's a continuum where you have life,

777
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:37,640
you have acute illnesses, more life, acute illnesses, chronic illnesses, life and death.

778
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:45,640
The hospital and the entire medical system is really only geared to treat with the acute

779
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:53,880
problems. It has virtually no tool dealing with life or even chronic conditions and certainly

780
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,640
not death. I don't want to get into the why is that the case? We can sit here and debate about

781
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,520
incentives all day long. I think it's straightforward. I mean, I think we understand

782
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:10,680
that the incentives are such that reimbursement follows the treatment of acute conditions and

783
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:17,160
to some extent chronic conditions. I guess the more relevant question is, what would have to

784
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:26,680
change to realign the focus of resources to make it such that medicine could be more about helping

785
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:32,840
people live and then helping them die when that time comes? As a part and parcel of helping them

786
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:38,200
live, then relate those two things. So I think a couple of answers to your question. I think one

787
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:45,880
is in a big office somewhere at HHS when they're trying to redesign a healthcare system and even

788
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,640
redraft a mission statement. I would challenge HHS to read the definition of palliative care and tell

789
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:56,360
me why the definition of palliative care isn't the mission of all of healthcare. So one answer to

790
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:01,080
your question is you can see that both the strengths of the healthcare system and the

791
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:06,520
trouble that comes from it is a design flaw because you and I both know healthcare is littered with

792
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:13,080
people who really, really care and are trained at the hilt. And yet the care we're able to meet out

793
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,720
too often falls short. I don't think the problem is the people. I think the problem is there's a

794
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:23,240
design flaw. And for my money, the design flaw has to do with the system is focused on disease,

795
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:29,000
not on the people dealing with disease. And the second you make it about the person living with

796
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,240
the disease, not the disease itself, well, you've welcomed all sorts of things into the mix beyond

797
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:39,560
just their physiology and anatomy. You've welcomed their social, emotional, and spiritual

798
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:45,640
lives into the mix. You've also welcomed your humanness into the mix as being relevant,

799
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:51,080
you as a clinician being relevant beyond just your technical skills, which will push back on

800
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:56,440
burnout for one thing. You've also made yourself in service of a human condition, which means for

801
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:02,760
us clinicians, the expectation management, we're not expected to work miracles. We know that it's

802
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,560
someday everyone's going to die and that that's not a failure for us. We didn't, the person didn't

803
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:13,880
succumb to the disease and we doctors didn't fail to make them live forever. Then once we align

804
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:20,280
healthcare with the human condition and we're serving human beings, so much of the trouble

805
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,880
will work itself out because we will be designed around the right thing. So that's one answer to

806
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,280
your question. I think it's that simple and that hard on some level. And then medical scores,

807
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,200
medical training would have to follow suit and revisit how we think about these things.

808
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:39,240
I mean, for example, think about your medical school training, Peter. 100% of your patients die.

809
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:44,440
Any rotation that you ever go through, no condition befalls 100% of your patients,

810
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,720
but 100% of our patients suffer. 100% of our patients die. And given that, wouldn't you think

811
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:57,000
that a responsible medical school curriculum that we would start and end day one and the last day

812
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,400
would be around conversations like we're having now. The pout of care would not need to be a

813
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:07,400
specialty. It would be baked in to how all of medicine works. So for my money, that's a major

814
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:13,800
thing that needs to happen. Policy will flow, et cetera. I also think to make that happen and to not

815
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:20,840
wait for that happen, that we human beings, we people, irrespective of our professions,

816
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:26,600
need to kind of come together as a society and to take these issues on, especially right now when

817
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,480
we're all so polarized and so divided and so aware about the things that we don't have in common

818
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:36,840
with each other. What a perfect time to revisit where we actually do have so much in common.

819
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,880
And where we do have so much in common revolves around everything we're talking about right now.

820
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:48,520
Black, white, rich, poor, young, old, I don't care. These issues affect all of us. This is a genuine

821
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:54,280
way for us to work on the points in common. So we can make political comments about why now is right

822
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,800
for that. The healthcare system itself can't keep doing what it's doing and can't keep death

823
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:05,240
the enemy because it's going to lose that war again and again and again. And the one way you can

824
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:12,520
keep score on that is just cost. Yep. Cost alone is a metric by which we're losing. Healthcare is

825
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:18,040
obviously one of two things that will either bankrupt the United States if they can't print

826
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:23,640
their way out of it or create sort of seismic economic shifts. And I do think that part of it

827
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:30,040
is, as you said, we've taken the wrong strategy in a war that probably ought to be deemed more

828
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:35,480
of a truce and put our resources in the wrong place. Can I ask you a question on that though?

829
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:42,360
Yeah. Yeah. Why would you say that we are so focused on acute care and not on chronic care?

830
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:47,160
If most everybody is going to die of most of chronic conditions, et cetera? I should say,

831
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,640
I think we do focus a lot on chronic care. I just don't think we're good at it. So what I meant to

832
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:57,640
say was I think where medicine is very good is on acute care. And I think where medicine is

833
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:03,400
really bad is on chronic care. And I think those are the two things it works on. It has nothing to

834
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:10,120
do with sort of healthy life to prevent acute or chronic issues. And it has nothing to do with

835
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,040
death. So that's sort of, yeah, just thanks for asking me to clarify that. But yes, I think we

836
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:20,040
disproportionately focus on chronic despite our relative lack of success with it. Why do we keep

837
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:26,040
doing that? Do you have a sense? Well, I think in some cases we don't know what to do to prevent

838
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:32,680
the condition. So certain conditions never show up as acute. Cancer does not show up acutely. I

839
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:36,920
shouldn't say that it kind of does, but it doesn't really fall under the rubric of acute care medicine

840
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:43,000
the way appendicitis does. But we don't really have a great sense of cancer. You know, we know

841
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,160
smoking and obesity are the two greatest risk factors for it, but there's many other risk factors,

842
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:54,760
including chance that we probably don't understand. And even the ones that we do understand,

843
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:02,360
like obesity, we don't really have the infrastructure to help with prevention. So you talked about how

844
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:09,240
in medical school we didn't have a single course on dying. We also didn't have a single course on

845
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:16,280
nutrition or exercise or stress management or the psychology of eating and our relationship to food

846
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,320
and how you can help patients make better choices with nutrition and things like that. So I don't

847
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:25,880
buy the narrative that we have an obesity crisis just because sort of people are fat, dumb, and

848
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:31,400
lazy. I think we live in a toxic food environment and we don't have a healthcare system that's

849
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:37,000
really geared to help people out of it because frankly, physicians aren't compensated to do that.

850
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,640
You just don't have the billable structure in which you can do these things. So instead, I think we

851
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:52,040
focus on where our tools are and our tools are drugs. Drugs become a good tool to use in a chronic

852
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:58,040
condition setting. Right. I think I'd add to that, maybe to encapsulate this list three ways. One is

853
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:04,280
the design flaw that we're the phobic and we see ourselves as victors when we cure something, when

854
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:10,840
we fix something. So chronic illness by definition is something that we can't fix. So I think it

855
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,440
presents us with a sense of failure, which I think is an emotional barrier to developing it

856
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:21,800
further. That's one big piece of the design flaw. I think a second big piece of the design flaw is

857
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:27,480
the way the busyness of medicine goes. We are left to see medicine as a series of transactions,

858
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:34,600
which in acute care, it makes a lot more sense. In chronic care, it becomes part of the experience.

859
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,880
You're not kicking this thing out of the body. You've got to learn to live with it. So

860
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:44,040
illness and health becomes protracted over time and therefore becomes an experience. But we're

861
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:48,840
wired for transactions. We don't have the systems and structures in place to be cultivating

862
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,320
experiences together with our patients. That's the second thing. And I think the third thing

863
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:59,560
is this reimbursement and we are incentivized away from thinking about care over time. So anyway,

864
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:04,600
I just want to complete that question for both of us. I think that's why we're where we're at.

865
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,920
Yeah, I appreciate that structure that you've put to it. I want to ask you about

866
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:15,080
patients that you interact with during hospice. So these are now going to be the patients who are

867
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:21,960
probably in the final months of their life. And that could be cancer is obviously a very common

868
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:27,240
pathway that you'll interact with hospice patients. Is that the most common proximate cause of death

869
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:32,520
for hospice patients in the United States? Cancer? Yes. No, it is no longer the majority.

870
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,480
Until recently, it's less than 50% now. Progressive neurological illnesses are on the rise,

871
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:44,200
cardiovascular, organ failure, but yeah, fewer than 50% of deaths. The hospice deaths are cancer

872
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:51,080
at this point. What do patients say most to you? When I was in medical school, I did a stint at the

873
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:57,640
National Cancer Institute and then I went back there for my formal training fellowship and people

874
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:03,640
that came to the NCI to where I was and I suspect to elsewhere in the NCI were generally patients

875
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:08,120
who had progressed through all forms of treatment, all standard treatments. So they had metastatic

876
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:13,560
disease that had failed to respond to any form of treatment. So therefore they were at the NCI for

877
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:18,680
experimental treatment. And at least for the type of cancer we worked on, the survival was between

878
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:25,640
10 and 20%, meaning 80 to 90% of the people we met were going to die very soon within six months,

879
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:31,080
typically. I remember obviously feeling very attached to many of them and also spending time

880
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:36,520
with them and asking them questions like what do they wish they could do? How do they want to spend

881
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:42,120
this time that they have left? And sometimes they would share regrets. And I always remember thinking,

882
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:47,000
I wish I could write a book about this, just interviewing people like this, but it felt,

883
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,760
it didn't feel right to me. It was one of those things that just felt like it should be shared,

884
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,640
but I wouldn't know how to share it. I suspect you've had more of those discussions than you

885
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:01,320
can remember. And I wonder what things you've learned from them. These vicarious deathbed

886
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,640
moments. I have a lot of them. I think a lot of us in this field and maybe a mess in general like

887
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:11,320
to say how privileged we are to be in this position, how lucky we are to have our patients let us in

888
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:17,240
to this very poignant moments. It's so intimate. So yeah, there's a lot to be said for those moments,

889
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:21,800
including your wanting to protect those moments and not necessarily ram them into a book. Although

890
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:27,800
there sure is a way to do that skillfully, the world could benefit from it. But the regrets that

891
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:33,480
pop in that I see at the end of life, the conventional ones are sure you hear people say

892
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,360
things like, I wish I had spent more time with my family than at the office and things like that.

893
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:43,320
Yeah, sure. That comes up. But in a way by some, someone's actually in their deathbed.

894
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:48,040
And again, these days, most of us dying from chronic illnesses, that means we have some

895
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:53,400
protracted period of time to think about our death. Specifically, we will be introduced to

896
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:58,600
the thing that will end our life, months or years in advance. And so by the time those folks get

897
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:03,000
around to their end of their life, they're beyond the sort of pat regrets. They shouldn't work so

898
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,200
much, for example. Oftentimes, if they're regretting anything, they're hanging on to anything,

899
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:14,840
including regrets. It's more likely, I wish I had dared to love more. I wish I hadn't been

900
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:22,600
so afraid. I wish I had just let myself be myself. I wish I hadn't been so hard on myself or criticize

901
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:27,720
myself. Those regrets, they all have something to do in common. And the commonality is, it's sort of

902
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:33,800
like oftentimes a common pathway is they wish they had let themselves come to terms with death

903
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:39,560
earlier in their lives, because it would have changed the decisions they made. I think one of

904
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:43,320
the things that people come to realize on their deathbed, and one of the things that I saw at

905
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:51,000
getting close to my own was really grasping it in our guts that death is coming no matter what we do.

906
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:56,520
Even in your work, promoting a longer life, as you said earlier, doesn't mean that death isn't

907
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:03,160
still coming. It's coming later. Given that, this is the freedom that comes from reckoning with

908
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:08,600
death, which is, if okay, you're telling me that no matter what I do, if I'm a good person, a bad

909
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:14,440
person, I eat my veggies, I don't eat my veggies, I smoke, I don't smoke, whatever it is, either way,

910
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:21,000
if I'm going down, eventually. In other words, if failure is in this way, quote unquote, failure is

911
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:28,280
guaranteed, then in some ways, the pressure's off. The pressure's on for me to take my life seriously,

912
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:34,440
but the pressure's off for me to get everything just perfect. There's this biphasic effect that

913
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:41,560
I see in myself and some of my patients, which is they see the grip that fear has had on them,

914
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:49,560
distraction is done to them, and they realize that no, man, the only thing I have to lose is

915
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:54,200
wasting my time. I'm not going to waste my time. I'm going to take this stuff seriously. I'm going

916
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:59,080
to say what I want to say to people. I'm going to do what I want to do, because if failure is

917
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:03,400
guaranteed, then I'm no longer, it doesn't make much sense to be afraid of failure anymore,

918
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,320
or not be limited by it, because I'm going to fall either way, so I might as well try.

919
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:13,640
Death gives me the reason to try and gives me the reason or the way of forgiving myself for,

920
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:20,200
quote unquote, failing. Really, in this way, it can be a real liberating force, and I see

921
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:25,240
people grok that, and the regrets have something to do with not coming to that place sooner.

922
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:34,920
You presumably encounter patients who have the proverbial dying wish, never saw the Grand Canyon,

923
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,880
and I really want to go and see it, never seen the Mona Lisa, and I want to see it, or I've never

924
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:47,400
taken this vacation with my family. How much of your work is trying to help patients navigate

925
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:54,440
those wishes medically? For example, is someone strong enough to physically go to the Grand Canyon,

926
01:28:54,440 --> 01:29:00,360
and can you put in a last ditch heroic effect to get them there? How much of that do you do?

927
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:05,080
Some. I'm involved with an organization called the Dream Foundation out of Santa Barbara, and

928
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,480
what they do for a living as an organization is help make those trips to the Grand Canyon,

929
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,720
or whatever those final wishes actually happen for adults in this country. It's beautiful.

930
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:19,720
And I have been engaged in some of that with some patients, whether on handful occasions where

931
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:25,000
someone was here who may have lived here for a long time, but grew up elsewhere and wanted to

932
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,360
get home, as it were, back to the Philippines or back to somewhere else, and helping this sort of

933
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:35,240
one last trip happen. I've been involved with that a lot. I've been involved with some bedside

934
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:40,280
weddings in a hospital just before someone died. I've been involved with some trips done to the

935
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:46,520
Grand Canyon. So some of that, that is true. Some of my job, especially if I can be engaged

936
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:51,880
with someone soon enough while there's still energy and time to work with, then making those

937
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:58,600
last wishes happen is great. It's fun. It's great work. It's powerful. It's delightful, and it's

938
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:05,320
stunning. But I will say, and so I do some of that, but for whatever reason, I'm more engaged with

939
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:15,240
people around letting go of that wish or that need to go see the Grand Canyon or whatever it

940
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:21,480
may be, of letting go of the things that they're not going to be able to do, or at least grokking

941
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:28,280
that fact. So yes, sometimes the response is to mobilize energy to do that thing. I'd say more

942
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:34,280
often and right alongside that wish is also helping them see the world and see themselves in

943
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:40,680
the world in such a way that they can let go of those things that they never got to, because they

944
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:46,920
realize the things that they're not going to get to is a very long list. And on a developmental

945
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:52,360
level, you've got to find a way to come to terms with all the things you're not going to get to do.

946
01:30:52,920 --> 01:31:00,280
So that's where I spend a lot of my time. Movies lead us to believe that people become enlightened

947
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:07,480
and hyper-transcendent at the end of life. But my experience with patients at the end of their

948
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:13,640
lives is that oftentimes they're so heavily medicated that they're not really even able to

949
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:18,680
communicate much with their loved ones. And that's the price we'll pay to keep them comfortable,

950
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:24,360
especially patients with metastatic cancer. The pain would be so debilitating, it would be inhumane

951
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:31,160
to let them suffer without those medications. And frankly, in the circumstances when we're lucky

952
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:37,880
enough to do so, we can get expressed direction from the patients before they get there that,

953
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:42,840
hey, I don't want to suffer and I don't want a breathing tube put into my chest. I don't want

954
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:47,320
to be intubated and I don't want you to do chest compressions on me when my heart stops. I just

955
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:54,280
want enough medicine to be comfortable. And so you don't have these sort of diving into a person's

956
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:58,600
soul in the last day of their life kind of thing. Is that your experience also?

957
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:04,760
Absolutely, it is. There are exceptions, but not many. The last day or two of life is not

958
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:10,840
necessarily the greatest time to be digging into someone's soul. And I will say, you're right about

959
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:15,640
medications is a big piece of this. But I will also say, just for your listeners, a refinement

960
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,680
here, again, pushing on the either or kind of thinking, it's not either take meds and be

961
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:27,080
comfortable or don't take meds and be lucid. Intractable pain is a great route to delirium.

962
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:32,440
And even if you're not delirious, trying to have an exchange with someone when your body is an

963
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:38,600
absolute agony is a pretty quixotic experience. I will say that another plug for a pound of care

964
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:43,400
is with a very expert and judicial use of pain medications, where we can often thread a needle

965
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:48,600
and get someone comfortable enough, but not so overly medicated that they can't interact.

966
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:54,280
We just want to name that refinement a little bit. Either way, Peter, your point is still taken.

967
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:59,560
The very, very final hours of life, you're not generally reviewing much. You're not having big

968
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:04,520
philosophical conversation at that point in so many ways, whether by medication or force of the

969
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,280
disease, it's too late. Which I think speaks to what you said earlier, that there really is no

970
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:15,720
time like the present to say what it is you want to say to people who matter. It's not the movie

971
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:22,120
where your final breath is asking for forgiveness or telling somebody you forgive them or that you

972
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:27,640
love them. That's very unlikely to happen. That's very unlikely to happen as is anything sort of

973
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,480
cleanly closure. I love pointing this out to folks. One of the things in my world and in

974
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,440
palliative care world, one of the one of the things you would want to forestall with knowing

975
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:40,920
so much pain is coming as you want to forestall the avoidable regrets and avoidable pains,

976
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,080
but you're not necessarily going to get there in your final breath.

977
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,640
Tell me the story about Randy Sloan. How did you meet him?

978
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:54,680
Randy was a beautiful young man. I met Randy. He worked at a motorcycle shop.

979
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:00,840
I first met Randy. One of my wishes for myself once I became an amputee was to get back on a

980
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:05,880
motorcycle at some point. I've always loved biking. I'd always wanted to get on a motorcycle.

981
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,920
Everyone smiles, swims through a motorcycle shop and see if there was any way to convert a bike.

982
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:16,440
Every time I walked in there, I couldn't get anyone to take it on. I think they all just freaked out

983
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:21,000
like, no way, dude. We're not putting you on a death machine. I didn't try that hard, but I

984
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,280
never could get anyone really interested. One day I walked into a place called Scuderia West here in

985
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:34,200
San Francisco and just met a wholly different energy. These guys were actually interested in

986
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:40,680
trying to make it happen. Saw it as a creative exercise. That's exactly the spirit you need.

987
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:46,120
Randy was the mechanic who put his hand up as wanting to help make this happen.

988
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:52,520
Randy, he was a bike mechanic. He took my bike and he managed to figure out a way for me to operate it

989
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:59,480
with just one hand by a series of modifications. He helped make this dream come true for me.

990
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:07,080
It was beautiful for both of us. He loved making it happen and I sure loved that he did. There

991
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:15,000
was this gorgeous, teary moment when I picked up the bike and rode off in the sunset. It was just

992
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:21,000
a beautiful, but time limited interaction with Randy. Then not that much longer, I can't remember

993
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:28,280
now, months or maybe a year later. Randy was in his mid-20s, by the way. Randy ended up somehow

994
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:33,400
his mother reached me and let me know that Randy was in the hospital and something really big time

995
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,800
was going wrong. Randy and I had remembered each other because we were both moved by this story

996
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,080
and his mom reached out and he knew I was a doctor. So, blah, blah, blah. Eventually I got to Randy's

997
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:48,600
bedside. Randy had been walking up a hill in San Francisco, found himself a little out of breath,

998
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:54,040
went to urgent care. They took an x-ray and he had turned out to have mesothelioma.

999
01:35:54,040 --> 01:36:00,360
Which is essentially unheard of in someone in their 20s. I mean, this is a cancer that is

1000
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:06,840
almost exclusively associated with long-term asbestos exposure in elderly folks. I don't

1001
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,920
know enough about motorcycles to know if there was asbestos in them, but even if there was,

1002
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:16,520
you'd think this is something that would still be 40 years later. You're right. So, total freakish.

1003
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:22,600
Even if you had had exposure, it's rare to find exposed asbestos these days, much rarer.

1004
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:27,240
But at that age, you just don't have even time to develop the cancer. It takes a while after

1005
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:33,640
exposure. So, just a real mystery how this young man came down with widely metastatic mesothelioma.

1006
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,760
Even at the time of diagnosis, scans revealed it was in his brainstem.

1007
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:42,840
He's one of these guys who went from walking, talking to that day was in the hospital on death's

1008
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:48,280
door and people scurrying around trying to make a plan of what to do. I met him. I walked in that

1009
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:53,320
situation. By the time I even got to the hospital, he had had a dose of whole brain radiation

1010
01:36:53,960 --> 01:37:01,400
because brainstem lesion was very precarious and they needed immediate care. So, he had already

1011
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:07,000
been radiated within hours. I walked into a situation. Here's a young man trying to deal

1012
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,720
with this diagnosis, come to terms with it and all that it meant. It meant that his life was

1013
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:15,960
measured in weeks at that point, right from the time of diagnosis. So, I became his palliative

1014
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:21,800
care doctor and we were together for the rest of the time and we got him into, I saw him into,

1015
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:27,320
at that point, I was working at Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco. He moved in there with us and he

1016
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:32,280
played his life out with us. It was an amazing experience. I think one of the most amazing things

1017
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:36,920
about it, besides the medical like mesothelioma and this young man, blah, blah, blah, the really

1018
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:43,160
interesting stuff was how Randy responded to this diagnosis. He and his mother and I were all,

1019
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:47,720
it just too, didn't make sense. It was too soon. So, we were all gearing up to think that somehow

1020
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:52,120
treatment was going to help him. It was a sober conversation. There was nothing that was going to

1021
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:57,640
help him at this point, except for love. That one dose of whole brain radiation really threw him for

1022
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:03,320
a loop. I'm trying to talk to him about the fact, trying to bridge him to the point, the realization

1023
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:10,520
that he has no good cancer fighting options. You're watching this guy's world shrink miserably by

1024
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:17,560
the second. To find a way out of this tailspin and to find a way forward, we had our dutiful

1025
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:23,000
palliative care conversation, which included a question in there eventually about what was really

1026
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,200
important to him. What about him that he want to protect as his body was falling apart? What did he

1027
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:35,880
love most about himself? Somehow the question to Randy became, what are you most proud of in

1028
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:41,000
yourself? As a young man in development, it seemed like an important question. His answer

1029
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,040
was immediate. His answer was, I want everybody I ever come into contact know that I love them.

1030
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:51,480
He answered the question immediately. It was remarkable coming out of a 27-year-old bike

1031
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:57,320
mechanic. So, there it was. I said, okay, we need to keep you as comfortable and conscious as

1032
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:02,760
possible for what time you have and be in a position that your friends and people can visit you.

1033
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:07,960
So, that meant let's get you in the hospice house out of your teeny walk-up apartment where

1034
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:12,120
you have three roommates. Let's get you into this hospice house. Let's get you out of the

1035
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:17,480
charade of treatment. Let's treat your symptoms and open up your door and get as many people in

1036
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:23,400
here as you want. That's what we did. He just had a steady stream of visitors. He just basically

1037
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:29,720
became this radiant beam of love for what time he had and just made sure to love as many people as

1038
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:36,520
he humanly could. With that, his mother and his stepfather came out and got married at the

1039
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:43,960
hospice house around the time he died. He got in the bay one more time for a swim. He got to be

1040
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:51,080
with his dog and he let everyone know what Randy meant was love and that became his legacy. He

1041
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:57,960
died smiling and quickly. This all transpired over what felt like hours. What role does

1042
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:02,920
euthanasia play? I ashamed to admit I'm a little bit ignorant about the legality of its state by

1043
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:09,400
state. Obviously, I know that Oregon is a state where it's legal. How many states in the US

1044
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,520
have legalized euthanasia or some form of physician assisted suicide?

1045
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:18,760
I believe the number is now nine. I have to double check. Still, it's unfurling as we speak.

1046
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:23,640
There's efforts going on in every state house, but I'm pretty sure the number is nine. The first

1047
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:31,240
was Oregon in 97, California in 2016, and others have followed suit. Montana, Oregon, Colorado,

1048
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:39,720
California, DC, others that I can't remember right now. It's coming slowly but surely state by state.

1049
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:49,160
Has it demonstrably changed the practice of hospice or palliative care or is it almost moot because

1050
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:57,880
so much of threading that needle as you described it, effectively it doesn't happen maybe in as

1051
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:03,640
dramatic a fashion. In the end of life care that you're discussing, for example, in the case of

1052
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:11,800
someone like Randy, if Randy had said, let's say a few weeks sooner, I want to go down the path of

1053
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:17,000
euthanasia, what would have been different than what he ultimately ended up doing at Zen Hospice?

1054
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:21,480
There was a moment there, I could imagine he would have really elected it. The world was falling

1055
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:26,920
apart too quickly. It was too painful for a little while there for Randy to see straight.

1056
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:31,240
The process we can talk, it's a little bit of walking. There's a two week wait. You need to

1057
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:36,600
have two physicians. You need to write a letter. They're fail safes because what the state wants

1058
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:41,400
to avoid is it making it too easy for people to do something that they otherwise might regret

1059
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,800
because I think many of us have moments where we just as soon get off the planet, especially when

1060
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:51,320
we're dealing with something like a terminal diagnosis. It's a funny thing where life's ending

1061
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:58,040
soon. Some folks have this response, okay, I'm dying. Now that I realize I'm dying, well, now I

1062
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:03,560
can't die soon enough. It's almost like once you pierce the veil of indefinite life, which people

1063
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:07,800
really long on some levels think they long for, then all of a sudden they're terminal and then

1064
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:13,640
they can't die soon enough. It's sort of a final act of control and a bit of an FU to death.

1065
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,120
Well, you think you're inevitable. I'll show you.

1066
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:21,800
It's the quit before getting fired impulse in some ways. There are other ways. There are many

1067
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:26,280
things that drive the impulse, but that's a sort of a side note. But answer your question. I mean,

1068
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:33,720
if Randy enacted this procedure and ended his life, hastened his death before nature otherwise

1069
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:39,720
would have had it, well, Randy would have died sooner. Randy would have been able to schedule

1070
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:45,000
the moment of his death. It would have been something. And on some level that could have

1071
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:54,120
served him. But the realization that Randy had a mission to sort of prove love, to show love,

1072
01:42:54,120 --> 01:43:01,080
to be love, he had a reason to keep going. There's a moment where if it had been too easy for him,

1073
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:06,120
he probably would have elected to hasten his death. But because he didn't, and because he let

1074
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:12,360
it play out a little bit longer, he got to a lot more people. He had a lot more final moments with

1075
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:19,480
friends. He got into the bay and he had the pride of playing his body all the way out. He played

1076
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:27,640
every cell all the way out, which for Randy served him very, very well. And I think it makes the

1077
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:32,760
point one of the problems with the dying laws. And let me just pause there too, by the way,

1078
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:37,640
Peter, the language of physician-assisted suicide has gone away in favor of aid in dying

1079
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:43,560
or assisted dying to get rid of the word suicide, emotional baggage around that word. And importantly,

1080
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:47,720
these laws are for people who already have a terminal diagnosis and for whom death is coming

1081
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:53,960
soon. So it's importantly different. But if we had just ceded his wishes and said, oh, sure,

1082
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,640
you want to die Randy sooner or later? Yeah, we'll make that happen. Just in the name of

1083
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:01,560
helping him not suffer, we could have made that happen. And it would have been a mistake in his

1084
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:08,440
case, because as I think a lot of us know intuitively or explicitly, a meaningful life,

1085
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:14,920
a good life is not the absence of suffering. Suffering teaches us too much. It's too important

1086
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:21,640
vehicle for us actually. A full life requires it. And I don't mean to castigate anyone who does

1087
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:26,840
choose to hasten their death. For some people, it is exactly the right decision. When it is seen as

1088
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:32,520
a meaningful response, not a flight from suffering, but a moving towards something meaningful. And

1089
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:39,320
for some people, a final act of will is very meaningful. But for more people, what ends up

1090
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:44,840
being more meaningful is them being more than their pain, being more than their suffering,

1091
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:50,120
and letting their body play themselves all the way out and dealing with and adapting every moment

1092
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:55,320
along the way, trimming their sails along the way, letting themselves be changed, letting themselves

1093
01:44:55,320 --> 01:45:00,600
grow right up into the moment of their death. That's actually a more meaningful pursuit for

1094
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:07,640
the bulk of people. It's really that pain matters more than being numb. Yeah, yeah. When it comes

1095
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:13,160
down to it, when it comes down to it, for most of us, and this is a realization that came clear to

1096
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:19,400
me when I was in my hospital bed, pain is very obnoxious. And I don't like this stuff. We can

1097
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:24,680
be more than our pain. Pain isn't ultimately avoidable in a full life, like I said, and it can

1098
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:31,160
teach us some things. And really, I'd much rather feel some exceptions, and there's ways to paint

1099
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:37,000
this otherwise, but in general, I'd rather feel something, even if it's pain than feel nothing.

1100
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:43,800
Anesthesia is a way, numbness is a way to die before we have to die. That seems to be a bigger

1101
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:50,280
tragedy to me than is death in the first place. Have you had any experience with the use of

1102
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:57,480
psychedelics in end of life care? Are people doing any research on this? Obviously, I'm aware

1103
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:04,680
of the research on psilocybin in patients with cancer. I believe there was research done

1104
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:11,640
helping with end of life depression. Are you aware of any other agents that are used besides

1105
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:16,840
psilocybin for that research? Anything with MDMA? I'm not sure if, which obviously I know MDMA is

1106
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:21,400
being used to treat PTSD, but what does the scope and breadth of that look like today?

1107
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:27,480
Substances being researched for end of life anxieties, fears of death,

1108
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:32,520
or studying a patient population dealing with terminal illness or serious illness. I can't

1109
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:38,440
quote to you all the latest details of studies. There are studies ongoing for yes for psilocybin,

1110
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:45,480
but also for MDMA. And then related, similar but different, is ketamine, and the way ketamine is

1111
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:53,480
proving its way to new therapeutic values. So yes, I'm most excited around the research on MDMA

1112
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:59,080
and psilocybin. And the research so far, we've got a little ways to go, but the data are pretty darn

1113
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:05,080
stunning. The impact is huge and offers access. The psilocybin stuff is the most remarkable,

1114
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:11,560
I think. One guided session, we're setting matters, dose matters, the integration process matters. It's

1115
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:17,240
not just people going out in the woods and having fun. But with this process, there are really no

1116
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:23,480
adverse events to speak of. People who are gripped by a fear of death, gripped by a sense of

1117
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:30,360
meaninglessness and not belonging and not feeling connected, come out of this one session, losing

1118
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:35,560
their fear of death, feeling part of something larger than themselves, having a totally different

1119
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:42,360
relationship to fear. This is one session. The effect lasts for months. It's not just a chemical

1120
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:49,320
effect per se. We don't have anything remotely like this to offer in medicine. The closest thing

1121
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:53,880
I have in my conventional work as a doctor is someone comes to me with death anxiety, two things

1122
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:59,000
I can do. I can talk them out of it and try to, with enough time, we can find a new way of seeing

1123
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,200
themselves in the world, a framework that allows them to feel like they belong in their own framework

1124
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:10,280
that takes time if we can get there at all. The other thing I can do is if you're really anxious,

1125
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:15,560
well, I can numb you out. I can give you Valium or whatever else. I can put a wet blanket on your

1126
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:21,880
system. That's the best we've had to date. I don't have an intervention that helps me connect you to

1127
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:28,760
meaning, connect you to the cosmos, but these medications are offering exactly that and is

1128
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:32,840
beautiful. So we've got a little ways to go, but I am thrilled for this potential.

1129
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:39,240
Are these tools the things you're probably most excited about in your field in terms of being

1130
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:46,920
able to revolutionize how you're able to help the patients who want or need that type of intervention?

1131
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:52,840
Or is there anything else that even rivals this? Yes, there are two things. Strictly speaking,

1132
01:48:52,840 --> 01:49:02,040
from a medical, medicationy, medical physiology-ish overlay, the medical lens, I would say the research

1133
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:08,920
going on around these substances, psilocybin, MDMA, ketamine, et cetera, are my favorite thing going.

1134
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:16,280
Maybe even bigger, maybe with other things that gets me more excited is the work going on on the

1135
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:21,560
periphery of healthcare and outside of healthcare. That conversations like the one you and I are

1136
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:26,920
having, Peter, and I thank you for it up and down. One of the things we're doing is we're kicking the

1137
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:31,880
conversation beyond just medicine. It's like we were saying earlier about the design flaw that

1138
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:36,840
medicine focuses on the disease, not the person. One of the great things that happens when we focus

1139
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:40,520
on the person is that we in medicine become part of something larger than ourselves.

1140
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:46,920
We can partner with architects and artists and designers and other disciplines and death doulas

1141
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:52,440
and quasi-medical folks and alternative and integrative medicine folks. All of a sudden,

1142
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:57,880
we are part of a much larger family working on behalf of something much larger than even medicine.

1143
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,520
That's where I get really excited that people, that society, that culture is waking up to these

1144
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:10,680
issues. Death has become a medical issue. It doesn't belong there. Suffering and death are

1145
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:15,080
way bigger than medicine. Medicine may have something to offer this. Getting back to your

1146
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:20,360
question, the thing that I'm more excited than anything else is the rise of commerce,

1147
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:28,040
multidisciplinary work, other institutions and vehicles tuning into this idea of life and death

1148
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:34,200
so that medicine doesn't have to carry all that water by itself, that people are going to start

1149
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,360
taking care of people and not handing themselves over to doctors to do the trick.

1150
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:46,360
PJ, I really want to thank you because your work and the work of people like you has actually had

1151
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:52,920
quite a profound impact on the way I think about life. I'm in the process of barely putting the

1152
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:59,880
finishing touches on a book about longevity and I've come to the realization lately, it's very

1153
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:07,640
difficult to do this without writing about death in some way, but not as an enemy, but more in a

1154
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:15,480
manner that is symbiotic with life. Maybe not quite a friend, but certainly not a hostile

1155
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:20,040
combatant. I just think the way that you've been able to speak about this so eloquently for many

1156
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:25,320
years now has been a great benefit to not just the people you've helped, which is obvious.

1157
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:29,640
I think those of us who are presumably a little bit further from needing that help.

1158
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:35,240
Pete, I can't wait to read that book, man. And that is right on. I think you will help so many

1159
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:40,920
people. Just this frame shift of finding a way to include death in your view of reality

1160
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,880
is one of the great services you can do the world, man. And I, oh, I can't wait to read it.

1161
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:51,000
Well, thanks, PJ. And thanks more than anything else for all of your time this afternoon.

1162
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,640
Thanks for having me, Tom. Thank you so much.

1163
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:57,720
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1164
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:02,120
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

1165
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:07,560
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

1166
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:12,760
back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a

1167
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:18,360
bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

1168
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:23,480
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes

1169
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:28,840
rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes

1170
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:34,600
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

1171
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:40,200
to listen to spiels like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release every

1172
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:44,360
Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

1173
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:49,720
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

1174
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:55,240
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

1175
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:59,800
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

1176
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:04,440
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits,
