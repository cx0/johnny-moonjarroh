00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,860
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,480
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,240
Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of the drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,600
My guest this week is my friend, Apollo Ono. For those of you who might not recognize Apollo,

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,480
which I would guess is not many of you, Apollo Anton Ono is an eight time medalist in the

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,160
Winter Olympics across three games, 2002, 2006, 2010 in short track speed skating, which

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,920
is one of the most intense, crazy sports to watch. We're going to have lots of videos

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,360
of it in the show notes. And if that weren't enough, he also went on to win Dancing with

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,080
the Stars, which sadly we don't get into in this episode, though I wish we did because

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,040
we were talking about it over dinner. And it's simply another manifestation of the type

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,040
of drive and determination that he brought to his sport. He brought to that show as well.

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,520
He has a really unique upbringing and he was raised by a single dad and his father, who

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,640
was an immigrant, played just an unbelievable role in his life through the good times and

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,540
the bad, which I know might sound like a bit of a cliche, but the level and the detail

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,360
at which we go into it in this podcast, I think is quite inspiring. There's no question

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,440
that at least in my mind that had Apollo been raised by somebody other than his father,

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,640
it's very hard to imagine he would have achieved the success that he has achieved. His father's

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,840
role in his life has just been unbelievable. And I think that's a common theme we see in

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,960
the people who are the greatest. One of the things that I didn't really fully appreciate

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,440
prior to this podcast was how this entire nation of South Korea basically grew to hate

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,240
him in ways that are almost impossible to describe following a very controversial race

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,640
in 2002. We go into that in great detail, so I'm not going to go into the whys and the

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,200
whats now, but the story is incredible, both how he got to that point of being so despised

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,640
by an entire nation and also how he basically went into the belly of the lion to confront

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,480
this head on and ultimately the finish to that story is as remarkable as how he got

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,760
there. Apollo has been known even inside the circles of Olympic athletes as having kind

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,120
of a surreal approach to training and we're going to link to some videos, including one

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,840
that is my absolute favorite with some of his training routines, but his discipline,

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,240
his work ethic are legendary once that switch was clicked. He spent the early part of his

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,520
career basically riding on talent and then just realized, nope, I'm going to go all in

36
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,320
on this. I never want to finish a single race and have a single regret. His determination

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,280
character responds to adversity. I mean, they're certainly inspirational to me. And frankly,

38
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,840
I think this is of all the podcasts I've ever recorded. If I was going to say to my

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,280
kids, I want you to listen to one. This is the one I want them to hear at least of all

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,400
the podcasts I've done so far because this to me is really about grit and I feel very

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
strongly that that's arguably one of the, if not the most important, one of the most

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,280
important things we want to be able to instill in our children is a sense of grit. So hopefully

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,240
this will serve to give my kids a lesson on that and potentially for yours as well. The

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,880
parallels between Apollo's life and Rocky Balboa are just amazing to me and I can't

45
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,320
resist making those comparisons a few times and not withstanding the fact that his name

46
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,680
is also Apollo and of course Apollo Creed though, spelt with two L's is the fictional

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,040
character that is one of the most important antagonists of Rocky Balboa. That that's not

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,480
lost on me, but if I were to sum up one Rocky-ism that sort of explains Apollo's life, it's

49
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,560
the one where Rocky Balboa in the sixth installment of that movie series is explaining to his son

50
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,240
that it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,600
forward and obviously I love that as a, as a metaphor for life, but I think it's illustrated

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,360
here. Apollo is just a great storyteller and he's, he's a beautiful speaker and I think

53
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
that's reflected in the fact that this interview goes on for almost four hours. It would have

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,440
easily gone on for six or seven had we not already made commitments to do other things

55
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,000
that evening. So I hope you find this interview half as interesting as I did. I think the

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,880
show notes will have some really great stuff in them and there's going to be links to some

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,360
really cool videos that we allude to, including not just races, but some of the other stuff

58
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,640
that goes above and beyond that. Lastly, just a couple things on some housekeeping. Every

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,520
Sunday I send out a weekly email that has been getting great feedback from the people

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,560
who subscribed to it. So if you don't subscribe to that, please do. If you end up thinking

61
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,840
it sucks, you can always unsubscribe from it. Secondly, we've got a team of both Bob

62
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,440
Kaplan and Travis Denson who do an incredible job putting together show notes. Again, the

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,800
feedback we get is there is no podcast out there that puts together show notes the way

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,480
we do. It's basically a full time job for one person, a part time job for another person.

65
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,240
And I believe that that shows in the volume of stuff that we're putting out there. So

66
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,640
if you're enjoying the podcast, at least take a look at the show notes because you'll

67
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,260
probably find something else that you might have missed or that becomes more clear. Lastly,

68
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,480
if you are enjoying this, please head over to Apple podcast reviews, give us a review

69
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,600
if it's favorable. Great. If it's not, please at least be constructive in your criticism

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,840
so that we can figure out how to make this show even better. Without further delay, here

71
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,080
is my guest today, Apollo. Hey Apollo, thanks for coming down, man.

72
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Thanks for having me.

73
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,160
It's kind of funny that we're doing this now as opposed to what we were supposed to

74
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,560
do.

75
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,440
The original plan though, as I mentioned, is very memorable and I'll never forget it.

76
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,360
The fact that we have a nice dinner, we're chatting, we're getting the rhythm. Okay,

77
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,800
and then just follow me. We're going to shoot this place. It's right on the water. We're

78
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:23,360
in Malibu. It's perfect. It's very quiet. Guys, we have a problem. I don't have keys.

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,120
I locked myself out. Yeah. The only saving grace is it could have been a lot worse if

80
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,680
I'd killed myself or broken a bone, hopping that fence to crawl around the back of the

81
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,840
house to try to get in. That would have been-

82
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,080
No, you seem pretty athletic. I was like, oh, he's okay. If you were struggling over

83
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,160
the first fence, I was like, okay, maybe I should get my hand, but he's got it. He's

84
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
pretty good.

85
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,520
You held the light for me. It was awesome.

86
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,280
Thank you. Now on lighting and grip, Apollo.

87
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,440
I'm the main act here. I do the fence hopping. I do the wall scaling, but yeah, I need to-

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,600
Get rid of that Arnold guy. His lighting skills are just below average, bottom of the

89
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
rung.

90
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,040
By the way, all guests who come to my house, you have to drink Topo Chico. Is that your

91
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
first Topo Chico?

92
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,560
It was my first. It was nice. I love the glass bottle. I love the fact that you love it and

93
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,160
you're so passionate. When you give it to me, it's like you're giving me keys to the

94
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,120
house for the weekend. It's like, tell me how it is after you're finished.

95
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Well, I like the fact that only halfway through the first bottle, you asked for a second,

96
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
so you've got that other one.

97
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,280
It's nice. Yeah. It's a strangely addictive quality.

98
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Yeah. When I first got into it, it was out of control. I was like, why am I drinking

99
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,760
six of these a day? It's became an expensive habit because they're hard to find. Well,

100
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,080
man, there is so much I want to talk about and I think we'll hopefully be able to get

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,680
to much of it, though probably not all of it just by the nature of the depth we'll probably

102
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,600
go into on some stuff. But let's, for lack of a better plan or strategy, let's just go

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,920
back to the beginning. So you grew up in the Pacific Northwest.

104
00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:00,320
I grew up in the Pacific Northwest. I was a very high energy kid, one who was mischievous

105
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,080
because I think just had tons of energy. My father was working most of the time to provide

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,840
so that we didn't struggle too much more than we already did, which I didn't know at the

107
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
time.

108
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,360
And your dad grew up in Japan, came to the US. Do you remember how old he was?

109
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,160
He said he's about 17 and a half years old when he came from Japan to ... I think he

110
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,120
landed actually in Oregon originally and he just started his life. He didn't speak a word

111
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,640
of English. He didn't really know anything about the American culture other than what

112
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,280
was kind of fed to him when he was in Japan. The only focal point he said that he had was

113
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,580
that he just needed to get outside of the protocol-like lifestyle that was existing

114
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,800
within the Japanese culture. I think that to him meant going to the place that was a

115
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,520
complete 180 and that was the United States.

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,880
So he left on his own at 17 and a half.

117
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,240
He left on his own against my grandmother and grandfather's wishes, which they wanted

118
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,080
him to go to school, study, eventually work for a university and just kind of follow the

119
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,640
same path that most, I think, Japanese follow. This is what you're supposed to do. This is

120
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,200
what you will do and this is what your life is going to be on a day-to-day basis.

121
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Something inside my dad just said, I don't want that. I don't want that type of future.

122
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,080
He came and he risked a lot. He didn't have any money. I think he had a camera in which

123
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,840
he sold upon his arrival and that's what he used to begin his life. I can't even imagine

124
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,560
how difficult that must have been coming to the US, not speaking a word of English in

125
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,880
a time where Japanese were not exactly the most accepted people in our country. Then

126
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,480
trying and he used to tell me, he was like, I was a bartender. I was like, how could you

127
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,360
possibly be a bartender if you don't speak English? My dad's just really short too. I

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,640
can only imagine what that looked like. Also, the grief that he probably got from all the

129
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,280
people who were ordering drinks that he would probably mess up. He said that he slammed

130
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,280
his head against the door many, many times to try to figure it out and he did.

131
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Yeah, it's not exactly a forgiving crowd, right? Six drinks in, when someone gets their

132
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,560
drinks screwed up, they're less likely to be empathetic to the guy struggling.

133
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah, I'm sure it was really challenging. Then my dad, weirdly, he said that he was studying,

134
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,280
I think he was studying accounting and then someone asked, oh, he was walking by one of

135
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,600
the classes, was hosting a hair cutting competition. That's when my dad said, oh, that looks interesting.

136
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,720
I could use some extra money. Let me try that. He ended the competition, essentially, got

137
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,360
in third place or something randomly and then began his career to pursue being a hairstylist,

138
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,880
which is really, really, if you knew my dad, it makes sense now, but even when I hear the

139
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,440
story, it's just that nothing adds up. He begins his life and he actually was and started

140
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,720
a pretty interesting career as a hairstylist and more than a barber, I guess you could

141
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,000
say and was starting to travel the world, had some success and he said that everything

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,120
was changed, obviously, when I was born and upon my arrival, both my father and my mom,

143
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,760
I think they were obviously going through some conflicted times and so they divorced.

144
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,720
My father took full custody of me and he didn't know how to raise a child. His only...

145
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,440
How old was your dad? Do you remember when you were born?

146
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,800
I don't know because my dad told me he's been 35 since I was born, which is funny.

147
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
That's a great anti-aging strategy.

148
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Yeah. He looks great too. He looks not his age at all. Again, my dad, his only context

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,980
for raising a son was the fact that people would come into a salon and that was his basis

150
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,480
for conversation. As your barber or your hairstylist, that's your personal psychologist if you've

151
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,920
been seeing this person for 10 plus years. As he's going through this process of raising

152
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,740
me, he's basically getting all these women who come into a salon free parental guidance

153
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,760
advice on a daily basis and I think he started taking it.

154
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,320
That is unusual when a couple splits that the father would take sole control. Do you

155
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,840
know much about that in terms of, has your dad talked to you about... I know you've told

156
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,720
me before that you don't really have contact with your mom. In fact, you've never had contact

157
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,600
with your mom since she left, right?

158
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Essentially, what my dad says is he is, I was the better suited to take care of you.

159
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,960
I also felt even though I knew nothing about raising you, I would do and I had the ability

160
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,240
to do what it takes to raise you properly. At least that's what I thought. At least provide

161
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,000
some form of security blanket for my one and only child. That's exactly what he did. It

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,960
is interesting. I never met my mom even when I have a conversation with my girlfriend.

163
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,360
She's like, haven't you ever wanted to just meet her? It's really strange when I say it,

164
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,240
but I never think about it. I grew up in a single parent household. Everyone in my neighborhood

165
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,240
pretty much was single parent household in some capacity or they were raised by their

166
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
grandmother and grandfather. I didn't grow up in a bad neighborhood by any means, but

167
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,640
that just was very normal where I grew up. To me, I never thought about it. I never understood

168
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,320
what that was like having two parents, but I didn't know. My dad did an excellent job

169
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,560
obviously raising me, but there was never an inclination or a want to actually meet

170
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,560
her. I think as I get older, there is more questions of I'd like to know from her perspective

171
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,200
what happened. I think we all have those interesting thoughts and moments where we want to just

172
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,480
divulge and just say like, man, I'd like to know my other half. My mom was adopted, which

173
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,720
I found out much later. Her background in ethnicity is also somewhat mysterious, which

174
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,560
is why my fascination with trying to understand my own genealogy and background in historical

175
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,400
context. Have you been able to dig into that through? Because the problem was if you're

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,240
using stuff like Ancestry, you have to have enough information to put in the system.

177
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:51,040
Yeah, exactly. This was maybe in 2006 or something, I think it was maybe 2005. NBC was doing a show

178
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,200
called Who Do You Think You Are? It might've been 2003, I don't remember, but I remember

179
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,600
during that time, essentially what they would do is they would ask for permission. They would then

180
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,480
find out every single thing there is to know about one side of your family. You say, okay,

181
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,880
I want to know about my father or my mom. I was really interested in my Japanese heritage. I had

182
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,200
asked them to start really diving deep on my father's side. Then they had traveled to Japan,

183
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,800
they started talking to people in Japan. For people who don't know, Japan is such a small but

184
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,480
highly protective society, especially when it comes to personal records. They essentially got

185
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,000
zero information. For whatever reason, they were like, we know that you have probably some

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,560
samurai blood from this Yasunaga clan in your grandmother's side of the family, but that's

187
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,080
really all we can get out of this thing. I was disappointed. To go back, my relationship with

188
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,840
my mom, there was none. For all you know, you could have half siblings, of course. Your mom was

189
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,400
presumably quite young when your parents split. She could have very easily remarried.

190
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,360
She still keeps in contact. I think it's been many years, but she was at least until my very

191
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,880
first Olympic Games in contact with my father. Essentially, she said and called him after she

192
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,160
had heard that I had won my first Olympic gold medal. I'm very proud of him. I've been following

193
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,080
him. She lives in the Pacific Northwest region. She obviously saw my face on newspapers and on

194
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,000
television leading up to the Olympic Games. I think she felt very proud, but she did mention

195
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,720
one thing to my dad. She's like, I feel this point in the life and both of our lives, I don't want

196
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,200
to disrupt his path. Maybe when he's ready, he'll seek me out or something of that nature.

197
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,280
That's always been in the back of my head. I also have this weird protective side of me because I

198
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,600
have so much love and respect for my father in everything that he did. I don't want him to feel

199
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,680
like he was less than if I go out and reach for my mom. No, it doesn't make sense.

200
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,480
You would? No, I don't think so, but that was inside me for a long time. When you're raising

201
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,120
a household, I think you're skewed in multiple ways and they create little small micro traumas

202
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,480
psychologically that maybe you don't recognize when you're younger or you're missing some elements,

203
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,640
which makes you more dependent. Maybe you're more alpha, maybe you're less. I don't know what that

204
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,880
is, but for sure, it definitely, I was not the most equilibrium based athlete in the world.

205
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,560
I think a lot of athletes are like that. I think there's always something that happens early stage

206
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,720
and for me, it was always like my father would always teach me that you can always be better,

207
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,440
you can always be better, you can always be better. There's always another level to go to.

208
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,920
Perfection is seemingly unattainable, but that's your goal and you don't stop until you get there.

209
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,080
That was so drilled into me psychologically from a young age. It wasn't like super tiger dad,

210
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,680
although thinking back, he did push me extensively. I didn't get that feeling when I was a kid,

211
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:49,240
but it definitely taught me a lot about my ultimate goal is to probably make him happy and

212
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,360
have respect for what I'm doing and also I want to achieve that perfection. I never did. I have had

213
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,680
races where I would call it the perfect race, but now when I look back, I'm like, ah, it was far from

214
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:09,080
it. I think that psychology started from my father and watching him in his work ethic. I was always

215
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,880
athletic as a kid growing up in Seattle and I was a swimmer and I did track and field and I

216
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,880
wanted to play football. He said, no, I wanted to box. He said, no, I saw this crazy sport of

217
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,480
short track speed skating and I was actually, at the time I was swimming a lot and my father

218
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,200
wanted me to go to Stanford or Michigan full ride. That was his goal, right? We were getting these

219
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,920
weird conversational actual snail mail letters. I remember back then basically telling my father,

220
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,680
if your son continues on this path of excellence in swimming, we would love to have a conversation

221
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,000
about having him become accepted into this school. This was from Stanford. I forgot what year it was.

222
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,640
What was your stroke?

223
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,720
It was breaststroke and backstroke or my two. So I was 50 and a hundred meter breaststroke.

224
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,400
Do you remember what your best hundred? Yeah, I don't remember.

225
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,920
I don't remember, but I do remember my 50 meter backstroke. I broke like some 20 year state record

226
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,560
at one time. I remember because the guy who record who I broke at the time, he was still like,

227
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,400
he was like semi coaching and my coach at the time, Bill Christiansen brought me up there and he's

228
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,480
like, oh, you know, this is the kid who broke your 20 year record. And the guy's like, wow,

229
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
you know, I have no idea what even would be.

230
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
What's interesting is, you know, usually backstrokers don't make good breaststrokers and vice versa

231
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,120
because backstroke and freestyle are long axis strokes. Breaststroke and fly are short axis

232
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,640
strokes. In your case though, I can see there's an interesting thing, which is your legs are so

233
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,400
freakishly strong and those are the two leg driven sports. So those are both what we would

234
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,320
call rear wheel drive sports versus front wheel drive strokes. So it's interesting to think that

235
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,880
you would be perfectly suited to do that, which means you would have been probably a really good

236
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,840
IMR as well. Yeah, I was, I was decent. My hundred meter. I am. I don't remember any of my times. Look,

237
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,920
we're talking like when I was 12, 13 years old, right? So a lot can happen between that and

238
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,880
college, but yeah, still, I mean that there was something there. I want to go back to something

239
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,640
you said a moment ago, right? Which was at a very young age, your dad sort of instilled in you this,

240
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,760
I don't want to put words in your mouth. I don't think you said it as the need to be perfect,

241
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,280
but a quest for perfection. You know, I talk about this a lot with my daughter, which is this idea

242
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,240
of mastery, which is this process of trying to master something that you'll never actually master

243
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,720
because that's technically not feasible is the beauty. Like that's the thing. And you know,

244
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,880
books that have been written about, it's usually written about athletes, but I think it can apply

245
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,320
to musicians or any number of other fields. They talk about the common bond that seems inherent to

246
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,520
many of these people who have achieved greatness like you have is this love of practice. Did you

247
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,520
sense that early on? Did you enjoy the practice or were you more task or goal oriented as far as

248
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,960
the outcome? Early in my career, I would say that I wasn't, I didn't enjoy the process as much. It was

249
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,240
based on sheer talent. And this is, I'm talking from the age of 14 until I was probably about 17.

250
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,400
And you started skating at what 13? I started skating. I actually started really,

251
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,960
really skating at 12. I started really training at the age of 14. So you started swimming what,

252
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,080
like as a five, six year old, but eight swam locally and you know, local competitions and state

253
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,400
competitions. And then when I saw the sport, short track speed skating in 1992 and they get in 1994,

254
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,720
that's when I said, wow, this is an amazing sport. I used to inline and quad skate like on the side

255
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,560
at the nearby local skating rink. I feel like I could do that. That seems pretty easy. It also

256
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,800
looks ridiculous, right? These guys are wearing these, when you're like 11, 12 years old and you

257
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,040
see these guys skate, it looks fake. And then when my father drove me north to Vancouver, BC,

258
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,000
I saw it live because the Canadians, they obviously loved winter sports. I was like,

259
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,080
this is the most incredible sport I've ever seen in my life. It doesn't make sense how these human

260
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,720
beings can be leaning over these impossible angles on a blade that's one millimeter thick.

261
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,600
And they're wearing outfits that resemble Superman without the Cape. Like literally that's what they're

262
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,200
doing. And they just have helmets on. I was like, this is perfect. Like I have to do this sport,

263
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,760
right? Superman without the Cape. Now that I think about it, there's, you know, we'll come back.

264
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,320
There's like flying around the ice cream.

265
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,760
I was going to say like, why don't they just have the capes on? It would be so much cooler.

266
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,280
Yeah, that'd be cool actually.

267
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,640
Yeah. Well, I want to come back to the evolution, but let's pause for a moment and have you explain

268
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,240
the difference between short track, long track, in line, all of these different types of skating.

269
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,120
Sure. So inline skating is predominantly done outdoors and they skate and they have competitions

270
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,920
all around the world. Now they have velodrome like competitions, but it's in. So if you've ever seen

271
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:35,400
a velodrome track for track cycling inside of that as a warmup area, that's where inline speed

272
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,720
skating competitions are being held in places like Bogota, Columbia, which is by the way,

273
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,560
Columbia is huge in the inline skating. I don't know why or how, but it's been huge there. And so

274
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,040
I big growing up in the Pacific Northwest and having rain be a very big part of our culture.

275
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,680
I did indoor skating. So think of your imaginary like roller rink and you have four pylons, right?

276
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,680
One for each corner. And you basically skate around and you're on like a roller blade,

277
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,440
but it's got how many wheels per the blade? I started out in quad skates. So two in the front,

278
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,360
two in the back. And then it's just basically just speed skating. So like if you've ever been

279
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,680
in a roller rink growing up as an American and it says, okay, it's time for speed skating. And

280
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,200
everyone goes out there and they play a song and we just get around really fast and he finished.

281
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,160
That's literally how I learned. And then someone in the local roller rink was like, hey, you should

282
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,600
try out for art club. And I was like, okay, that looks, that seems fun. And my dad at that point

283
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,600
was like, anything I can do to create more fatigue in this child, I'm in. I just want to

284
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,960
get him exhausted. Because your dad is working nonstop. He's working all day long. He comes home,

285
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,520
he's exhausted. And I'm like this kid who's just completely berserk out of control. Like I just,

286
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,640
I never get tired. I could just run and run, run, run, run, run, just unsatiable appetite for

287
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,720
everything. Were you getting into trouble at all? Absolutely. Absolutely. It was very mischievous and

288
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,440
environment has a lot to do with that. But for whatever reason, I was, I excelled pretty early

289
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,520
in some gifted programs when I was a child. And my dad was very much a proponent of pushing

290
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,000
education and cramming it down my throat and being like, look, take this test until you pass it,

291
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,440
basically. How did your dad have the time to even oversee how you were doing in school and overseeing

292
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,200
looking over your shoulder while you're trying to get your homework done? How did, do you reflect

293
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,200
back on what that even meant? I don't think he really could. I think he did what he could. I mean,

294
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,120
most of my childhood was spent, my father was not there during the day. So I would go to school on

295
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,040
my own. I would come back on my own and then until he came home and I can come back from school at 3

296
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,400
PM or something like that until seven, 8 PM, sometimes nine, 10 PM, he's not there. And I'm

297
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,480
alone in the house. I had to cook for myself. And you're eight, nine years old. Yeah, very, very

298
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,120
young. So at a very early age, I was very independent on just relying on myself to kind of succeed.

299
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I didn't think anything of it at the time, like I was this latchkey kid, right? I had no idea.

300
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,200
My dad hates that word saying, I'm like, dad, that's pretty much what it was. There's no way,

301
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,200
I can remember many, many nights, it's like dark outside. And I'm like, where's my dad? This is

302
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,000
weird. But that was the reality. And thinking back, my dad, he put aside every single want he had in

303
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,880
his life, everything. And it was all about me. And for that, I feel obviously eternally grateful,

304
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,880
but also I learned so much from such a selfless man, I get it, like I'm his son, I'm the only son,

305
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,920
I'm everything he has, everything he wants to do, he wants to see me succeed. I didn't recognize it

306
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:37,880
when I was that young, I do now. So every waking moment was like, how do I create more experiences

307
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,320
for this child? How do I take my son to, we don't have a lot of money. So how do I take him to nature

308
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,520
and experience things that are free? How do we go out and we can draw, we can create something in

309
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,640
the sand, I can go and appreciate the ocean if that takes us to drive. I mean, we used to drive

310
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,520
to all competitions, like we would drive from Seattle to Prince George, Canada, that's a far

311
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,280
drive in the middle of winter to go skate one day competition against Canadian kids who I don't know,

312
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,640
I'm the only American there. And my dad is like basically driving for two days straight with no

313
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,720
sleep, just so I can have that experience. When you're that young, you don't recognize

314
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,920
how much of a sacrifice that is. Incredible, right? And then I think about now, I can't even do that

315
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:25,800
now. I feel vibrant and peaking at this 36 year age, right? So I just have a tremendous amount

316
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,880
of respect for my dad in terms of his dedication and sacrifice, just because he's just one of the

317
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,280
best and he didn't know what was good, what was bad, he just tried to do everything. So going back

318
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,320
to the skating, so that's what inline is. And then talk about the different disciplines of skating on

319
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,800
ice. Yeah, so you've got there's short track speed skating and then there's long track speed

320
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,560
skating. Long track is the one that's been around forever. Like that's when we go back and see the

321
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,720
Olympics 50 years ago. Correct. That was long track. Correct. So long track speed skating is

322
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,640
what most people think of as predominantly being on an outdoor ice surface. That's a 400 meter oval.

323
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,800
So imagine that you just had a track and field track and you basically just, it froze over during

324
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,520
the winter and you poured ice and that's your, and you had used a Zamboni, that's your track. Long

325
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,360
track speed skating has the 500 meters. It has the 1000 meters, the 1500 meter, the 5,000 and the

326
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,280
10,000. It's sort of parallels running in distances. Yes. But you also in long track speed skating,

327
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,480
it's all about time. So you've got your own lane, no one interferes with you. You can have some

328
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,280
moments where your pair, which you're skating with is, he's in front of you. You can basically

329
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,920
get a little bit of draft on the back end of a straightaway, but for the most part, it's you

330
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,960
against the clock and there's no hiding, right? You can't, like, as soon as you stop skating,

331
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,760
you kind of immediately sort of slow down with the exception of like some gliding, but the most part,

332
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,080
like time trialing, just like being on a bike, there's no hiding, there's no cheating. And when

333
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,560
I first started, I actually started out how I started out doing long track as a proponent,

334
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,920
because that's what everyone does in Calgary and other parts of Butte, Montana, I would skate.

335
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,840
So that's long track speed skating. The skate itself used to be a fixed boot and a fixed blade

336
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,680
meaning there's, imagine a shoe and then on your heel and then again on your, under the ball of

337
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,600
your foot are these two cups that basically just, they just lock into the bottom of the shoe. And

338
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,320
then on the bottom, that is the skate. And how long is the blade? The blade's about 17 to 18

339
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,560
inches long. It's again, it's only about a millimeter thick, a little bit thinner than a short

340
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,520
track blade. The actual bend and rocker of the skate is different, but it's a relatively flat

341
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,560
blade, correct? It's very flat. I used to play hockey growing up, but I was a goalie and goalies

342
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,480
have a much longer flatter skate than the skaters. The skaters have a very rounded blade. And so

343
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,920
when you're a goalie, you have all of this equipment on, so you're relatively slow.

344
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,880
But in a straightaway, a goalie, even with all his equipment, can generally skate pretty fast,

345
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,160
even relative to the regular skater, just because you have more blade on the ice. So I'm assuming,

346
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,480
I don't know how many inches it is, but it's obviously much shorter than what you're describing.

347
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,720
So when you have what, 17, 18 inches of surface on that ice, that's a ton of contact, right?

348
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,360
A ton of contact, but it's only in between the two cups at any moment and even shorter actually

349
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,840
of the time of which your blade is touching the ice. We can get into those details

350
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,040
in differently, but that's long track speed skating. They then evolve to a clap skate,

351
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,920
which means that the rear heel of the blade was hit.

352
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,560
Detaches, yes.

353
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,360
And it detaches so that when you push, the blade actually still stays on the ice as a full pull.

354
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,240
As the heel comes off.

355
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,520
So you get like a five to 15% additional advantage every single time you push. And I

356
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,920
was, I watched that phenomenon come on.

357
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,400
How much of an impact did that have on times?

358
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,040
It changed everything. It changed who was good. It changed who wasn't good. It changed which

359
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,920
countries were really strong for a period of time because people couldn't understand how to skate in

360
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,920
a clap skate mechanism because the technique is so much different. And it really became a lot to do

361
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,880
with the type of equipment that you had and your ability as an athlete to transfer your power

362
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,600
through the clap skate mechanism. You could be the world's greatest on a fixed skate mechanism,

363
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,240
go to the clap skate and not even make the top 20. So it was a really difficult learning curve

364
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,520
for a lot of athletes. And a lot of people started just to just basically give up and they just,

365
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,320
they just dropped out.

366
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,040
What year did that transition take place?

367
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:23,800
This was 1995 when we really started to see it. 95, 96 and 97 was when that was the peak years

368
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,240
of the clap skate really changing.

369
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,800
What drove that technological change? Was there some whispering that, oh, this is politically

370
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,640
motivated to change the power structure within the sport? Because which countries

371
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,120
prior to the 90s were the most dominant in long track?

372
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, I would say with the exception of the Americans, right? It's always been the Europeans

373
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,880
were always the best. A couple of Japanese, but for the most part, it was always the Europeans,

374
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,000
meaning the Netherlands, some of the Germans, and some of the Russians.

375
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,720
Though Eric Haydn in 1980, has anyone ever matched that feat?

376
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,400
No one has ever matched that feat. I don't think anyone ever will match that feat.

377
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,040
And that feat again was he won five golds.

378
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,800
He won the 500, the 1000. He went all the distances in one Olympic games, which is,

379
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,080
it would be like Usain Bolt.

380
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,880
No, no, it's, yeah, there's no way to explain that. I mean, the closest thing to that that I

381
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:20,600
would say in recent times is Katie Ledecky winning the 200, the 400, the 800 in the Olympics.

382
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,440
If there were a 1500, which there is in the worlds, but not in the Olympics, don't get me

383
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,080
started on that. She would have won that as well. But you're right. I mean, it's sort of like

384
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:37,160
prefontaine at one point holding the American record in everything from, I think, the 1500 to the 10K.

385
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,560
Then of course, to win the gold in all of those is.

386
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:47,640
And Eric was a specimen. He was a very special genetic human being and is. Aside from that,

387
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,520
his work ethic was astronomically high and he was a complete, this guy was a savage when it

388
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:01,160
came to training. He would bury and still does, by the way, bury most people on a bike and he

389
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,080
doesn't train anymore. He's just, his ability to tolerate pain and threshold and lactic acid

390
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,240
is like when I was like, when you watch a racehorse and that racehorse is obviously in pain,

391
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,680
but doesn't slow down. It's very similar. And when I was growing up, Eric Haydn was the king.

392
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,680
And to be honest with you, he's to me, he's still the king. And I tell him he's still the king

393
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,400
because what he did was so ridiculously difficult. And my sport of short track speed skating,

394
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,160
by the way, is very different than long track.

395
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,720
Yeah, I want to come to that. But before we leave Eric, I mean, one, I know we've talked a little

396
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,720
bit about some of his training. I want to hear more about that later on. But my one connection

397
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,160
to him is of course, he went to med school at Stanford, which is where I went. And when I was

398
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,640
in med school, I used to ride my bike a lot. And there's this very famous hill near Stanford

399
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,400
called Old Lahonda, which is sort of the benchmark hill for cyclists. And anyone listening to this

400
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,840
who rides a bicycle in the Bay Area knows Old Lahonda and not only knows it, knows their time

401
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,640
up it, because that is the metric. That is the equalizer. It's about three and a half,

402
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,920
3.6 miles. It's got a number of switchbacks. It's relatively steep. I feel like it's almost 7%

403
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,520
grade on average. And I believe the benchmark time is about 20 minutes. So if you're below 20

404
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,400
minutes, you're allowed to call yourself a cyclist. If it takes more than 20 minutes, you know, you

405
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:25,240
ride a bike. So it took me a while to break 20 minutes. My roommate in medical school, his name

406
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,360
is Matt McCormick. He was about 17 minutes, 20 seconds, which was exceptional. He was certainly

407
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,600
the fastest of any of the people that I knew on a bike. Eric Haydn apparently was about 14 and

408
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,720
a half minutes up Old Lahonda, which was and remains to my knowledge, the record up that hill.

409
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,760
And I used to, I had a model that I built that would calculate how many watts you needed to

410
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,520
average to go up that hill. And I forgot, I don't think I've ever plugged Eric's time into it, but

411
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,080
it wouldn't surprise me if that were a 600 watt effort given his body weight.

412
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,520
He's a big guy. Eric Haydn was a very big and heavy, obviously quad dominant athlete.

413
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,480
So, I mean, I should go back and do that. But I think for someone Eric's weight to have gone up

414
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,760
that in 14 and a half minutes, it's hard for me to imagine he could have done that at less than 600

415
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,520
watts, which anybody who's ever stepped foot on any sort of ergometer knows that like anybody can

416
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:24,040
hold 600 Watts for 10 seconds. Most people can't do it for a minute. Very few people can hold 600

417
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,280
Watts for a minute to hold it for 14 and a half minutes. That's so much power. And then of course,

418
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,960
he became a professional cyclist. Right. And I think he rode in a couple of tours.

419
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,480
Yeah. Yeah. I think he rode for 7-11 and he's an orthopedic surgeon now and I've never met him

420
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,320
or know him at all, but it's hard for people who don't follow that sport, myself included,

421
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,800
to really reflect on what it would mean to be the best in the world at such a broad

422
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,160
range of distances because those are physiologically completely different events.

423
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,760
I mean, the 500 and the 10,000 have nothing in common really. They're completely different

424
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,440
energy systems. They're different technique, different energy systems, different training.

425
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,080
I didn't even realize that. So of course that makes sense. Different technique, right? It's

426
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,640
the difference between someone running 200 meters versus someone running 5K.

427
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,400
There's different equipment involved. I mean, there's so many things that are so...

428
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,640
And in the 80s, I think sport science was, especially in speed skating, was never a huge

429
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:23,320
part of what we did like track and field and like cycling, which are in my opinion,

430
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:30,280
at the absolute pinnacle of pushing that red line, right, of utilizing science and what we

431
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:37,000
understand of the sport. Speed skating is a very unconventional, it's a uncomfortable position to

432
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,360
be in. It's not natural to speed skate being in that position, especially as a long track

433
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:50,280
speed skater. So to train for that is, and still is, really, really excruciating and there is no

434
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,880
balance, right? We only turn left. So there's lots of imbalances aside from physical being.

435
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,200
But Eric was a huge part of that motivation to train like an animal, as was Lance and a lot of

436
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,320
the other guys who I looked up to as being superhuman, not only for their accomplishments,

437
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:16,200
but the way that they mentally attacked pain and training, because that's where you win your actual

438
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,840
wars in the training part. When you get to the competition, you can't do anything. So if you

439
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,600
didn't show up ready, you can't hide that, you know? In my sport...

440
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,640
You can only lose it by showing up in the wrong headspace, but the right headspace won't win it

441
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,440
if you haven't done the work.

442
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,920
Yeah, your likelihood of doing very well is dramatically much higher if you prepare. And I

443
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,280
think that goes with pretty much anything. So I was really interested in that psychology of what

444
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,040
makes up someone like that. So with Eric Haydn and many other athletes who trained in the

445
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:53,080
same tutelage of his original coaches, and I believe her name was Diana Holum, she was based in

446
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,120
Milwaukee, in the Madison region of the Midwest. And her training methods were very unconventional,

447
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,400
and they were obscene, and they probably would be deemed very, you know, almost punishment.

448
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,120
They're on par with waterboarding today. It's like, you know, not allowed to do that training.

449
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,640
Yeah, like, hey, Eric, here's what we're going to do since you're... And by the way,

450
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,160
we had 100 athletes to start, only 12 remain. That's our team. Now we start training together.

451
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,880
So you can imagine...

452
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,120
Because the other 88 got broken.

453
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,960
Yeah, broken very early, or they just didn't have the ability to recover

454
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,960
based on pure genetics at this time. And that's how we trained back then. And watching and hearing

455
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,800
these stories about Eric going up the Lake Placid ski hill with a large rope tied around him,

456
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:45,800
and that is tied to a tractor trailer truck tire, right? And he's just doing hill sprints up

457
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,200
and down for like three hours. And he just did crazy stuff like Rocky style training. And that

458
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,280
mentality, like, I mean, for me as an athlete, sports science is amazing, and I wish I concentrated

459
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,400
more on it. But that psychology was what I was actually really, really, really interested in.

460
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,880
That's what I loved. I loved to do stuff that people thought was completely obscene and crazy.

461
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,160
And, you know, like, for me, like, I would say 80% of my career, all my races were won ever before

462
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,960
I got to the start line. The other competitors were racing for a second. And they just knew

463
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,920
that I was like just completely off my rocker. I was not in the same headspace as them. I was

464
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,400
different. I didn't talk to anybody. I was... And I wanted to create that kind of bubble, right? And

465
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,600
I got that from these kind of legends who I looked up to. There's a video that will definitely make

466
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,160
sure we link to this. I have a feeling this podcast will have more links to videos than most of ours,

467
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,400
but there's a video that I remember seeing. It was like probably six, seven minutes long.

468
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,040
And it had some snippets or highlights of some of your training. And I actually was discussing it

469
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,360
with Lance Armstrong once we were having dinner. And I was like, dude, you got to see this video

470
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:59,320
of what Apollo was doing. And you were doing, I think, single leg lateral jumps up two steps at a

471
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:06,520
time. Yeah. Yeah. Most likely. I mean, Jesus Christ. I feel like I've done some crazy things in my day.

472
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,680
I just don't think I have the explosiveness single leg. That's the thing. Most people don't appreciate

473
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,200
how much of a reduction you have in power when you go from two to one leg. Right. It's not half the

474
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,720
power. You're losing way more than half when you take that second leg away and then adding to it

475
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,840
that you're doing it laterally. Yeah. Like it's... And I remember in the video, it says, yeah,

476
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,400
this is basically a 48 minute set. Yeah. That was probably following like an ice session. Yes.

477
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,800
Like a two and a half hour ice session. That's where you would do those. I mean, how often does

478
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,200
someone get injured doing that? Because the thing that struck me is like, look, you can be the best

479
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,800
stud in the world. You can have the toughest head in the world, but at some level, your ankle's

480
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,160
going to catch on that stair and you're going to fall over a ladder. Like you're always just

481
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,360
one millimeter away from breaking your ankle. You're looking at me like, no, that would never

482
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,720
happen. Yeah. Never thought about that. Never saw it. Never thought about it. Definitely the risk

483
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,120
is there. But then again, in short track speed skating, I mean, we skate together every day,

484
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,800
sometimes twice a day for four to six hours a day and we're inches from each other. And that blade

485
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,760
is literally this close to my face. Now, if this blade gets this close to my face, it's going to

486
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,440
slice my face off. Just for reference, that's like, that's 12 inches from your face is where

487
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,320
you're putting that blade. I mean, every day, every crossover, every lap. Is that why you have such a

488
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:28,440
smooth shave? The sport was very dangerous. And I used to do really dumb stuff. Like we would have,

489
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,840
at one point in the ISC, the international skating union implemented a rule that had to have,

490
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:41,400
you had to have a neck guard to protect your neck and all major arteries on the body needed to be

491
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,400
covered with a cut-proof material like Kevlar. And so everyone was wearing these cut-proof material

492
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,200
inside of the skin suit. So it was basically sewn into the skin suit, the racing suit.

493
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,240
And I hated the feeling of the Kevlar because it didn't stretch. I used to cut mine out.

494
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,560
So I would rate, it's completely legal, right? But I used to cut mine out and I used to race,

495
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,680
we call it racing naked, right? So you'd race naked. So if I fall with another skater,

496
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,280
the likelihood of me getting cut is like 80%. And you're done. Like that's one time you're done. But

497
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,680
when you're young and you're dumb, I did many, many dumb things like that. But now they actually

498
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,840
check before you get on the ice. They see if you've altered the skin suit.

499
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,400
So what year was Short Track a demonstration sport? Was it 92?

500
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,360
88 in Calgary.

501
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:31,400
88. Okay. And so what was the impetus for creating this new sport?

502
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,080
You know, I'm not sure because the sport actually has been around for a long time. And people used

503
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,720
to do Short Track speed skating outdoor in New York City, I think in the sixties.

504
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,080
I see. So it was just one of those things where the sport had been around forever and it was like,

505
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,160
now we're just going to bring it to the Olympic level.

506
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,120
Yeah. And it was, you go from long track speed skating, which is all about time. It's imagine

507
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,720
like you're watching a track and field race, but no one can ever go outside their lane. You know,

508
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,160
we see that in a hundred meters, but imagine like a mile. You can't move. These is the lane you're

509
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,920
given and there's only two people on the track at a time. And everyone does basically just does

510
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,840
time trials. So that was like not that interesting to me. And also I just liked the fact of racing

511
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,920
was so much more, it was just more intimate, right? And it was psychologically a huge part of what I

512
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,960
wanted to race against other athletes and outsmart or out strategize them. And I like that moment of

513
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,440
risk. And so short track speed skating is very different than long track speed skating. So you

514
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,960
go from a 400 meter oval outdoor to, and long track is also indoor, but to a Olympic size hockey

515
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,680
rank. And the track is 111 meters around at the inside, at the tightest perimeter, right? That's

516
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,600
the actual track size. And you've got instead of just two people on the track at a time going for

517
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,720
against the clock, you've got five to six, sometimes seven to eight skaters on the start

518
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,920
line at once, all racing and jocking for position and drafting each other and passing on the inside

519
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,880
and outside and grabbing each other, bumping, making mistakes and, you know, leaning over

520
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,880
these angles because it's such a tightly held oval inside. Our skates are set up differently.

521
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,480
We don't have a clap skate. It's a fixed skate. We tried using clap skates in 1997 and 1998,

522
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,560
but it just, it was the sport is too dynamic and there's too much weight transfer from the,

523
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,640
from the ball of the foot to the heel of the foot where, you know, sometimes I would lean

524
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,040
so far forward on the ball of my foot. When I'm coming out of a corner, my heel would lift off

525
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,800
using a clap skate. And so it was just very, very dangerous. You couldn't, you couldn't use that now.

526
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,000
I mean, short track speed skating is one that the blades are so offset. So imagine this is my,

527
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,840
my skate. Instead of having the blade right in the middle, the blade is actually way over here

528
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,920
on the, on the left side on both the left skate. Because you're always going left. Because you're

529
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,480
always going left and you're leaning over so much at these angles that you need to have that

530
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:51,160
additional offset to make sure that you can still have enough pressure on that leg and also be able

531
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,280
to maneuver properly. So while I never even realized that in watching that, that your blades were not

532
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,200
symmetric on the bottom of the boot. So they're not even straight. They're actually even sometimes

533
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,080
tilted depending on the, what you like as a skater and your technical. You, as a skater, have some

534
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,040
say in that degree of tilt. You have all the say. So your control over your equipment is the one

535
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,840
thing that is a huge part of short track speed skating that if you don't short track speed skate,

536
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,040
which I'm assuming no one on this listening to the podcast does, it's such a huge part of the sport.

537
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,840
It would be the difference between me feeling like I could never lose and me feeling like I'm not

538
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,920
going to make it into the quarterfinal. Like if my equipment feels that far off, it just feels,

539
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,920
you just feel like you lost all your power. Maybe I can use another example. So imagine you're a

540
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,480
boxer and you've got boxing gloves that weigh, you know, two pounds each. And then imagine the

541
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,960
next time you put the boxing gloves on, then I'll 10 pounds each. That's, that's what it feels like,

542
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,000
how much different it feels like as an athlete when your equipment isn't, is not dialed in or,

543
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,360
and then small things like the ice temperature, the grip of the ice, meaning like your perfect

544
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,160
body weight and the amount of power that you typically generate in the corner. And they wet

545
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,880
the ice, don't they? To give you guys more grip. Yeah. Because the angles you're at are ridiculous.

546
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,840
We pour actually hot water in the corners of both sides of the track. And we actually,

547
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,360
we're actually skating on top of the water. We're actually not digging in the ice. If you slow it

548
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,960
down. So what's giving you the grip? If you're not digging into the ice, you technically are,

549
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,400
but most of the time you're on top of the water. So the grip is a combination of both the,

550
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,400
the way that our blades are set up. There's such a hardcore bend in the blade that when you lean

551
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,640
over on that 1.1 millimeter piece of metal, the blade will flex to a certain degree. And some of

552
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,240
that bend comes out and what's remaining is still a curve that allows you to hook yourself around

553
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:45,320
that corner. Oh, I see. Wow. So if you laid that blade in its maximally flexed position on a flat

554
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:51,080
surface from end to end, could you put like a dime underneath it? Does it have that much bend

555
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,680
or curvature in it? Not a dime, but you can see it. So like if I had my blade here, I should have

556
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,240
brought my skate and I didn't put any pressure on the blade and I just laid it down. The only

557
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,320
ends of the blade will be touching the middle part in between the two cups, which I mentioned,

558
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,840
which was the ball and the heel, that whole area doesn't touch the ice until I put a lot of pressure

559
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:14,360
and then the ends no longer touch in the middle touches. So it's a, we bend our own skates,

560
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:19,640
we rocker our own skates. It's very, you know, it's very technical. We use a radius machine,

561
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,640
which measures one, 1000th of a hair in between these two areas, which is about, I think it's

562
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,920
about like four and a half inches across the blade and we mark it. And so you're born in what?

563
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:36,120
80, 82. So when you're 10 years old, this is a demonstration sport in the Olympics. So by the

564
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:44,040
time you're 13, it's about ready to become a full fledged Olympic sport. And it's sort of,

565
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,360
it's in the crosshairs now for you, which is it's a sport that you're passionate about. Your dad's

566
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,320
like, fine, let's let him do this because it's better than him getting a concussion every day.

567
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,960
When you started, I'm just guessing you were quite naturally talented to begin with because

568
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,800
you alluded to it earlier that you didn't really start training until you were 14. So there was

569
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,760
this year when you were just getting by on talent. Yeah, actually further than that. So,

570
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,360
you know, from 12 till 14, my father took me around to small local speed skating competitions

571
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,520
and I was winning most of them, even the ones internationally, which I say internationally,

572
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,400
meaning just going to Canada. And I wasn't getting any competition in the States. I was getting all

573
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,520
of my challenge from racing against other athletes inside Canada. And I had beaten pretty

574
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:33,080
much anyone west of Toronto. And now it was a time where the only remaining place for me to

575
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:39,160
compete in Canada was Montreal, because that's where the real skaters came out of. So it's the,

576
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,760
it's, it was Montreal, not Vancouver that had the epicenter of skating. Yes. And like Fredericton and

577
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:50,360
a few other places, Quebec and Quebec city was a big producer of great Canadian short tracks,

578
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,840
speed skaters. Something about Quebec, growing up, I was really serious in martial arts and

579
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:01,000
boxing and yeah, like the national championships were always in Quebec or Ottawa, like some place

580
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,280
close to Quebec. And the nationals was the only time you would face these guys. And they were like

581
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,000
a different breed, man. They're different breed. They were really, really tough dudes. Yeah,

582
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,760
they're tough guys. Yeah. And I had a lot of respect for them. The Canadians to me were always

583
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,840
very, very strong in the sport and they still are today. You know, short track speed skating is not

584
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,160
like cycling where you've, you've got all of these different athletes from all these different

585
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,720
countries all over the world. At the time there was only a few really, really strong countries

586
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:36,200
in short track speed skating. The U S was not one of them by the way. So after, so in 92 in the

587
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:43,000
demonstration year, that's sort of the moment when it, I guess, presumably after 92 people say, well,

588
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,920
okay, we're going to take this sport seriously. Now the countries are deciding how much do we

589
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,000
want to invest in this and cross of our athletic programs. Correct. Did the United States at that

590
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,800
moment, did they do well enough in the demonstration games to decide, let's put some resources into

591
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,040
this? We did okay. We weren't definitely weren't dominant and we weren't on the podium. I mean,

592
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:06,440
on the women's side, Kathy Turner had won a gold in 92 and again in 94 other than that, there was

593
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:11,000
no real funding mechanism. We were there, but you know, at the time people were training in

594
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,200
the U P they were training in Marquette, Michigan. Now, were you thinking,

595
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,240
because now by the time you get into the sport, it's 94, which means there was another Olympic

596
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,560
year. Cause that was the year 94 was the year summer and winter offset. If I recall, right.

597
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,920
That was the whole Nancy Kerrigan, Tanya Harding year. Wasn't it? That makes me feel old. Cause I

598
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,760
remember that like it was yesterday. Were you thinking I want to go to the Olympics or were you

599
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,440
just thinking, no, I just want to keep, you know, sort of beating whoever I'm skating against and

600
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,440
I'm going to still be a swimmer. I knew that I didn't want to swim. I see. Okay. Yeah. It was

601
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,040
around that, around that time period. You're kissing Stanford and Michigan. Goodbye. I knew

602
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:50,280
at that time that those were not in my path. Looking back, I very interesting and I don't,

603
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,360
I'm pretty sure I would have not gotten a full ride to Stanford if I had pursued and maybe I

604
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:59,560
would have, but I, you know, obviously I didn't. So, you know, at the age of 14, I was winning

605
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,160
quite a bit of competitions locally in domestically in the United States. And I was essentially being

606
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:10,840
scouted by a few of these junior development program coaches who at the time, the junior

607
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:16,760
development program was in Lake Placid, New York, the same place where the 1980 games were, where

608
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:23,320
Haydn won his amazing five medals and the miracle on ice from the U S beat the Soviets in the summit

609
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,840
final. They went on and won the gold, but that's where I was going to have to move to. And these

610
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,880
coaches, Patrick, one at a time came to my father and said, we, we actually have a lot of interest

611
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,360
in bringing your son early. You have to be 15 years old to be admitted into this program. I was

612
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,000
only 14. And was this a summer only program or was this an academy where you'd actually go to school?

613
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,080
It's a real academy. Like you, you actually literally move there. You go to school there

614
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,800
and you train to be hopefully the next stage would then go to the national team and train to go be a

615
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,800
part of the Olympic program. Okay. I didn't know what any of this stuff meant. Right. So they

616
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,840
approached your dad. They approached my father. They approached me. I wouldn't even know that.

617
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,520
I was like, okay, that sounds not fun. You know, on the other side of the country,

618
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,680
like I want to stay in Seattle. We've got very few sunshine days a year.

619
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:13,320
It's the summertime. Like I don't want to go there. This was 1997, the summer of 1996.

620
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,480
And they essentially said, you know, we, we want Apollo to come and what do you think? And

621
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,960
my father was like, absolutely. I got to get this kid focused on something. You know, I kind of

622
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,040
alluded before that I was pretty mischievous as a kid. I had difficulty concentrating and staying

623
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,760
on task to one specific thing. And are you one of those kids that today would automatically get

624
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,320
this label of for sure. I'm sure I would have been loaded up on all day long, all kinds of stuff.

625
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,440
Right. So which my dad was always, he wouldn't care if I even got that diagnostic. He would

626
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,360
never allow that for some reason. My dad's been like 20 years ahead of the game in terms of

627
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,800
nutrition. I don't know where he learns this stuff, but anyway, different topic.

628
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,560
He's got good lineage, right? I mean, if you, you know, just, just follow the Okinawa and you're

629
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:59,000
pretty much going to be okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The centaurians, my father then approached me and

630
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,840
I remember this very clearly. He's like, look, you've got this incredible opportunity to train

631
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,640
in Lake Placid, New York. You potentially could go on to be a part of the Olympic team,

632
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:13,800
which would mean that you would make the 1998 Olympic team in Nagano, Japan and compete.

633
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,520
Your grandfather is still alive. I'm from Japan. This is your heritage. You had, this is, this is

634
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,000
an incredible opportunity. Wait, was that a real possibility that it was because you would have

635
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,080
only been 16, right? I would have only been 15. 15 in that, for those Olympic games. Correct.

636
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,800
I mean, for a men's sport to go to the Olympics at 15 is almost unheard of. It's not unheard of

637
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:41,400
for women, but for men, that's really, that's amazing that they thought that that was a chance,

638
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,320
right? Yeah. So that was, that was the end goal. Like Michael Phelps went to his first Olympics

639
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,720
at 15. Right. What most people don't realize is he was fifth in the 200 fly, was the only event he

640
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,320
went for, which was still unbelievable. It's hard to believe that a 15 year old boy could have

641
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:02,520
gone to the Olympics and placed fifth in the world at arguably the second most grueling race in

642
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:08,440
swimming, if not the most grueling race in swimming. He went on to break his first world record before

643
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:15,240
his 16th birthday, if my memory serves me correctly, making him the youngest male athlete to ever have

644
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,920
a world record in a time sport. Yeah. Michael's not human. I'm the Michael for years. He's not

645
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,120
human. Doesn't matter what he says. And he trains like a monster, but he also is just not, he is put

646
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,880
on earth to be in that water. I think he told me one time because I'm more comfortable in the water

647
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,200
than I am in my bed. It's more comfortable for me to be, I guess there's like a sense of weightlessness,

648
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,280
right? Yeah. But that's amazing. Well, actually you and Michael have something in common, which is

649
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,080
you are both the most decorated Olympians in the United States in the summer and winter games.

650
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,640
Michael, of course, also being the most decorated Olympian ever, but I don't think any US Olympian

651
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,520
is more decorated in the winter games than you, are they? It's arguable and subjective, right? I

652
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,760
had an amazing career and I was very blessed to be and won that many medals, but I also had the

653
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,080
opportunity to win a lot of medals too, right? So like I grew up in the Olympic training center with

654
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,600
these wrestlers. They only have a chance to win one medal. Right. Yeah. No, certain sports are

655
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,440
amenable to any more medals. That title has been kind of tasked over and over again. And I smile

656
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,280
when I hear it because it's amazing, right? But I still look at Eric Hyde and Bonnie Blair and

657
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,160
they're very good friends of mine and I still consider them to be like, you know, really on

658
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:26,360
top of the podium. So, okay. So it's summer of 96. You're basically being brought in 18 months before

659
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:33,560
what could be your first Olympics. Correct. So it is, it is the summer of 96 opportunity to move,

660
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:40,040
to be part of the junior development program. My father says, you got to do this. I met a

661
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:46,200
mischievous age. I didn't recognize my own talent. He says, yes, I say no. He says red. I say black,

662
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:53,400
like I'm always the complete opposite of what my father is saying. And so, you know, he essentially

663
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,680
packs my bags, tries to explain to me the incredible importance of what I'm about to embark upon.

664
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:07,000
And then drives me to SeaTac airport, drops me off, waves goodbye. And then I wave goodbye. I had

665
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,760
a plan in my head already what I was going to do next. And I walked right to the payphone,

666
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,640
which we use payphones back then in 96. Put a quarter in it. Yep, exactly. And I called my

667
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,800
friend and I said, I'm supposed to go to New York today, but I'm not. Come pick me up from the

668
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:25,000
airport. And then for the next, like I would say eight days, I was bouncing around from like,

669
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,120
no, like almost like 11 days actually, bouncing around from house to house. All while my father

670
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:36,600
believes that I'm still in Lake Placid, but I'm so angry. I'd never called him and he hadn't got

671
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,840
a call from the, what did the coaches do when you didn't show up? So the coaches called him

672
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,040
eventually. I think this is probably like on day six or something like that. And they're like,

673
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,360
Hey, Mr. Oh, no, very curious. The offer is still wide open. We just never heard from you.

674
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:54,680
Do you have plans on still attending? And my dad's like, Oh my God, you lost my son. And,

675
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,920
you know, all these things. And he figures out somehow which house I was at picks me up. He's,

676
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,200
he's very angry, obviously, because essentially I was running away as a kid. And, you know, my dad,

677
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,320
it's got this sense of wisdom and he's noticing these like small little habits that I had been

678
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,200
doing as a child that he really, really tried to train out of me. And he thought that by placing

679
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,920
me in this kind of single discipline sport of going in circles would do a lot psychologically

680
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,760
from a beneficial perspective. I didn't know anything about that time. All I knew is I didn't

681
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,160
want to go there. Why do you think you didn't want to go? I mean, you had been successful. Yeah.

682
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,200
Do you think on some level you were afraid of going and finding out you might not be as good as

683
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,800
you thought you could be? I don't even think it was. I didn't even think I got that deep. I think

684
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,800
it was just, I just didn't, I literally didn't want to go. I wanted to hang out with my friends

685
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:49,320
in the Seattle area. And it was that, it was that simple and also stupid that I was going to be

686
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,320
throwing away potentially. Cause I could have very easily just said, no, I'm not going to do this

687
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,080
thing and done it again. Right. And just never went to New York. And then we would never be sitting

688
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:02,600
here talking about this. So credit again, my father who the second time he comes and takes me

689
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,200
to the airport, gets on the plane. And with the second time, meaning it's still the summer 96.

690
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,160
It's just like a couple of weeks later. Two weeks later. So first of all, I mean,

691
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,560
that's pretty interesting that the coaches there didn't say, well, forget this kid. Like he just

692
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,720
failed the test, right? Like the test was, do you have the mental fortitude to even show up on day

693
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:23,320
one? The coaches were like, we have to have this kid. He's this kid is, he is going to make us

694
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,880
speeds getting like amazing. Those are not my words. These are things that they're trying to

695
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,680
tell my dad, which he tried to kind of tell me to me, but you know, when you're 14 and you don't

696
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,360
agree with anything your father says, it doesn't make any sense. And so again, this time he

697
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,280
accompanies you there. Oh, he makes sure. So he flies to Albion, New York. We take the drive to

698
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,120
Lake Placid. He gets out of the car. He shakes Patrick. Well, in his hands, it's good luck. And

699
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,120
he walked turned around and goes home, you know, and Patrick went and was like, Oh shit. Like I get

700
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:56,280
this, this Calvin and Hobbes character in my life. I don't need this kind of heat. And, uh,

701
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,080
but Patrick actually turned out to be an incredible coach and mentor and guy.

702
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,880
That first night.

703
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:07,000
It was just so awkward and weird. I mean, you're, I mean, I'm a 14 year old kid. I'm living now in

704
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,080
a dormitory. I've got roommates from parts of the country. I don't, I've never heard of or

705
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,080
recognize. And they're all short track skaters or it's short, long skiers.

706
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,480
There's both, there's both in the, in the junior Olympic program, in the Lake Placid Olympic

707
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,080
training center, you've got lose, you've got Bob sled, you've got cross country,

708
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,160
you've got the ski jumping guys, you've got long and short track speed skating.

709
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,480
And you've got all the biathletes and you've got everyone there from the winter regions because

710
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,160
Lake Placid is very cold in the winter. And so I, I'm a complete fish out of water. I look different.

711
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,560
I talk different. I wear different types of clothes. I listen to different types of music.

712
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,600
I can't relate to anybody. And I feel, I hated it there the first seven days. I remember this

713
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:53,480
very viscerally. I really, really every day would call my dad and be like, I hate it. This,

714
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,840
this place is not for me. And my dad's like, just, you gotta give it 30 days. You have to be there

715
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:04,520
for a month. Just give it time. Give it time. And prior to going, had you done much in the way of

716
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,240
off ice training, like, you know, you and I have talked and we're going to talk later today about

717
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:15,160
some of your legendary workouts in the weight room. Had you discovered that yet? Or were you

718
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,120
mostly an on ice guy and not doing a lot of dry land? I mean, my dad would take me when I was an

719
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,680
quad, an inline skater. My dad would wake me up really, really early in the morning before he

720
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,520
went to work and he would make me go to the park and skate. So the tiger dad or whatever you want

721
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,080
to call it. That was very much, and I hated it by the way, it was horrible. I hated it so much.

722
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,840
I told my dad, I want to quit one time. Cause he was like, Oh, you want to quit? Okay. Tell me

723
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,960
that you really, really want to quit. Okay. And for him, it was never about me actually becoming

724
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,160
the best. I don't think that actually was ever part of his goal and life plan. His plan was to

725
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:55,720
instill these mental strengths within me that never allowed me to quit what I was doing,

726
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,920
to develop the capacity to understand what it was like to truly leave no stones and turn during the

727
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,960
preparation. It's a very Japanese in his, in his way, right? Like, okay, you want to do this one

728
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,680
thing, then everything you do is dedicated towards being incredible. And you know, the thing about

729
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:17,480
this, the Japanese sushi masters, right? They have seven years before they're ever allowed to touch

730
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,840
the fish. They're just making rice every day. Dude, I would blow my brains out month two. Like,

731
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,240
I could not deal with that. Right? You're telling me I'm an amazing sushi. Like what happens if

732
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,320
you're just really, really good and you're talented. Nope. There's, you can't break the rules. It's

733
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,040
going to take you seven years of touching this rice and making it perfect before you allowed to

734
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:43,960
touch the fish. So like that kind of mentality of like this ever going method of trying to become

735
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,760
perfect. And my dad left Japan, so he didn't want to do that, but I think he couldn't help himself.

736
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,280
That's just a part of, well, I mean, my guess is he realized that maybe at its most extreme

737
00:59:54,280 --> 01:00:00,520
end, it wasn't what was right for him. But I suspect he realized that there were elements

738
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:06,440
of that that were beautiful, that were important and that he was succeeding as a result of,

739
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,000
I suspect he wanted you to have some elements of that discipline. And that, again, passion might

740
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,480
be overly simplistic, but the ability to stay on that thread and master something, which is

741
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,600
interesting, right? Because look, like all parents, he wanted the best for you. He, at this point,

742
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,400
you know, you're 14. Even maybe he couldn't have imagined you'd go on to be what you did, but it

743
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,040
was like, look, this kid's going to go to college and whatever he's learning here, this grit will

744
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,840
translate over to that next phase of his life. And maybe he didn't really know when had a master

745
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,720
plan. I think he did. And I think he'll tell you that he did, but it wasn't exactly graphed out.

746
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:47,640
This is the recipe for having success and being a successful father, which I consider my father to

747
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,920
be, but it was tough, right? I mean, you imagine I'm really, really, really young and I'm being

748
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,480
forced at waking up at like six or five in the morning to go skate outside in a year.

749
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:02,360
Well, that's right. If I'm doing the math right, you're 14. You're a year younger than the normal

750
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,320
entry to this program, right? Yeah. Yeah. That started. And when we, when I arrived in Lake

751
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:13,320
Placid and I was going through the process of understanding, like if I even liked the sport,

752
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:18,040
like I'm probably like a week number two or three, I started recognizing, wow, this is,

753
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:23,560
I feel a lot of freedom here. I don't, my dad's not here. The only kind of authority figure I

754
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:30,280
have is my coach who is really, really easy, but also I respect because he's figured out a way to

755
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,080
talk to me in a way that speaks to me. Is he kind of your first real coach? He's my first

756
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:40,120
real coach. So all of the previous year and a half or two years, you were. It's my dad.

757
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:44,040
Who obviously, you know, despite his greatness, doesn't really know much about speed skating.

758
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,880
He knows nothing about speed skating. So you're sort of like, you're just going out to the track

759
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,920
and just, you don't have a strategy. You're just trying to win. Yeah. I mean, every time I would

760
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,880
skate back then, it was cheerily based on talent. Nothing more. I didn't train. In other words,

761
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,760
off the line, you're going for broke every time you're not trying to be tactical and outsmart

762
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,800
somebody necessarily. Yeah, basically. And arguably I was just better than most of those kids. They

763
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,560
didn't, in my eyes, they didn't know how to speed skate very well. So now you got this coach and

764
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:16,440
presumably he's looking at you being like, we got to break some habits here. Yeah. So we do the body

765
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,680
composition test first and I'm like, obviously the highest. My nickname was Chunky as a kid.

766
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,520
And, you know, I was eating everything in sight. We had cafeteria. Just let's put this in perspective.

767
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,520
There is no way you were a Chunky kid. I was Chunky. What was your, what was your body fat on

768
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,520
that first test? I don't remember the body fat, but it was the highest and there was some chubby

769
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,080
kids in my, in our program. There were some chubby kids. I mean, look, I'm 14 years old though. I

770
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,360
don't know how, how lean there, I was going to be coming out of there looking like, you know,

771
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,360
shredded, but I was the highest by far. Did you always kind of have that physique of just having

772
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,240
enormous? Yeah. Enormous quads, enormous, enormous, but I was just a thicker kid and partially

773
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,960
because I just was eating everything and I was going to puberty and everything was tasty and I

774
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,280
would just eat it. I had no understanding at any capacity of nutrition and that what it meant.

775
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,600
Which is so funny knowing you now, right? Like you're, you're so dialed on everything.

776
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,280
Yeah. Try to be much more specific in terms of how you live your life. And

777
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:16,360
anyway, but back then it also didn't really matter thinking back. So I, you know, I get these tests

778
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:23,080
back and I'm deeply embarrassed to be, you know, the most chubby kid out there. And I, I remember

779
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,480
the coach telling me one time, like, what do you want to do? Like, what are your goals for this

780
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,720
year? Like goals? What does that even, what do you mean? My goals for this year. I couldn't even

781
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:36,760
think about the next six months, let alone the world team trials in eight months from now. Like,

782
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,320
I had no idea what that meant. And then so I started to understand that I actually liked

783
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,960
speed skating. I liked being out there on the ice. I liked the feeling. I remember one time I,

784
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,680
because I was so embarrassed by that first test. Oh, by the way, going back to just one sort of

785
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,480
technical issue about the sport, Short Track has how many distances? It's the 500, the thousand.

786
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:58,760
500,000 and 1500 meters. 1500. And then we have a relay. And across those three distances,

787
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,000
had you exhibited proficiency equally or were you more geared towards one or the other?

788
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,240
At that age, I was stronger in the 1500 meters. Okay. I was more, I would say we would call it

789
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,280
an endurance athlete. So two and a half minutes on the ice at a time separated by 20 minute breaks.

790
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:19,640
And then you race basically every 20 minutes. Jesus, that is Phelpsian. Yeah. It's like that's

791
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,440
there were races, I think in the Olympics where Michael would have what, 17 minutes between a

792
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,880
heat and a final or something, which it just seems impossible to imagine. Yeah. Your recovery has to

793
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,640
be very, very high. And that's why most athletes in Short Track speed skating, even to this day,

794
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:38,440
they train for all the distances. They train for the 500, which is the pure sprint 40 seconds.

795
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,840
They train for the 1500 meters, which is two and a half minutes. And they even train for the,

796
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,240
3000 meters, which is only held at the world championships, which is like, you know,

797
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:51,800
four and a half minutes. So going back to my story, I was so embarrassed by this body

798
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:57,640
composition test that I sat down with Patrick Wentans and I asked him, is it possible that I

799
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,200
can become too good too early? And he's looking at me. I remember looking at me like, what the

800
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:07,160
hell is this kid talking about? No, that's why you're here. Right. And he's like, no. And I was

801
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,840
like, what happens if you burn out? He's like, he only burn out if you don't like the sport anymore,

802
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:15,960
if we train you too hard, like, and it's not going to be the latter. So as long as you continuously

803
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,160
like this, you're going to be, you're going to do great. You just, you got to focus. And that began

804
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:27,720
my kind of understanding of if I really concentrate on this and I really care about the outcome,

805
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,600
I was able to achieve really, really interesting results. And I went to the junior trials,

806
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,120
which means you make the junior world team and I was supposed to make that team and I didn't,

807
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,400
I got third. So it's like swimming where the top two make it. Correct. Okay. And I remember going

808
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,160
back home and being so pissed that I didn't make that team that I just started actually really

809
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,560
attacking the weight room. Was that kind of your first big loss? Was that the first time you

810
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,240
were surprised at an outcome? It was the first time that in short track speed skating that I was

811
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:00,440
supposed to make a team, but I didn't. And I just remember that feeling was just, it was so like,

812
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:06,440
itchy. It's like an itch that you can't scratch and it's there every day, every second of the hour.

813
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,640
Do you remember that race? What happened? You race at multiple different distances,

814
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,200
but it just, it was a combination of I wasn't good enough and I wasn't racing properly. I

815
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,200
shouldn't have made that team. So you sort of reached your limit of natural talent.

816
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,400
At that age. Yep. And that was the time where if I wanted to make significant changes, I'd have to

817
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,880
really concentrate both technically and also on the physiology of training to be a short track

818
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,440
athlete. And I started attacking the weight room and that was the only way that I knew how to

819
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,560
exert like this, you know, I'm this, I'm going through puberty as a kid. I've got all this

820
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:43,400
testosterone. I'm genetically gifted for the sport. I just have to put it to work. And so

821
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,680
that was the one major difference is I just remember just basically putting more plates

822
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:51,960
on the squat rack at the age of 14. And it was very easy. And I noticed like, I remember like

823
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,640
a week would go by and my like strength would increase by like 30%. Like it was like just

824
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,400
compounding boom, boom. Every single week I was just getting stronger and stronger, stronger.

825
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:07,320
And when I arrived in the world team trials in 96 to make the 1997 world team, I ended up actually

826
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:13,240
winning the competition, which in for, you know, the viewers who don't understand that's like a,

827
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,120
I was 14 years old racing against guys who were grown men. Yeah. So this is a junior world.

828
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:22,120
No, this is everybody. The team to go to the world's represent the US. This is, and again,

829
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:26,920
for most people who don't follow Olympic sports outside of Olympic years, you know, you sort of

830
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:31,240
have an Olympics three out of four years because you've got the Olympics or worlds. You actually

831
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,240
compete every single year. Yeah, exactly. So you, you, we've got world cups, we've got world

832
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,760
championships and that's what we're doing. You know, every single, we're not working at like

833
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:46,200
home Depot and just like having fun. So you made the team for, this is 97 to go to the world. So

834
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:51,480
this is the team. This is now means you're an odds on favorite to go to the Olympics in 98.

835
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,320
Absolutely. I mean, I dominated those trials. What did you do at the worlds that year?

836
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:00,280
I think I got 19th in the world, I think. And I remember that I had never skated against the

837
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,960
Chinese or the Korean. I only skated against Canadians and Americans at the time.

838
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,960
So you hadn't even skated against Europeans. I skated against no one other than those two

839
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,920
countries. And you know, when you talk about Canadians, I probably skated against really

840
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:16,040
only like 10 guys from Canada who were semi-competitive with me. So when I went to the

841
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,240
world championships, the first thing I noticed was the track pattern in which these athletes

842
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,840
were skating were so vastly different. And that's when this light bulb came on my head.

843
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:30,120
And I was like, Oh my God, the US is so far behind. We are skating the wrong way.

844
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:35,720
Everyone is basically when they exit the corner, they're hugging the, you know, the blocks. And

845
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,720
they're basically creating the smallest distance possible to protect their inside lane and position.

846
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:45,480
And I was way out by the boards. So you're taking a faster turn, but going a greater distance,

847
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,840
right? You're basically creating more pressure on your legs, but you're being more protected.

848
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:53,560
So it's also, I just noticed the strategy was so much more important in international competitions.

849
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,040
And I felt like we were skating two different races and you know, I performed, you know,

850
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,480
pretty poorly because it's my first world championships, but that's when I saw like,

851
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:06,600
this is the big leagues. These are the guys who are really training to win medals. These are the

852
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,440
Koreans, these are the Chinese, these are the Canadians. This is the real national teams.

853
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,960
This is all they care about. This is all they do on a day to day basis. And it was a huge difference

854
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,520
between racing domestically at the world trials level in the US versus international.

855
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,240
Once you actually go. And that's when I was like, wow, I have to, if I want to remain

856
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,200
competitive, like I felt so, I felt so far away at that time. Were you discouraged? I mean,

857
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,840
it sounds like a silly question to be 19th, but did you actually expect to go there and win

858
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,840
or did you expect to do better than 19? No, I didn't have any expectations to be honest with you.

859
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:44,040
I didn't know what to expect. What I did understand was, you know, again, this is 97. So this is

860
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:48,840
pre-Olympic year, which means we were having the world championships in Nagano, Japan,

861
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,120
because they usually want to have a test event to make sure the venue works properly. So you can

862
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:57,960
imagine all of the Japanese that are there, right? My father's there, my grandparents are there.

863
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:03,160
I mean, it's a full arena with 20,000 people in that arena. I'm 14 years old. I've never skated

864
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:07,640
in front of more than like a thousand people in my life, let alone this many people. And I just

865
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:13,720
remember the roar was so deafening. And I just was like, man, this is, this is, this feeling is

866
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:19,240
so addictive. And looking at like all the other athletes in their like colorful skin suits and

867
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,880
the Koreans and they skated so differently than we did, the Chinese had their own style of skating,

868
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:29,160
the Canadians, the Italians. And I was like, man, this is like, this is crazy. Like this is,

869
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:34,120
I can't believe that I'm here. And I finished that competition. I very much realized and

870
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:38,840
recognized that the Koreans, in my view, were significantly better than everyone else.

871
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,840
Technically, the way they raced, the way that they carried themselves on and off the ice was

872
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,520
very, very unique at the time. And, you know, I came home from those world championships with

873
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,640
an incredible experience. I mean, mentally and psychologically. And then unfortunately,

874
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,120
instead of spending, this is now 97 this summer. So I'm going into

875
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,360
a lot of trials for the Olympics are going to be in February of 98.

876
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:08,120
So I come home in March of 97. So you've got basically eight months till the trials.

877
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:12,760
So I've got three and a half to four months until I go back into the national team program. Now,

878
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,600
before I was in the junior team program training in Lake Placid, we now I would be relocated to

879
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,640
Colorado Springs, the official Olympic training center of the United States. And this is where

880
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:26,600
all of the guys who I just beaten, you know, a month before this is where everyone's going to

881
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,080
be housed and trained 80% of the guys, some guys had their own personal coaches and Saratoga Springs

882
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:36,840
and other areas, but most of the team was training in one location. And, you know, if you have 12

883
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:42,280
people there, only five are selected to the team. One is an alternate for skate, the relay,

884
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,200
the top two from each distance skate individually, the games with an opportunity to win a medal.

885
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:52,200
None of this makes any sense to me still. Okay. Even though I had just won and even though I had

886
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,680
done very, very well, I come back from that competition and I go back to Seattle and instead

887
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:05,720
of training, my food choices were like basically Taco Bell pizza and zero, zero athletic activity.

888
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:12,360
I'm talking to it. Why? I don't think that I truly understood the importance of the off ice

889
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,440
training mechanism and off season training. I thought this was the break that you're supposed

890
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,080
to take. And my dad's like, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be working out. I was like,

891
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,640
Oh, whatever. I just, you know, tell him I did. And I just, I didn't. And I, I fell back in the

892
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:29,880
same negative habit of hanging out with the same kind of crowd and individuals who that's what my

893
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,680
dad wanted me to get away from. And now what I was doing, I'm getting older, I'm more crafty,

894
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,640
you know, I've got experiences under my belt and I'm just doing it on my own. And finally,

895
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,720
when I get back to Colorado Springs, you know, I, and you head back at the end of the summer,

896
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,200
the beginning of the summer now, this is the end of the summer, the summer of 98. So you're like

897
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:53,000
four months from trial more like maybe like five and a half months from trials. And so now I'm in

898
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,880
a position where I've gained like all this, I think I gained like 20 pounds or something crazy

899
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,560
from when they saw me the last time you can imagine, right? I'm still going through puberty.

900
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:07,400
I'm still kind of maturing zero training, eating complete garbage food. And my physique totally

901
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,000
changed. Like I just show up with like spacey. There's two spare tires around my, but my body,

902
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,120
you know, and they're like, and I remember hearing when we're doing body composition,

903
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,280
we all take our shirts off and do the, do this test. I remember some of the other athletes going,

904
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,840
holy shit, like what the hell is that kid been doing? Because everyone's been busting their

905
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:28,040
ass in the off season because they all recognize the importance. And I, I just remember being

906
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,600
called a Springs and it was a different environment. I didn't, I didn't have Patrick

907
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,760
wetlands. My head coach had a different coach at the time because Patrick stayed with the junior

908
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:42,920
team. No, Patrick was the assistant coach now to the national team. He had zero power or say in

909
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,400
any of the training, just the way that structure was working at the time. And I wasn't mentally

910
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:52,200
committed to the sport at that time. And that's not a good thing, right? So here I am now training

911
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,880
with the national team, huge importance. Everyone's trying hard. Everyone's committing everything

912
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,920
they're doing. And I just going through the motions during that year. I just, do you have

913
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:03,320
a sense with the benefit of hindsight as to what, what else might've been going on in your head at

914
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,960
that time? Cause you've now tasted success, right? And not only have you tasted success,

915
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:13,720
you've tasted success on the back of huge effort, right? You had already discovered the weight room.

916
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:19,400
You had discovered your capacity for work, which like Phelps and like Haydn and like

917
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,840
all these other great athletes, it's really the capacity for training that seems to differentiate

918
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:31,000
them. You figured out you had that, you figured out your super power and then you decided, yeah,

919
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,480
I'm not going to do it. It's like this self-sabotage. I think that early in my career,

920
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:41,480
and I actually, I struggled with this later on in my career too, as an athlete where it's going so

921
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:47,400
well. It's almost too perfect. It's too easy. Let me throw, let me throw a little monkey wrench in

922
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,280
here and really let, let's see if I don't train and if I can really make the team again, because

923
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:57,080
let's see if I'm really that good. Yeah, yeah. I see what you're saying. So psychologically,

924
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:01,960
I had a pattern. I think of doing that. What's the minimum effective dose of training I can get to

925
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,440
still, you know? Yeah. Let me basically like screw off and like almost throw this opportunity totally

926
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,040
away and see if I can still come back and get it and remind me, cause I'll come back to that. And

927
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:15,320
the way that I raced for many, many years also is exactly like that. Let me wait until the very,

928
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:19,480
very last lap to make a move. I don't know. That's a very dangerous, like you're talking about,

929
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:24,360
it has to be perfect. You can't, yeah, the margin's gone. Yeah. So you're playing with fire at that

930
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:29,640
point. Right. And I remember one time skating a race, great Canadian speed skater, Mark Ganyal,

931
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:34,200
he watched me do this. I got waited till the last half lap that I passed all four skaters on the

932
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:39,400
outside and he's like, Oh, you're playing with fire, man. You're going to get burned one day.

933
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,960
You know, I remember that like in my head because I did and it, and it did burn me. So anyway, so

934
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,640
I mean, just to go back to your question. Yeah, that's, that's what happened. I mean, I,

935
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:55,240
I've been blessed enough. I was blessed to have a really unique gift to athletics and specifically

936
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:59,560
in short track speed skating. And I was really squandering. It was so easy. It was too easy.

937
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:05,160
I couldn't recognize that you've got this talent. You really also have to really, really dedicate

938
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:09,000
yourself and don't throw away this incredible opportunity because there's a thousand guys in

939
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,200
line who have half the talent, but would do 10 times more work just to be a fraction of what

940
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:19,160
you could possibly become. I didn't recognize it. It was just so stupid. And I'm, I kicked myself

941
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,320
now thinking about that, but that's what happened. So the whole year that year in Colorado Springs,

942
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:27,640
I went, they're just going through the motions, very defiant against my coach. Didn't really

943
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:32,120
want to be there. So when you entered the trials in December of 98, did you think you were going

944
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,520
to make the team? No, I, I wrote it off. I was like, I don't even want to make the team.

945
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:42,920
So you completely self-sabotaged at this point. I am so far departed. I'm the same. I have the

946
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:49,320
same mentality as I did before I went to Lake Placid. And so when I go to these trials and we

947
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,680
do a time trial in the beginning, let's say there's, let's say there's a hundred people show up for

948
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:59,320
the trials. You do a nine lap time trial and from those results, only 16 are now racing. And that's,

949
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:05,880
that's the bracket. 16 people now is making up your preliminary quarter heat semi final. I finished

950
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,280
a year. Don't say 17th. I finished 16th in the trials. So you made it. No, no, I didn't make the

951
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,640
team. I made the cut from the bracket, but I got last. So basically I should have got 17. That means

952
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:19,160
we wouldn't have to skate the whole competition. Right. Right. Right. I ended up skating the whole

953
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,720
competition. So you now earn the right to complete the right. I earn the right to try to compete.

954
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,720
And we still have video tapes of this, like every race I'm just crossing the line with like my head

955
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:34,760
facing the ice and looking down and just completely defeated as you know, a 15 year old. And so my

956
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,880
father, this to me is a really important part of my life. My father sees this and he had been

957
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:46,200
spending all his time in Seattle, right? So my father sees this. He then takes me from Boston

958
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:50,200
with the time. So it takes me back to Seattle after the meet you've lost. You didn't make the

959
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:55,240
team. I mean, everyone was just, I hear the quiet conversations. Oh my God, this kid is just, you

960
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,840
know, he's another student who stood away. He has so much talent. My dad's embarrassed, right? He's

961
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:05,000
like, Oh my God, like this, you know, what the hell happened? Like you were number one, less than a

962
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,720
year ago, you were supposed to go and be a medalist. My dad already bought tickets for the

963
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,520
Olympic games. Like he'd already set aside time to spend there. So now we're in, we're in a spot

964
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,120
where my dad is like, look, you have to make a decision. Do you want to continue in this path of

965
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,880
Olympic, you know, pursuit or do you want to do something else? And I was like, I don't, I don't

966
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,760
know what I want to do. He goes, that's exactly what I'm talking about. You don't know what you

967
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,080
want to do. So he takes me to this place where we used to go to and have vacations, which is three

968
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:37,160
and a half hours Southwest of Seattle area called Mo Clips beach, which is sounds nice, but it's

969
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:42,280
like rains like, you know, 300 days a year. And it's like very dark and it's beautiful now, but

970
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,800
he drops me off and he says, you're going to stay here until you figure out what you want to do with

971
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:51,480
your life. What do you mean stay there? You're going to stay here in this cabin. We rented a cabin

972
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,800
and you're going to stay here until you're ready to do the real answer with what you're going to do.

973
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,360
And I don't care what the answer is, but you have to come to a real decision and commit yourself.

974
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,760
And that's what you're going to do. And he leaves.

975
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,640
This is like the best parenting story in the history of parenting.

976
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,600
The bad kid, right? The only tough love is the only way to do this.

977
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:14,120
And he drops me off and he says, this is what you got to do. And I have food and I didn't have,

978
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,080
I mean, there's no video games.

979
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,240
Yeah, exactly. You don't have a cell phone and iPad.

980
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:22,360
There's no Instagram. There's no, there's nothing. It's just me and nature. And I have like workout

981
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:27,240
gear. I have a stationary bike. Like I have my old bike and I set up a little spinner in the back

982
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,080
and that's it. And like a pen and pad to write, to make notes and journal.

983
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:37,640
And every day I'm in here 15, 15. And you know, again, if you go back, like I, I grew up kind of

984
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,880
taking care of myself, so it's not a big deal to me, but I mean, thinking back, I'm like, Oh my God,

985
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,040
that's a pretty serious. What do you think? Have you ever talked to your dad about what was going

986
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,480
through his mind on the three and a half hour drive back to Seattle when he dropped you off?

987
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:55,000
He was terrified and scared and, and, and afraid he's making the wrong decision. Is he a bad parent?

988
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,480
Is this too much? Am I going to be able to handle it? And I think my dad is like, this is,

989
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:07,560
nothing else is working. No one can get to this kid. He's got all the green lights in his life

990
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,440
and he's throwing them away. Like this is it. This is the last straw. This is the last effort

991
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:18,200
with the guy didn't have, you know, jocko willing down the street to like basically say, you know,

992
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:23,720
like to really drill home the importance of what it needs to be done. I can call jocko right now.

993
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:29,800
And I would love it. I would have invited him over for dinner tonight. I never even thought of it.

994
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:36,440
So just thinking back, I was so fractured mentally. Did that first night in that cabin hurt more than

995
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:42,200
that first night your dad yanked you back to Lake Placid? No, those would be two tough nights, right?

996
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:50,040
It was different because this time when I left the Olympic trials in 98, I actually knew that I

997
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:54,520
could have made the team. And here's the sick part. I think that if I trained just for one month

998
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,760
before, I probably would have been top three and I would have made the team had I just put like a

999
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:04,040
fraction of effort and I didn't want to do it. I know for sure. I wanted to taste such devastating

1000
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:12,040
defeat when I'm supposed to win something. I think I was addicted to that self-sabotage of,

1001
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:17,800
okay, I'm at the real bottom now. What do I got to do? And so I spent nine days in this cabin

1002
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:23,720
alone writing down, making a journal. I still have the notes actually. I'm writing down my thoughts

1003
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:31,400
and praying and trying to just determine like why am I here? What am I supposed to do? Give me a

1004
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:37,800
sign. I was like mindlessly going out on these runs 45 minutes, an hour, half an hour. And

1005
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,680
it's raining every single day, by the way, because this is December and it's cold. And like there's

1006
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,360
no, by the way, there's no one there. This is like the place where they send people who are part of

1007
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:49,960
the witness protection programs. Like there's literally, there's like a, there's a native

1008
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,480
American reservation, 15 miles up the road. And other than that, there's like, there's literally

1009
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:57,720
no one else staying at these cabins. So it's you and like someone from the Gambino crime family

1010
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:02,600
and witness protection as a 15 year old. It's not fun. I mean, now I would like love to spend time

1011
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:06,920
there alone. And so I was going to say, give me the address I need to go. It's incredible. I mean,

1012
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,840
it's a place where I go when I need to make really, really what I consider to be important decisions

1013
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,800
where I want to make a shift. You still go. I haven't been in a couple of years, but I'm,

1014
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,600
I'm planning on taking actually my girlfriend pretty soon. It's a beautiful place is there's

1015
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,840
nature is, I think really, it's always been a very important part of my life. I think my dad did

1016
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,880
that when I was ready to go where the exact cabin was. I know the exact cabin. I know the exact

1017
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,200
place. They rebuilt it. Right. So it's, it's much nice. Someone bought the, it was called the iron

1018
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:37,480
Springs resort at the time. And back then it was iron and Springs generally don't go side by side.

1019
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:43,560
It wasn't nice. And definitely they should have left off the word resort for sure. At the time,

1020
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:49,880
if like iron Springs jail, you know, penitentiary, every road is basically like a one-way road and

1021
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,480
you're surrounded by the beautiful trees. But again, I'm just running every day and mindless.

1022
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:58,360
I'm just trying to figure it out. 15 years old. I'm at the fork in the road. What do I want to do?

1023
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:02,360
Do you want to please my dad? Does my dad want me to speed skate? Does he want me to do this? And

1024
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,920
then finally I was like, you know what? Like, I think I want to speed skate. I think I want to

1025
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:11,880
actually truly dedicate myself to do this. And also I was pretty bitter that I didn't make the

1026
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:17,480
team, which doesn't make any sense. Right. Cause I didn't, I threw it away. Yeah. But I was also like,

1027
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,960
I hated the feeling of that, of like the opportunity was there and I didn't take it.

1028
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,480
Were you still in touch with your friends that you had grown up with that obviously for the

1029
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,120
year and a half prior, you'd been somewhat detached from because you're now living this

1030
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,720
separate life training. But what did your friends think of this opportunity? I mean,

1031
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,320
did a lot of them, they didn't know, they didn't understand what you were going through. No,

1032
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,240
I didn't really talk about it. They didn't really understand. And that was very much in my own head.

1033
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:51,240
And it was, it was when I made the decision to continue one more time and really, really give

1034
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:58,680
short track speeds, getting a try is that changed my whole life. I mean, what do you think happened

1035
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:06,040
in that nine days that made you, cause you had to leave there, go back home, watch the Olympics six

1036
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:13,240
weeks later, basically watch three other skaters in your flag and your colors and thought, you know,

1037
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:17,080
I really could have been one of those guys and then decide, I mean, not that you would have known it

1038
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:22,600
at the time, but this would go on to occupy your life for the next 12 years. Right. Yeah. So I,

1039
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,760
I remember calling my father and saying, I made a decision. I want to come back to Seattle. And he

1040
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,400
didn't ask me what the decision was, by the way, he just came and picked me up and drove me back.

1041
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,600
And during that three and a half hour drive, I explained him what I want to do. And he's,

1042
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:43,160
I think I can feel that he's like, okay, let's see. And so I go back to Lake Placid, the train

1043
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,520
under a different coach. You wait till the Olympics are over. I don't know. This is,

1044
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,960
this is still during the Olympics. I go, I go the right away because after the Olympics,

1045
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,840
there's a world team trials, which the format's messed up. But so after the Olympics is a world

1046
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:59,320
team trials. Now I have the opportunity of, of making the world team, which at this time,

1047
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:04,920
after the Olympics, no one's training, no one cares about the world team. And I remember just

1048
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:11,160
kind of training really hard and studying and I get, I get sixth at those world team trials.

1049
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,840
So I was a double alternate, which means I would skate no distances at all, but I would basically

1050
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,840
just carry the bags for everybody. And if two guys got hurt, then I had a chance at getting in.

1051
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:23,960
So I went to those world championships and I was, I just had a different view. My, something had

1052
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:29,240
switched in my mind and I started taking notes and I made promises to myself, like real legitimate

1053
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:35,400
promises that I could never get out of it. When I get home, I'm not calling anybody. No one's even

1054
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,280
going to know that I'm back home in Seattle and my off season or the time spent after this,

1055
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,640
the next four and a half months is going to be completely dedicated towards just,

1056
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:48,520
just being a monster. And so set up the stationary bike in the basement, had a small seven inch or

1057
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:54,120
nine inch Sony Trenton TV, VCR, and I just watched skating tapes every single day, trained twice a

1058
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:59,960
day alone until I arrived back in Colorado Springs as a part of the national team program. And I was

1059
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:05,000
significantly more fit and stronger than anyone else and developed such a strong aerobic base that

1060
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,120
I was bearing everyone on my team. Even though I was still ranked number six, I was by far number

1061
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:16,840
one. And so the next big test for you would have been the 99 worlds. Yep. Which was where that year?

1062
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:22,840
Sophia Bulgaria. The real test was actually that year, 98. I won my first world cup medal. I ended

1063
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:26,920
up winning a gold in the thousand meters against the reigning thousand meter Olympic champion,

1064
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:32,120
Kim Dong-sung and Fabio Carta, who was like many times you should have been, you should have been

1065
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:38,440
world champion. And I won. I came out of nowhere. That became my real first taste of, of winning

1066
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:43,160
on the world circuit. And again, this is post-Olympic year. So it's not that important. Like

1067
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:47,960
people don't really care. No one in the US is even watching this stuff. It really cared to me.

1068
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:53,000
It also was a time where I got in, I started to work with a sports psychologist and that was the

1069
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,960
big, big difference in terms of performance. What did he or she teach you or what was the most

1070
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:03,560
important insight that you got early on from that experience? So this, this guy named David Creswell,

1071
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:07,880
who was pretty young at the time, I think he was actually still studying and he was going to. How

1072
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:12,520
did you meet him? He was brought in as an intern to basically look over a lot of the younger athletes.

1073
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,720
And he also was doing a sports psychology kind of residency program at the Olympic training center.

1074
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,880
And so he was so pro about all these different things. And he started asking me,

1075
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:27,320
we would play badminton like for fun. I would make mistakes like over and over again. And he would

1076
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,920
notice that I was kind of getting down on myself and he would ask me these like little questions.

1077
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:35,960
Oh, what happened there with that shot? And I, this guy was so young. I was like, I can't respect

1078
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:40,040
this guy. And I just, I didn't recognize the time that he was basically trying to figure out

1079
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:45,800
how I ticked, like what made me angry and the inconsistencies that would happen on the court

1080
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:51,240
were a direct representation of actually what was happening in sport. And so that was my first

1081
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:55,800
real foray into understanding. And so we did everything from like, you know, meditation

1082
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:00,040
exercises to breathing exercises, to writing down positive self, you know, the basics, right?

1083
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:05,000
Positive self-talk, manifesting what you want. And then he began my real true process of

1084
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,160
visualization. And then I ended up winning the 99 junior world at that time in Montreal,

1085
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:14,040
which was a huge win. The time was still eligible to compete at junior world. I was still eligible

1086
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:20,760
16. And it was hugely beneficial. The mental component of the sport was always to me,

1087
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:26,120
the most fascinating and the most underutilized in every aspect. And to my detriment later on

1088
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:31,240
in my career too, because we did, I did things that completely are very destructive when we look

1089
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:34,920
at the thing about it in terms of sport science and the training that we did. And, but to me,

1090
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:40,360
I didn't care. Like I wanted the edge of being able to say, I'm going to wear this 45 pound weight

1091
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:45,560
vest. I'm going to go up this man to incline five times back to back and do skating jumps

1092
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,760
every 25 steps on one leg and then switch to the left and then do them alternate boom, boom, boom,

1093
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,280
and just do that back to back until basically I throw up. Now there's no physiological benefit

1094
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:58,920
you're getting after like the first set, right? But the psychological advantage that you created

1095
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:05,080
just this mental hardness that no one else would do. And I loved it. The harder it snowed outside,

1096
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,000
the less people that are outside. I want to be out there with the weight vest doing some dumb

1097
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
training. That to me was the epitome of what was a driving force later on in my career. And I

1098
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,360
craved it time and time again. You mentioned it earlier, and I know you've talked about in the

1099
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:23,560
past that you always looked at boxers as role models, even though you didn't end up boxing.

1100
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,200
And it's funny because that's very much a boxer's mentality, right? I mean, I think with every

1101
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:33,640
sport, so much of it is going on between the ears, especially a sport when it's against another

1102
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:39,160
individual, which is not the takeaway from the team sport, but when you lose in tennis, there's

1103
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:45,480
no subtlety about who won and who lost, right? But this idea of how the training feeds the beast,

1104
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:50,440
growing up, I felt it's so funny. I mean, on a much smaller level, I remember I used to run at

1105
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:55,640
4.30 every morning. So all of high school, I would run at 4.30 and it had to be somewhere between 5

1106
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:01,560
and 13 miles was the distance. And growing up in Toronto, it was so cold in the winter that

1107
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:06,120
like the colder it was and the darker it was, the happier I felt. Because I remember thinking like

1108
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:11,480
the guy I'm going to fight is not up at this moment. There is no way he is in a warm bed.

1109
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:17,800
And that just that fact absent any physiologic benefit became the thing that you needed to hang

1110
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:22,440
on to. And again, I don't know how many skaters thought that way, but you clearly were training

1111
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:27,160
like a fighter. And living in the Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center, we were all

1112
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:32,440
rooming with different short trek athletes. And then there was one time in which instead of

1113
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:36,760
rooming with a short trek athlete, they had asked me if I wanted to room with a wrestler. And every

1114
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:40,920
one at the time was like, no, the wrestlers are dirty. These guys always get staph infections.

1115
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:45,560
They're like just nasty. Then they're crazy. And I was like, sure, I don't mind. Like I'll

1116
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:52,760
run with the wrestler. And that was my first entrance into the mind of a fighter. And I loved

1117
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,680
it because I'm like, look, I wear spandex for a living and skating circles. It's not the most

1118
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:02,680
manly thing known to me on this planet, but I wanted it to be more than it's not as primal.

1119
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:07,400
I mean, you could argue wrestling or practicing are about as primal as any sport gets. Right.

1120
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,720
You're fighting against another human being, basically. In my own right, I was fighting in

1121
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:17,720
my own ways. Right. And there's many correlations there. But I love the psychology of those wrestlers

1122
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:23,000
that I would see. And I would go in the sauna post weight training workout. And I would,

1123
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,200
I was the only non wrestler in the sauna every time they were in there ever. And I just remember

1124
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,400
like talking to these guys and hearing them talk to each other and watching them cut weight and be

1125
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,840
like, these guys are not human. They are doing everything against what I was told from a sport

1126
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:42,120
science perspective. And they still are winning like that mental toughness and fortitude.

1127
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:49,720
That's what I craved was that old school Rocky mentality and that hardness that is created that

1128
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,440
I loved. And I thought that was the only way that I could beat the Koreans. That was the only

1129
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:58,520
because I didn't skate as beautiful as they did. And even to this day, I still love it. Right. I

1130
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:03,160
still like that mentality. And it was a huge part of my career was was developing that mental

1131
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:10,280
fortitude and that strength and that consistency of being so obsessive and replace my self sabotage

1132
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:15,480
stuff with the self sabotage came in the form of like, let's just do some workout that makes no

1133
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:20,280
sense. Yeah. You went to the pendulum swung so far. You stopped self sabotaging and incompetence

1134
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:25,960
and in effort and you started to overdo it. And again, I even just some of the videos I've

1135
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:31,240
watched, I'm like, Oh my God, like I watch it now as an old guy who's only thinking about how to

1136
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:36,200
avoid injury. And I'm like, Oh my God, like all the ways you could have just destroyed your body

1137
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:41,160
with those things. Yeah. We used to do some really just ridiculous, ridiculous training, but

1138
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:46,840
you know, again, you're young, your body's resilient, you're gifted, you're doing what you

1139
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:52,280
love. You're in an arena where that's the only thing that matters. Nothing else exists outside

1140
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:56,520
of this realm of short track speeds, getting it's the most important thing in the world. Nothing

1141
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:02,200
else is here. It was beautiful and I loved it. And so 2002 is the big test. Now you've had four

1142
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:10,920
years to get on the horse. You've won some meets, some important meets, but for most Olympic

1143
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,640
athletes, the world only considers the Olympics. They don't care about winning the worlds, even

1144
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:22,440
though the competition is just as stiff at the worlds. So going into the trials in late Oh one,

1145
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:29,320
were you nervous? What was your confidence level going into make the 2002 team? I wasn't nervous

1146
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:36,440
at all. I was ready and I skated incredibly fast there. I did a time trial. It was like 123.8

1147
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,440
was my time trial time. Wait, wait, that's your 1500. That was my thousand meter time.

1148
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,360
And at the time no one was skating under 125 in the world. So when the world heard that I had

1149
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:52,360
skated this lap time, they knew that I was ready. And you know, the Koreans, the first time they had

1150
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,720
to worry about an American skater who was in their race. It was the first time a Canadian had

1151
01:33:55,720 --> 01:34:01,080
to worry about me was kind of through 1998, 99. So it's interesting. The time trial is kind of a

1152
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:06,280
nice normalizing metric because it strips out the technique, the strategy, the where this person is.

1153
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,800
So just because you have the fastest time trial doesn't at all mean you could win. You may still

1154
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:15,800
get, you may have a dumb race. You may not be able to maneuver and sort of physically get in and

1155
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:20,520
around other skaters, but it's certainly a beautiful metric. It's a bromberg. Yeah. Yeah.

1156
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:25,320
It's sort of like in cycling. It's your FTP, your functional threshold power. And it shows like,

1157
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:30,520
oh, this guy is in incredible shape. By the way, what is your lactate at the end of a thousand

1158
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:35,080
meter time trial? How high would your lactate get? I don't even remember. My lactate was low.

1159
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:40,600
You're like Lance Armstrong in that regard where Lance is lactate after the typical set that they

1160
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:45,640
would do, which would be a one kilometer uphill sprint. And they would do lactate checks at the

1161
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:49,640
end of these. I mean, his lactate levels were just half of everybody else's. Yeah. I was very,

1162
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,080
I was low. So a lot of the sprinters had super high lactate levels. Like they were like in the

1163
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:57,640
twenties or something crazy. And I was like always like nine or something weird. I forget

1164
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:02,840
the actual numbers, but we would do six by 1000 meters with what rest. I want to say the rest

1165
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:07,720
was two minutes. So it's two minute rest or on an interval that gave you about two minute rest from

1166
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:13,560
however you go to nine laps again fast. Jesus. Yeah. We hated doing lactate testing, but that was,

1167
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:17,080
oh, so they would prick you each time. Each time. Yeah. So that generates your lactate

1168
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:21,320
performance curve. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And mine was pretty steady. Like I would maintain like my

1169
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:27,880
lap time and also my speed was around the same, even in the set four or five, six. Wow. In speed

1170
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:32,360
skating, a lot of it's got to do with technique. So yeah. Although it's so funny. Like I don't

1171
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,400
know what they're doing these days in sports science cause I don't really pay much attention,

1172
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:40,120
but I wonder if they're doing muscle biopsies on people and looking at lactate clearance and stuff

1173
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:45,880
like that. No, no, no. No one's offering up a little vastus lateralis biopsy. I, and maybe

1174
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:53,000
they are in cycling, but I can tell you from just listening to your podcast, 99.999% of all

1175
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,840
athletes in the US who are Olympic level have no idea what they're doing when it comes to nutrition,

1176
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:03,240
when it comes to training, they're just doing what kind of they're told. And I say that with

1177
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:08,040
all due respect, right? But that's just all that much more impressive that they can do so much.

1178
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:13,880
It's changing slowly. But since I retired in 2010 and being so obsessed with like looking back on

1179
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:19,320
my career and wanting how different I would have done it now versus then and just understanding how

1180
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:24,440
the human body works and all the different efficiencies or deficiencies or over-training

1181
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:29,160
and recovery. And there was so much, I think specifically for short track speed skating,

1182
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,920
because we were so predominantly dominated by the Korean culture and skating. They never used

1183
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:40,040
sports science. They did everything by eye. Very old school, right? They were just technically the

1184
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:46,760
most proficient to the most beautiful. Biomechanics were, and if you did study their training and you

1185
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,880
did study the way that they skated, it all made sense. But they, again, they didn't, you didn't

1186
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:58,040
have a sport science team there measuring lactate. When I went to my first Olympic games in 2002,

1187
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:03,080
like the rumor to the Korean team was that I had like some unknown military NASA grade technology

1188
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,760
that I was using because I couldn't figure it out. Right? Cause I didn't skate that nice.

1189
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:12,920
Was O2 Salt Lake City? Salt Lake City. Okay. Yeah. Post 9-11, it was incredible experience.

1190
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:18,760
It was incredible being 19 years old. Your first medal, was it a gold or a silver? My first medal

1191
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:22,760
was a silver. Was it the thousand? It was a thousand meters. Oh my God. Which is, that's the

1192
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:28,360
funniest race of them all. I didn't know that was your first medal race. That was my first Olympic

1193
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:35,720
final. Can we talk about like how funny the race isn't funny, but the video we're going to link to

1194
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:41,480
is exceptional. Right? It's perfect. It's actually perfect. I'm so happy that I can laugh about it now.

1195
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,840
I feel like so honored that I could have shown you that video because you hadn't seen that video

1196
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:54,520
until I showed it to you. No, but it's so perfect and so many levels. You know, it's like watching

1197
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:00,120
your face, watch it for the first time. I can't believe I couldn't have had that on film. Like

1198
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:05,960
there was just genuine, like joy. Like you couldn't stop laughing at that, which is, I'm

1199
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:09,640
sure that would have not been that funny at the time. So let's tell people about that race, right?

1200
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:14,840
So you're pretty favored going into this race. It's you. There's a Chinese skater. Yeah. To give

1201
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,480
you context, I was in the cover of Sports Illustrated and I think that the article was

1202
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:24,520
about, this was February of the games. It's pretty amazing to put a speed skater on the cover of

1203
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:29,320
Sports Illustrated. It was ridiculous. And you know, I was sponsored by Nike and I was going to

1204
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:34,760
these games and they said, like, Apollo has the chance to win four medals, four goals going into

1205
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:38,040
these games. And everyone in short track speed games, like that's not going to happen. No one's

1206
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:42,200
that dominant. Our sports do volatile and variable. It's just impossible. Yeah. Which is true, right?

1207
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:47,080
I mean, this is a much harder, not to take anything away from long track, but in long track,

1208
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:52,520
you only have to worry about yourself. Right. It's you against a clock. As you said, in short track,

1209
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:56,040
anything can go wrong. Yeah. Almost without exception, it seems to go wrong. It always

1210
01:38:56,040 --> 01:39:00,840
goes wrong. Yeah. Whatever plan you had never goes exactly. My favorite Mike Tyson line, right?

1211
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,600
And I don't know if Tyson actually said it, but it's like everybody has a plan until they get

1212
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:09,240
punched in the face. It's exactly what happens to everyone's technique is beautiful until you start

1213
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:14,040
to get tired. Yeah. Or until some guy jumps right in front of you and like grabs you or pushes you

1214
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:19,160
or you get bumped or someone time trials it from the start. Now your whole plan from the beginning

1215
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:23,160
is completely out the door because you're not prepared for that. So here we are a thousand

1216
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:29,000
meters. I'm in the final. I've got one of the best Canadian skaters, Matt, you took out. I've

1217
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:35,160
got a Chinese legend, Lee Jia Jun. I've got this young kid on hand, Sue, who's 16 years old. He

1218
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:39,240
looks like Harry Potter with glasses. Literally that's our nickname for him as Harry Potter who

1219
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:44,200
skates. So technically beautiful that I'll get back to that later before talking about it. And

1220
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:49,480
then we've got Steven Bradbury, the Australian, the Australian. And by the way, let's tell us after.

1221
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:53,720
So the race begins. I have my strategy. Bradbury had called you before, right?

1222
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:59,480
Didn't Bradbury have some connection to the company two days before the semi-final? And he says,

1223
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:04,440
Hey man, Hey mate, that's a time. Steven Bradbury was working for the skate manufacturer that made

1224
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:09,080
my skates in, I think they were in, in Brisbane. He says like, Hey, I know you're probably going to

1225
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:14,360
get on the podium. Would you mind giving a shout out for the boot company, RBC revolutionary boot

1226
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:17,880
company? I'm like, Oh, Steven, no problem buddy. You know the problem. Hey, it's good to see you.

1227
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,560
And he was like, Oh, so he's like the typical Australian is I loved him.

1228
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,320
I never thought this guy would make it past the preliminary round. I didn't know, actually,

1229
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:30,040
I didn't even think about it. I didn't know he was skating the Olympics. Like that's how much non,

1230
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:34,680
like he wasn't even there in my mind. He was just another person who happened to be on the ice.

1231
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:38,920
Like he could have been replacing the blocks on the ice, right? He wasn't even a competitor.

1232
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,920
Yeah. You're thinking, wait, why are you wearing spandex just to replace the blocks? Like you,

1233
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,480
you could do that in much looser fitting clothing. Yeah. I mean, I say that like jokingly and then

1234
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:52,280
the day of the races, he, like this miraculous thing happens where two people get disqualified

1235
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:56,520
and fall down. He makes it into semi-final and then he makes it into the final. Like he doesn't

1236
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:00,920
make it. He makes it because people fall down and get disqualified. And now he is like sitting here

1237
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:06,760
in this, in this final with like any, by the way, the Canadian, the Chinese, the Korean and me,

1238
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,600
anyone I want to be can win gold, anyone I'm just going to win gold. I feel very, very confident in

1239
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:15,960
my ability to win gold. And I had a very specific strategy two and a half laps ago. I start my,

1240
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:21,000
my outside pass. I blast off one lap to go. I noticed that the Chinese skater is starting to

1241
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,000
set up a pass or at least put himself in position to pass me. I didn't want that to have happened.

1242
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,680
So I started skating very defensively and protecting my outside and inside position,

1243
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:34,760
thus slowing us down. We fight the Chinese skater falls down about a half lap to go.

1244
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:40,040
I swing a little bit wide. The Korean skater tries to go on the inside of me. He falls down

1245
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:45,400
into me. I fall down and we all take out the last guy who's Matt, you took hot. Who's in third place.

1246
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:51,320
The Canadian, the Canadian, the Chinese goes down. The Korean takes me. And then we all take

1247
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:56,760
out the Canadian. So everyone falls down the same corner, which to this day has never happened.

1248
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,680
The last corner, the last corner, I can see the finish line. I'm in first place by the way. So

1249
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:05,000
I feel like I'm going to win. And I remember thinking in my head, I'm going to win. I remember

1250
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,800
thinking that. And then literally, as soon as I snap my fingers, it was like the karmic reaction.

1251
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,760
You're spinning out of, like you're down and spinning. I'm spinning. I hit the wall. I don't

1252
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:20,520
know what happens. I later find out that like my right skate through my back, hitting the boards,

1253
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:25,880
my right skate comes inward and actually stabs my left leg. And that's where I have a small cut

1254
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:30,760
on that left leg. I get up, I throw my skates across the line. And what I didn't know at the

1255
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:36,440
time that Steven Bradbury, who was like over a half a lap behind when we all fell down,

1256
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,920
only takes about eight seconds to get around the track, comes around and he finishes first. And I

1257
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,840
end up finishing second. And the video, which I mean, we're going to link to the video of the race,

1258
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:51,320
because I remember the first thing I thought when I saw that was I was actually impressed

1259
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:58,200
that you had the presence of mind to get up and get across the line because it looked, and I'm not

1260
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:03,480
a skater, so I can't speak to it, but just as an observer, it looked so disorienting when you went

1261
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:09,320
down. It was that I was like, geez, I wouldn't even think to do anything other than just stand up.

1262
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,240
Like I wouldn't, and it's not like it wouldn't take me two seconds to realize to get across the

1263
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:18,200
line, but you didn't have two seconds. It had to be like a brainstem activity. There could be no

1264
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:24,680
cerebral involvement. It had to be pure brainstem of I'm down, I'm spinning, I'm cut, get across the

1265
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:29,240
line. And you did what none of the other skaters were able to do. Like you were the first one in

1266
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:35,400
that whole melee to get across the line, but of course Steven got across first, giving you the

1267
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:41,000
silver medal. Yeah. And I ended up winning the silver and it was a really good shout out for

1268
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,560
the boot company because first and second guy both were wearing the same boot. That's right.

1269
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:51,400
That's right. And Steven, I remember he just kind of goes across the line and raises one on barely.

1270
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:55,400
He's standing straight upright across the line. I believe it. It's the least

1271
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:00,760
blank impressive finish. And Bradbury cannot believe what just happened. And no Australian

1272
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:05,000
was watching the winter Olympics, by the way. So all of a sudden they got to probably send someone

1273
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,640
there from their media team. They're like, Oh my God, you got to get off the surfing track and get

1274
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:15,480
over on the, on the, right. Right. Right. So he, Steven wins. I ended up actually winning silver,

1275
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:21,640
very disoriented, had no idea what just happened and got a cut in the process. And it was the most

1276
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:26,440
important race of my entire Olympic career because at the time, look, I very much wanted to win.

1277
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:33,240
Not only that, it was so important for me. I felt like I should have won. I think that's natural

1278
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:37,240
for me to say that, right? I really felt like I should have won and I felt like Steven should

1279
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:43,160
not have won. I didn't know actually that he won at that time. I couldn't believe what just happened

1280
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:47,560
and I was trying to figure out in my head and process. Meaning after you've crossed the line,

1281
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:52,680
it's still not entirely clear that he's won. Even though you've seen him also skate across the line,

1282
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:58,040
sort of bolt upright, but you haven't figured this out. Yeah. I mean, I knew, I knew that someone

1283
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:02,360
crossed the line and it was probably Steven, but more importantly, I was figuring out like,

1284
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:08,280
what just happened. Right. Is there a rule that says like you can't come from 200 feet behind when

1285
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:12,200
everyone, yeah. Yeah. Like what's going on? It was more like, I was more thinking like that last

1286
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:17,400
half lap, like what happened? And then I noticed it like I got this itchy feeling on my left leg.

1287
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:20,680
So you don't even realize you've cut yourself. I had no idea at the point at that point until

1288
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:24,680
I went into the locker room and took my skin suit off and they had a chance of like, Oh my gosh,

1289
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:29,160
like that was a crazy, crazy race. And I remember coming out and someone asked me, well, Paul,

1290
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:32,600
what does it feel like to lose the gold? That was the first question. It was the first question.

1291
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:37,400
Michael was like, I didn't, I didn't lose the gold. I won. I won the silver, you know, and

1292
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:42,680
that, that answer wasn't entirely me. There was a guy, Brent Hamilow, who was our sports physician

1293
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:46,280
at the time came in the locker room. Cause he had to look at my cup before we went back out there to

1294
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:52,920
go receive our medals. And he was like, Hey man, I know you wanted to win, but that was incredible.

1295
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:59,240
Like you have to be so proud of yourself for having that ability to cross the line. It was

1296
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:03,160
so instinctive, right? I would be an idiot to claim that I had that plan and it was all my

1297
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:08,760
grandmaster idea to do that, but it wasn't. I just, I felt like I had to finish the race.

1298
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:12,120
Dude, it's another boxing analogy, right? And we can't get away from the fact that your name is

1299
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:18,120
Apollo. Okay. And in the second Rocky, when Rocky and Apollo fight, they both go down. This is a very

1300
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:23,800
rare occurrence in boxing that both fighters go down. And if they both can't get up, it's a draw.

1301
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,640
But if one of them can get up and the other guy can't, he's the winner. And obviously everybody

1302
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:32,840
knows how that goes. Rocky amazingly managed to get up while Apollo couldn't. So this time, Apollo

1303
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:40,120
actually got up first. Yep. Got up first, but I finished second. And cause my first Olympic games,

1304
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:43,880
I felt like I had been through a lot psychologically, even though- Did you have to race

1305
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,280
again that night? Two days later. Okay. Oh, this is something I should tell you. Before I went out

1306
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:54,200
there, I had to get stitched up quickly. Guess who my surgeon was? Eric Heiden. Come on. Yes.

1307
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:58,280
Eric Heiden. So Eric Heiden stitches me up and I was looking at him. He's like, Hey man, that was

1308
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:03,880
amazing. That was so incredible. And all I want to tell was like, Eric, I'm just trying to be like

1309
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:08,600
you. I'm just trying to win every distance. Because I still, even though it was pretty

1310
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:12,840
impossible, that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to win all, I wanted to sweep just like Eric Heiden

1311
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:16,600
did. And I feel like I had the ability to, if everything went in my direction and this was the

1312
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:21,800
first blemish, but it was pretty cool to be able to be stitched up by kind of like your idol and

1313
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,200
then have that conversation and then have him say like, Hey, look, your Olympics aren't over yet.

1314
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:32,040
Like you're just getting started. So get back into the game, remain your focus and forget about this

1315
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:37,320
race as much as you can and prepare for the next one. When I went out there, happy as hell, 19 year

1316
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:41,960
old kid from Seattle could have thrown it all away. And here I was competing in my first Olympic

1317
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:49,400
games post 9 11 hearing thousands of Americans screaming USA, chanting my name. I would never

1318
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:55,480
replace that with anything ever in my life. It was so, it was just, it was awesome. I mean,

1319
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:03,080
every, and I felt so proud to be able to win a medal for the US and win a medal for my family

1320
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:06,120
and for my team and for my country. It was, it was awesome.

1321
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:09,560
Mad Fientist How long after the race, did you get to talk to your dad?

1322
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:13,640
Immediately because NBC grabbed him and they wanted him right down by the ice and right away.

1323
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,080
Mad Fientist What was his reaction?

1324
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,040
He was just proud.

1325
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,800
Mad Fientist Was he worried about your leg? I mean,

1326
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,320
what else was going on in his mind?

1327
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,880
He was worried about my leg. He was right by the ring side and he's, my father's looking in.

1328
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:28,680
I see my dad right away. He's just, he's just very proud, you know, and that to me,

1329
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:32,760
it felt very, very good. And I remember standing on the podium, even though not hearing my

1330
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:37,880
own national anthem being played, just feeling amazing and actually thinking back,

1331
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:41,560
if there was any person in that race who I would want to win the gold versus me,

1332
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:45,560
it would probably would have been Stephen Bradbury. And just because that guy, and people don't know

1333
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:50,440
this, he had been through hell, like a skate blade had gone through that guy's leg at one point.

1334
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:55,240
Like he had almost died many times on the ice, like pools and pools of blood. He had come back

1335
01:48:55,240 --> 01:49:00,360
from devastating injuries, broke his back, like weird, crazy stuff. And through it all,

1336
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:06,360
he stuck with the sport and he was the last man standing. He wasn't the best speed skater.

1337
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:11,160
He wasn't the most technically gifted physically. He was a monster, but he wasn't supposed to win

1338
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:15,560
that race. But because he didn't give up, he ended up winning that race when everyone else

1339
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:19,800
was better than him. Everyone else was there and it was, it was pretty remarkable.

1340
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:23,560
So Matt target, who's a swimmer, an Australian swimmer he's been to, I think three Olympics.

1341
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:27,960
He's a good friend of mine. And I actually sent him the video that we're going to also link to

1342
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:31,400
because that's the one that we were talking about earlier, which is the, there's an Australian guy

1343
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:36,760
who does a commentary and voiceover dubs the video. And it's really funny. His point being is like,

1344
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:40,680
if you just stay out of people's way, you can still win. Right? Right. And he met, I think he said to

1345
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:45,720
me that in Australia, there's still an expression around his name. Like you can pull a bribery,

1346
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:49,800
right? Yeah. You win the lottery. Oh, you just pulled a Bradbury. Oh my God. You just jumped

1347
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:53,640
up at a plane, your parachute didn't open. And then somehow someone else grabbed you,

1348
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:59,080
didn't Bradbury like just freak golden horseshoe luck. By the way, Stephen Bradbury retired that

1349
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:04,360
night. Every women gold. He knew him. Yeah. He's like, this is the pinnacle. This is the pinnacle.

1350
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:09,880
I am now on and I am, I have an Australian stamp with my face on it. This doesn't get better than

1351
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:14,920
this for me, Australia's first winter Olympic gold medal. So you had to go on and continue

1352
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:19,000
through these games. So how did the rest of those games go? My next race was the 1500 meters in

1353
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:25,080
which I was battling against my rival at the time, which was two guys, Mark Ganyal from Canada,

1354
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:30,120
and also Kim Dong-sung from South Korea, who was the reigning Olympic champion in that distance.

1355
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:35,080
And Kim Dong-sung had this very specific strategy, which he had been testing on me

1356
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:40,840
throughout the entire year. And that was he was going to lead the race with about seven laps to go

1357
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,760
and just do a negative split. So every lap get a little bit faster, a little bit faster,

1358
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:51,160
escaped very defensively. And I, my strategy was known all over the world that I always waited

1359
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:56,600
until the last two laps. Because your explosiveness, you just basically based on your lactate tolerance

1360
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,120
and your explosiveness, you're going to out muscle somebody. I had another gear that other people

1361
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:05,720
didn't have. And I think that the training that we did at that time directly just, you know,

1362
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:11,320
is a massive attribute to exploding when there was a lap or two laps to go, as long as I could have

1363
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:15,560
that reserve. But you needed the lane. You had to be able to technically, you had to have the ice

1364
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:19,640
to do that, right? There's got to be space. And so in short track speed skating, if I'm passing

1365
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:25,400
a skater in front of me and we have some sort of a conflict or collision, I get disqualified. At the

1366
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:30,360
time, that's what the rules were. So you had to pass the other skater who was in front of you

1367
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:36,040
completely cleanly with no contact. That puts a huge onus on the guy passing because he's got to

1368
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:40,840
take a huge distance. Well, they changed the rules after this, after this Olympics, but at the time,

1369
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:46,360
that's what the rules were. And so it was very important to pass completely cleanly with no

1370
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:52,360
contact and any capacity. And I remember everyone knew that my inside passing lane was the best in

1371
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:56,840
the world. How many kilometers an hour are you guys going about 40? We're going like around 35

1372
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:01,720
plus miles an hour. Yeah. So you're going about 50 kilometers an hour. Yeah. There is at that speed,

1373
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:07,480
aerodynamics is everything. Like there's an enormous draft advantage if you can slingshot

1374
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:12,520
around someone. And I could skate behind someone all day long and break world records because I

1375
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:16,920
was so comfortable. Anyway, it could, but I wasn't very good at leading for whatever reason. My

1376
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:21,080
technical ability would change and my track pattern would change. Which is so interesting,

1377
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:25,720
given that you still broke, you still have that time trial world record, like going under 125,

1378
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:29,480
because there's no one blocking the wind for you there. Right. But later on in my career,

1379
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:33,480
that became less and less of a big attribute of mine. So I was less and less a good time

1380
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:38,520
trialer, more and more of a good racer, so to speak, about a lap and a half to go in the

1381
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:45,720
1500 meters. I'm in, I'm actually in fifth place. I pass three skaters on the inside to pass into

1382
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:51,720
second place. Now there's a lap remaining. It's me and Kim Dong song. I know that there's only one,

1383
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:55,800
I'm actually doing this prior lap too late. I probably should have done this earlier, but I

1384
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:02,280
didn't wait a little bit too long looking back. And I tried one, one last pass on him on the inside.

1385
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:06,280
I recognize right away that he had known that I was going to be passing on the inside. So he

1386
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:11,400
protected that inside lane position. And he really, really came over to protect that position as much

1387
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:16,680
as possible. And I wanted to make sure there was no contact in the capacity. So I put my arms up to

1388
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:20,840
show the referee who was in the corner. Look, there's no contact. I'm not pushing him. There's

1389
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:26,120
nothing going on. And I slipped back in a second, finished the race. He ends up getting disqualified,

1390
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:31,480
even though he finishes the race and wins. He had been parading around his South Korean flag and

1391
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:36,280
celebrating in victory. My coaches knew that there was going to be a call being made. And why

1392
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:40,840
was he disqualified? So he, at the time there was something called cross tracking. So even though

1393
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:45,080
you're not, you're supposed to, if you come out of the corner and you're supposed to maintain your,

1394
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:49,480
maintain your lane effectively, your lane, right? So if you, if you come out of the corner and

1395
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:53,720
there's technically an inside lane, you can't immediately cut it off. Right. It's like blocking.

1396
01:53:53,720 --> 01:54:00,680
And so he was disqualified. I was a word of the gold and thus began this crazy relationship with

1397
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:05,480
the country of South Korea that I would have never been able to do to explain. And so.

1398
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:09,000
So you get a silver when you should have had a gold, you get a gold that you feel,

1399
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:13,560
is this really a silver? Yeah, it wasn't a clean win. Right? That's very clear,

1400
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:19,800
but I was awarded it. And at the end of the day, a win is a win. And so I celebrated as such.

1401
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,520
So this time you get to hear your national anthem for the first time.

1402
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:27,080
I hear my national anthem for the first time. It's incredible. It's everything you can think it.

1403
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:31,640
We sit there. I remember watching that on TV. I remember where I was watching that on TV.

1404
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:37,480
And it's like, I don't know you it's, but it's still emotional for us to watch this, right?

1405
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:42,680
And to sort of, I think we put ourselves in the shoes of like these kids, right? And we think like,

1406
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:48,840
wow, I can't imagine the sacrifice they just went through. The difference between winning and losing

1407
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:55,800
seems to be almost random, stochastic, if you will. Right. But you did it. Wow. I can't believe

1408
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:00,360
that you're standing there. And I mean, I think that's why we just love the Olympics, even sports

1409
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:05,320
that we don't necessarily pay attention to outside of the Olympics, right? I think that the fascination

1410
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:10,040
is like, we know these athletes aren't doing it for money because there is no money in the Olympic

1411
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:15,720
space, you know, with the exception of like the 0.001%. And you know how much they dedicate. You

1412
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:20,040
know that four and eight and 12 years of their life is dedicated towards this one moment. And

1413
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:24,360
there's a sense of purity associated with that, that they really truly do it because they love

1414
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:28,680
the sport. They want to go to the Olympic games and they want to be the best against the world's

1415
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:33,800
best. And I think we can appreciate that. Now you won two more medals in 02, didn't you? No, I won.

1416
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:38,680
I just won those two medals. You did. Okay. So you didn't win on the relay that year? No. One of the

1417
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:44,200
guys fell in the relay. I feel like we would have won gold actually, heading out fallen. Which has

1418
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:47,640
got to be tough. I mean, you always feel bad. I don't, I follow swimming much more closely,

1419
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:52,200
obviously in any other sport, but it's always just the saddest thing for me when I see a guy

1420
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,760
on the swim, you know, on the four by whatever this thing is. And when that one person has a

1421
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:02,680
bad leg, you just, you feel worse for them than you feel for the other swimmers who swam their

1422
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:07,560
best. Cause like, it's just hard. And I always sort of think it's beautiful when people console

1423
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,680
the one guy who has the bad race or the one girl who has the bad race. Yeah. In short track speed

1424
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:17,400
skating, it's such a variable. We grow up with that mentality. We call that short track. That's

1425
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,840
your equivalent of shit happens, right? It's that short track. That's short track. Like, look,

1426
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:25,160
man, like you plan everything. You are the best. You've been undefeated for years. You get the

1427
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:31,400
Olympic game. Boom. You fall down. Shit. That's short track. Like that's the sport that you signed

1428
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:35,880
up for. And if you can't subscribe to that mentality, you chose the wrong sport. But short

1429
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:40,600
track to me is very much like life, very much like life, right? You can do everything right.

1430
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:45,640
And for whatever reason, something out of your control gets thrown in your way and you have to

1431
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:50,680
take it as such and learn from it obviously and come back stronger and better. But for the

1432
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:57,640
most part, I think that's what it is. But you became one of the really few athletes that rose

1433
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:01,960
above the sport, at least from a commercial standpoint. I mean, there are obviously a handful

1434
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:05,640
of Olympic athletes that we can all name that end up on the, were you on the cover of a Wheaties box?

1435
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:09,560
I was on the cover of a Wheaties box. That's like about as American as it gets. It might not be

1436
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:12,600
necessarily the most lucrative commercial opportunity, but it is certainly the most

1437
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:18,760
distinguished, right? I mean, to be on the Wheaties box is sort of. It's always a dream. Yeah. So I'm

1438
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:23,080
not going to ask you to sort of explain why you think you rose to that level. How much of it do

1439
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:28,680
you think had to do with just what you did on the ice versus something about you that sort of

1440
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:32,920
captivated people's interests that goes beyond just the performance? Like, you know, obviously

1441
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:38,120
you're a good looking guy, you're articulate. Your story is incredibly interesting as evidenced by the

1442
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:42,440
fact that we could sit here and talk about this for like six days. And you also seem very comfortable

1443
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:47,240
in that role too. Like it wasn't, you get the sense some athletes are really uncomfortable

1444
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:51,320
with that. They're appreciative of it. And it's this great opportunity to sort of remunerate

1445
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:56,040
some of their success. But you seem like totally natural in that role, right?

1446
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:01,480
I think, yeah, I mean, I, look, I was extremely blessed to be able to be one of the few athletes

1447
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:09,640
that both NBC chose and wanted to feature as a star athlete. And my story for whatever reason,

1448
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:15,320
and I think, look, immigrant father comes to the U S doesn't have anything, tries to raise this

1449
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:21,720
kid. This kid is bad, finds his life through sport, turns it around, understands the power

1450
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:28,600
that he has throughout the sport. And then against all odds, I was able to deliver in some capacity

1451
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:33,400
and I didn't deliver a gold net first race. It was a silver. Well, it was a scrappy silver. I mean,

1452
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:39,160
I think that's in some ways, I think people much prefer, like if you had gone out, you know, I

1453
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:43,320
don't know what the expression is in speed skating, but if you'd gone wire to wire, right? If you'd

1454
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:48,520
time trialed that event and won by five lengths or, you know, by five, you know, body lengths or

1455
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:55,720
whatever, it's like, okay, wow, he's dominant, but to fall, cut your leg, you know, barely know which

1456
01:58:55,720 --> 01:59:00,520
way is up and down and manage to really take the group of four that you're racing against and be

1457
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:04,680
the first one across the line. That's a, that's a heartfelt silver that I think most people

1458
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:09,800
probably find more appealing and actually probably creates a better substrate for the

1459
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:14,360
way we like to use sport as metaphor for life. I think that's exactly, I couldn't have articulated

1460
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:19,720
it better. I mean, I think that we, you know, Americans, look, we love dominance. We love to

1461
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:25,720
win, but we also like to see a story that, that somewhat mirrors what we can relate to. And it

1462
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:32,040
wasn't perfect in any way. But I think at the end I was, I also didn't want to cross the line. And

1463
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:35,160
even though I was upset, I didn't win gold. I didn't want to show that. I didn't want to be like,

1464
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:38,840
hey, I should have won gold. That guy, that Australian guy shouldn't have been in the final.

1465
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:45,160
He's not a good skater. That I didn't want to have or be near that type of a mentality. Instead,

1466
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:50,360
I had an opportunity, I think, to be really, really appreciative and have gratitude for the chance to

1467
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:54,360
even be there. Number one, even though I was supposed to win the race, but take it from that

1468
01:59:54,360 --> 02:00:00,920
perspective and then just like I won my first Olympic medal, you know, like that that's the,

1469
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:06,360
this is how the race played out. Not to plan, not exactly how I would have written it, but this is

1470
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:11,880
how it went. And I've been through a lot personally to get to that point. And I really,

1471
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:17,320
really wanted people to see that I was proud to win that silver. I was proud to win a bronze.

1472
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:21,800
I was proud to be there and compete. That was really important for me to people to recognize

1473
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:26,680
and see that I didn't take it lightly. I didn't take it for granted. Like I'd done in the past

1474
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:33,560
and it was something that I was humbled by. And I mean, I got to the start line in that race and

1475
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:39,720
people were chanting my name like in the arena. I mean, I'm 19 years old. That, that is not normal

1476
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:43,960
of any stretch of the imagination. I got to imagine that's different even from the world's

1477
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:48,120
like that's a totally different experience. Right. It feels so different as an hour camera

1478
02:00:48,120 --> 02:00:53,720
in my face every second, every inch that I move around and there's immense pressure. I hear people

1479
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:59,480
in the audience who I don't know, Apollo, bring home the gold, you know, like, and I can feel like

1480
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:05,800
the actual genuine authenticity that exists within saying bring home that like people really,

1481
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:09,720
really wanted me to win. Well, yeah. And you've alluded to it already, but this was only what,

1482
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:15,480
four months after 9 11, this was still a very unified country in a way that I don't know that

1483
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:20,440
we've experienced since. I'm walking in the opening ceremonies in Salt Lake city from

1484
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:24,840
our staging area to inside of the time, it was called the Delta center. That's where the,

1485
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:29,960
the opening ceremonies were. And I remember seeing on all of the rooftops and in the trees,

1486
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:36,520
all of the American servicemen snipers, they're sitting there and I remember looking up and

1487
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:39,640
seeing them and then they, they, because they know it's us, right? Cause they've got their,

1488
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:44,200
their binautros on the goggles and they wave. And I'm like, this is much bigger than me.

1489
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:48,760
My representation of what I do, my silly sport of short track, speed skating,

1490
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:55,320
my insignificance of going in circles in this world. And I'm 19, so I can't really understand

1491
02:01:55,320 --> 02:02:02,520
it to that degree, but the feeling is there that what I do here is far more important than the

1492
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:08,520
results that I give. Obviously I want to win. I want to bring home the color gold because that

1493
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:14,040
is what we signify with being successful. But at the end of the day, I wanted the representation

1494
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:20,040
of who I was on the ice at that period of time to reflect, I think what we would be proud of.

1495
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:24,040
And that would make my father proud. And I knew if I had that happened that I could be proud that

1496
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:28,360
our country would be proud aside from all the other conflict and things that we disagree with.

1497
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:32,520
That was a really important part, right? Of, of what I was doing. And it's a tremendous amount

1498
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:35,960
of pressure too that you don't recognize. No one can prepare you for the Olympic games.

1499
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:41,240
I used to do visualization and hear and have previous tapes recorded and then like try to

1500
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:45,080
visualize and close my eyes and visualize a race that I wanted to have happen while the crowd is

1501
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:49,320
in my ears. But when I went out there for my first race, I couldn't, nothing could have prepared me

1502
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:54,600
for that. My heart rate jumped from like whatever being like 50 to like 160, like literally within

1503
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:59,880
seconds. And I was like, Oh my God, like I'm, I'm starting this nine lap race now at threshold

1504
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:04,600
versus this is not supposed to work. You know, like I'm not prepared for those six by 1000s are

1505
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:09,880
paying off now. Yeah. That's also a very addictive feeling. So what's the letdown like after the two

1506
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:16,040
weeks after the games are over? Yeah. Well, depends on how you do. So you've done well. You've

1507
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:21,400
obviously got a great commercial career ahead of you, but you still have four years until you're

1508
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:26,120
going to be back on that stage again. You'll go to the worlds again. You'll do world cup, but you're

1509
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:30,280
not going to feel that electricity for four more years, right? Correct. And nothing replaces the

1510
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:35,160
Olympic games. There's no competition on the planet. So post games, you, I go on the media whirlwind

1511
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:39,960
tour for basically six to eight months. I do every single interview and conversation and

1512
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:43,640
sponsorships and commercial advertising stuff, because that's the only way you as an Olympic

1513
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:47,800
athlete can generate any source of revenue. You're not really paid to win gold medals. You're not

1514
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:53,240
paid to be a part of the team. You're there. And so what percentage of Olympians, United States

1515
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:59,960
Olympians can secure enough sponsorship that that can become a sole source of income to sustain

1516
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:06,040
them through another Olympic run. I E they do not need to go out and get another job. Maybe

1517
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:10,360
less than a percent. Wow. For sure. Less than a percent, because even if you win a gold, it

1518
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:15,720
doesn't necessarily guarantee you to have a good generating of income. If for whatever reason you

1519
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:20,840
weren't featured or NBC didn't see you or sponsorships aren't interested, you just, you're a guy with

1520
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:26,200
a gold medal. And I know a few who won gold, who have the most normal jobs that we normally would

1521
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:30,120
see like, wow, that guy won gold. And why is he working here doing this like day to day activity,

1522
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:35,880
like this manual labor? But that's just the reality of what happened. So I was blessed. I didn't have

1523
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:40,760
to do that. I got great sponsor opportunities and I took the sport of short track speed skating,

1524
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:44,920
which was relatively completely unknown to most Americans. And the first time they ever saw it

1525
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:49,240
was that thousand meters in which I fell down and people were like, Oh my God, this is the craziest

1526
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:53,800
sport I've ever seen in my life. And it was like, it's like roller derby. Yeah. That's what people

1527
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:59,880
say. NASCAR on ice, we call it. Right. And it's crazy. It's fun. It's fast, it's explosive. There's

1528
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:04,920
strategy. It's unpredictable. There's crashes. It's aggressive. The only thing, you know,

1529
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:08,440
if they just allowed you to punch each other, it would be like the next American like checkbox.

1530
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:14,280
They should be able to carry knives too. You should at least be able to like, you know,

1531
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:17,800
clothesline somebody, right? Yeah. That would be, we get some different looking

1532
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:21,720
athletes on the ice. That's for sure. There's so many other things I want to talk about. And I

1533
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:26,040
realize like we're getting looks out there because they want us to go out for dinner. So let's

1534
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:31,880
talk about oh six and 10. So, you know, one of the things you've told me before that I was

1535
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:39,080
blown away by was the difference in your body weight between 2002, 2006 and 2010.

1536
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:46,120
Most athletes who go from being 19 to 23 to 27 are putting on more muscle are getting bigger and

1537
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:51,960
bigger. Right. You're maintaining muscle and getting leaner and leaner and leaner. Remind me

1538
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:57,800
again the difference between your fighting weight in those three Olympics. Sure. So in 2002,

1539
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:06,280
the training focus was power, ballistic, strength, and speed. Those are the important factors in that

1540
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:11,160
time period. Do you remember how many watts you could generate for a minute on a bike on an erg?

1541
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:15,640
I don't remember. I have to ask Dr. Randy Wilbur, who's I think he's still at the Olympic training

1542
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:20,600
center in Colorado Springs, head of sports. You got to get all that data and send it to me. I

1543
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:25,800
want so badly to see your LPCs and your wattages and stuff like that. I bet it was just sick.

1544
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:30,040
It was good. I don't know if it was like astronomically high. Like I've hear these

1545
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:34,520
other stories of other athletes who were short track speed skaters to be just freak in every

1546
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:40,360
genetic response, but my ability was to recover really quickly. That was the one component. I

1547
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:44,840
remember doing a test in, I remember doing all these different sports science tests. I remember

1548
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:50,360
these doctors basically saying like, you need to live at altitude. Your body responds extremely

1549
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:55,960
well the higher you go. For whatever reason, your body just produces a ridiculous amount of red blood

1550
02:06:55,960 --> 02:07:03,080
cells. You come down and you love it. So in your ability to recover high or low is different.

1551
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:08,600
Yeah. The first time I trained at altitude, I got to go and swim in Colorado. I was like,

1552
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:15,080
like I'm not swimming. I'm not doing the same stroke. Nothing feels the same up here. I

1553
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:20,360
couldn't believe it. Yeah. I think Colorado is like 6,400 feet. I think you're at the elevation.

1554
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:27,400
Back then we lived high and we slept high. Right. Because I think today isn't the conventional

1555
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:31,480
wisdom. You want to live high, train low. Doesn't that produce the best outcome? Correct. That's

1556
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:36,600
correct. So you're better off actually having a tent and training at sea level. Yeah. Then there's

1557
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:41,560
some arguments against the entire tent related. What type of stress that places on the human body

1558
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:46,840
and is it natural form of stress? Did you get the proper response? There's some arguments back and

1559
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:52,120
forth that Dr. Renny Wilbur was like, no, I think the actual natural environment far exceeds. I'm

1560
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:56,520
sure it does. Something that he tried to explain to me, obviously I didn't understand. So in 2002,

1561
02:07:56,520 --> 02:08:04,120
you're weighing what? So 2002, I weighed approximately 164 to 167. So call it 165. That

1562
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:11,800
was my fighting weight and I could like press around 1400, 1450, 1500 pounds. I'm just giving

1563
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:16,920
you just context. So a small car. My back squat was never really that high. I think a lot of it

1564
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:21,080
had to do with just the way that I hinged. I was very good hunched over in that position. I could

1565
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:24,200
generate a lot of power when my back was rounded. Which you don't want to be squatting in that

1566
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:27,800
position. Yeah. It's complete opposite. But you were still probably what squatting? I think you

1567
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:33,320
said you were probably in the mid 300s for 12 reps. Yeah. About 350, 365, 275. Which is still

1568
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:39,560
pretty, that's probably a max of 500 at a body weight of 160 is no slouch. Yeah. I mean,

1569
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:45,880
my vertical was really high. Almost like 36. Jesus. Do you know what your single leg vertical was?

1570
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:52,280
No, I don't remember that. Again, this is all stuff that I wish that we had. Because we trained

1571
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:57,960
so hard. I'm convinced by the way, the single leg vertical is probably the best predictor of speed.

1572
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:02,920
Yeah, I think so. And your ability to generate force into the ground. I like to see the difference

1573
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:08,840
between doing a single jump and doing a series of two or three. And seeing that reaction time

1574
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:14,520
and generating a power over all these cool tools and ideas that I wish we had implemented. We

1575
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:18,440
probably had the ability. We just didn't implement them properly back then. So in the 06, what did

1576
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:23,640
you weigh? 06, I weighed about 155 pounds, but I could still lay press the same amount of weight.

1577
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:29,720
So I was significantly leaner in 06, significantly leaner. So long gone is the chubby boy. Yeah,

1578
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:33,720
gone. We have new coaches. I now have a Chinese coach going to those games.

1579
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:38,040
These were in Italy this year, wasn't it? Yes, Torino, Italy. And I performed very well in those

1580
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:42,680
games. I ended up winning a gold in the 500 meters. I won wire to wire, controlled the race,

1581
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:47,160
did very well. Wasn't the best skater out there for sure. But strategically, it was my day. Did

1582
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:51,400
you also get a relay medal that year? Yes, we did. We got a bronze. And then what did you weigh in

1583
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:58,280
2010? And in 2010, my goal was to be under 150. And I hadn't been under 150 since I was 14 years

1584
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:04,680
old. When I was 14, I was 135, 137. And then I ballooned back up, obviously. So my goal was

1585
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:12,040
to be under 150. I ended up competing between 142 and 146. Jesus. So I would say on average,

1586
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:17,080
it's about 143, 145 pounds. How much strength did you give up to get there? It was weird because

1587
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:21,800
I could leg press the same amount of weight. I could leg press nearly 2000 pounds at that

1588
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:27,720
weight, like 1900, something like that. The difference was my pure ballistic power

1589
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:32,040
was drastically different. I stopped doing all Olympic lifts. So were you doing a lot of

1590
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:38,280
plyometrics? A lot of weighted plyometrics. But again, I cut most of that weight that year,

1591
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:42,440
like that Olympic season. So you can imagine like the first half of the year was spent just

1592
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:47,400
cutting this weight. So essentially living in a catabolic environment all the time to eat excess

1593
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:53,560
muscle mass from your upper body, traps, arms, you know, I mean, I had no, I see that picture.

1594
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:59,080
My arms were so skinny back then. It was very similar to what you'd see in someone who's climbing

1595
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:05,960
in a toilet. I remember Lance saying that during the tour years, he wouldn't do one pushup or swim

1596
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:12,600
one lap in the spring and going into it because it's like you had to be able to waste as much

1597
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:18,040
muscle as possible from the upper body. You want complete atrophy from the hips up. And there's

1598
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:21,720
a crazy stories that we hear that like these cyclists would like basically put themselves in

1599
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:26,840
a sling in the summers during their training. Right. Cause it lose also. And the reason why

1600
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:30,120
and people are like, why would you want that body to say those people that ask that question

1601
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:35,640
have never ridden a bike up a hill. That's how long it's every bound counts. Yeah, it is. I mean,

1602
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:40,200
cycling in many ways is such a beautiful sport because there are a few sports that can be reduced

1603
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:46,360
to such formulaic outcomes. And when you can take functional threshold power divided by mass in

1604
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:51,000
kilos and get a number in Watts per kilo that essentially predicts who's going to win the race

1605
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:56,920
up a hill. That's pretty amazing. And speed skating, it's harder because one, I don't know

1606
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:03,960
what the metric is of power, but two absolute power to translate to a bike is much easier.

1607
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:09,400
Like you're transmitting from the leg to the pedal, to the crank, to the wheel, but in skating,

1608
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:14,360
there's more to it, right? It's not entirely clear what the relationship is between the 2000

1609
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:20,440
pounds that you can leg press versus how many of those pounds in Watts are hitting the ice, right?

1610
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:24,920
There probably is not a correlation. Or it's probably loose correlation, but everyone's

1611
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:27,560
different because if you can't put the power. If you don't have the technique, it's irrelevant.

1612
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:33,160
Yeah. So like a bike, the technique is pretty simple. It's a push and pull at the basic level,

1613
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:37,960
right? But in speed skating, there's seven parts to one push. Literally, there's seven parts to

1614
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:42,840
one push that you have to drill in your head to make it automatic and normal. And you're never

1615
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:48,360
on just one plane of balance on that piece of blade. You're in the heel, now you're in the middle,

1616
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:52,200
now you're back towards the heel, and then you finish the ball or towards the toe. And it's

1617
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:57,000
different depending on the speed, what you're doing, the track pattern. There's so many elements

1618
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:03,080
that are always changing. For example, the Koreans, they don't lift weights, right? That became my

1619
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:07,080
obsession. This started in 2002. Yeah, because you went to Korea, didn't you? I went to Korea

1620
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:14,040
before 2010. In 2007, because I was so obsessed and fascinated with how they continuously kept

1621
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:18,440
producing incredible athletes that I was competitive against. And they just skated so

1622
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:22,440
beautiful. Now you were at this point, pretty much a god to them and they were gods to you.

1623
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:27,400
Did they welcome you with open arms? They did actually. They invited me, and partially because

1624
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:31,160
I think they just wanted to study me. They just wanted to see like what made me tick,

1625
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:36,440
how strong is my ability to train? Can I handle their type of training atmosphere and environment?

1626
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:41,400
And I was fascinated to go into the belly of the beast. I wanted to go into that lion's den

1627
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:47,240
and understand what makes them tick. And my dad was completely against it, but I was like,

1628
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:50,280
this is something I have to do. And eventually he was like, this is something you have to do.

1629
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,800
Why was your dad against it?

1630
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:57,960
So after the 2002 Olympic games, there was after that race where I was awarded the gold and the

1631
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:04,520
Koreans came up to qualify. There was 16,000 emails sent in the form of death threats to the United

1632
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:09,640
States Olympic committee because of that race to me. It was pretty crazy. So it was, again,

1633
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:14,440
it was a time where my relationship with Korea changed overnight. We ended up not going to

1634
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:17,640
Korea for two years for competitions because we were unsure of the environment.

1635
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:20,440
When you say we, you mean you and your dad or the US team?

1636
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:23,400
No, me and the US team. We none of us went. I mean, my face was on a toilet paper inside

1637
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:27,800
the country. Like I was the second most hated person aside from Osama bin Laden inside that

1638
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:29,640
country. Literally.

1639
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:30,840
Unbelievable.

1640
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:33,880
It was unbelievable. We can talk about this other thing. Like for two hours,

1641
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:38,040
I have a thousand stories in relation to that. And like when I actually decided to go against

1642
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:41,960
everyone's wishes, I was like, I can't just keep running from this problem. I gotta go.

1643
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:45,800
The number one, they haven't heard me tell my story. Like they hate me for reasons that are

1644
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:50,760
unexplainable. And also they're not really that fair because they don't know me. I'm not a

1645
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:56,040
referee. I didn't make the judging call. I am an athlete. I am a, I'm a sportsman. I compete like

1646
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:01,240
anyone else does under the same rules and capacities. And I walk away regardless of outcome.

1647
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:06,760
Right. And it was a changing time. So the Koreans were always number one. I was the only threat at

1648
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:13,960
the time to them and their legacy. And it was a huge, huge part of my fascination with actually

1649
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:17,400
saying, you know what? I gotta go there. Even though they're going to study me, I have to go

1650
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:22,200
and understand it's like someone going to train with Usain Bolt in Jamaica for like three months

1651
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:27,320
and seeing what is he doing? Is he doing some exercise? What are they eating? Where is their

1652
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:31,880
sleeping habits? What is their recovery? How did they get massage? Right? What kind of all these

1653
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:36,680
elements. And you already knew that they weren't doing the type of off ice work that you

1654
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:42,200
were. What surprised you the most about what they did on ice? The two things that I recognize right

1655
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:47,240
away was their efficiency in training. There was no talking when you're on the ice. There was all

1656
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:51,000
business. When you shut up at the ice rink at four in the morning, four 30 in the morning, there was

1657
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,880
already probably 30 skaters there who are eight to 12 years old who had been practicing technical

1658
02:15:55,880 --> 02:16:01,080
drills before you even got there. So their commitment to perfection in terms of technique

1659
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:06,280
is drilled in at a very young age. So their efficiency ratio, they don't have to be as strong

1660
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:10,200
as me in the weight room because they're so much more efficient. That's what it came down to.

1661
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:14,440
This by the way, has another beautiful parallel to swimming, right? I mean, unlike cycling,

1662
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:21,000
in swimming, the relationship between the power you can actually generate and how you can transmit

1663
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:26,840
it to the water is elusive. And I don't know if the guy who wins the race is necessarily the

1664
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:32,840
strongest on land. It really doesn't matter. It's so much more about avoiding drag and efficiently

1665
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:37,480
putting your muscle into the go. So in that sense, it's much more like skating where

1666
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:40,520
there are certain swimmers who have some of the most unimpressive physiques. I mean,

1667
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:44,520
Phelps has such an impressive physique to begin with. It's sort of the best of both worlds, but

1668
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:52,040
there are some really ridiculously scrawny looking pathetic swimmers who like biscuit chest dudes

1669
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:58,600
that can't like literally can't do anything. But when they get in the water, they sure as hell can

1670
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:04,360
do something. Sure. It's very much the same way with speed skating. And I saw that. And the first

1671
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:09,720
thing I recognized was their ability to copy each other was unlike anything I'd ever seen. When you

1672
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:14,200
go watch a US short track speed skating practice, everyone skates entirely different. You can pick

1673
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:19,240
out who's who. When you watch a Korean speed skating practice, they all look the same. You

1674
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:23,640
can see a couple of the guys that stand out, but for the most part, and it's beautiful to watch,

1675
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:26,360
they're very quiet. They don't make a lot of noise when they go around the corner,

1676
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:30,280
they're extremely efficient. And I remember the first day that I showed up, we broke like five

1677
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:36,360
world records in that practice. And to the girls who are leading, by the way, in the 3000 meter,

1678
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:41,720
we did five times 3000 meters, five times 27 laps, to the girls I never ended up seeing for the next

1679
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:45,800
couple of years. They never made the team. And they were the ones who were leading this from start

1680
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:51,480
till finish breaking the world records. So they just have a mass talent pool of skaters that they

1681
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:57,960
can just pick and choose from. And just like the old school Eric Haydn era of survival of the

1682
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:02,040
fittest, we're going to pick out the pure genetic monsters who not only technically are the most

1683
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:06,440
efficient, but also can handle the greatest amount of volume and load and training. They're going to

1684
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:12,280
rise to the top. And usually the South Korean skaters only last one or two Olympics at the

1685
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:16,200
absolute most before they're just gone. And they just like literally overnight, they just-

1686
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:17,880
They get replaced by the next cog in the mission.

1687
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:24,840
It became and make the team. So my whole goal for showing up in Vancouver was in 2002,

1688
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:31,160
I was dominant. 2006, I had won a gold, probably could not have replicated that. And in 2007,

1689
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:36,520
I was losing my dominance in the sport significantly and people were skating so fast.

1690
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:41,880
Was that mostly just apparent to you? Because usually the athletes the first to figure that out.

1691
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:45,960
Or was it also visible to those around you? I think people started to notice that I was

1692
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:52,040
no longer this undefeatable, unrecognizable, unknown mystery athlete from the US. Everyone

1693
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:58,280
knew my strategy. Everyone knew my natural gate and rhythm of skating. And it was like do or die.

1694
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:02,200
I wasn't dominant and I wasn't winning. I was winning, but I wasn't winning with the same

1695
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:05,560
fashion I was where people were like, Oh my God, that guy just smashed the pack.

1696
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:10,120
So was there a period then between 07 and 10 when you were even wondering if you would come back?

1697
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,920
It was not wondering if I was going to come back. Cause I'd already committed. It was more,

1698
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:18,040
how do I actually get to the games and have a chance at meddling? That was the conversation.

1699
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:21,800
Like how can I win against this next generation of South Korean athletes that I've never faced

1700
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:28,120
before who are so fast and so good. How old are they? You're, you're now 25, right? 26.

1701
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:31,080
Yeah, they're 18, 19, 20. That was usually the range.

1702
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:35,480
Which is interesting because if you really think about it for a male speed based sport,

1703
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:37,640
you should still be able to peak in your mid twenties.

1704
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:41,240
Yeah. For whatever reason, it was always a young man sport, short track speed skating.

1705
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:46,840
I think a lot of it's got to do with flexibility and the way in which you move. And maybe there's

1706
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:50,920
no correlation in the capacity, but that's just what it was in 2002. A lot of the heavier guys

1707
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:56,280
had to retire before 2006. They couldn't meet the cut. The sport had changed from 2006, 2010,

1708
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:59,720
a whole next generation of guys were tired because again, they couldn't meet the cut.

1709
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:03,720
The way that we trained the focal points, what was important during training,

1710
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:08,360
the elements that made you a fast speed skater are all changed. And we had a big coaching

1711
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:12,280
turnover. So we went from a Chinese coach. I had a originally had a Canadian coach, American

1712
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:18,120
coach to then a Chinese coach to then two Korean coaches who threw everything out the window when

1713
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:22,360
it came to sport science and said, we are going to take you Apollo and change the way that you

1714
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:27,320
technically skate. And physiologically, my goal was to show up as a different type of an athlete

1715
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:30,600
that they would never prepare for. So I want to change my natural gating rhythm.

1716
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:35,000
I can't help but bring the Rocky metaphor back. This is when Rocky comes back to fight club

1717
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:41,000
because he gets killed by club or fighting Rocky style. And then Apollo comes back to train him.

1718
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:45,400
I'm grinning as I say this because I realize it sounds so stupid, but it's really the example.

1719
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:49,560
It's like you can't come back and fight club or the same way. You got to lose like 15 pounds and

1720
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:54,440
you actually have to box instead of slug. Correct. If I want to be competitive, if I took the same

1721
02:20:54,440 --> 02:21:01,000
strategy of success from 2006 and 2010, I won't make the semi-final. That's apparent. And so that

1722
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:06,760
meant I had to make drastic changes by 07. You had three years to change everything.

1723
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:12,520
After I had gone to Korea and skated and recognized and knew what I was really up against and saw this

1724
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:16,120
next generation of South Korean athletes who were training there, that would be the ones that I would

1725
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:20,600
compete against and also recognize also when I stepped on the ice in 2010 and look in the

1726
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:25,160
coaches box and see that I would have skated against 80% of the coaches because they all

1727
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:28,760
retired and became coaches of those national teams who are then coaching their athletes to beat me.

1728
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:32,360
They know me better than anybody. They'd seen me for 15 years at that point, right?

1729
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:32,360


1730
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:37,320
Technically. So the goal was to show up as someone who they couldn't prepare for. Different strategy,

1731
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:42,120
different mentality, different training. And that meant drastic decisions and changes. And so I

1732
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:47,000
hired a strength and conditioning coach who lived with me at my house in Salt Lake City, Utah,

1733
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,720
to watch and monitor every single thing that I ate, every single extra training regimen that we did.

1734
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:56,120
And I was a guy that I was never like, you never had to push me to train more. It was like, okay,

1735
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:59,720
we need to figure out how to rest. Yeah. Like let's, let's figure out how to do some things a

1736
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:05,320
little bit better, better here. And so it became a huge emphasis on recovery, a massive emphasis on

1737
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:11,240
nutrition, which is recovery and just making sure that everything that I was doing was correlating

1738
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:17,000
with my end result, which was being, let's be this light, let's maintain this strength. And I know if

1739
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:21,720
I can at least do those two things, I've got the unique technical ability to at least get myself

1740
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:28,760
to the podium. And it was a struggle because I love to eat. I love food. I'm always hungry. And

1741
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:35,000
at 153, there's not a lot of weight to lose. Like, like, like my skin was very thin around my legs.

1742
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:40,440
Like I had, it was all muscle. So I had to go catabolic. I had to lose excess muscle mass that

1743
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:45,480
wasn't being specifically derived from the sport and perhaps was being generated from the weight

1744
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:49,320
training that we were doing, whether it was deadlifts, whether it was poles, whether, I mean,

1745
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:55,640
there was no more. I mean, in 2019, 1999, we were still doing bench press, right? It's a part of our

1746
02:22:55,640 --> 02:23:00,280
weight training program. That's got, that makes no sense in general. So even those cleans, really,

1747
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:03,720
I mean, you could argue there was obviously an explosive benefit to the cleans, but two and a

1748
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:07,960
half to three pounds there, probably an upper body mass, right? That you just don't necessarily need.

1749
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:12,840
Now the benefit from those is incredible. And looking back, I probably should have incorporated

1750
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:19,080
some specific type of Olympic or deadlift like activity. But I was so hyper focused and obsessed

1751
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:23,400
with losing weight. I remember writing down on these little post-it notes and putting them all

1752
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:29,720
throughout my house, the weight, and then like, Jesus, and then like zero regrets, like make sure

1753
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:34,440
you get to the Olympic games with zero regrets, regardless of your outcome there, you have to

1754
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:39,880
arrive, leaving absolutely no stones unturned in your preparation. You wrote a book by this title

1755
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:46,040
years later. Yeah. And that was just because that was my mentality. And I was doing like dumb

1756
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:50,760
workouts. I had two training sessions with the Olympic team, and then we would do an additional

1757
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:55,720
one or two on top of that every day of the week, with the exception of Saturday and Sunday,

1758
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:59,960
which was pure recovery. Saturday morning, we would skate Saturday afternoon, it was recovery,

1759
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:04,120
Sunday, well, there was recovery. But the rest of the time I was doing these crazy sprints and

1760
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:09,240
intervals on a treadmill that my, my strength and conditioning coach could monitor and watch my gate.

1761
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:14,520
We would try and change the way that I naturally ran. So we increased the, the cadence and I wanted

1762
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:20,920
to be a higher cadence athlete who had very high cadence versus the previous Apollo, which is all

1763
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:26,520
power, slow, and it was very hard. It's nearly impossible to change, but that was the goal point.

1764
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:31,160
Which is interesting to come back to a cycling analogy here, right? Which is today we see

1765
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:35,880
cyclists riding at a much higher cadence and a lower torque to generate comparable power,

1766
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:39,480
shifting the load to the cardiovascular system from the muscular system.

1767
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:44,200
Yep. And all comes down to efficiency, right? Generate the least amount of lactic acid,

1768
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:49,000
and increase the amount of speed and repetitions that you're crossing over in the corner without

1769
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:54,520
the more static you are on one leg, the more strength and lactic acid you essentially are

1770
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:59,080
producing. So if you can decrease the amount of time you are on each leg, the less likelihood

1771
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:05,320
you are to get tired as long as you're naturally able to do that. So I mean, it was a real struggle.

1772
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:11,160
Like I cracked on that treadmill, I cracked in the weight room all of the time. And I questioned

1773
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:16,360
my path on that process. Cause you can imagine, right? I'm a guy here who I have a recipe for

1774
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:21,400
success. I know what works. And now you're going to abandon it. Not only do I abandon it, I go the

1775
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:27,560
complete opposite direction and I change everything and everything that I know about what made me me

1776
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:34,200
in hopes that I would do this gamble and show up to the Olympic games and be the best I've ever been

1777
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:40,520
and complete unpredictable to the other athletes. And it remarkably worked out, but there was a lot

1778
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:45,800
of questioning in my head. And I remember many, many nights I'd lay in bed starving,

1779
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:50,120
so incredibly hungry. Cause I just, I for sure wasn't getting enough calories in my body.

1780
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:56,120
Absolutely. And just like wondering like, is this the right path towards success? Is this going to

1781
02:25:56,120 --> 02:26:00,920
work? Cause the last thing I want to do is get to the games and be like, shit, that was a bad

1782
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:05,240
decision. Right. And that's painful for so many reasons, not the least of which being you have

1783
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:10,840
just spent four years before you got that feedback, right? It's one thing to say, you know,

1784
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:15,400
I'm going to try this new way of washing my car today and see if it produces streaks or no streaks

1785
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:18,600
and then you do it and it produces streaks and you're like, well, okay, that was 30 minutes. I

1786
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:24,440
wasted, but like, this is four years to figure out that the new washing technique streaks the car.

1787
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:29,800
Yeah. And for the first four and a half months, like I, I just wasn't skating very well. I was

1788
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:35,480
tired. I was fatigued all the time. Other athletes on my team were better and skating

1789
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:39,160
faster than I was. I was doing workouts that I probably shouldn't have been doing at that

1790
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:43,880
latent stage. And the chatter is basically he's sticking around for one too many Olympics.

1791
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:49,000
And he's like, lost his mind. Like he's like, what is he doing? Like, look how much weight he's

1792
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,960
losing on like a monthly basis. But again, goes back to that psychological advantage of

1793
02:26:54,680 --> 02:27:00,680
this is what it took. And this is the place that I was in. And to me, having that edge of going to

1794
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:05,160
a place where no one else went to, and also it's very personal, right? Going to a place where you

1795
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:11,560
never knew was possible. It's incredibly powerful. It's you have a sense of inner strength when you

1796
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:15,640
get to those Olympic games and I hadn't raced a single race, but I was smiling before that even

1797
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:21,000
happened. Like I felt so like weightless, not only because I'd lost 20 pounds from over my career,

1798
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:26,120
but because I just, I really felt prepared. Could I have done it differently? Absolutely.

1799
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:30,760
Could I have gone back and implemented sports science and other elements that we now know

1800
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:37,400
would have dramatically increased my performance ratio? Yes. But the process of going through that

1801
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:42,280
and hardening my mentality and going through those dark times where you're questioning yourself,

1802
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:49,720
being in a sauna alone every day, sweating and meditating and visualizing to be your absolute

1803
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:55,560
greatest potential. Thinking about not an almond more or an almond less that goes into your body,

1804
02:27:55,560 --> 02:28:01,640
like on a daily basis, like that obsession is fatiguing, but also really beautiful thinking

1805
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:08,600
back and I miss it immensely, but it was a huge burden and weightlessness and victory,

1806
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:13,800
personal victory that took a whole team to get me to that point when I arrived in Vancouver and

1807
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:17,960
I had an incredible Olympic games. Didn't actually end up winning a gold in those games,

1808
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:22,360
but still feeling like I won and having the most consistent Olympics I ever had in my life.

1809
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:28,440
And that transition from 07, 08, 09 as you're completely changing your style,

1810
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:35,560
completely changing your body, changing the way you train, adjusting to a sport that is still

1811
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:41,640
basically in probably a profound evolution more so than a sport that's been around for

1812
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:45,240
hundreds of years or at least been an Olympic sport for a hundred years. It's still in that

1813
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:52,360
growth curve of figuring out the balance between technical versus strength versus power. What was

1814
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:59,160
it like to go back to Korea in, is it was in 07 you went back? To live in Korea was in 07.

1815
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:04,200
And I know we sort of talked about this before, but you had kind of an interesting homecoming

1816
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:10,120
back to Korea post-02, right? Which was in 04. We kind of glossed over that a little bit, but

1817
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:15,080
for two years you didn't go back, right? Yeah. So after the 2002 Olympic games,

1818
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:19,960
when I had won that gold medal in the 1500 meters and the South Korean was disqualified,

1819
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:25,320
thus began this like really interesting relationship with the country of South Korea.

1820
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:28,920
I think I had mentioned that I was the second most hated person in South Korea. First was Osama

1821
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:34,680
bin Laden. We received 15,000, 16,000 death threats via email, which crashed the United States

1822
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:39,320
Olympic committee servers during the Olympic games. So instantaneously, we knew that that country was

1823
02:29:39,320 --> 02:29:44,200
very unhappy with what had just happened. And it was a subjective call, not made by me,

1824
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:49,400
but made by a referee who was the corner judge who decided this thing that there was a cross-tracking

1825
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:54,520
penalty. And I was awarded, could have went either way if you replayed the race again

1826
02:29:54,520 --> 02:30:00,920
with different judges. So fast forward to the 2002 world cup soccer world cup,

1827
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:05,480
and it was Korea versus United States, a Korean athlete scores the first goal,

1828
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:11,960
rips off his jersey underneath the jersey painted on his back is my last name, OHNO. Oh, no. And

1829
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:17,800
they essentially do a replay of that race on the soccer field and pretend and they throw the arms

1830
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:23,720
up and everything. Basically showcasing that they think that that was a misstep in the judging call

1831
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:29,000
and I should not have been on word of the gold. So they were really infatuated with that result.

1832
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:33,080
It was also a time in which I think anti-American sentiment within the country was at its probably

1833
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:39,880
peak. And a lot of people were kind of pointing fingers about things that were happening

1834
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:46,840
inside the country that involved Americans and could have been penalized, should have been

1835
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:50,760
penalized for their actions in the country and they weren't and they were let off. And so they

1836
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:56,360
thought that this was not okay. And outside these decisions in courtroom areas that these things

1837
02:30:56,360 --> 02:31:01,640
were happening, people were chanting my name as if I had anything to do with any of those incidents

1838
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:07,960
in any capacity. So again, it was a really sensitive time and it escalated even further

1839
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:14,040
because these death threats continued on throughout the year. So much so that my face was on toilet

1840
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:20,040
paper inside Korea where they were selling this and you can imagine that's a crazy thing to have

1841
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:23,000
happened. I had a lot of friends who were in service who were in the country and they were like,

1842
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:28,120
dude, you are not liked in this country. Do not come here. It's not okay. They don't even watch

1843
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:31,240
speed skating. They don't know the sport. They don't know you. They just know they're supposed

1844
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:37,400
to hate you. And so this spread, this nationalism inside South Korea was always strong and they're

1845
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:41,720
very patriotic people and very passionate. And they just, they got behind this thing that I was not

1846
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:47,160
the good guy. And we compete every single year in these world cups, right? So from 2002 to 2004,

1847
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:53,080
we had probably three world cups that were supposed to be in Seoul. All three we opted out

1848
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:57,240
not to go. Now those are important world cups. Those give you the world ranking in order to

1849
02:31:57,240 --> 02:32:01,320
get best seated for your world championship. So it had to be pretty devastating for us to not go.

1850
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:04,840
And we just didn't know what the threat was going to be. We didn't know if it was going to be real.

1851
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:09,320
We weren't, we weren't certain of all it takes is one crazy person to make a, you know, an action

1852
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:13,160
and something could happen. And my father definitely didn't want me to go. I'm the only son.

1853
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:17,240
He felt that the threat was real and he just wasn't worth it. It's only sport, right? Why would you

1854
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:22,120
put yourself in danger and at risk? And to me, I just, I felt I was really hurt. I think emotionally

1855
02:32:22,120 --> 02:32:26,280
because I grew up around the Korean culture. Like I was obsessed with the Korean skaters. I had

1856
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:30,920
Korean coaches, you know, I looked up to them and Korean friends growing up in federally Washington

1857
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:34,680
and Seattle, Washington, and I ate the food. I understood it. And so I just felt like it was

1858
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:39,160
very unwarranted because they never heard my side of the story and they didn't know me as a person,

1859
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:44,280
but instead I was judged by a preconceived notion or speculation that wasn't accurate. And so

1860
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:50,280
getting that across a huge language barrier is impossible. So my only thought was well,

1861
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:56,200
in 2004, I have to go there. And so finally made the decision as a team to go to Seoul to compete

1862
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:00,840
and upon arrival, you know, we were told that the risk is still there. There's going to be body

1863
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:06,360
guards, but I had no idea what to expect. I'd never been in this position before. And upon arrival

1864
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:11,720
in Incheon international airport, there was an empty baggage claim, meaning they cleared out the

1865
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:18,440
baggage claim, the area that we arrived at. And it was like a hundred to 200, maybe 300 plus

1866
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:24,120
security guards and police who were standing shoulder to shoulder to block out the Korean

1867
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:29,800
media in which there was like hundreds of people there and fans trying to take pictures and get

1868
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:33,240
interviews because it was a, you know, it's like my first time coming back. So I'm like the second

1869
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:40,040
most hated person in the world. Now I'm back to compete on their home soil in their view to see

1870
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:44,760
who the best, the best is. So like, this is their rematch, right? It's not the Olympics, but this is

1871
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:49,000
their rematch. This is their opportunity to prove for once in a while for all that it was a complete

1872
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:55,240
fluke that I won during those games. And it was the bad call. And the skater that you defeated in

1873
02:33:55,240 --> 02:33:59,800
oh two, was he still skating? He retired. So this wasn't even really about you and him anymore.

1874
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:03,960
This is about you in a country. It was about me in a country about me versus South Korea,

1875
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:09,560
which is really insane for many different levels. But looking back, it made me a lot

1876
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:15,960
stronger mentally and it made me train like a complete monster. Every waking moment I was

1877
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:23,160
driven a lot by my pure fear that the guys on the other side of the world were better,

1878
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:29,640
more prepared, younger, talented, genetically gifted bodies suited for the sport of short

1879
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:34,760
track speed skating. And how can I beat them? The only way I knew was just to be tougher,

1880
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:39,800
right? Mentally be able to withstand pain thresholds that they would even dare step

1881
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:43,880
into that. This is my mentality is the only way that I could make up for my lack of,

1882
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:48,280
you know, whatever God given talent and abilities that I did or didn't have. And so

1883
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:53,640
when I arrived in South Korea, and I don't tell the story often because it's never came up,

1884
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:57,960
but the week prior, we were actually in China for another World Cup. And usually whenever we

1885
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:02,840
go to China for the World Cups, they're held in like Harbin, Changchun, like these north

1886
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:09,080
eastern regions of the country that are very cold. Back then, they just were not nice to visit.

1887
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:13,960
Skyscrapers are being built everywhere. Like it's just not a pleasant place to be in during that

1888
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:18,840
kind of infrastructure booming period. And you usually always got sick at some point,

1889
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:23,640
like the Chinese food was just not clean or what we just didn't have the bacteria to fight. And so,

1890
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:29,000
you know, me being a guy who would like eat street food sometimes when I go over there,

1891
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:33,480
that was no longer an option. And all of my team got sick during that first week. And so we

1892
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:38,040
traveled the next week to South Korea. And typically when you go to a World Cup, you arrive

1893
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:43,560
on a Monday, compete on a Friday. So you spend Monday through Thursday adjusting to the climate,

1894
02:35:43,560 --> 02:35:49,080
getting used to the ice conditions, understanding the environment, and essentially just preparing

1895
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:54,840
yourself for the competition. And so I was the only guy in my team who didn't get sick in China.

1896
02:35:55,480 --> 02:36:01,480
But upon that plane ride from China to South Korea, my stomach was starting to feel a little funky.

1897
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:07,720
Talk about bad timing, right? I'm going to the heart of the lion's den to be at my best.

1898
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:12,840
This race in this competition is a World Cup. It means nothing overall that year. It's 2004.

1899
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:17,400
People don't care. No one's paying attention. It's so intrinsically important for me to perform well

1900
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:22,440
at that competition. Nothing else matters that year because of all of these things that are

1901
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:29,720
encompassing. And so I arrive on Monday. On Tuesday, I have like really bad food poisoning from China.

1902
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:34,760
And it goes into Wednesday. It goes into Thursday. And at this point, I'm like down 10 pounds.

1903
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:41,080
And what's normal for the type of training you would do on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? I mean,

1904
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:45,240
this is like kind of like a dual meet in swimming, right? Where it's like, you're not shaved. You're

1905
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:49,800
not tapered. You're just sort of going through the motions. It's like, it's basically a meet that's

1906
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:54,360
a practice. Would you guys be treating these meets that way? More than a practice, but for sure,

1907
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:57,560
not as important as a world championships and definitely not showing all your cards.

1908
02:36:57,560 --> 02:37:01,880
You would ideally train pretty hard the Wednesday, Thursday. Yeah. So we arrive on Monday. We'll go

1909
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:06,440
for a run with the team, do some skating drills and exercises. Tuesday, we have a harder high

1910
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:12,120
intensity. We'll do like five times seven laps intervals, right? With like four to six minutes

1911
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:17,560
rest in between pretty high intensity, 80 to 90% threshold. And then in the afternoon, we'll do

1912
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:22,280
some form of a plyometric jump training. And all this is by the way, like fractions of what we

1913
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:26,600
would normally do in terms of training. So this to us is a complete rest. Right. But you're not even

1914
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:30,440
able to do this based on the food poisoning, or you are sort of still going through the motions

1915
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:35,320
of these practices. I'm kind of going through the motions and by Thursday, it's pretty apparent

1916
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:39,640
that I'm full blown, like extremely dehydrated and starting to question whether I should even

1917
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:45,080
compete in the competition. Right. Which is like an impossible choice to face because no one's going

1918
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:49,080
to buy the story that you didn't compete because you lost 10 pounds due to food poisoning. Yeah.

1919
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:53,320
The story is going to be, oh, you wimped out. You know that you didn't win effectively. Yeah.

1920
02:37:53,320 --> 02:37:57,880
You're host. And then you show up and compete 10 pounds dehydrated. There's no win. It's lose,

1921
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:03,240
and my father was actually there too in South Korea because he got really scared of my wellbeing.

1922
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:07,960
And, you know, I was just assigned two bodyguards to follow me around the whole competition and the

1923
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:12,040
entire time. And I remember walking in on Friday, the first day of competition and getting on the

1924
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:19,320
ice and hearing all of the Korean fans literally booing and just being like, you know, I don't

1925
02:38:19,320 --> 02:38:22,440
know what they're saying in Korean, but I'm sure something like, like, you know, you're losing.

1926
02:38:22,440 --> 02:38:23,560
It's probably not nice.

1927
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:29,960
It's not nice. You know, definitely take me out of the game. And, you know, I performed okay,

1928
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:34,360
actually, the first day. I did not bad. And there's something about, and I'd love to really

1929
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:38,040
understand the science behind this because I've had this repetition time and time again. Whenever

1930
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:44,200
I got sick in my sport, I always performed pretty well for whatever reason, even through time trials.

1931
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:48,120
Do you think it just has to do with the forced rest that comes before it?

1932
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:52,360
Maybe forced rest. Maybe the white blood cell count is a component. I mean, who knows what's

1933
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:56,280
really there? Maybe the immune system is working overtime. I don't know, but I mean, I'm exhausted.

1934
02:38:56,280 --> 02:39:00,600
I physically feel terrible, but for some reason, my output is still very, very, very high.

1935
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:05,880
This time was different because I'm pretty lean already. You drop all that water. I was drinking

1936
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:11,080
water. It was coming right out 10 minutes later. Like literally, it was just severe, nasty food

1937
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:16,200
poisoning that lasted about three and a half days. And so, you know, I get through the first day,

1938
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:20,840
I get through Saturday, the 500 meters, I was pretty much useless in the sprints for whatever

1939
02:39:20,840 --> 02:39:26,120
reason. I just had no strength in between races on Sunday, which is a thousand meters and the

1940
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:31,640
3000 meters. I'm like lying on the floor, you know, like just trying to rest. And I ended up actually

1941
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:35,400
somehow just doing very well at that competition. I ended up winning the thousand meter, winning the

1942
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:40,200
3000 meter. So at men, this is Saturday, Sunday, this is Sunday. So on Sunday is the big day,

1943
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:44,040
which means you skate the thousand meter and the 3000 meter super final and then the relay

1944
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:48,200
on the same day. That's how the world cup schedule usually works. It doesn't work that way in the

1945
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:53,160
Olympics, but it's very, very different. And so I skated very well and I ended up winning the

1946
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:58,680
competition on the home soil. So what, how do the fans react to this? Well, you know, when I first

1947
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:03,240
got on on Friday, they were all booing. And by the time I left, I would say 80% of them actually

1948
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:08,120
were clapping and they were cheering. And someone had leaked to the media that I was really sick

1949
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:12,280
during that time. And I think that had a component of that of people, people understood that I

1950
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:17,720
actually was performing at subpar optimal levels and I still was able to somehow pull it off. And

1951
02:40:17,720 --> 02:40:22,760
it was really mentally excruciating because I very much wanted to win, but not because I wanted

1952
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:28,360
to beat them, but because I just, I wanted to prove to me, it was, it was like, look, I'm legitimate.

1953
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:35,000
Like I am a competitive athlete who on any given Sunday can win, may not win every 10 times,

1954
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:39,400
but I'll win at least one of those 10 times. Right. And I wanted to showcase that and just

1955
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:44,520
kind of searching and, you know, reaching for respect because I didn't get that when I first

1956
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:49,800
arrived, like it was like basically, you know, the thought process was you did not deserve to win

1957
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:55,240
and you cheated to win and I didn't feel like I did. And so the only way to re to retract those

1958
02:40:55,240 --> 02:41:00,040
statements from those people who were making them was to try to go there and win wholeheartedly

1959
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:06,600
openly. And I did in that manner. And so that was, that was the first change in our relationship

1960
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:12,280
in terms of being the most hated to having respect for me as an athlete and as a sportsman

1961
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:16,840
to actually like going to the airport and then people having like fan club signs. And this

1962
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:20,840
happened within the same trip. This happened the same, meaning you described your arrival,

1963
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:26,200
but by the time you departed, the same Korean fans were cheering for you. The same Korean fans

1964
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:31,240
were cheering for me in the airport with signs. And I remember the head of KSU at the time,

1965
02:41:31,240 --> 02:41:34,920
Mr. Chang came up to me. He's like, I don't know what you did or how you did it, but you are

1966
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:39,640
leaving here in a much better place than you did when you arrived, which is awesome, you know,

1967
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:45,320
because that was the actual goal. My goal was not to defeat really them, but to just show them

1968
02:41:45,320 --> 02:41:49,720
that I'm. Just to earn their respect. Yep. That's, that's what it came down to. And it did it in a

1969
02:41:49,720 --> 02:41:55,320
convincing fashion. So it was, it was awesome. So between 04 and 07, you've obviously gone back

1970
02:41:55,320 --> 02:42:00,040
to the Olympics. You've demonstrated that this isn't some fluke. You've earned their respect.

1971
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:07,240
And now in 07 you're going to actually train with them as you try to come back and make the Olympic

1972
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:12,520
team in 2010. Yep. So again, I kind of go back into the, the belly of the beast. I go back to

1973
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:17,800
the place where no other. And they're embracing you now. But they're also at the time, the South

1974
02:42:17,800 --> 02:42:23,000
Korean short track team was very, very fenced off from the rest of the world in terms of their

1975
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:27,480
training methods. That was their secret sauce. We don't understand why they're so good. How do they

1976
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:31,400
get that technique? How do they, they don't lift weights we hear, but they're so good. We watch

1977
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:35,640
them during training and it looks like they're over-training. What did their bodies look like?

1978
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:41,880
I mean, designed for short track. If you could be God and you could make a perfect short track

1979
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:47,720
skater, tell me what their body looks like. So you take your pelvis, tilt it forward. So the complete

1980
02:42:47,720 --> 02:42:51,960
opposite of what you do in a squat, do the complete opposite. Tilt your pelvis forward.

1981
02:42:51,960 --> 02:42:58,200
Okay. And so your lower back is now rounded, have a shorter torso, longer legs, thinner and frame

1982
02:42:58,200 --> 02:43:02,760
naturally, and basically zero upper body weight, because then you can strengthen your lower body

1983
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:08,840
very easily. That sounds like a cyclist. That's the tilt you put into a cyclist's thoracolumbar

1984
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:15,480
spine. No upper body, all lower body. That's how you design it. And very, and strength, the weight

1985
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:21,400
ratio, that's strange. That's the perfect speed skater. And there's a few that exist. I actually

1986
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:25,320
wasn't one of them. My proportions are actually, my legs are a little bit too short. My torso is a

1987
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:29,560
little bit too long. And you're pretty muscular all around. Like you don't have that emaciated

1988
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:36,120
upper body. No, I didn't naturally, but the South Korean athletes, men and women had this naturally.

1989
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:41,080
And so when I watched them skate, I recognized right away, I was like, these guys aren't thinking

1990
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:44,600
about their technique when they're going through the corner. It's natural. Like they're just

1991
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:49,480
skating. It's like walking. You don't think about left, right, left, right. You just walk. When you

1992
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:53,320
go for a jog, the same thing, you're not thinking about which foot is in front of the other. That's

1993
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:57,080
what it's like when you don't understand speed skating is you're thinking, let me tilt my left

1994
02:43:57,080 --> 02:44:01,480
hip in. Let me put my right shoulder down. Maybe make sure that my shoulders and my hips are level

1995
02:44:01,480 --> 02:44:05,880
with the ice, no matter what angle I'm skating at. Make sure my nose, knees and toes are in

1996
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:10,520
in line at all times in all periods. Like I'm thinking about these things every corner because

1997
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:15,320
it's not natural. Really? Even, I mean, I remember you once telling me the funniest thing about how

1998
02:44:15,320 --> 02:44:21,400
you would drive to the rink in that position. Yeah, I was obsessed. I mean, of course we can't

1999
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:26,440
do it on the podcast because we don't, we don't have the visual, but like the image of you tilting

2000
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:32,520
yourself over the steering wheel, driving that way to mimic the corner. It never became

2001
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:37,880
autonomic. You never got to the point where you could make that turn and perfectly line up without

2002
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:43,320
a single thought. I trained myself to do it automatically, but I don't think it was a natural

2003
02:44:43,320 --> 02:44:50,440
feeling for me. It took years and hours and hours of obsessive driving with like all the weight on

2004
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:54,440
my right hip with my left hip. You know, like imagine driving and you put all the weight on

2005
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:59,320
your right leg and your left leg is not even touching the ground. Okay. And your left hip is

2006
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:03,480
actually raised a little bit and your left hand is on the steering wheel and your right shoulder

2007
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:07,800
is down. Like that's an uncomfortable position to be in every single day to and from the ice rink.

2008
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:13,880
And I did it because I want, I just wanted to feel natural. I wanted to skate as natural as I saw

2009
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:17,400
the other skaters skating. I love this kind of stuff. I mean, that's what I sort of enjoy about

2010
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:23,240
having a discussion like this is I think so many people, if they're sort of watching you on TV or

2011
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:26,520
they're watching Phelps or they're watching Lance Armstrong or they're watching, you know,

2012
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:33,480
pick whatever great athlete. I think people just assume like it just came so easy to them. And,

2013
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:42,440
but I don't think they realize that the best of the best have this ability to force themselves to

2014
02:45:42,440 --> 02:45:46,840
do this type of work, which is not to say that there isn't a natural talent. I think the best

2015
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:51,960
of the best combined natural talent with sort of, you know, whatever, but you know, you don't even

2016
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:56,840
have the same sort of physical dimension advantage that some of your peers would have,

2017
02:45:56,840 --> 02:46:03,480
but it's this complete obsession. It's this like, who would even think I'm going to use the extra

2018
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:08,520
hour a day I'm driving to train speed skating. Yeah. It's all I cared about. It's all I thought

2019
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:14,840
was important. It's all that mattered in my life. And when you prioritize that as being the sole

2020
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:19,240
significant piece of your life from waking moment till you close your eyes and hopefully when you're

2021
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:23,560
sleeping, you're thinking about it too, it changes your perspective on how you live your life and

2022
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:28,040
what actually you do on a daily basis to impact you. I mean, I want to come back to finish your

2023
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:33,080
career, but I can't help, but at the moment, ask a question that I'm afraid I'll forget to ask if we

2024
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:40,520
go back to the Olympics, which is now that you're not a professional athlete, do you still have that

2025
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:47,320
level of focus or is that something that is very difficult to maintain for a prolonged period of

2026
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:51,560
time? In other words, do you now relish the fact that you didn't have to think about what we had

2027
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:56,440
for dinner? Like you could eat as much as you wanted and you can now sit here comfortably and

2028
02:46:57,320 --> 02:47:02,840
you're going to drive home tonight and you're not going to have to contort yourself into some crazy

2029
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:07,960
position. I mean, what's the new guidance system you've applied to the missile that is your life?

2030
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:13,960
It definitely have the same, I think, quirks that I did from sport that are transferring over to my

2031
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:18,520
life. I now recognize them. When I was training as an athlete, I didn't recognize them. I didn't

2032
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:22,920
know what they were. I just thought that that's what I did. This is the things that me driving

2033
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:27,800
in that way to the ice rink was normal. That's not normal. That's not even normal for an athlete.

2034
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:33,240
It's really not by borderline unhealthy psychologically to be that obsessed at that

2035
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:37,720
level all the time. There wasn't one day I went to the ice rink. I didn't wake up and didn't want

2036
02:47:37,720 --> 02:47:42,280
to be there because it was in a choice. There was no, do I want to go to a not? That was even

2037
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:49,480
a conversation. Now, concentrating the different projects that I have and delving into areas where

2038
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:58,520
I don't have the experience, I don't have the time spent and education, it really helps because I

2039
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:03,240
completely immerse and I spent hours and hours and hours on certain elements. Is it in the same

2040
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:09,320
intensity? Probably not. It's difficult to relate that in the same way, but for sure the traits and

2041
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:14,840
attributes that I developed as a short track athlete for absolutely sure they are beneficial

2042
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:19,080
attributes to apply towards specific parts of life. Also, just the fact of feeling like

2043
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:25,960
when you look at life, no matter how bad shit gets, you can always come back. No matter how

2044
02:48:25,960 --> 02:48:32,360
sick, no matter how tired I am, I was able to compete. I was able to train now in doing business

2045
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:37,880
or relationships, taking the same kind of mentality of saying like I've done things

2046
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:41,560
physiologically I never thought was possible. I broke through barriers mentally that I think

2047
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:46,920
were really powerful. How do you apply those with an open mind and with a way that's a different

2048
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:53,560
perspective on life? I'm much softer as a person now than I was back then. I was so rigid in every

2049
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:59,320
element you can imagine and tight actually with my time, with the way that I viewed, I think the

2050
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:04,680
world, with the way I viewed my teammates. It made me probably unpleasant to be around on the ice

2051
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:09,800
most of the time because I wasn't there to make friends. Did you have significant relationships

2052
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:14,920
with a girlfriend or something during that period of your life? Kind of off and on, but none that

2053
02:49:14,920 --> 02:49:22,120
really were, no, nothing that I would really say like this was huge. Not like what you enjoy today.

2054
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:27,080
No, totally different, but my view is different. My life really kind of began after I retired from

2055
02:49:27,080 --> 02:49:32,680
the sport. I learned so much through it, but I really recognized that my life began when I

2056
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:36,760
decided to not come back to the sport. It was really beautiful to be able to do that.

2057
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:42,120
Why is it that many athletes can't articulate what you just said on two levels? The first being,

2058
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:47,720
I'm amazed at the number of athletes that I meet who once they're done with their sport,

2059
02:49:47,720 --> 02:49:53,720
they can't seem to apply that greatness to the next chapter. In other words, they've clearly

2060
02:49:53,720 --> 02:50:00,280
worked hard. They've clearly learned to do something well even when no one's looking because

2061
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:05,320
that's basically what most of practice is, but they really struggle to make that leap. Then

2062
02:50:05,320 --> 02:50:12,440
secondly, for many athletes sadly, once the lights are gone, once nobody knows your name,

2063
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:16,040
there seems to be this depression that sets in and maybe depression might be

2064
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:23,560
too far on the pendulum, but there's this sense of their purpose is over. They don't think about

2065
02:50:23,560 --> 02:50:26,680
what that next chapter looks like. Did you struggle with any of those things at all? I

2066
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:30,680
remember just seeing you now on the other side of that where it looks like everything's worked out.

2067
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:34,680
I mean, was there ever a challenge where you thought, oh my God, I don't ever get to

2068
02:50:35,400 --> 02:50:39,960
carry a flag. I don't ever get to put a medal on my neck. I don't ever get to be on TV for

2069
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:43,160
being the best athlete or something. I mean, was that a transition?

2070
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:47,960
It was an incredibly difficult transition and one that I don't talk about that much,

2071
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:53,640
but I don't care who you are. I heard a podcast, I'm going to say like a couple of years ago,

2072
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:58,600
which I really resonated with it. It was talking about seals coming home from war

2073
02:50:59,720 --> 02:51:04,600
and feeling so out of place in normal society that they can't wait to go back. Not that they

2074
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:08,040
love war. They hate war. They don't like what it is, but-

2075
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:09,560
They probably love the purpose.

2076
02:51:09,560 --> 02:51:09,800
They have a purpose.

2077
02:51:09,800 --> 02:51:11,400
The camaraderie and the purpose, right?

2078
02:51:11,400 --> 02:51:16,200
They feel like this is what they're supposed to do. There's a sense of belonging and a sense

2079
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:23,240
of purpose, like you said. In the Olympic space, you have one single focus for a long time,

2080
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:29,960
four, eight, 12 years. Nothing in your life matters more than that sport and everything

2081
02:51:29,960 --> 02:51:34,840
you do is generated to be important in that sport. If you win, you're celebrated, which makes it even

2082
02:51:34,840 --> 02:51:39,080
more dangerous because now there's a level of expectation that you are going to carry this flag

2083
02:51:39,080 --> 02:51:45,560
further. Like you said, there's a ton of attributes you create as an athlete that are incredible life

2084
02:51:45,560 --> 02:51:49,800
lessons that you learn through sport. They're amazing. The problem is when you retire from

2085
02:51:49,880 --> 02:51:55,480
an athlete, you've now dedicated most of your adult life towards this one specific task that

2086
02:51:55,480 --> 02:52:02,200
has absolutely zero relevancy to life. I went in circles in spandex for most of my adult life.

2087
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:07,000
Well, most of my younger adult life, right? And now I retired. I didn't intern. I wasn't working

2088
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:11,800
at Goldman Sachs as a finance guy. I don't have experience working as a job. And now I'm thrust in

2089
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:17,800
the spotlight to go and basically act and interact in normal society. If you didn't make money, you

2090
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:23,000
didn't win medals, then what do you do? Like you basically you sacrifice like the first 12 years of

2091
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:27,400
your life that you normally from the age of 18 to 28, those are so incredibly important to gain

2092
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:32,680
expertise and experience and social skills and personal development and try anything that you

2093
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:36,680
want and fail at them and still okay and get back up. You didn't have that opportunity. You're now

2094
02:52:36,680 --> 02:52:43,240
starting out as an 18 year old, but you're now 28 years old. And so that's the challenge is from a

2095
02:52:43,240 --> 02:52:47,400
competitive perspective, when you've got a corporate entity looking at hiring or perhaps you want to

2096
02:52:47,400 --> 02:52:52,120
get a new job like, hey, that's great. You got you're an Olympic athlete. I know you probably work

2097
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:56,360
hard. I know that you probably spent a lot of time doing this, this and this, but you've got zero work

2098
02:52:56,360 --> 02:53:02,120
experience. You didn't finish college. You don't have any idea what it takes to be here. Like,

2099
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:06,040
maybe I'll take a risk on you. Maybe I won't. It's a difficult position to be in. But on top of all

2100
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:11,000
of that stuff, you have to look at the actual psychological issues that exist. And that's where

2101
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:18,280
really, really gets dark. I'm not excluded from that. I was so fearful in 2008 that when I retired

2102
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:25,400
in 2010, I wouldn't find my place. I wouldn't find my running start. I didn't want to go from 2010

2103
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:31,480
retire 2014 or 2013 say I'm coming out of retirement. I want to go for another games.

2104
02:53:31,480 --> 02:53:36,840
I never wanted that to be me. I said, as soon as I retired, I really, really want to walk away

2105
02:53:36,840 --> 02:53:41,960
because I'm doing something else. And I want to win at something else. It's completely unrelated

2106
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:47,000
to speed skating. It's unrelated to the Olympic space. So it's almost like a chip on your shoulder.

2107
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:51,560
Not everyone is like that, but that was my perspective. And, you know, a lot of athletes,

2108
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:54,840
when they retire, like literally like at the snap of a finger, when they come home from the Olympic

2109
02:53:54,840 --> 02:54:02,280
games, there's no coach, there's no training program, there's no cafeteria, there's no,

2110
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:08,120
there's no more structure and schedule that has been kind of given to you in a way that's pretty

2111
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:12,040
easy to follow. You just, you wake up, you go to the ice rink, you train, you come home, you eat,

2112
02:54:12,040 --> 02:54:16,360
you focus on skating tapes, sharpen your skates, go back to the ice rink, train again,

2113
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:22,760
etc. It's very mundane, specific, but pretty easy to follow. It's simple. I say not easy, it's simple.

2114
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:26,120
That's a great point, right? There's a big differentiation between simple and easy.

2115
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:30,440
There's nothing easy about it, but there's a beauty to being able to focus on one thing

2116
02:54:30,440 --> 02:54:33,080
at the exclusion of pretty much everything else.

2117
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:40,600
Yeah. And now you wake up and man, what do I do? Like how important is money? How important is

2118
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:45,560
having a family? How important are relationships? How important is personal self-development? How

2119
02:54:45,560 --> 02:54:50,280
important is my nutrition? Do I even understand nutrition? Everyone, my nutrition is giving the

2120
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:54,840
food to eat. Do I go for runs? Do I work out? Like, so I see a lot of athletes.

2121
02:54:54,840 --> 02:54:59,080
Is there much effort around preparing athletes for that transition in retirement?

2122
02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:03,560
There used to be, I don't know what it's like now. I think there's probably more of an emphasis

2123
02:55:03,560 --> 02:55:09,400
now, but they always look, people always tell you, look, your Olympic career will end at some point

2124
02:55:09,400 --> 02:55:15,000
and you have to be prepared for the transition. We used to do these things called USOC summits

2125
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:19,800
in which two years before the Olympics, you would go to a winter destination. For example,

2126
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:27,480
we would go to Park City and then all the Olympic hopefuls and existing Olympic athletes in the past,

2127
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:31,560
two or three generations would come. Eric Hyde would be there. Bonnie Blair would be there.

2128
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:36,680
Dan Jansen would be there. Michelle Kwan. These people would be there and you basically would

2129
02:55:36,680 --> 02:55:41,320
talk about what it takes to train for the next two years and then what to do before,

2130
02:55:41,320 --> 02:55:45,960
during and after the Olympics. The issue is no one really takes it seriously because you have

2131
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:52,200
this invincibility complex that, you know what? I'm not going to get hurt. Sure. Like I'm just,

2132
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:56,200
I'm just going to keep skating until I die. And I was naive enough. Remember, I made some bad

2133
02:55:56,200 --> 02:56:00,760
decisions as an athlete. You know, I told you pretty early, I was asked at the age of 17 at one

2134
02:56:00,760 --> 02:56:05,080
of these summits, two years before the games, I had said like, I'm like, what do you want to be

2135
02:56:05,080 --> 02:56:09,560
remembered for? And I wrote down, like I want to be the most decorated winter Olympic athlete of

2136
02:56:09,560 --> 02:56:13,480
all time. The greatest speed skater to have ever lived in short track speed skating. And they put

2137
02:56:13,480 --> 02:56:18,520
that in a Steiner ice arena in Utah. I forgot about this, but the things that I learned there

2138
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:21,720
were so important, but people could tell me all the time. And someone asked me like, what do you

2139
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:24,840
want to do in retire? I was like, what do you mean when I retire? Like I was built for this sport.

2140
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:29,640
I'm supposed to be here to motivate other human beings throughout my actions on the ice.

2141
02:56:29,640 --> 02:56:34,760
It's very naive to say. And I, for some reason, I just thought that it was okay to live that life.

2142
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:38,920
It was like, I didn't have a parachute. I lived that way in speed skating. On one side,

2143
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:44,120
it's beautiful because there is no plan B. And when there's no plan B, you really commit to plan

2144
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:48,200
A. You better make sure that plan A is going to be executed. That's the burning of the ships,

2145
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:52,520
right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You burn the ship so you can't leave the island. But again,

2146
02:56:52,600 --> 02:56:58,920
there's still something here. There's a difference between people who seem to get more out of the

2147
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:04,200
sport. It's almost like they're actively versus passively participating in the process. You can

2148
02:57:04,200 --> 02:57:11,960
very passively participate, I suspect, where you follow the lessons and you go through the motions

2149
02:57:11,960 --> 02:57:16,920
of doing everything you need to do for the sport versus I think a more active way of doing that.

2150
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:21,480
And I say active in an emotional way, not a physical way. Obviously, both examples are

2151
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:27,800
physically active, but to be emotionally active through that process, I suspect you are, whether

2152
02:57:27,800 --> 02:57:34,600
consciously or subconsciously assimilating the knowledge, the skill, the failure, the discipline

2153
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:41,320
into what could be the next chapter. So let's go back and finish. How does the story end?

2154
02:57:41,320 --> 02:57:49,080
It's oh eight, it's oh nine. So oh nine is really the last major competition before the Olympics,

2155
02:57:49,160 --> 02:57:56,680
right? It's the world. It's the world championships. They're being held in Beijing and I'm competing.

2156
02:57:56,680 --> 02:58:01,720
And there's one other US short trek athlete who was my junior. He started speed skating because

2157
02:58:01,720 --> 02:58:06,600
he watched me in 2002. Now we're competing on the same team. He's from the same area I grew up in.

2158
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:11,640
I used to be his idol. And I always used to look at this kid and be like, this gets a lot better

2159
02:58:11,640 --> 02:58:16,520
than he actually realizes. Once he realizes how good he is, he's potentially going to be world

2160
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:23,400
champion or Olympic gold medalist. And in and throughout this process at the world championships,

2161
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:31,480
I just performed sub optimally. I wasn't a major contender. I wasn't a top tier guy to win. I

2162
02:58:31,480 --> 02:58:36,920
wasn't on top of the podium. I think I got like fifth at the world in the world in oh nine. Yep.

2163
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:41,240
I got to go back and check, but it was the first time I watched from the, you know, after the

2164
02:58:41,240 --> 02:58:44,520
competition, we have a banquet. All the athletes are there. Everyone's getting awarded. You go in

2165
02:58:44,520 --> 02:58:50,840
the podium, getting your checks. And it was the first time in a long time that I wasn't,

2166
02:58:50,840 --> 02:58:55,320
didn't have the spotlight. I wasn't the guy that people were talking, man, that race, all that

2167
02:58:55,320 --> 02:59:00,920
pass. Oh my God. So powerful. Like it was not about me. And I was like, Oh man, this is,

2168
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:06,840
this is weird. Is this what it's supposed to be like? Do I just start to dissipate and just

2169
02:59:06,840 --> 02:59:12,040
kind of wither away? And I used to be good and I'm still respected, but just don't have what it

2170
02:59:12,040 --> 02:59:16,360
takes anymore to be competitive. And I'm kind of losing that edge. And I can't keep up with the

2171
02:59:16,360 --> 02:59:19,480
evolution of what's happening in short track because the body types are changing and the

2172
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:26,120
training is changing. The athletes are changing. And so I left there really, really, really worried

2173
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:30,920
and upset. And also hearing that chatter again about, I don't think that Paula was going to be

2174
02:59:30,920 --> 02:59:36,120
actually on the podium in 2010, which is a big, different conversation. You know, I've been at

2175
02:59:36,120 --> 02:59:43,080
that level for 10 years now at the top, top, top of my game in the year 2000, 2001 season. I won

2176
02:59:43,080 --> 02:59:48,760
every single race that season and both the Korean athlete who I, you know, had that tussle with and

2177
02:59:48,760 --> 02:59:53,160
that Mark Ganyal character from Quebec, both camped me during that race. And it was like, you are the

2178
02:59:53,160 --> 02:59:57,400
greatest athlete to compete in short track speed. Like two champions that I look up to and analyze

2179
02:59:57,400 --> 03:00:01,800
said that to me to now being at a point where no one was talking to me, not even on the podium,

2180
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:05,480
not even on the podium, but not only that people aren't even taking my lap times during practice

2181
03:00:05,480 --> 03:00:11,160
anymore. Wow. So like this is psychologically damaging because from a confidence perspective,

2182
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:15,000
you race differently. And I started to recognize that other athletes aren't respecting me on the

2183
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:19,800
ice the same way they used to. I used to be able to actually have an off day, but if I just kind of

2184
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:23,720
attempted to pass it, someone, they just let me in because there was so much respect for what I had

2185
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:28,600
done in the sport before that no longer existed. People skated as if I was just like a random skater.

2186
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:33,480
Yeah. So there's huge psychological advantage you brought to the start line was gone.

2187
03:00:33,480 --> 03:00:41,240
Was gone. And so it really made me dive deep and say, okay, like, look, this is my last chance at

2188
03:00:41,240 --> 03:00:45,720
really trying to show up differently. And I think that, you know, my Korean coaches that

2189
03:00:45,720 --> 03:00:52,040
have been telling me, they're like, look, the Korean coaches themselves, they know you so well.

2190
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:58,440
They studied you from 2002 until today. You're the only thing that mattered to them. So they

2191
03:00:58,840 --> 03:01:04,200
watched every single race you've ever skated time and time again, and they have pawns in their

2192
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:09,560
skating rings to basically mimic your skating, just like a boxing, like your sparring partner.

2193
03:01:09,560 --> 03:01:13,720
So they have guys who try to mimic the way that you skate in that style so they can practice

2194
03:01:13,720 --> 03:01:17,320
against you every single day. I didn't have, we didn't have that. We didn't think about it like

2195
03:01:17,320 --> 03:01:24,280
that. They were, they were different level. And so I went back to my house in, in Utah and I said,

2196
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:28,920
man, I'm going to go back to kind of where I developed my strength. And I said, I'm going to

2197
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:35,880
go spend a summer in Colorado Springs alone. I drove there. Was there some part that thought,

2198
03:01:35,880 --> 03:01:39,880
maybe I should just retire because it's one thing to go through what you went through. It would be

2199
03:01:39,880 --> 03:01:44,040
entirely another thing to fail on the Olympic stage. Yeah. I didn't want to give up. That's

2200
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:49,000
for sure. I still believed. This is interesting. I mean, let's explore that for a moment because

2201
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:52,360
I gotta be honest with you, man. I don't know that I would have had the intestinal fortitude to

2202
03:01:52,360 --> 03:01:58,360
continue. If I, if I really felt like I'm on the decline and every day I'm getting a little less

2203
03:01:58,360 --> 03:02:02,840
good and everybody around me is getting a little bit better, I don't know. Maybe that's why I'm not

2204
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:09,240
Olympic champion. Like, I mean, that's, that's kind of a remarkable inner confidence. And did you

2205
03:02:09,240 --> 03:02:14,280
explicitly or implicitly tie that back to some of these other difficult things you'd been through,

2206
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:19,480
including getting thrown out in the woods when you were in the summer of 98 and things like that?

2207
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:23,720
I did, but you know, again, you're like, did you talk about this with your dad? I mean, who would,

2208
03:02:23,720 --> 03:02:27,640
I did, I did extensively. He was my confidant and there was three people in my life who were my

2209
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:32,120
confidant. It was my dad, one of my best friends, Ian Baranski, who was basically living in my house

2210
03:02:32,120 --> 03:02:36,920
in Utah as like a training partner. And then John Schaefer, the guy who I brought in to live and

2211
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:40,840
train me during that period of time. Those are the three people who I really, really had conversations

2212
03:02:40,840 --> 03:02:45,080
with. John is the most optimistic, positive person on the planet. Like there's nothing he believes

2213
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:50,040
that can't be accomplished through strength and focus. And so his thought was, Oh, it doesn't

2214
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:52,440
matter. You're going to come back and you're going to crush everybody. You're going to smash

2215
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:56,200
everybody. You're going to skate lap times that don't exist. You know, my dad's more realist.

2216
03:02:56,200 --> 03:03:01,560
Ian is a very, very, very strong, different view. He's much more of a realist. And you know, he saw

2217
03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:05,000
what was the view between the three of them. My dad didn't really have an opinion, right? He's

2218
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:08,440
more just like, look, I support what you either do to make sure you, you really go through the

2219
03:03:08,440 --> 03:03:12,120
drawing board and develop a plan. And I was a different person then. So my dad was, I think

2220
03:03:12,120 --> 03:03:17,320
he was happy to see me, but he also recognized that it was not going to be easy. John with the

2221
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:20,600
time was like, well, you know, I think this is still possible. You can still win every single

2222
03:03:20,600 --> 03:03:25,240
distance in the world and you won't lose in a big year. You know, that's his attitude, which I

2223
03:03:25,240 --> 03:03:29,080
needed to have that around because I'm not naturally that type of a person. And then Ian was-

2224
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:31,240
Meaning you naturally don't have that much confidence.

2225
03:03:31,240 --> 03:03:34,600
I have confidence, but it's different. Like I definitely, it's not like I walk in and say,

2226
03:03:34,600 --> 03:03:38,280
I can't lose. There was times, right? When my equipment was on point, like earlier in my career,

2227
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:41,640
I was like, I could fall down. I guess I win this race. Like no one's going to beat me. I'm just that

2228
03:03:41,720 --> 03:03:45,240
much better than everybody else. But at this point, you know, I was battling some small injuries and

2229
03:03:45,240 --> 03:03:49,240
some equipment issues and nothing was quite right. So I never felt like I was a hundred percent,

2230
03:03:49,240 --> 03:03:53,480
like maybe 80% of the time. So the one person I felt like really knew me was my friend,

2231
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:57,720
Ian Barranci. Now to give you kind of some backstory, like as a short track on book athlete,

2232
03:03:57,720 --> 03:04:01,800
you never show your cards, even to your teammates, because eventually you raised against them in the

2233
03:04:01,800 --> 03:04:06,920
Olympic trials. So you kind of show that you always hold something back. And so I was really,

2234
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:11,160
really good at that. So people didn't really know like what was going on internally.

2235
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:18,280
They just thought that I was like the stoic never show pain, incredibly focused, super hungry,

2236
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:23,560
quiet, kind of crazy guy who just comes to rank with an insatiable appetite for pain and training

2237
03:04:23,560 --> 03:04:28,840
every day, like with like a complete robot. Like that's, that's who Apollo is. And that's what I

2238
03:04:28,840 --> 03:04:33,000
wanted the people to believe. Right. The reality was and who I would, I needed somebody to kind

2239
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:38,600
of confide in was Ian, my close friend. And you know, Ian was my first roommate when I was traveling

2240
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:42,760
on all these years, like when I was 12 and 13 years old. So he knew me from when I started till

2241
03:04:42,760 --> 03:04:47,960
to this point. And he basically was like, look, you are not the same athlete you used to be.

2242
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:52,200
Like you're actually, even though you have the same recipe for success, you're just not the same.

2243
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:56,360
You're older man. Like your body's stiffer. You don't skate the same. You don't look the same.

2244
03:04:56,360 --> 03:05:00,200
Your equipment's a little bit different. The other athletes are changing. The sport is changing.

2245
03:05:00,840 --> 03:05:06,920
And you know, he's just keeping it real, right? Someone has to. And so I kind of went back and

2246
03:05:06,920 --> 03:05:12,760
I'm like, man, like how do I, in my view, like all these years spent training still only matters

2247
03:05:12,760 --> 03:05:17,560
on this one day in the Olympics. Like none of this stuff matters. My previous wins in my own head,

2248
03:05:17,560 --> 03:05:21,640
my previous wins don't matter. I keep my medals inside my sock drawer in my house. I never bring

2249
03:05:21,640 --> 03:05:25,480
them out. I don't want to think about that. I want, I want to think about I'm the underdog every day.

2250
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:31,480
So I said, I got to make some huge, huge changes. And so I, a week after the world championships,

2251
03:05:31,480 --> 03:05:36,280
I'm back in Salt Lake city. And normally you take like a decompression period and you really, really

2252
03:05:36,280 --> 03:05:39,560
think about things. And I was going to stay there for about a month and then potentially go

2253
03:05:39,560 --> 03:05:44,280
somewhere else to train. I just packed my bags like one day and I just left and I drove all the

2254
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:48,920
way to Colorado Springs, checked myself into the Colorado Springs Olympic training center

2255
03:05:48,920 --> 03:05:55,080
and began training. So the Olympic team moved from Colorado Springs to Salt Lake city in 2007

2256
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:59,160
to train. So the speed skaters were no longer in Colorado Springs, the train center. So when I

2257
03:05:59,160 --> 03:06:04,520
arrived back there in 2009, I was the only guy there. Everyone else was off training in, in,

2258
03:06:04,520 --> 03:06:09,080
in Utah or wherever else. And I brought my bike and I basically set up a little training plan. I

2259
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:14,600
just trained solo for this is like February, March of 09. Yeah, this is like February, March, April,

2260
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:21,080
May. I think I first saw the team again, like the end of May. And I did, I spent that entire time

2261
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:25,880
and like essentially complete solitude, just training by myself. And I just, you know, I,

2262
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:29,800
you know, I just like anything else. Like you analyze the situation. What are the goals? What

2263
03:06:29,800 --> 03:06:33,800
are you trying to do? What type of training you need? And mine wasn't based solely on sports

2264
03:06:33,800 --> 03:06:37,240
science because I didn't seek that route. I probably should have, but I didn't seek that

2265
03:06:37,240 --> 03:06:42,280
route. I just like, okay, got to improve cadence, got to lower the body weight, maintain strength,

2266
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:47,480
but really have to just get an incredible aerobic base shape like you've never been before. And

2267
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:50,840
that's going to carry you throughout the rest of the year so that you won't have issues with burnout

2268
03:06:50,840 --> 03:06:55,720
or, you know, with any over-training. And do you develop that aerobic base on the bike or on the

2269
03:06:55,720 --> 03:07:00,120
track more? Well, we don't skate in the summer that much. We don't skate till the end of May. So

2270
03:07:00,120 --> 03:07:05,240
that period off. So it's on a bike. It's on a bike. It's on inline skates. It's running.

2271
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:11,240
It's with treadmill. It's with Stairmaster, but it's really spent a lot of time for me. I use the

2272
03:07:11,240 --> 03:07:16,360
Manitou incline in Colorado Springs, which is like the scar on the roads, one mile of cog railroad

2273
03:07:16,360 --> 03:07:22,280
steps that go up. And that was my, that was my sanctuary. Like I lived on that thing so many

2274
03:07:22,280 --> 03:07:27,320
times a week. I used to go up it with weight vests and jumps and you know, you can't beat that thing.

2275
03:07:27,400 --> 03:07:30,520
It's just one of those elements where you just get a little bit faster at it and you get easier

2276
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:34,760
to compensate, but you hurt just the same no matter how fast or slow you go. And so it's the

2277
03:07:34,760 --> 03:07:42,360
fastest time you could make it up that mine was like 1736 or 1738, which is fast. And obviously

2278
03:07:42,360 --> 03:07:46,360
lots of athletes do this, right? It's not just the skaters. Yeah. A lot of athletes, I would say

2279
03:07:46,360 --> 03:07:52,040
the average time is probably 22, 24 between there. And that 17 and a half minutes was not with the

2280
03:07:52,040 --> 03:07:56,760
40 pound weight vest. I assume. No, no, no, it was clean. I needed to go back to that space again

2281
03:07:56,760 --> 03:08:02,600
of like, this is where I started. How much of that training do you think was for your brain versus

2282
03:08:02,600 --> 03:08:08,040
your body? 90%, 95%. I was probably doing everything wrong to be completely honest with you.

2283
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:11,400
There's no reason why I should be going for a three hour bike ride. My races last no more than

2284
03:08:11,400 --> 03:08:14,920
two and a half minutes. And of those two and a half minutes, I'm probably only really skating

2285
03:08:14,920 --> 03:08:19,400
for a minute and a half, three and a half hour bike rides going up and down. Like the canyons,

2286
03:08:19,400 --> 03:08:23,560
they're important. Maybe you go a couple of those rides, but you don't need that. I should be doing

2287
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:29,800
specified interval training according to the time that's under duration. And you can extend that,

2288
03:08:29,800 --> 03:08:37,160
but I shouldn't be spinning my wheels for hours at a time. But what did I gain? A mental perspective

2289
03:08:37,160 --> 03:08:44,120
and a honed focus and a resiliency and the feeling that I was reinventing myself was really important

2290
03:08:44,120 --> 03:08:48,440
to me psychologically. So I would walk on the ice differently. I would walk into the ice rink

2291
03:08:48,440 --> 03:08:53,000
differently. I would project a different type of energy upon my opponents and other skaters. And my

2292
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:58,360
conference level would be higher. So that's what I went after. And it wasn't until I came back to

2293
03:08:58,360 --> 03:09:04,280
Salt Lake City and invited John Schaeffer back into my home until he said, look, no more of these two

2294
03:09:04,280 --> 03:09:09,400
hour runs. Like what are you doing? This is like so 1960, like you're wasting your time and you're

2295
03:09:09,400 --> 03:09:13,880
actually training the sprint out of your body, which is your biggest strength. And then I kind

2296
03:09:13,880 --> 03:09:18,440
of explained to him my goals. And we began that journey towards shedding all that weight and it

2297
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:24,840
was excruciating. And so how the story ends is arrive in Vancouver, BC, 2010. And going into

2298
03:09:24,840 --> 03:09:30,520
the Olympic trials, had you gotten back in enough shape that most people felt like you'd make the

2299
03:09:30,520 --> 03:09:33,960
team? Yeah, everyone knew I'd make the team. It wouldn't be as dominant as I normally would be,

2300
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:37,800
but for sure I'd make the team. So that's a big improvement over where you were at the worlds

2301
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:41,800
earlier in the year. Yeah, I think so. I think it definitely came a long way. And technically,

2302
03:09:41,880 --> 03:09:46,360
I'd improved a lot and people had seen some big changes in my body. And going into Vancouver,

2303
03:09:46,360 --> 03:09:50,440
you've already figured out like this is your last Olympics. Internally, I didn't tell anybody,

2304
03:09:50,440 --> 03:09:55,640
but internally, I've always wondered what it felt like for multiple Olympians. Like, you know,

2305
03:09:55,640 --> 03:10:02,760
when Phelps rolled into Rio, how bittersweet it is in a way, because they, I don't know, like,

2306
03:10:02,760 --> 03:10:08,840
do they appreciate it more then or the first time? Because you'd think, well, the first taste of this

2307
03:10:08,840 --> 03:10:13,320
is the greatest, but perhaps in some way, like I'll give you another example. It's totally unrelated.

2308
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:18,040
Like I have three kids, right? And you've met them all. And I remember when the first one's

2309
03:10:18,040 --> 03:10:22,520
born, I'm thinking this is the greatest thing in the world. And now our third one, you kind of know,

2310
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:28,760
it's your last one. In some ways, I think I'm actually enjoying it even more. Like changing

2311
03:10:28,760 --> 03:10:33,000
the diaper is like, you know what, there's going to be a day when I don't get to do this anymore.

2312
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:38,440
And so did you have that sort of feeling when you walked into the opening ceremony? One, you're

2313
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:41,640
being probably looked at now as a leader of the team, right? You're certainly one of the

2314
03:10:42,280 --> 03:10:46,120
leaders of the team, just from a maturity standpoint and experience standpoint.

2315
03:10:46,840 --> 03:10:52,120
And you also know inside, like, Hey, I don't get to put this uniform on and walk into this opening

2316
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:57,080
ceremony again. This is really the last hurrah for this chapter of my life. It's an absolute

2317
03:10:57,080 --> 03:11:02,840
greater sense of appreciation for what you're doing. And also that you know that this is, this is it.

2318
03:11:03,720 --> 03:11:09,320
And I'm older, more mature, I can appreciate the process that I've been through. I've got scars.

2319
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:15,880
I've got wins and losses. Mentally, you've gone through a lot, you spend a lot of time alone. So

2320
03:11:15,880 --> 03:11:20,040
you've battled your own internal insecurities and demons and self doubts. And now you're at a place

2321
03:11:20,040 --> 03:11:25,720
where you feel like you've you've experienced a lot. So to me, the last games was the best,

2322
03:11:25,720 --> 03:11:30,120
for sure. When the first Olympics was incredible, never take it away. But I was so young,

2323
03:11:30,120 --> 03:11:34,280
difficult to absorb that type of information at that rate of speed, which you've never had

2324
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:39,320
access to before. 2006, different environment, different games, been through it one time,

2325
03:11:39,320 --> 03:11:42,600
understand it. I know how to do this. I know how to handle the pressure. I know what the sounds are

2326
03:11:42,600 --> 03:11:49,880
like, go through the process. The last one, you go walk into the arena, you hear the sounds and it

2327
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:56,200
sounds awesome. Just you have a greater sense of appreciation. And also, you're just really focused

2328
03:11:56,200 --> 03:12:01,800
on just trying to be your absolute best. So it's not like you're there to experience the moment,

2329
03:12:01,800 --> 03:12:06,040
because you just don't have time to write your you're there for a specific task and a goal. And

2330
03:12:06,040 --> 03:12:11,640
unfortunately, that detracts away from your time to be present and experience the Olympic games for

2331
03:12:11,640 --> 03:12:16,840
what we see them as it's amazing production of the world coming together to compete. We go there

2332
03:12:16,840 --> 03:12:22,600
and it's just like I'm ice rink Olympic Village, ice rink Olympic Village, ice rink Olympic Village,

2333
03:12:22,600 --> 03:12:27,400
rest, recovery, massage, sharpen skates, game time. That's a recipe right there.

2334
03:12:27,400 --> 03:12:33,080
Yeah. In many ways, you do as a spectator even feel bad for the favorites because it's a totally

2335
03:12:33,080 --> 03:12:37,960
different experience in swimming, for example, like usually the meat kicks off with the 400 IM.

2336
03:12:37,960 --> 03:12:41,640
And so if you're a favorite to win the 400 IM, I'm not even sure if you're showing up to the

2337
03:12:41,640 --> 03:12:46,200
opening ceremonies. You're not. You're absolutely not. Yeah. I mean, it's like, whereas if you're

2338
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:49,960
not a favorite, if you're like not even going to make it out of the first heat, you're going to go

2339
03:12:50,040 --> 03:12:53,720
to the opening ceremonies because that is part of like, that is the experience, right?

2340
03:12:53,720 --> 03:12:55,560
You're probably going to open ceremonies. You're probably going to have a drink.

2341
03:12:55,560 --> 03:13:00,920
Yeah. So it's important to keep in mind, like the sacrifice that has to be made if you really want

2342
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:05,720
to win using that very specific example. It's a moment in time, right? So as much as you want to

2343
03:13:05,720 --> 03:13:10,520
have fun and go talk to their athletes and mingle with the different cultures and community,

2344
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:17,640
you've trained your entire life for these two weeks and you are not going to allow one slip up

2345
03:13:17,640 --> 03:13:22,680
to detract away from that in these two weeks. And it's funny because when you're four years

2346
03:13:22,680 --> 03:13:29,880
away from a game, it's like when it's 2006, oh man, I'm four years away. This is going to take forever.

2347
03:13:29,880 --> 03:13:33,960
You know, like this is, I know I hear when it says it's going to be here before I know it.

2348
03:13:33,960 --> 03:13:37,480
And then two weeks from those games, you're like, man, I wish I had another year of training.

2349
03:13:38,040 --> 03:13:42,360
You're not saying that in 2006, you know, you're wishing like the games were in a year or two.

2350
03:13:42,360 --> 03:13:47,560
And so it's a different perspective, but I arrived and I hit my goal set in terms of my weight and my

2351
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:52,920
cadence. And the first check mark for me was when I got on the ice in Vancouver and the Chinese

2352
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:56,360
coaches are there, the Canadian coaches are there, the Russian coaches are there. All the coaches from

2353
03:13:56,360 --> 03:13:59,960
the different teams are there and they're videotaping our practice as they are. Everyone else's

2354
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:04,600
practice. Cause the first look at seeing what shape you're in, did he change anything since the last

2355
03:14:04,600 --> 03:14:09,080
world cup? Is your body weight different? Are your equipment different? What are you doing differently?

2356
03:14:10,200 --> 03:14:14,120
And the first thing that we heard via the chatter that was going on was like,

2357
03:14:14,120 --> 03:14:19,400
we don't even recognize Apollo. This guy we trained to beat. He didn't show up. We got a new

2358
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:24,280
guy, a new guy, new guy with a new cadence, a new rhythm, a new style of training, a new style of,

2359
03:14:24,280 --> 03:14:28,280
of racing, a new tech. Everything was different. And that's exactly what we wanted to do. And

2360
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:32,920
I had an incredible team to help support that. Not only my strength coach, John Taver, but the rest

2361
03:14:32,920 --> 03:14:35,880
of the Olympic team and my teammates too, we're a huge part of that, right? Cause we trained every

2362
03:14:35,880 --> 03:14:40,760
single day together and it's a really, really powerful feeling to be able to show up. And

2363
03:14:40,760 --> 03:14:47,480
like to me, that was the win. Actually it was before I ever raced. I was like, man, like I went

2364
03:14:47,480 --> 03:14:53,320
through this. I took a huge gamble and I wasn't sure if it was going to work. I think it did.

2365
03:14:53,320 --> 03:14:57,560
I feel like it did. Everyone else is saying like it did. My coaches are beyond happy and they can't

2366
03:14:57,560 --> 03:15:01,800
believe what we just accomplished. And I haven't raced the race yet. That's a very powerful feeling

2367
03:15:01,800 --> 03:15:06,040
to go into your first race with. And then from there, it's like, look, I've done the work.

2368
03:15:06,040 --> 03:15:11,000
There's nothing more I could have done. I wouldn't change anything. And it's time to just

2369
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:15,000
focus on strategy and compete. And then I ended up winning another three metal at those games

2370
03:15:15,640 --> 03:15:20,600
and retiring with eight medals. Were you sad or happy at the closing ceremonies? Was that?

2371
03:15:20,600 --> 03:15:26,120
It was both. I was both sad and happy. I couldn't believe that my, my life had turned into this

2372
03:15:26,120 --> 03:15:31,320
direction. I couldn't believe that I'd spent this much time dedicated towards a sport. I couldn't

2373
03:15:31,320 --> 03:15:36,920
believe the amount of press and interest that we were getting from a crazy sport, like short track

2374
03:15:36,920 --> 03:15:42,280
speed skating and just feeling grateful. And then also kind of promising myself to like, Hey, like

2375
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:47,800
any opportunity that comes your way, you are going to say yes, no matter what for the next year.

2376
03:15:48,520 --> 03:15:54,680
And then thus began when I walked off the plane from Vancouver, I like wasn't in one place for

2377
03:15:54,680 --> 03:16:00,760
more than two or three days, just bouncing around from speaking engagement to appearance to meeting

2378
03:16:00,760 --> 03:16:06,120
to sponsor blade of stuff. And it was incredible. Who are your sponsors by the end of the 2010

2379
03:16:06,120 --> 03:16:11,560
Olympics? Who were your main sponsors? I had Alaska airlines. We had Omega subway was still

2380
03:16:11,560 --> 03:16:17,480
subway was yes that year. Coca-Cola was a sponsor. There's a few others, but those are the major

2381
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:22,360
sponsors. And when did you announce your retirement? I announced our retirement 2012 publicly,

2382
03:16:22,360 --> 03:16:28,520
but I knew, I knew in 2009, this was my last games. It was just one of those things where I,

2383
03:16:28,520 --> 03:16:32,760
I was happy and I was, I really wanted to complete the game. Like I always talk about that,

2384
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:36,280
right? But like, I never wanted to come back. I never wanted to finish my career feeling like

2385
03:16:36,280 --> 03:16:39,880
I was missing something. Like I want, like I had an itch. I wanted, I didn't want to be

2386
03:16:39,880 --> 03:16:44,680
going down the line, working on some new app and be like, man, I think I'm going to come

2387
03:16:44,680 --> 03:16:50,040
up out of retirement. And I had that feeling watching Phelps in 2012 during the London

2388
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:54,120
Olympics. You had that feeling for him or yourself? Myself to wonder like, man,

2389
03:16:54,120 --> 03:16:58,840
I'm still in great shape. I still feel really healthy. I know a lot more about myself,

2390
03:16:58,840 --> 03:17:04,200
nutrition, technique, training than I ever did. I'm pretty sure I can make this team and I'm pretty

2391
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:09,160
sure I can be competitive in the Sochi Olympics in two years. And then so instead of that, I had

2392
03:17:09,160 --> 03:17:14,120
that conversation with myself internally while doing commentary in NBC Olympic games, while

2393
03:17:14,120 --> 03:17:18,200
interviewing Phelps at his first press conference and talking to him about the pressures of being

2394
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:22,440
so successful. How does he maintain, you know, like his sense of in 2012 was a very difficult

2395
03:17:22,440 --> 03:17:26,680
Olympics for Michael. I mean, I don't know him of course, but I just, I know enough about swimming

2396
03:17:26,680 --> 03:17:29,720
to be able to watch and read between the lines, but he went through, he's going through a lot.

2397
03:17:29,720 --> 03:17:34,120
There's only two events he entered in the Olympics where he didn't win a medal. The first was that

2398
03:17:34,120 --> 03:17:41,000
fifth place finish in the 200 fly as a 15 year old boy in 2000 in Sydney. But what a lot of people

2399
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:47,240
forget is he finished fourth in the 400 IM, his signature event in London. And that's a race that

2400
03:17:47,240 --> 03:17:54,120
if I recall, I mean, at the time, Lochte was probably the best 400 IM in the world, but Michael

2401
03:17:54,120 --> 03:17:59,320
had done really well in the trials and basically touched out another swimmer that most people

2402
03:17:59,320 --> 03:18:05,160
thought was going to get that spot, but then kind of faded at the back of the 400 IM. Didn't look

2403
03:18:05,160 --> 03:18:11,000
like himself. No, didn't at all. And I've always thought it was sort of inside baseball minutia.

2404
03:18:11,720 --> 03:18:16,760
If I were to say like as a swim fan, what were the greatest Phelps performances of all time?

2405
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:25,240
I'll tell you what is number one, his anchoring the four by 100 relay right after his abysmal

2406
03:18:25,240 --> 03:18:31,080
performance. And I use abysmal in quotes, but for Phelps, his abysmal performance in the 400 IM.

2407
03:18:31,080 --> 03:18:35,880
And I remember watching that race thinking, Oh my God, this could shatter his confidence for the

2408
03:18:35,880 --> 03:18:43,240
rest of the meet. And then he shows up in the next race, the four by 100 free relay and crushes

2409
03:18:43,880 --> 03:18:49,960
the anchor, crushes the lead off leg. There's a backstory to what happened in the anchor of that.

2410
03:18:50,600 --> 03:18:54,760
And they didn't end up winning the gold, but that was one of his most remarkable performances.

2411
03:18:54,760 --> 03:18:58,040
But overall, that Olympics was sort of sad for me to watch Phelps because I felt like,

2412
03:18:58,760 --> 03:19:03,880
God, like he's not the same swimmer he was. He got touched in the 200 fly and all these other

2413
03:19:03,880 --> 03:19:10,360
things. So what was that like for you both talking to him about it, but also just now thinking,

2414
03:19:10,440 --> 03:19:15,400
wait a minute, should I be doing this again? You're going through this process of what you didn't

2415
03:19:15,400 --> 03:19:19,000
want to do. I didn't want to do that. And I was having that conversation and then, you know,

2416
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:23,160
I had some friends who like, they always thought that I retired too early. They were like,

2417
03:19:24,040 --> 03:19:28,040
man, you, you still got another four years. Cause you were what, 29 at this point.

2418
03:19:28,040 --> 03:19:35,240
That's 28. Yeah. I was young by the way, looking at Michael and seeing him by the way, in that race,

2419
03:19:35,240 --> 03:19:42,840
directed anger and rage is very powerful. And Michael swims very well when he's angry,

2420
03:19:43,480 --> 03:19:48,680
very well. And he needs to have. So you saw that between the 400 IM and the four by one.

2421
03:19:48,680 --> 03:19:51,880
Cause I was very similar. I needed to have, like if I was winning too often,

2422
03:19:52,840 --> 03:19:57,480
like I needed to throw in a little self-sabotage, little monkey wrench in there to lose a race and

2423
03:19:57,480 --> 03:20:03,240
then get that feeling of losing. And like, Oh, I do. I forgot what that tasted like.

2424
03:20:03,240 --> 03:20:08,760
I think Michael won so easy for so long. You know, like it's difficult to push yourself when

2425
03:20:08,760 --> 03:20:15,320
no one else is. It's only you out there and you can win if you're 70%. Right? So, and he's so

2426
03:20:15,320 --> 03:20:18,600
incredibly talented. It's that that's what I saw and maybe that's wrong. That's my view.

2427
03:20:19,240 --> 03:20:23,240
And so when I was watching that and I said, you know, I'm not going to make a decision here.

2428
03:20:23,240 --> 03:20:28,040
So I came back home. I went to that same place, Mo clips in iron Springs resort. And I said,

2429
03:20:28,040 --> 03:20:31,320
I'm going to really think about this and make a real decision on whether I want to do. And I said,

2430
03:20:31,320 --> 03:20:36,200
you know what? I'm not going to go back. I'm going to continue on this path of trying to

2431
03:20:36,200 --> 03:20:44,040
become an entrepreneur and trying to learn and explore and grow as a human. And that's what I'm

2432
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:50,840
going to commit to. And I'm not going to listen to this short sighted wants of wanting to relive

2433
03:20:50,840 --> 03:20:54,280
in those Olympic moments again, because I think a lot of that's what it comes from is like, you

2434
03:20:54,280 --> 03:20:58,040
know, two years out from the games, although I'm there, I'm on the other side of the lens for the

2435
03:20:58,040 --> 03:21:04,920
first time ever. And it's a different feeling. And I want to be the guy on the start line in

2436
03:21:04,920 --> 03:21:10,120
that fourth and fifth lane getting ready to go. I want to be one of the favorites to win this race.

2437
03:21:10,120 --> 03:21:15,720
And I want that pressure. I want that moment of, okay, the curtains open. It's do or die. Like you

2438
03:21:15,720 --> 03:21:20,200
either perform or you don't. The paper is never going to lie at the end of the day. And you don't

2439
03:21:20,200 --> 03:21:24,520
get that anymore. You do if you have a different perspective in terms of business and opportunities,

2440
03:21:24,520 --> 03:21:28,840
but as an athlete, it feels different. It doesn't matter how, which way you chop it up. So I'm glad

2441
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:32,600
I made the right decision. I decided not to go back to the sport and I was going to pursue

2442
03:21:32,600 --> 03:21:36,680
different opportunities and different, different things in my life. And that was the decision I

2443
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:41,960
made. And I'm still happy about doing that. God, it's such an amazing journey because, you know,

2444
03:21:41,960 --> 03:21:47,560
I've known quite a bit about you before we spoke today, but I didn't realize, I think all of the

2445
03:21:47,560 --> 03:21:52,280
internal struggle, I think it's just so easy to kind of look at athletes and look at the ones who

2446
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:56,680
have done so well and assume that it was always clear in their mind that they were going to win

2447
03:21:56,680 --> 03:22:01,480
and they just executed. And you don't realize the best athletes are still humans, which means they

2448
03:22:01,480 --> 03:22:06,520
still come with all the doubts that the rest of us have and the, the self loathing and the shame or

2449
03:22:06,520 --> 03:22:11,880
the, in some ways, perhaps even perverse incentives. You know, I can't help but hear your story and

2450
03:22:11,880 --> 03:22:17,720
wonder how much of this was sort of you needing to prove yourself to someone to something from the

2451
03:22:17,800 --> 03:22:22,280
moment we talked about, you know, your mom not being there. I've always wondered is like,

2452
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:27,720
is there something about you wanting to demonstrate to her like, Hey, I'm worth it. Like I was, you

2453
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:32,520
know, I was an amazing kid. And that may be too obvious a statement, right? Maybe that, maybe that

2454
03:22:32,520 --> 03:22:36,520
never even factored into any of this stuff subconsciously, but you were a very driven

2455
03:22:36,520 --> 03:22:41,240
kid from the beginning. I described these are like missiles without guidance systems.

2456
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:45,720
Those are still good things to have. Like it's great to be a missile that just needs a guidance

2457
03:22:45,720 --> 03:22:51,160
system. When you think now, I mean, where do you want to be in 10 years? Obviously it's going to be

2458
03:22:51,160 --> 03:22:55,160
mostly business related. I think it, you know, we were talking about it over dinner. Like it's not

2459
03:22:55,160 --> 03:22:59,880
like you necessarily want to go back to coaching skating or something, which is unfortunate.

2460
03:22:59,880 --> 03:23:04,200
Cause I think in many ways you could bring so much to that sport if unfortunate for the sport,

2461
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:08,360
not for you, that you could bring so much knowledge, as you've said, like your knowledge

2462
03:23:08,360 --> 03:23:14,520
of nutrition and training and specificity today is so much beyond what you had at the time. But

2463
03:23:14,600 --> 03:23:18,200
let's just pause it for a moment that you're not going to become the head coach of the US

2464
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:23,800
speed skating team. Where do you want to be in 10 years? 10 years. I want to be, I think first and

2465
03:23:23,800 --> 03:23:30,760
foremost healthy. I want to have increased my personal relationships with my close family and

2466
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:37,000
friends made new ones along the way, increased the amount of experiences that we've shared together.

2467
03:23:37,880 --> 03:23:43,720
Business. I think that I'll always have an urge to be involved in different projects and different

2468
03:23:43,720 --> 03:23:49,880
ideas and whether they succeed or fail. I want to win, but I don't think it's necessarily, that's

2469
03:23:49,880 --> 03:23:54,680
the, the real importance is that I go through those processes and hopefully I learn and apply

2470
03:23:54,680 --> 03:23:59,000
those lessons at the next business opportunity or the next venture or path that I'm doing.

2471
03:24:00,040 --> 03:24:05,240
And I think at least my father told me at one point, he's like, you know, Apollo in your mid

2472
03:24:05,240 --> 03:24:13,320
thirties into your early forties, you will become significantly more self-reflective and inquisitive.

2473
03:24:13,880 --> 03:24:19,240
Of many questions. My father's a very curious person as am I. And so like these questions come

2474
03:24:19,240 --> 03:24:23,880
up in my life that I never asked when I was an athlete, like what is really important? What do I

2475
03:24:23,880 --> 03:24:29,320
really care about? We were talking about like watches and these, these things that have like

2476
03:24:29,320 --> 03:24:35,080
limitless acquisition opportunity. Where does some of these things really play a role in my life in

2477
03:24:35,080 --> 03:24:41,560
the longterm and what do I really need that really makes me happy? And you know, I feel really blessed

2478
03:24:41,560 --> 03:24:46,760
to have had both incredible wins in my life, both on the field of play and off the field of play.

2479
03:24:47,320 --> 03:24:52,600
And also I'm really blessed and have gratitude for the incredible stupid mistakes that I've made

2480
03:24:53,320 --> 03:24:59,080
and losses that I've created both on and off the field of play, either through business and

2481
03:24:59,080 --> 03:25:04,120
relationships and the way that I acted or whatever. I am human. Like anyone else, I've developed

2482
03:25:05,080 --> 03:25:11,000
superhuman like attributes associated with this sport as with anyone would who dedicated a lifetime

2483
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:14,280
of achievement towards something. Maybe they wouldn't be Olympic champion, maybe, but they

2484
03:25:14,280 --> 03:25:19,800
would be very, very good at that thing. And I think that I've just, I've realized that the things that

2485
03:25:19,800 --> 03:25:25,480
make me really happy, this pretty small list. And I feel really, really grateful and happy to have

2486
03:25:25,480 --> 03:25:33,000
recognized that at the age of 36. And I want to continue that and I want to continue to explore.

2487
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:38,840
I want to continue to learn and hopefully I can give back and teach the next generation of kids

2488
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:43,160
and people, whether they want to be an athlete or not. I believe that everyone should be playing

2489
03:25:43,160 --> 03:25:48,440
sports in some capacity regardless of your output or your skillset. I think there's amazing life

2490
03:25:48,440 --> 03:25:52,760
lessons that are learned about how to win, how to lose. And just like I went through about

2491
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:57,080
committing and dedicating and sacrificing and going through the physical pains that you have

2492
03:25:57,080 --> 03:26:00,440
to go through. I think there's really, really powerful things. Even if you just suck and you're

2493
03:26:00,440 --> 03:26:04,280
the last guy picked, it doesn't really matter. There's things that you learn through that process.

2494
03:26:04,280 --> 03:26:08,840
I think they're difficult to teach if you don't have the physical component that's associated.

2495
03:26:08,840 --> 03:26:14,920
And so I think about that often as I, you know, every year that goes by, I'm eight years retired

2496
03:26:14,920 --> 03:26:20,520
now from the sport of short track speed skating. I have no desire to go back. I love going to every

2497
03:26:20,520 --> 03:26:24,840
Olympic games and commentating. I feel at my element, it's a homecoming and reunion for me

2498
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:30,120
to see all my old friends and associates. And I keep tabs in the race. And sometimes I watch

2499
03:26:30,120 --> 03:26:35,240
speed skating tapes until four 30 in the morning and realize like, dude, this doesn't matter anymore.

2500
03:26:35,240 --> 03:26:41,880
Like put it away. And then also just trying to find out and understand more about myself. And

2501
03:26:42,600 --> 03:26:48,760
I think that's really interesting. And so I've gained a lot from just spending time and learning

2502
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:54,760
from people who I don't consider to be, if you asked me younger, when I was younger, experts in

2503
03:26:54,760 --> 03:26:59,240
their field, but now I've had a much more open mind. I've learned a lot from you. I've learned

2504
03:26:59,240 --> 03:27:02,840
a lot from a lot of the people that you are friends with a lot of these different podcasts

2505
03:27:02,840 --> 03:27:07,880
and the advent of technology and access to information is so incredible. You know,

2506
03:27:07,880 --> 03:27:12,600
when I went on my first Olympic games, we didn't have Instagram. Like people were barely using

2507
03:27:13,160 --> 03:27:16,840
their phones in the same degree that we were doing today. So like your access to the internet

2508
03:27:16,840 --> 03:27:21,160
was just to Google a couple of ideas, but that's really the bare minimum. If you're creating

2509
03:27:21,160 --> 03:27:25,960
content, you are one of the very few. Right. And so I just, I think it's really interesting.

2510
03:27:25,960 --> 03:27:29,960
And I've been traveling around the world. Yeah. Your travel schedule is worse than mine. And I

2511
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:35,640
tend to lament my travel schedule, but yours is, I mean, you're really never in the same place

2512
03:27:35,640 --> 03:27:39,880
for more than two or three weeks, right? Yeah. This is probably the longest I've been in one place

2513
03:27:39,880 --> 03:27:45,240
in the US and actually in years. So I'm actually really enjoying it. I've been spending a lot of

2514
03:27:45,240 --> 03:27:51,640
my time, but 80% of my time in Asia and my routine is pretty aggressive. I've always had a fascination

2515
03:27:51,640 --> 03:27:56,280
with Asia in general, both the food, the culture, the people, the diversity, the growth, the

2516
03:27:56,280 --> 03:28:00,600
opportunities that exist there. But you still don't speak Japanese fluently. I know. I still

2517
03:28:00,600 --> 03:28:04,600
don't speak Japanese fluently. I speak more Korean than I do Japanese. And I think this is a

2518
03:28:04,600 --> 03:28:08,200
byproduct of me being honest. I just have to introduce you to Tim Ferriss because he will be

2519
03:28:08,200 --> 03:28:12,840
able to teach you Japanese in a shorter period of time than I'm convinced anybody could teach you.

2520
03:28:12,840 --> 03:28:16,840
That's right. That's right. That's his amazing ability to deconstruct world-class people.

2521
03:28:16,840 --> 03:28:20,840
Japanese was the first language he learned outside of English because he went and spent a year in

2522
03:28:20,920 --> 03:28:26,040
Japan when he was in high school. And I remember one night over dinner, he just explained to me

2523
03:28:26,040 --> 03:28:30,920
how he learned the language. Because if someone says to me, look, I went to live in France for a

2524
03:28:30,920 --> 03:28:36,600
year and I learned French, I'm like, okay, well, I get that. That strikes me as achievable. I get

2525
03:28:36,600 --> 03:28:42,520
to spend a year in Mexico and I learned Spanish. I get that. I can relate to that. But you take a

2526
03:28:42,520 --> 03:28:47,320
white kid out of Long Island and send him to Japan for a year. And he comes back speaking,

2527
03:28:47,880 --> 03:28:54,120
obviously with an accent, but very fluent Japanese. That's incredible. And he can really

2528
03:28:54,120 --> 03:28:58,520
articulate that process. So I don't know. We might have to make that happen.

2529
03:28:59,480 --> 03:29:02,600
Sure would make your dad pretty happy, right? It would make him very happy. My dad still counts

2530
03:29:02,600 --> 03:29:09,240
in his head in Japanese. So as much as he wants to be full on American as he is American, but he

2531
03:29:09,240 --> 03:29:14,200
still can't shake that. Man, I know they're waiting for us inside. So I guess we should

2532
03:29:14,920 --> 03:29:18,600
continue this discussion off the mic, but I want to thank you so much for everything for coming

2533
03:29:18,600 --> 03:29:24,600
down. And also just for being so generous with your insights as well. I know I'm guessing that

2534
03:29:24,600 --> 03:29:27,800
a lot of what we talked about today, you've talked about a thousand times before and it's sort of

2535
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:31,960
like, God, do I have to tell that story all over again? But I think we've also talked about a bunch

2536
03:29:31,960 --> 03:29:35,560
of things that certainly I've never heard before. And maybe that means that for others, there's

2537
03:29:35,560 --> 03:29:41,240
also more of a collection of stuff here. Last question I have for you though is thinking about

2538
03:29:41,320 --> 03:29:45,960
your racing career. You talked a lot at the outside about your father instilling this

2539
03:29:45,960 --> 03:29:50,520
belief in you that there should always be this pursuit of perfection, even if you never get there.

2540
03:29:51,400 --> 03:29:55,880
Is there a race when you look back at your career that was the narrowest gap between what you

2541
03:29:55,880 --> 03:30:01,560
perceive to be the perfect race and your actual outcome? Not necessarily the place you stood on

2542
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:07,160
the podium, but just in terms of your execution. Yeah, there's one race that I publicly talk about

2543
03:30:07,160 --> 03:30:12,520
as being the quasi perfect race. And it was the 500 meters in Torino, Italy. I was not favored to

2544
03:30:12,520 --> 03:30:18,040
win that race. I hadn't won that race all year long. I hadn't won a gold yet in those Olympics.

2545
03:30:18,040 --> 03:30:24,680
It was clear that the South Korean team was just better at those games. And I was in the final and

2546
03:30:24,680 --> 03:30:29,720
I had incredible athletes to skate against. And I knew my only option was to basically,

2547
03:30:30,840 --> 03:30:36,280
we call it jamming the pack where you slow down so that people can't get their momentum to pass you.

2548
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:42,680
So if you can imagine driving a Honda on a freeway and a Ferrari is behind you, imagine the Honda,

2549
03:30:43,560 --> 03:30:49,080
wherever the Ferrari goes, the Honda is in that lane. So it doesn't matter how fast the Ferrari

2550
03:30:49,080 --> 03:30:54,280
is, he can't pass because he's blocked by that car. That was the strategy that I use in that race.

2551
03:30:54,280 --> 03:30:59,800
I wasn't the fastest, I wasn't the best, I wasn't the most likely to win. And I was able to pull off

2552
03:30:59,800 --> 03:31:04,120
a wire to wire win. So that was publicly, that was one of the races that I think that was the

2553
03:31:04,120 --> 03:31:08,680
most perfect for me because everything was on the line. I wanted to win. Everyone had given up on

2554
03:31:08,680 --> 03:31:12,040
my team. They thought that I wasn't going to win that race. My sports psychologist at the time

2555
03:31:12,600 --> 03:31:16,840
basically said, Apollo, this is your second Olympic game. It's amazing what you've gone through

2556
03:31:16,840 --> 03:31:20,200
crazy that you came back and you won another couple of medals. You should be really proud of yourself.

2557
03:31:20,200 --> 03:31:24,280
And I took that as like, are you giving up on me, man? There's only one more race left. And so

2558
03:31:24,840 --> 03:31:29,080
it was personally very, very powerful and visceral. And then I've had a couple of other races where

2559
03:31:29,880 --> 03:31:35,960
just execution wise, it was so perfect. Just the pass being in that flow state,

2560
03:31:35,960 --> 03:31:42,440
everything felt very automatic and easy. It slowed down the minute and a half long race felt like

2561
03:31:42,440 --> 03:31:48,120
five minutes. I felt like I produced zero lactic acid in my body. And it felt like I just was

2562
03:31:48,120 --> 03:31:52,680
simply significantly faster than everybody else. I felt like Neo from the matrix. And I don't say

2563
03:31:52,760 --> 03:31:59,160
that with any exaggeration, it just felt so incredibly easy to maneuver and dance on my

2564
03:31:59,160 --> 03:32:05,560
skates and pass that I was like the puppet master. And those are the feelings that I think we,

2565
03:32:06,440 --> 03:32:12,760
all of us are addicted to, whether you're a writer, whether you're a doctor, whether you are a singer,

2566
03:32:12,760 --> 03:32:20,440
you have that one glimpse of being in a true state of flow. And it's so difficult to replicate. And

2567
03:32:20,440 --> 03:32:27,800
you spend years, years searching for that one time and you do everything possible. You go back

2568
03:32:27,800 --> 03:32:31,560
and eat truck. What did I eat that day? Well, I had three grapes in the morning. Well, you know,

2569
03:32:31,560 --> 03:32:35,560
what's going to happen for the next two years. I got three grapes and they're all green for the

2570
03:32:35,560 --> 03:32:39,720
rest of my life. Right. You just try to replicate because you don't know what changed. And I'm not

2571
03:32:39,720 --> 03:32:47,080
sure we can, we can really identify what that is. But those moments are the ones that I crave. And

2572
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:50,520
I get into those moments no longer in sports. Sometimes I get it to where I'm in the gym,

2573
03:32:50,520 --> 03:32:54,600
when I'm alone, that's my sanctuary. But in conversation, like our conversation,

2574
03:32:54,600 --> 03:33:00,920
three and a half hours went by earlier and I had no idea because I was so transported into that

2575
03:33:00,920 --> 03:33:06,600
moment. And to me, that feels perfect because you're present, you're here, the quality of time

2576
03:33:06,600 --> 03:33:11,080
is being spent. And you know, hopefully people at home didn't fall asleep listening to my crazy

2577
03:33:11,080 --> 03:33:15,720
speed skating stars. I'm sure they didn't. I'm going to get you into race car driving because

2578
03:33:16,680 --> 03:33:22,440
that is another example of where this flow thing happens. So your lap time on the track is like,

2579
03:33:22,440 --> 03:33:25,560
you'll, you'll focus on that. I mean, in many ways to me, driving a race car is basically

2580
03:33:25,560 --> 03:33:31,800
just a bunch of time trials. And I know it sounds like a cliche, but my absolute fastest laps in any

2581
03:33:31,800 --> 03:33:40,120
car on any lap never feel that fast. Yes. That is the most amazing feeling. Usually when I set a lap

2582
03:33:40,120 --> 03:33:44,120
record, which is just meaning my lap record, like I'm never going to be the guy that sets the actual

2583
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:50,440
lap record, but my lap records are always after the fact, I just noticed it. I'm like, wait, holy,

2584
03:33:50,440 --> 03:33:57,800
you took like five tenths off your fastest time ever. And that felt effortless. That really is a

2585
03:33:57,800 --> 03:34:02,920
beautiful feeling, isn't it? It's an amazing. And you're right. It is so addictive. And I think

2586
03:34:02,920 --> 03:34:07,960
that's part of why competitive sports have been displaced by, you know, things that I do,

2587
03:34:07,960 --> 03:34:11,160
not necessarily competitively, but just came about to live with myself, like, you know,

2588
03:34:11,160 --> 03:34:15,240
archery and race car driving and these things, because you're waiting for that day when it's

2589
03:34:15,240 --> 03:34:21,400
like, oh my God, you did 12 out of 12 shots all bullseye. How did that happen? That's why people

2590
03:34:21,400 --> 03:34:25,560
run. It's why people do Ironman and some people do triathlon. That's why people do everything.

2591
03:34:26,280 --> 03:34:32,280
And I'm convinced that you have to care enough about the outcome for you to get in that state.

2592
03:34:32,280 --> 03:34:38,360
There has to be some form of consequence, maybe not physical, maybe not danger, but psychologically

2593
03:34:38,360 --> 03:34:42,360
to impact you to almost force yourself into that realm. That's why I think athletes always

2594
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:46,360
time and time getting in that flow state more than anyone else, as with the military and people

2595
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:51,000
in the service, because they're in real true flow state because they will die if they're not.

2596
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:55,320
But I think that there's a lot to be said there. And I think that we as human beings take that for

2597
03:34:55,320 --> 03:34:59,640
granted. I think athletes a lot of times take that for granted and trying to achieve that flow state

2598
03:34:59,640 --> 03:35:03,960
of maintaining that mental consistency. And that's what I was seeking for all those years.

2599
03:35:03,960 --> 03:35:07,880
That's why I read all those books about sports, psychology and the brain and human behavior and

2600
03:35:07,960 --> 03:35:11,640
trying to understand myself and others. And it's a beautiful thing. Yeah.

2601
03:35:11,640 --> 03:35:14,040
So where can people find you on social media?

2602
03:35:14,040 --> 03:35:20,120
Social, I'm at Apollo Ono on Twitter. My Instagram is there for pictures, but I'm not as active as

2603
03:35:20,120 --> 03:35:22,600
I'd like to be. And it's something that I would like to restart.

2604
03:35:22,600 --> 03:35:24,680
And what's your handle on Instagram? Is it the same?

2605
03:35:24,680 --> 03:35:25,880
It's the same at Apollo Ono.

2606
03:35:25,880 --> 03:35:30,120
Any books that you recommend that you've, I know you've written a couple, any of those that you

2607
03:35:30,120 --> 03:35:33,960
think people ought to follow up on based on what we've talked about today, because I know you have

2608
03:35:34,040 --> 03:35:39,320
one called No Regrets, which basically describes kind of this ethos going into the 2010 games.

2609
03:35:39,320 --> 03:35:44,120
Yeah. I mean, my book of, it was called Zero Regrets. I wrote that right after Olympic games.

2610
03:35:45,240 --> 03:35:46,840
I had an amazing experience. Zero Regrets.

2611
03:35:46,840 --> 03:35:47,160
Yes. Zero Regrets.

2612
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:48,120
I said no regrets.

2613
03:35:48,120 --> 03:35:52,600
But it's kind of like a snippet into my life. And also you got to remember I was in that mind frame

2614
03:35:52,600 --> 03:35:56,920
of really just post-Olympic games without all these other experiences involved to be able to

2615
03:35:56,920 --> 03:36:02,120
really think back objectively and think and remember and really understand what was happening

2616
03:36:02,120 --> 03:36:07,000
at the time. But that was one of the books that I had written with a ghost writer. When I say I

2617
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:11,080
had written, I didn't actually write the book. I wish I was a great writer and had that talent.

2618
03:36:11,080 --> 03:36:16,040
My writing skills are subpar, but I really enjoy reading and I really enjoy learning.

2619
03:36:16,040 --> 03:36:22,120
And so I've, I mean, look, I've invested, I've spent time into businesses and deals and things

2620
03:36:22,120 --> 03:36:27,480
that are so far away from sports that would really blow people's minds. And it's because I just

2621
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:32,040
fascinated, right? I'm a curious learner and it's been amazing opening the next chapter of the life

2622
03:36:32,040 --> 03:36:33,400
and seeing where life takes me.

2623
03:36:33,400 --> 03:36:39,640
Well, it's amazing to know that your athletic career spanned, what, 12 years basically?

2624
03:36:39,640 --> 03:36:45,000
Your professional career, your career as a father, whatever else you go on to do is going to span

2625
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:49,160
multiples of that. So in many ways, the best is yet to come, right?

2626
03:36:49,160 --> 03:36:49,800
I believe so.

2627
03:36:49,800 --> 03:36:51,080
I hope that's true for all of us.

2628
03:36:51,080 --> 03:36:51,720
I think so.

2629
03:36:51,720 --> 03:36:53,480
All right, man. Thanks again. It's been awesome.

2630
03:36:53,480 --> 03:36:54,360
Thank you. Thanks, Peter.

2631
03:36:54,680 --> 03:36:55,160
