00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:14,920
Hey, Pat. Thanks so much for sitting down with me today. I've been wanting to sit down with you

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,080
for quite some time. And I know we've been rescheduled and rescheduled on several occasions,

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,640
and between one thing or another, it took a while, but I am pretty confident it's going to be worth

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,080
the wait. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. I'm very happy to be here. That's something that I have

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,280
a lot of pleasure talking about oral health with MDs. That's my life is trying to do this connection.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,200
So I'm very excited to be here. It's going to be interesting because I don't know much about what

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:54,280
to do. And I think I can bring something new about dentistry and oral health and things,

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,160
which is so important. Yeah. Well, I think it is important, and that's certainly why I've wanted

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,720
to talk about this for a while. And I've been trying to figure out who would be the right person

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,520
to speak with. And you came very highly recommended because I think it's actually a very

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,640
underappreciated part of health. I think it's easy to think of the mouth as this sort of thing. And

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,280
we go to the dentist and hopefully we don't have cavities. And obviously we have a whole bunch of

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,320
cosmetic concerns with the spacing of our teeth and the whiteness of our teeth, et cetera. But

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,920
I'd like to sort of tie that all together. But I want to kind of start with a little bit of your

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,160
background. So obviously you grew up in Brazil, I shouldn't say obviously, but I recognize your

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:40,920
accent and I know your history a little bit. When did you leave Brazil? Well, so it was a long time,

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,720
over 20 years ago. So I had my dental degree in Brazil, and then I had my specialty in

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,960
periodontics and implant dentistry, which is one of the fields that is more connected with

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:04,760
systemic health. I always wanted that. And then I went, I came to US mostly for personal reasons.

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,280
And I want to, and I, and my passion for research because I, that's what I do my whole life. And I

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:20,040
never went back because I got fascinated by the opportunities and everything that I could have

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:28,360
near that. Unfortunately, we don't have the resources in Brazil to do. And I'm still doing

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:37,720
research up to today, many years. So this is a bit off topic, but tomorrow is a very sad anniversary.

25
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:48,360
Do you remember where you were 27 years ago tomorrow? No, remind me. Sunday, May 1st,

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:59,400
1994 was the day I Artan Senna died. Oh, wow. I remember that day really clear. Yeah. Wow.

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,880
Where were you that morning? Were you like everybody watching the race on TV? Yes, yes.

28
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:17,000
I was still there in Brazil. Yeah. Yeah. I have so many Brazilian friends and we're just fortunate.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,040
So many people in our life are Brazilian, our nanny is Brazilian. And I've never met a person

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,880
from Brazil who was, who was, you know, anything over about four or five years old on that day,

31
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:40,680
it's etched in their minds forever. Yeah. Well, yeah. He's a big legend. And I think in a time

32
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,680
that made Brazil so visible for the world and all those things. So everybody was always very proud

33
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,960
of him. Yeah. Well, he's my personal hero. And so for you today, I wore one of my Senna bracelets.

34
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:10,920
So let's start a little bit with tooth anatomy. Unfortunately, I have teeth that my wife refers

35
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,720
to as a Tia teeth, which she jokingly means like I just have genetically horrible teeth. Like I

36
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,520
always seem to be at the dentist for something. Something's always going wrong. So I'd like to

37
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,000
think she's exaggerating a little bit, but, you know, there was a period in my life, unfortunately,

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,440
of maybe 10 years when I didn't go to the dentist once. And I think I'm, I sort of ended up paying

39
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,080
a bit of a price for that going on, which sounds like a stupid thing to say, imagine somebody not

40
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:50,600
going to the dentist for 10 years, but that's sort of what happened for largely much of my medical

41
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,120
school and residency. I just never made the commitment to go still brushed my teeth and did

42
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,920
all that stuff, but obviously wasn't getting regular checkups. And now that I find myself

43
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,040
taking dental care so seriously, the first thing I realized is I had to understand the anatomy,

44
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,320
you know, I had to understand what they meant by pulp and dentin and all of these things.

45
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:22,360
But I think it might make sense to give people a decent overview over the semantics of the tooth

46
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,400
at the individual level, and then sort of at the level of how all of the teeth fit into the mouth.

47
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,960
Can we start with something like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, I think which is strictly

48
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:40,440
important, they all have a reason to be. So you have 32 teeth in your mouth. All of them, of course,

49
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:49,080
they have very specific functions. So if you think about the anatomy of the tooth, you can

50
00:05:49,080 --> 00:06:00,280
think about one unique tooth only, which is the anatomy of you have the root caries. You have,

51
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,080
if you think about between what you see in the oral cavity and what you don't see is like the

52
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,880
crown and the roots, as you see in this figure. And then you have all the parts that surrounded

53
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:21,000
the tooth, they call the supports where the seat sits on top, which is the periodontum, which is

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:32,520
another very complex system as well. So, and then if you think about this whole system together,

55
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:42,360
and you have multiplied that by 32, then you have this amount of very unique set of different,

56
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,480
think about individuals inside your mouth and they all have very specific functions.

57
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,200
Can you pull that slide up again of the individual tooth? I have some questions about that.

58
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,440
Yeah, the first thing that jumps out to me is that there's a vascular supply

59
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,440
that is quite high in the tooth. If I didn't know better, I would assume that when I look

60
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,280
in my mouth and I see that white crown, that everything inside it is a bone. In other words,

61
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:21,160
I would assume the entire tooth is an avascular amorphous thing that serves one purpose and one

62
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,040
purpose alone, which is just to basically break down food. So why is it that this tooth is so

63
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,080
much more complex than just having enamel? Why does it have this dentin and this pulp?

64
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Yeah, it's a very complex structure and it's for a reason. So the enamel, it's minerals,

65
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:47,080
so it's a very hard surface. It's actually the hardest surface on the human body. It's the enamel.

66
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:55,800
And then under the enamel, you have the cement and then the dentin, sorry, the dentin and then

67
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,360
I have the pulp and the cement is everything part of the pitot don't turn. But there's three

68
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:10,920
layers of the tooth itself. The enamel protects the underneath layers. The second one that you see

69
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:18,920
is just like cushion and has a lot of tubules as well. So it's hypersensitive. And then the heart

70
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,680
of the tooth is actually the pulp. So it's high. You see a lot of nerves and they all connect to

71
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,560
the body. That's why you have a lot of tooth pain is one of the most detrimental type of pains that

72
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,920
we have because you have all those nerves connecting everywhere. And then you have the

73
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:41,880
bone as well. And the ligaments around the roots, they protect, it's that cushion that protects

74
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:49,800
against the impact and it gives you all that biological symbiotic so you can chill and you

75
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:57,160
can function. But why is it that we need a nervous connection to the tooth? Because

76
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,240
I understand that like if you had a dental implant, obviously you've given up the nerve and vascular

77
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,560
supply to the tooth, correct? So we can still carry out the function of breakdown without that or?

78
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Well, so the first signs when you have a tooth loss, right, for example, you start with the decay

79
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,520
and then if decay takes the pulp, then you have to excise the pulp and you can still preserve the

80
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:35,320
boot. So the main thing that we think, the way we want to think in dentistry is that you want to

81
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,920
preserve health as much as you want because you want to preserve function. So you don't want to

82
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,680
extract teeth because teeth, they have a very precise reason because they need to hold this face,

83
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,240
you need to chill. There's just a lot of things that that's part of the mouth. So you need to

84
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,760
have the teeth. So you can do a root canal or if you don't have any more of the crown because you

85
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,040
lost to the decay, you can take it out the crown, you can put some metals and then you can put it

86
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,280
in a trick with your crown. The moment that you lose is infected and you have to extract the whole

87
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,600
tooth, then you need to put the implants on. But not that the implants is better, it will never be

88
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,840
better than your natural function in your teeth because it's a metal and it has many other issues

89
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,960
and we still have periodontitis which is an infection of the implant. It doesn't mean that,

90
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,080
oh, I'm going to take my teeth out and I'm never going to get inflammation, periodontal disease.

91
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,040
It's not true. You still have that. I think my question is more that if you have an implant

92
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,800
and therefore you have a denervated tooth, it seems to still be able to carry out the function

93
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,320
of breaking down food. I think the thing I'm trying to understand is you pointed out something

94
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,960
that unfortunately most people listening to this can relate to, which is dental pain is some of the

95
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:07,640
worst pain in the world. And it speaks to, I think, that highly, highly innervated pulp that

96
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,960
you showed. I'm trying to understand what the function is of having something so highly innervated.

97
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,040
Like for example, our fingers are highly innervated because they serve such an important function.

98
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,280
Our ability to have fine motor control with our fingers is why we have so much innervation here.

99
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:33,560
So why is it that we have so much innervation in a surface beneath this enamel, which as you said,

100
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,840
is the hardest surface in the body? What is the purpose that that innervation serves?

101
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:53,400
That's an interesting question. It's the viral part of the tooth that preserves blood flow and

102
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:05,400
keeps the tooth alive. And it's a connection, now that I'm thinking through, it's how you protect.

103
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,040
So it's a connection with your immune response if you have, let's say, if you have a

104
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,120
caries infection. So probably that's how the body tries to be able to respond and fight against

105
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,000
infection information. So the moment you don't have that anymore, so it's just a dent.

106
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,280
I see. I see. That's a good point. So you're saying-

107
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,240
That's what I think now that we're talking.

108
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:38,120
So maybe it serves as such an early warning indicator as a breach of a barrier, basically,

109
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,720
an important barrier. Okay. That's interesting. I just have to tell you, having been through so many

110
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,760
miserable dental experiences, I've often cursed our evolutionary gods for giving us so much

111
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,480
innervation in that tooth. So you've already started to talk a little bit about the pathology

112
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,440
that can go wrong here. Before we do that, I want to get a little bit more an understanding of the

113
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,320
function. Can you show me again that slide that has all of the teeth and maybe explain-

114
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,720
Yeah, sure.

115
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,960
How different teeth serve a different purpose in the mouth?

116
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:24,440
So technically you have the incisors. So you have four of them in each part of your jaw,

117
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,880
in the maxilla and the mandible. Then you have the canines. There are another four. So the incisors

118
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,920
is mostly in your mouth where you can cut your food in any animal. That's how you bite and how

119
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,200
you separate pieces of fruit. And then you have the canine that is a very strong, that's the

120
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,720
longer root that you have in your mouth that's chewier so you can see animals when they are eating

121
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,640
meat and all of that. You tend to go to the side because it's a very strong anatomy that they have.

122
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,880
And then you have four, we call premolars or bicuspids. So that's where you start to break

123
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:10,120
down the food that you eat to tear them apart. And then the molars, they do the whole

124
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,360
through duration. That's where you have to chew. And when I always talk about chew is because

125
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,280
when the digest process starts in the mouth, so it's very important that people chew their food

126
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,120
and in contact with the saliva and all the nutrients that we have. But it's a completely

127
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,320
different subject talking about saliva, but it's mainly to chew your food, to start the digestive

128
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,720
product so then you can get most of the nutrients out of your food. Now, looking at the lower part

129
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:51,800
of this figure, it seems that the different teeth have different numbers of roots. Is that correct?

130
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,560
Yes, that's correct. So incisors and laterals and cream molars, the one in front,

131
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,400
they have single group. Then if you go to premolars, they will have two and some premolars

132
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:15,240
itself, they might have three or four depending on how big the chew is. So it's a much more complex

133
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:24,280
because they are much more strong and they have to get much more pressure and to function. So they

134
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:33,000
need to have much more sustainability so they can chew and treat our food.

135
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,000
I see. So that actually probably explains another reason why these things are innervated,

136
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:48,760
which is the harder they have to oppose other teeth, so the molars would have the greatest

137
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:57,880
opposition to another tooth. Then they need greater sensory input to understand the relative

138
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,920
spacing and force. Would that be part of the difference as well?

139
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:09,880
As well, you think in your mouth it's like a bridge. It has to be very well balanced. The

140
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,080
occlusion needs to be perfect because then you're going to hurt all your ligaments and cause

141
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,760
inflammation in your mouth. So it's a very elaborated system. If you think about the occlusion,

142
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:31,480
they connect. They have to be very perfect aligned. If you start having issues like your teeth,

143
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,280
they don't have a perfect occlusion. You start losing your vertical occlusion, then you have

144
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,960
a lot of other issues like pain on your face and headaches. There are many other issues that can

145
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,480
happen if you don't have a good function in your mouth.

146
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,080
Okay. By the way, I learned the hard way that I have four roots in my molars, not three,

147
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,200
because I've had two root canals and the first one, they missed one of their roots. They only

148
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,760
went after three roots and I still had endless persistent pain until they figured out I went to

149
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,280
finally then see an endodontist who realized I had a very hidden fourth root. But we'll get to

150
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:21,880
root canals later, my least favorite procedure in the world. So let's talk about what a healthy

151
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,600
mouth looks like. You alluded to saliva. I assume that that plays a very important role in oral

152
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,520
health and I assume it does something beyond lubricating food. Does it play another role?

153
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,120
It's true. So the oral cavity is a very complex system. So if you think that you have teeth,

154
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:53,080
you have the gums, you have the gingido cravutua fluid that is open and allows the bacteria to go

155
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,040
in and out. You have the tongue, which is a completely different texture structure. You

156
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:05,480
have the throat, which is entrance to your body. So all this whole complex system, they need to

157
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:13,880
live in a very organized way. And on top of that, you have the saliva. Saliva is, again, we could

158
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,200
have a completely other podcast just about saliva, but in the context where they preserve health,

159
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,160
because we know today that people with dry mouth, if you have, I treat patients with radiation,

160
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,640
they're going through radiation ecology. We're going to talk, we can talk about that later, but

161
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,720
the moment you dry your mouth for any reason, systemic conditions, medication,

162
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,560
who causes dry mouth, and many of them, the causes or toxicities, your cancer care,

163
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,520
radiation drives mouth. It's a completely shift of the oral microbiome in your mouth

164
00:18:51,480 --> 00:19:00,360
because saliva protects. It's that bio-food that's constant washing and flushing your mouth and

165
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:08,920
maintaining a very omniostasis on the microbiome as well. It prevents GDRs on the

166
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,320
oral microbiome. So this whole complex needs to be balanced on every single aspect that we look.

167
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,520
You need to have the teeth, you need to brush, you need to have a lot of saliva, and you need

168
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:30,680
to eat well. So it's a combination of a lot of factors that makes people say to be in health

169
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,560
when you look at oral health, but the primary is so simple. It's actually oral hygiene.

170
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,040
If you brush your teeth, you're going to be technically, you preserve a little bit more

171
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,760
of health than people who don't. I want to go back to what you said about the dysbiosis and

172
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,720
the microbiome of the mouth. So my recollection is that the mouth actually has a significant amount

173
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:02,760
of anaerobic bacteria. Is that correct? Well, they're both. You have anaerobic, you have

174
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,840
facutative bacteria. They can play both roles because it's so strong, they can change,

175
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:16,360
but we have over 700 different bacteria than these in a perfect symbiotic

176
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:27,480
habitat in our kingdom. And they can live really well with the host without causing disease

177
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,040
if you can maintain the state of health. Because in the past, people think that

178
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,680
what causes disease or disease is this specific bacteria, but it's not true.

179
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,760
We all have all those bacteria in your mouth. It's indigenous to you. It's not that it's from

180
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:56,840
something external. You have that. Their normal habitat is your mouth. But for some reason,

181
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,680
you don't stop rushing or you start taking medication and your mouth becomes dry. You have

182
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:10,200
a health condition that allows inflammation to be more prevalent. All those things might change the

183
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,880
cognitive environment. And that allows some bad bacteria to grow and supersede the good ones.

184
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,440
And then that's what happens with the dysbiotic. So we talk about two things, abundance,

185
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,280
changes in abundance and diversity, which is allowing bad bacteria to flourish and suppress

186
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,240
the good ones that helps us preserving health. So that's mainly what's going on.

187
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,360
Of course, there are the co-polarities.

188
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:48,760
So in an ideal state, directionally, what amount of bacteria are aerobic, anaerobic, and facutative?

189
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,560
What's the approximate distribution in a relatively healthy mouth?

190
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:06,120
It's probably half and a half between aerobic and anaerobic and another maybe 30 to 40 percent of

191
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:15,960
them. They can play both roles. But those, let's say, a clear example, and we can talk about that

192
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,680
in a completely different section, but even children. When I did my studies with the twins,

193
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,200
and then we asked them to stop brushing for two weeks, all the periodontal pathogens,

194
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,200
pitin jubile, chidintrachol for cytos, that we only see in adults with periodontal disease,

195
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,760
in two weeks, they became abundant in their mouth. So they were there that I couldn't see

196
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:49,800
a baseline. The more that they stopped flossing, they became abundant. So they are there, but they

197
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,440
never cause disease unless you have a shift on their own microbiome.

198
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,120
Let's talk about that study. How old were these twins?

199
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,680
So let me go back. It was a long time ago. That's when I first started my research,

200
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:15,000
because I always had an interest in dental care. There were between 12 and maybe 16 years old. I

201
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,320
wanted to have adolescence because they have, that's where they don't like to brush the floss.

202
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:28,360
You know, it's a very hard population to do that. So what we did, we got, so when you do

203
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,920
studies, and I'm going to talk a little bit about the twins. So I understand why we use the twins.

204
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,200
So they're the perfect model to do clinical trials. That's my passion is clinical trials,

205
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:48,120
because they share, especially on that age, the same households, the same, there is no confounders,

206
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,840
right? We don't need to adjust for age. The identity between do they even need to adjust for

207
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,560
gender because they share the same sex and they share 100% of the genes. So when you look at

208
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:06,040
Mona's, I got it and guys are got it twins. The Mona's I got it twins, they share 100% of their

209
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,160
genes. It's almost a perfect clones of each other. Right. And to your point, as adolescents,

210
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,800
they're still in the same house. It would be different if you did this with 30 year old

211
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,960
monozygotic twins, because at least there might be some environmental differences, right?

212
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,360
And the environment takes place and then a lot of no epigenetics might change even mutations.

213
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,400
And then when you look at the dizygotic twins, they're 50, 50, they share 50% of their genes.

214
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:42,200
It's the same as two siblings. So there's two ways that you can do studies with twins. You either

215
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:51,480
get the twin set, and then you do treatment A and B to see response to treatment because they're

216
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:59,880
very similar or the way I like when you want to see traits and how a trait can modify by genetics

217
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:07,800
or environmental factors, you get the same set of twin and you give the same drug medication or

218
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:14,280
treatment. Because then when you look before and after, if you don't see, if you see that the

219
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,960
identical twins, they behave in the same way, you're going to say, well, genetics modulate that trait.

220
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,680
But then if you look at both of them and say they're all over the place, they behave in the same

221
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,920
way as the identical and the fraternal twins, they say, well, here the environment is playing

222
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,520
a big role because genetics are not holding anymore, right? So when we do this flossing in twins,

223
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:46,920
that's how we did the study. We got, we didn't want to give separate treatments for the twins

224
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:53,240
because they're going to the same house. So, and I did very controlled. So for two weeks,

225
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,440
we asked the twins to come every day to the center and I'd have the hygienists and my clinical people

226
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,320
trained and they do brushing and or flossing because they're two groups. One group, we wanted

227
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,520
them just to brush. The other group, we wanted them to brush and floss stitch. And then, so the

228
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,920
hygienists would floss and watch them doing, it was very supervised and controlled. And when they

229
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,360
go home, I asked them to do at night at home. But if you think about, that's a very hard

230
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,400
kungka trial to do because we had to bring the kids every single day with their parents

231
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:39,160
to the center so we could actually watch them doing the intervention. So when we finished the

232
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:47,080
study, what happens that we saw is that the children that stopped brushing the teeth,

233
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:55,960
they, we saw a changeable bleeding, not brushing, sorry, both of them were brushing. The children

234
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:03,160
that did not floss, we saw elevated levels of changeable inflammation, which was represented by

235
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,000
changeable bleeding. We measured changeable bleeding. And what was striking was all those

236
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,320
periodontal bacteria. They just came in abundance. Which ones in particular

237
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:27,640
overexpressed in the non-flossing group? It's the three big guys we call P. gingivalis,

238
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:37,320
T. denticola, A. actinomycin. They're very complicated names, but it's the top bacteria

239
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,760
that causes periodontal disease and change of virus we found in a very young population.

240
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,600
Are those all faculty of anaerobes or any of those?

241
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,760
Yeah, anaerobic species. Most of the bacteria, so caries and periodontal disease,

242
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,800
they're very similar in the way they behave and they respect us. But they can be separated. That

243
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,520
caries is most aerobic species because they live in the presence of the oxygen. So they're free on

244
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:26,660
the oxygen because of the aurocab

245
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,020
to just grow and cause inflammation and to cross, which is the end.

246
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:39,700
Just to be clear, the periodontal pocket is inside the tooth and the gingival

247
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:47,140
pocket is between the gum and the tooth? It's all the same thing. So the way

248
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:55,940
periodontal disease manifests is that first it starts with inflammation around the gums.

249
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:04,180
The way the periodontal works is that it's very serious by the periodontal ligament attaches.

250
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,820
If you were in health, your periodontal ligament is very healthy. It's like a muscle.

251
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:16,660
It's very tied to your tooth. If you stop brushing, which is the primary cause that

252
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,580
your gums get inflamed, you stop flossing or you relapse, you're going to immediately,

253
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:29,620
if you floss, you're going to see some bleeding. That's the initial stage of periodontal disease,

254
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:35,540
but it's highly modifiable. If you have only gingivitis, you can't refer to health.

255
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:42,820
So if you keep going and you continue with the traits of the disease, the ligament

256
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,700
is going to get inflamed and they're going to be attached from the tooth. The bacteria is going to

257
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,900
come in and then that whole process of inflammation, bacteria, and the deterioration of the ligaments,

258
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:04,580
that's where we form the pocket. That formulative harm to the periodontal culminates in bone loss.

259
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,540
So the initial, the acute periodontal disease, you're going to see someone is that they come

260
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:17,220
to your office. If they take radiographs, the gums are still somehow attached to the tooth,

261
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:25,060
very inflamed, it bleeds a lot. You touch it bleeds. But if you go and look at the

262
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:31,940
radiograph, you're going to see a big gap. The bone is all done. And then that's the pocket.

263
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,380
It's when the bone goes down and then if you put a probe, you're going to see three millimeters,

264
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,500
five millimeters, seven millimeters. It keeps going down. Now, how does that relate to the

265
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:50,500
carry? Because the carry typically occurs on the sort of top surface of the tooth typically, correct?

266
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,180
And everything you're describing is often actually below the gum line, yes?

267
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,540
Well, that's the next stage. So once the pocket gets influenced, the chronic periodontal is what

268
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:09,460
happens is that the actual of the gums. So the gums, they're going to recede and they're going

269
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:16,100
to keep going down. So it's very typical that you look, if I look at someone, I know they have

270
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,740
periodontal disease just by looking at their gums because we're going to see the teeth, they become

271
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:27,860
bigger. And then you're going to see the gap that you're going to expose the root. So usually the

272
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:35,300
roots of your teeth, they're not meant to be exposed because once they expose, the bacteria

273
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:41,300
can colonize and you can have root carries as well. So you can add the corona carries, which is just

274
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,060
on the crown of your tooth. But when the root get exposed due to periodontal disease or the forms of

275
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:54,100
trauma, malocclusion and things like that, then you can get carries to take over the root of your teeth as well.

276
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:04,580
So in children, the typical carries that we see are on the occlusive surface, correct?

277
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:15,620
Mostly, but one of the most common carries we call early childhood carries, which is

278
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:23,460
caused by baby bottle, children that breast, not the breastfeeding, but the bottle overnight and

279
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,460
many times a day. So it's mostly on the antineuptive. I don't know if you have a chance to see it,

280
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,820
but they carry the belly very rapid because the milk accumulates in that area and it's extremely

281
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:43,780
painful. It's actually one of the most common, then the disease is the most common

282
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,220
disease worldwide due to that carries. Everybody has dental carries.

283
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,580
Why did you say it doesn't happen with breast milk?

284
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,940
Because the breast milk, we have studies showing that it causes much less decay than

285
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,140
formula because every formula has sugar.

286
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,140
So what is it about sugar? We all grew up knowing that sugar was the worst thing for your teeth.

287
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:18,900
I've never understood or heard a, I don't want to say compelling reason that suggests I don't

288
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,500
believe it. I do believe it empirically, but what is it about sugar? Is it the fructose? Is it the

289
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:34,820
glucose? Is it the combination of them that leads to a rapid overgrowth of the carry causing bacteria?

290
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,180
It's all of them. It's

291
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:48,740
fructose, sucrose, lactose, more complex starch. They are even worse. All the drinks today,

292
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:56,420
they have added sugar, you name it. Everything has sugar, right? But the main mechanism is very

293
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:07,300
simple actually. The cardiogenic bacteria, they love sugar. They metabolize the sugar. It's actually

294
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:15,060
energy for them. Every time that they see it, so the way they have a very, they have the capability

295
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:21,780
of attaching the tooth surface, all this bacteria. So they get together, they stick to each other,

296
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:29,220
and they have the ability to secrete that extra cellular matrix that is like a glue.

297
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,860
We call biofilm, and that attached to the tooth. So every time that you put sugar,

298
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:43,380
they take that sugar, they metabolize that sugar as energy source, and they multiply, and they grow

299
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:50,420
with other foods that we put it on the other cavity as well. But what happens is that when

300
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,340
they might metabolize sugar, they secrete acids, and that acid is the one who destroyed the

301
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:02,260
normal future. So that's the cycle. That suggests that they're metabolizing

302
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,580
sugar anaerobically to produce lactate. If they're increasing the acidity of the environment,

303
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:15,380
presumably hydrogen ion is coming out with lactate, they're doing this not in mitochondria.

304
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,820
They're doing this outside of mitochondria. This is almost like the Warburg effect,

305
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,300
where whether oxygen is present or not, they always choose anaerobic metabolism. Do we know

306
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:36,420
if that's been looked at? Probably yes, but I don't know. I don't remember, Peter.

307
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:44,260
And also, you say sugar, but I just want to be clear. Do these bacteria have a preference for

308
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,900
glucose over fructose? Obviously, sucrose is both. It's an equal mix of them, but I want to get very

309
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:58,500
specific on this point. Is fructose specifically more harmful? Because if that's true, then

310
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:04,100
sucrose would be more damaging than, say, starch, which would just be pure glucose.

311
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:15,220
I think the glucose is the worst, especially when they do syrup, when they intensify and do

312
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:24,660
with higher concentrations of sugar on that. But technically, all of them

313
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:33,300
can be metabolized, even the fructose from fruits and vegetables. They can metabolize that as well.

314
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,580
Do you have a sense of how our species survived before we brushed our teeth?

315
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,660
How they survived?

316
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:53,700
Yeah. I mean, when you think about it today, if after two weeks of twins not flossing their teeth,

317
00:36:53,700 --> 00:37:00,500
never mind not brushing, just two weeks of not flossing, you're able to induce significant

318
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:06,100
periodontal disease where you actually had gingival disease that would induce bleeding

319
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,740
in the gums. Now, let's go back in time 300 years, which our species looked the exact same

320
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,780
as we do 300 years ago. It's not like we're talking Neanderthals, but presumably 300 years

321
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:24,100
ago, we didn't have toothbrushes and dental floss, did we? Do we know what oral care consisted of

322
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,460
300 or 400 years ago?

323
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:34,900
Well, we know that 400 years ago, we see from research that people have

324
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:41,780
don't have toothbrush, they have dental care, it is not new. But if I look at populations

325
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,860
from developing countries, for example, I go to Africa and I do a lot of research there.

326
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:54,740
They have like some plants, they have like a stick that they use and they clean their teeth

327
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:05,460
with that three is a three that they find. So I'm assuming that people just use different devices

328
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,980
to clean their teeth. Because if you think about the removal of flaps is mechanical to brighten it,

329
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,740
you need to just drop the biofilm. What we do with brushing, we're just trying to just drop

330
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,900
that matrix of the biofilm, but they form again. Research shows that you clean, you can have the

331
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:30,820
mouth with zero plaque in two hours, you have them all formed again, they colonize back.

332
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,740
But what we're trying to do with the brushing is just instructing that we don't let that

333
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,580
colonize and be like overwhelmed in the other capacity.

334
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:51,300
Yeah, I just, I mean, I would assume that the food consumed somehow, even though obviously

335
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,900
people hundreds of years ago still consumed glucose and fructose, maybe the form in which

336
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,980
they consumed it was less concentrated and refined, which I suppose we know it was.

337
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:08,260
And so they had less of an insult to the tooth. But every time I've had a bad dental pain,

338
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:14,020
I've said to myself, how would I be functioning right now if this was hundreds of years ago and

339
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:21,540
I didn't have modern medicine with lidocaine and a very good dentist who could take care of this?

340
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:27,220
Like as you, again, I want to go back to this point earlier, it is the single most uncomfortable pain

341
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:36,420
imaginable. It's horrible to have pulpitus or any of these things, you can't function.

342
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,060
Highly preventable.

343
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:47,860
Well, yes. Yeah. We'll certainly get to that. But again, I'm just constantly amazed that our

344
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,740
species would have had to presumably suffer quite a bit until we figured out this ability to clean

345
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:02,980
these things. Because it's counterintuitive, I think. Now it seems obvious, but if you're

346
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,100
sitting in a cave 10,000 years ago, I don't know that it would have been the most obvious thing,

347
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,540
that you need to remove this thin film bilayer on your teeth, right?

348
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:21,220
Yeah. But I think the diet, fibers, everything was very different back there. So they with the

349
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:29,860
modernization and the amount of sugar everywhere that it looked, sometimes you can't even buy

350
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:38,340
anything because everything has sugar. I think it's a big change on the culture and what we eat,

351
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,460
how we do things today, I think is much worse.

352
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,940
So let's talk about the brushing. I once heard somebody say

353
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:52,420
that the toothpaste is far less important than the toothbrush. In other words, you could almost

354
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,180
brush your teeth without toothpaste, but if you did a good enough job just using a wet brush

355
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,220
to brush, you were getting most of the benefit. Is that true?

356
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:12,500
I tend to disagree. I think both are equally important and I'll tell why because the toothpaste

357
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:22,820
is the main source of fluoride. So the fluid protects your teeth and harden the nimbal and

358
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:28,260
protects against cavity, especially in children. It's extremely important that you look at that

359
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,900
exposed to fluoride. If they have high risk of care, there is other sources you can paint,

360
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,620
you can have varnish, you have a bunch of approaches that you can preserve oral health

361
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:50,660
in children just by brushing and fluoride. It's all about education. So in the flossing,

362
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,300
it's a combination. You have to clean in between your teeth, you have to clean the surface of your

363
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:03,300
teeth and I needed to put fluoride. And I'll tell you more. Now on my new clinical trial, I'm

364
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:09,620
actually brushing the oral mucosa to decontaminate against bacteria. So I still think that is another

365
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:15,700
neglected surface of the arachab which is all the oral mucosa, the tongue. Most people don't brush

366
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:22,260
the tongue and there's a lot of bacteria that accumulates in the tongue. So I think you need

367
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,980
to clean every single surface and just the brush itself is not going to do the job.

368
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:34,340
When you say brushing the tongue, is the purpose to remove bacteria or?

369
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:34,820
Yeah.

370
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:41,700
Okay. And what about the rest of the oral mucosa? Do you mean brushing the gums as well?

371
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:51,220
Well, technically, that's not standard of care, right? So the way research has done and proved

372
00:42:52,180 --> 00:43:01,460
that you can maintain optimal oral health just by brushing teeth, by flossing really well and

373
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:09,460
having good nutrition and all those things. Of course, there are phases in your life where,

374
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:15,940
like in the specific case of my population, they're undergoing radiation ecology, they have a lot of

375
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:23,620
ulcers in their mouth and they can drink, they can eat and or they cannot brush their teeth because

376
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:29,140
it's so painful because of all the ulcers. And then there is a whole just the ozy that are

377
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:35,380
pores in the oral cavity because on top of this has radiation and a bunch of things. So on that

378
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:42,660
specific population, they need a more intense oral care program where we clean the period

379
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:50,340
down to, we clean the teeth and we contaminating and brushing the oral mucosa. So it depends on the

380
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:56,820
risks, it depends on the population that we're treating, it depends on their ability to brush.

381
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:07,300
Every oral hygiene program, I think needs to be personalized to the person, to the age, to the

382
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:14,180
risks that they have, if they have dry mouth, if they have different diseases that affect

383
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:21,620
your body. So it's a very, it's a holistic approach that not one regime would fit.

384
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:33,540
Is the importance of flossing the mechanical removal of food particles between the teeth

385
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:41,460
or is it the actual transient irritation of the gum that actually provides the benefit? Because

386
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,420
you can imagine a thought experiment where a person subsided on an all liquid diet, so there

387
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:55,220
would never be food particles that are between the teeth, but where they might still benefit

388
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,980
from flossing or more directly, they might still experience a harm from not flossing.

389
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,540
At least that's my hypothesis, which would suggest that the benefit of flossing

390
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:13,060
is not just the actual removal of the gross large particle, but it's the transient irritation

391
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,700
that's created at the gum surface. Do you have a point of view on that?

392
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:27,460
Yeah, there have been research on that. Some people on the opposite direction that my,

393
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:35,620
if you floss, for example, a mild, someone who is immune compromised, you might see nurses

394
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:39,700
and doctors saying, don't floss. Yeah, what about non-immune compromised people?

395
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:48,020
I don't think that is any harm on flossing. It might give you more resistance to those

396
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:58,420
constant exposure to bacteria, but mainly it's to clean that anaerobic bacteria that is really

397
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,060
hiding in between your teeth. So that's the main function of flossing. And the brushing,

398
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:11,460
if you think about brushing, it also stimulates the gum. The gum is not driven from any other

399
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,220
muscle or in your body because it needs to be really strong and attached around your teeth. So

400
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:25,460
the brushing as well, it helps a lot with that dynamic constant, because it massages

401
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,700
all your gums, your periodontum. And I believe that is a good benefit as well.

402
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:39,300
Is there a benefit or a rationale to flossing before brushing, which for some reason is the

403
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:46,660
way I've always done it. I don't know why. Yes, I love that. Because that's usually how we

404
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,060
recommend. Actually, I asked them, you've brushed your floss and your brush again,

405
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:59,620
if you want to be perfect. Because when you brush, you remove all the biofilm of the bacteria and

406
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:05,540
your surface of the teeth and you need to rinse your mouth well, to just get everything out. And

407
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:11,380
then you floss. But imagine if you floss and then throwing all that bacteria back in the autocavity,

408
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:17,380
that might populate and recolonize again. So that's why I say you just brush your floss.

409
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:24,260
We either rinse your mouth really well after that, or you just quick brush again. That would be the

410
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:31,300
most, the way if you want to be obsessed. And then you need to brush your tongue because bacteria,

411
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,740
even the ones that are flossing and throwing inside their mouth, they might just colonize

412
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,780
the tongue as well. Some people have fissures on their tongue and then allows them to get in.

413
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:52,500
When we do studies and I collect bacteria, for example, swabs from different parts of the mouth,

414
00:47:52,500 --> 00:48:01,300
every study that we do, we collect that. Buckle left, buckle right, tongue, floor of mouth, throat,

415
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:08,100
every surface of your mouth, you find different bacteria. So your tongue has a different

416
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:15,700
colonization from your buckle, from the floor of mouth, from the throat, throat we know colonized

417
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:23,620
by bacteria and virus, the HVV virus. It's highly associated with autopharyngeal cancer. So all those

418
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:33,460
variations, they do different things, right? But you don't recommend also brushing the

419
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:38,820
buckle surfaces or other surfaces if they're also a great source of bacteria?

420
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:45,140
I don't think I can recommend because it's not a standard of care. So everything that you recommend,

421
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:52,900
for example, the trial that I'm doing right now, I'm implementing an oral care that doesn't exist.

422
00:48:53,620 --> 00:49:00,500
So no one tells people, patients who are undergoing radiation treatment that they need to see a

423
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:06,020
periodontist and do a periodontal treatment every week. That's how intense it is. They come, we do,

424
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,100
they hold the bridesman of the periodont, we clean the oral course, we clean the teeth, that doesn't

425
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:16,980
exist. And if you ask a dentist, they're going to say, ah, why I need to do that. And that type of

426
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:24,180
procedure as well is not insured. So if you've got a patient who is undergoing radiation treatment,

427
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,660
they can get speech pathology. They go to see their oncologist, they go to see their nutrition.

428
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:34,820
This is all part of the healthcare system. And this is all they can charge to the insurance or

429
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:43,860
Medicaid, Medicaid. Oral health is not part of that. And I want that to be part of a magically

430
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:48,980
compromised patient that the same way that they need to see a nutrition, they need to see our

431
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:55,380
health specialists, because that's going to help them respond to the cancer treatment. They're not

432
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,300
going to have the burden of infection information in their mouth. And of course, they're going to

433
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,700
perform better. They're going to eat better because if they have ulcers, they're not going to be able

434
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:11,860
to eat. So there's a whole benefit around that. But there is no insurance would pay. And that is

435
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:17,620
not a standard of care procedure. So I'm doing the research. I'm collecting all those biomarkers.

436
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:23,220
And I want to prove the benefit of that. And once I prove the benefit of that, because now I do the

437
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:29,220
clinical trial, I might be able to push and get all the centers and other people to do it. And

438
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:35,460
that might become a standard of care for this specific population. Now, is there evidence that

439
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:44,340
cancer patients, because of two things, their immune compromise through treatment, coupled with

440
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:52,820
the increased susceptibility and the loss of immune barrier in the mouth, are actually at

441
00:50:52,820 --> 00:51:02,020
greater risk of systemic infections that arise from the mouth? Yes, yes. There's a lot of research on

442
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:09,060
that. And that's what I believe as well. And when they're going on top of everything that is going

443
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:16,100
on with them, they have horrible dry mouth. Week two of radiation, they cannot, two or three,

444
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:22,260
they, some patients cannot produce saliva anymore because the radiation damage they salivate grants.

445
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:31,220
And that's changed the whole auto-microbiome allows opportunists, organisms to prevail. So they have

446
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:38,740
a lot of fungal infection because of the issue that they have with dry mouth. And that escalates

447
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:45,380
a lot of local infection and inflammation burden on the oral cavity and affects them systemically,

448
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:50,820
because I don't have data from the trial that I'm doing right now. But the reason I'm doing is that

449
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:59,860
on my small pilot that I did to lead to this large trial that I'm doing now, I saw that main

450
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:06,260
inflammatory markers. I look at saliva, inflammatory markers and microbiome before

451
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:14,980
they started the trial and three months after they completed the last dose of radiation.

452
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:22,180
And then when I look at cytokines, I sampled several cytokines in saliva, most of them,

453
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:29,540
they're completely suppressed on the oral cavity. They're all cancer patients, but the group that I

454
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:35,780
didn't do the periodontal disease, they all had even increased on those. But the ones that I did,

455
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:42,500
this very comprehensive, they all gone suppressed on the negative. So it's clearly showing that

456
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,980
that's something going on systemically on those patients that is just because I'm brushing your

457
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:55,700
teeth. And the way my studying started, that's why I always say that it makes me so happy when

458
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:03,780
I'm discussing oral health with MG, like you, smart that understands a lot about those things,

459
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:11,940
is that I started my life when I was at NYU and I used to work with all the radiation college and

460
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:17,060
all the surgeons that were doing surgeries on the patients. So they had diagnosed the cancer.

461
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:23,940
And because I was doing research, I would go to the OR, collect the samples and take over the

462
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,540
patients throughout the whole research when they're looking for oral cancers and all those things.

463
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,180
And I started looking at those patients' mouth and said, I can't believe that that is not a single

464
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:39,460
doctor who's looking at their mouth. They have horrible oral hygiene. They got the cancer,

465
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:47,780
they're depressed. They start radiation right after surgery, which they already can't brush

466
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:53,700
their teeth because sometimes they lose half of their jaw, they take their tongue. So they

467
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,260
hide their ability data, so they stop brushing and they go into radiation. When they get into

468
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:05,540
radiation, then comes with R2. Radiation also changes the microbiome and they develop horrible

469
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:11,060
ulcers in their mouth and then they become immune compromised. So it's a whole cascade of things

470
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:18,260
that happen in those patients. And then I started, one of them, I came to the oral surgery and I said,

471
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:25,380
do you mind if I start cleaning your patient's mouth? And I said, why do you want to clean?

472
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,660
And I said, well, I know he's going to go into radiation. Let me do a dental cleaning. I can't

473
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:36,500
look at any more the way this. I said, Pat, do it, whatever you want to do it. So I start doing my

474
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,860
cleaning, periodontal disease, and after I treat it, and they were going through radiation.

475
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:49,460
Some of them I'd say, well, I'm going to clean your mouth twice a week. Radiation is usually

476
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:57,300
six to eight weeks. So if I clean your mouth every two weeks, at least you're going to get a baseline

477
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:04,100
middle radiation and end. And others will say, well, if he's not responding really well, I will

478
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:11,460
just start training, say, what can I do to get a good oral help. Others I start every week,

479
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:17,620
and then after I treated like 10 patients, I got a call in my office with the, he was a

480
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:26,500
head, his name is Nico Sanfilippo. He was the head of the head and neck group. And I said,

481
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:32,180
Pat, I never had never talked to him, but he was the referrals from our patients because you have

482
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:39,540
the cancer, you have the surgery or not, and then you're radiation oncologist like a referral. So you

483
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,340
need to find a radiation oncologist that can see your patients. So he called me and said, Pat,

484
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:49,780
can you tell me what you're doing with my patients? And I was like scared because I knew that wasn't

485
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:57,700
like a perfect like stand of care. And then he said, well, I have maybe eight patients that you

486
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:03,380
treated and they don't develop mucocytes. And they're sitting on my waiting area and they're

487
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:09,060
talking to each other. Well, I went to see Pat, Pat is doing that, Pat is doing that. And then

488
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:15,540
he said, can you tell me what you're doing? And I said, Nick, you're gonna laugh, but I'm brushing

489
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:21,300
your teeth. Of course it wasn't that brushing, but it's oral hygiene. And he was going to say,

490
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:29,060
Pat, can you do a pilot? I'm fascinated by that. And then we did, we saw 16 patients, that's the

491
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:35,860
pilot that I submitted and we got the grant. But that was how everything started was him

492
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:43,140
call you and say, what's going on? Now, how in depth was the oral care you delivered to these

493
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:48,260
patients? Is it the type of thing that they could do for themselves if taught, or did it have to be

494
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:55,780
done while they're sitting in a dental chair and by someone who was highly trained? It's a

495
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:03,380
combination. Actually on the current trial, I'm trying both approaches. If I can just give a

496
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:11,220
baseline to me, because if they have a lot of, if someone has a lot of plaque in it for a long

497
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:17,780
period of time and you haven't brushed for six months, for example, the plaque becomes harder

498
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:24,340
and becomes tougher. No one can remove that unless we have a very specific ultrasound that vibrates

499
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,980
an instrumentation. That's what we do every six months when we go and get our dental cleaning.

500
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:35,700
They either scrape your teeth with very sharp instruments or they use the electronic one to

501
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:43,540
disrupt and they get blood. So at a minimum, you have to do once in a dental office. But in my trial,

502
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:49,620
I'm doing both because I don't know which one is better. Nobody ever did before. So one group,

503
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:56,260
I'm doing mechanical debridement as a period dentist. It's the same, even I go sub-gentle.

504
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:05,380
I'm trying to flush every toxins that I have sitting on the oremulcosa inside their gums,

505
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:11,060
on the gums, on the tongue. I brush and cross. It's, there is not a single surface on the other

506
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:18,340
cap that we don't clean. How long does that take? Takes one hour on the chair. Okay. The other group,

507
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:28,180
we give them a dental hygienist come every week to reinforce the importance of brushing,

508
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:35,540
flossing. And she flosses the patient's mouth, tell them how to properly do that. So it's just

509
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:40,500
to blind the study. They both come to the clinic. They didn't have to come because it's just a brush.

510
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,820
But we want to blind so both groups come to the chair and the hygienist does a light cleaning,

511
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:53,300
flossing only and brushing, or she does this holistic, comprehensive approach that I put

512
00:58:53,300 --> 00:59:04,100
together. So, which is something that is striking going on right now on my patients in iron group,

513
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:08,980
they're not the following the disease. Now, just to make sure I understand, how many of these

514
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:17,620
patients are patients with head and neck cancer where they're developing, they're either directly

515
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:23,620
receiving radiation to the mouth or this area, which is resulting in the deterioration of the

516
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:31,780
environment versus patients with other cancers whose chemotherapies are rendering them susceptible

517
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:38,340
due to the mouth sores that are pretty common with chemotherapy coupled with the anticholinergics

518
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:45,700
that can dry the mouth out. Well, on my population, because I wanted to do a more controlled clinical

519
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:54,660
trial, they all had an eye cancer, scheduled to undergo radiation. The head and neck cancer

520
00:59:54,660 --> 01:00:02,020
can be different areas of the head and neck, but I have a very strict inclusion criteria that at a

521
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:07,860
minimum 50 grains of radiation needs to be delivered to the other cavity due to the cancer.

522
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:17,220
Because I know that in this particular condition, 90% of them will develop mucocytes.

523
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,660
And this is male and female?

524
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:28,900
Male, female, and we have RT only and we have combined treatment. RT plus chemo,

525
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:35,380
100% get mucocytes. It's not a single patient. If you have a combined program,

526
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:41,140
regimen like that, it's very aggressive. And then on top of that, they get immune compromised.

527
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,780
But these are mostly squamous cell, not lymphomas and head and neck lymphomas, correct? This is

528
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:50,260
mostly squamous cell. And how many of these patients are HPV positive?

529
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:58,660
Probably 90% of them. Oral cancer, it's very low incidence.

530
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:04,500
Which is known by research as only the oropharyngeal cancer that has been linked to the HPV.

531
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,700
Most of them have HPV positive.

532
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:12,500
This is an interesting epidemic that's getting very little attention. And I don't know why, but

533
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:20,820
I think these HPV driven squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharyngeal region really frighten me

534
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:26,260
because we don't have really adequate ways to screen for them the way we can screen for HPV

535
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:34,420
cancers of the pelvis in women. Unless people are doing very advanced imaging like MRIs,

536
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:42,100
they're often caught quite late. What do you think accounts for the rise in incidence we're

537
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:47,940
seeing of this cancer? I mean, it's obvious that it's the HPV, but yeah.

538
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,620
Is it just sexual transmission? Like why are we seeing?

539
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:59,140
Yeah, it is sexual transmission. So we were in condoms. It's oral sex. We know today that

540
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:07,540
is sexual transmission. Of course, combined with poor oral health, they might cause disease or not

541
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:13,620
because we know there are like several predominant bacteria. They have a very symbiotic relationship.

542
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:18,980
They allow virus to grow. Like the pigeon gee values, there's several studies that show that

543
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:28,660
they can allow other virus to grow. Immune system deficiency as well. We know that every time that

544
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:36,020
you have your immune system is not strong, allows virus and bacteria, full infection to grow. So

545
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:44,580
you might charge over abundance as well. But it is, it's just, you need to modify habits so you

546
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:50,420
can prevent. I want to go deeper into this, but before we do, I want to actually go back to some

547
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:56,820
of the more mundane stuff, the real, you know, the blocking and tackling of dentistry and talk about

548
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:05,620
carries again and what, like what the stages of carries look like, when the tooth can be preserved.

549
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:11,380
All right. So when you're just replacing a little bit of enamel and then what that next layer of

550
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,660
damage looks like that ultimately leads to a root canal, presumably once the pulp is irreversibly

551
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:22,980
damaged. And then ultimately when even that can't be reserved and a crown is no longer sufficient

552
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:27,620
and you have to replace the whole tooth. Can you, I know you have some nice figures on that. Can we,

553
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:33,540
can we kind of go through those different stages of, of dental care? Because I think it is important

554
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:40,500
to see these images. It certainly helps me understand what's going on. So technically,

555
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:47,540
the first initial stage of dental decay is the one that breaks through the enamel.

556
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:54,740
The very incipient decays, they haven't got to the second layer of the tooth.

557
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:02,900
And they're, those are the ones, some of them, even like if we call white spot vision, you start

558
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:09,620
the decalcification, they can be reversed. If you have a child, you can have a very intense flow,

559
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:15,700
right? Furnished application, they are in reverse. So most of those very significant

560
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:22,180
solutions we shouldn't be touching or treating. And to be clear, is this the type of thing where

561
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:28,340
the dentist will use a little probe and say it's a little bit soft there, but I think it's okay,

562
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:34,020
or it's a shadow on the tooth, but they're confident that it's. Yeah, there are like some

563
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:42,660
controversy on that. In the past, they would have that very pointed probe and they would poke and

564
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:48,900
do inspection. Today, most people they would clean and they look with air because you don't want to

565
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,900
break the enamel more yet, right? Because if the enamel is already with loss of minerals, you don't

566
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:00,740
want to be poking. So you need to be very careful when it's a very superficial case like that,

567
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:07,140
because you might want to restore in a different way. But this is not painful. The enamel carries

568
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:13,060
have come nowhere near the pulp, so no one feels anything. There's no cold insensitivity or heat

569
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:21,620
insensitivity. Very, very minimal. Most people, they just don't even know it's there. And then

570
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:26,980
when it gets close, the more it gets close to the pulp, because it has so many nerves, the more

571
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:34,980
painful it's going to be. The dentin now is very soft. So it's more like a sponge that it's there

572
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:43,300
with very rich inside. So the moment it hits the dentin, it's painful. So that's when you're going

573
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:49,380
to start feeling like you get something cold and say, something's different in my tooth.

574
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:57,060
Hot is more signs of inflammation if you feel the hot surfaces, things that you put in your mouth.

575
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:06,820
Or when it gets infected, the bacteria can come to that hole and start colonizing. Then it starts

576
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:12,420
the inflammation and is that pulsation that you feel. And the pain now doesn't stop.

577
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:19,060
And before you get to full-blown pain, when you're just dealing with temperature and

578
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:27,620
sensitivity, is there anything that can be gleaned clinically between the cold versus the hot

579
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:37,460
insensitivity versus both? Yeah, most, I'm not an endodontist, an expert, but most tests that they do

580
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:47,540
to look for inflammation and infection when you have more of that hot sensation that is painful,

581
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:52,340
you know that you most likely might need to do the root canal because it's highly infected,

582
01:06:52,340 --> 01:07:00,980
inflamed. The cold, it's a little bit better because it's not in more advanced stage.

583
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:12,580
And then when you go, if the decay progresses, that's when you see on the other two figures is

584
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:19,860
that it hits the pulp. The moment it hits the pulp, there is no way you can not do the root canal

585
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:25,460
because now everything's already infected. And most root canals are done when the pulp is still

586
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:35,780
alive. They just excise the pulp and clean it just in fact, so it's not from a dead tissue that has

587
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:42,980
been there for a long time because it's hard to keep up with the pain. But just to be clear,

588
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:52,100
the dentin carry can be fixed without a root canal. Yes, yes. If it is not as close to the pulp

589
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:59,860
that got to the point that is infected and it broke through, you can resort. So this is my

590
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:10,020
own personal misery. Both root canals I've had were from what I now believe were dentin carries.

591
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:17,940
The first one was actually a dentist that wanted to change an old filling that I had from when I

592
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:24,340
was a child. So I had an old mercury filling from when I was a kid and fast forward 20 years,

593
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:30,660
he said, your insurance will cover the changing of this to a white filling. We should just change

594
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:37,460
this out. Keep in mind for 20 years, I had no complaint of this filling whatsoever. And the

595
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:43,460
moment he changed that mercury filling over to a white one in the process of mucking around,

596
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:48,740
that tooth started really hurting. And over the next couple of weeks, the pain got worse and worse

597
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:54,180
and worse. And ultimately I needed a root canal on that tooth. So needless to say, I was

598
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:03,700
very unhappy about that. Let sleeping dogs lie. The next one I had was the same thing,

599
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:12,740
was another filling that the dentist thought in this case, hey, I think there's another little

600
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:22,580
carry next to it. It should be an easy fix. And it actually was on a wisdom tooth. But my teeth,

601
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:27,620
my mouth seems to be big enough that I'm able to tolerate having all my wisdom teeth. So he said,

602
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:31,700
look, we can do a root canal on a... Or sorry, this was before we needed the root canal. This was just,

603
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:37,460
hey, we'll just replace or fix the carry there. But same thing, it ended up hurting and hurting

604
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:42,580
and hurting. So they ended up doing the root canal. I still have that tooth with a... I didn't

605
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:47,300
even put a crown on that one actually, which is amazing on a wisdom tooth not to have a crown,

606
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:53,860
I assume. So you said something very interesting that's counterintuitive, I suppose, which is most

607
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:58,180
times you do a root canal, the pulp is actually alive, but you still have to remove it all.

608
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:07,780
Once they anesthetize you, they kill all that pulp, right? So the process is remarkably crude.

609
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,860
They're using these little fine... I don't know what you want to call them. They're almost like

610
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:18,900
needles, but they're a bit bigger. They're sort of serrated. I remember wanting to play with these

611
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:24,820
things after I had my root canal, but it's like these little... You wind these little serrated,

612
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:32,900
jagged tools into the end of the root. It's basically a very mechanical procedure.

613
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:40,900
It is, but today they're very sophisticated. They do all microscopically. I think in the past,

614
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:48,660
they had a lot of the issues from 100 years ago is because we're not sophisticated enough.

615
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:54,660
So they would put those fine things and they would break through the roots because they couldn't see

616
01:10:54,660 --> 01:11:00,580
well and they cause immediately like the inflammation, the reaction, because you're just

617
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:05,300
perforating everything. But today, if you look today, how they treat periodontal disease,

618
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:11,540
it's a microscopic surgery. So they just put the tooth under the microscope. They're a completely

619
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:18,500
aseptic environment because they put those rubber bands into to isolate, to not let the bacteria

620
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:24,020
from the arachavia to get inside. And they do the whole excision of the pulp. They disinfect

621
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:30,340
everything and they fill in with special materials to just fill the hole. It becomes

622
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:37,300
like just a cast, the truth, because there is no more vitality on that tooth, but yet

623
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:42,740
preserves function, which is extremely important. That's why you shouldn't be extracting all your

624
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:49,300
teeth unless you really need it because it's not even the influence is better than your,

625
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:53,460
even without having a root canal is not better than your natural tooth.

626
01:11:54,660 --> 01:12:00,420
Yeah. I mean, I think that's probably one takeaway here, which is, and I want to talk about the

627
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:05,620
concerns that people have around root canals because it seems to be one of these very

628
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:11,940
controversial topics in some small circles. But if you're going to have a root canal, it seems to

629
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,700
me that you have to have this done under a microscope by an endodontist. I just think

630
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:22,180
the days of freewheeling root canals where a dentist is looking through his or her glasses,

631
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:28,820
regular glasses and ramming these things through just doesn't make any sense. And I know that both

632
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:34,900
of my root canals were done initially in that way. Ultimately, both of them needed to be corrected by

633
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:41,060
endodontists who did it with microscopes in a much more aseptic fashion. Ultimately, one of them

634
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:47,380
ended up developing an abscess many years later. That tooth needed to be extracted.

635
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:56,660
So, which by the way, after that tooth was extracted, I was relieved of so much pain that

636
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:01,700
I decided in a temporary moment of insanity, I wanted to in that moment have all of my teeth

637
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:07,140
extracted and replaced by implants so I could never deal with this again. Of course, that's idiotic.

638
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:14,820
No. Yeah. So let's talk about the controversy around root canals. Basically, the controversies

639
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:21,380
are root canals are a dangerous procedure and they lead to kind of fill in the blank. And fill in the

640
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:26,740
blank is I've heard everything. I've heard people say, oh, root canals cause cancer, they cause

641
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:35,460
Alzheimer's disease, they cause sore toes, you name it. What is the state of evidence

642
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:42,340
about the safety of root canals or frankly, the state of evidence that root canals are indeed

643
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:52,740
potentially hazardous? It's hard to say in a nice way, but I think it's a total nonsense.

644
01:13:53,620 --> 01:14:03,140
It's been, it's 100 years ago that all those focal theories that they said that would exist,

645
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:08,180
there is zero evidence, Anik, there is no research, there is nothing that can

646
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:18,260
prove that this is true. If you think about, I was even the other day talking to one of my faculty

647
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:25,860
because I said I'm not an endodontist, so I don't know. I've done root canal, but it was a long time

648
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:30,580
ago, but I was asking him, what do you think about this? And he said the same thing to Pat,

649
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:38,020
that there's no common sense on what's going on, is that focal point of infection. But what he said

650
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:45,540
is that if you think about the most root canals, the way they start, it's through the crowns and

651
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:54,100
the same bacteria that colonizer tube goes inside the pulp and then comes and goes inside the root,

652
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:59,940
and that's the infection that we're saying, right? That it's causing all those infections. But this

653
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:05,060
is all in your body already. And if that's the case, every time that you have a dental case,

654
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:11,300
you need to extract the tube because it's all the same route of infection. So when I think about all

655
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:17,060
those things and talking to them, I said, this makes no sense. There's no way we can explain that.

656
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:23,620
And again, I still think if it is well done, of course, there are a lot of root canals out there

657
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:29,860
that people don't know what they're doing. They don't clean well. They leave things behind or they

658
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:37,940
perforate. And we see how many regographs we take and we see a focal infection on the throat.

659
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:45,460
But that's because it's small cracks or someone, or not even they couldn't see well to do a proper

660
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:51,540
way, right? But as an end today, most root canals, if you walk in their clinic today,

661
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:57,940
they all under a microscope and I can guarantee it's really well done, the process. And people

662
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:03,540
don't have issues after that if it is well done. Yeah. I mean, I guess the question is,

663
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:08,980
even in the cases of root canals, which were not done ideally, such as mine,

664
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:15,860
beyond the local complication, which is the need for subsequent root canals,

665
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:24,420
ultimately the need for even an extraction, does that pose a systemic risk even when it's done

666
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:33,300
poorly? I don't believe so. Most have localized, there are few surgeries that they do and they

667
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:40,580
open through the gum and they clean that area and you see that improve. I don't believe that.

668
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:46,180
They're like with this root canal, for example, there are another paper who's saying that

669
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:53,700
people with root canal have breast cancer, for example. But then they look at a hundred of women

670
01:16:53,780 --> 01:17:01,700
that didn't have root canal and also had breast cancer. So, it's not clear evidence.

671
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:08,340
These epidemiologic, I call them bottom of the birdcage papers, because that's about what they're

672
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:15,060
good for. They're the papers that say, well, if you look at the number of women who have had a root

673
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:22,500
canal on the same side that they get breast cancer, it demonstrates the relationship. But these papers

674
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:29,460
always fail to look at the numerator, which is all the women who develop breast cancer who did

675
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:35,140
not have root canals. They don't have root canals. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's true, true and unrelated.

676
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:41,300
And it's unfortunate because I think what bothers me the most about this type of pseudoscience is

677
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:46,660
when a woman gets breast cancer, it's already upsetting enough. I think the last thing she

678
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:52,420
needs to be told is this is because you had a root canal five years ago. And that's been

679
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:58,900
probably the biggest issue I take with this nonsensical science. And unfortunately, it tends

680
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:06,100
to aggregate from the same group of people who tend to have other beliefs that are very unsubstantiated,

681
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:12,500
such as vaccines causing autism and things like that. So, there tends to be a core group of

682
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:23,940
beliefs like that. So, let's go back a bit to the kind of broader theme of these systemic diseases.

683
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:34,420
When you think about major chronic diseases, is it safe to say that the greatest causal relationship

684
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:42,740
we have between poor oral health and poor systemic health would be with cardiovascular disease?

685
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:47,380
Or do you think there are... And so, I guess, first of all, how strong do you think that

686
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:54,980
relationship is causally and how does it compare to others? There is a lot of research showing

687
01:18:55,700 --> 01:19:03,940
association. We don't know what comes first. So, they show the relationship that's proven with

688
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:09,700
periodontal disease and diabetes. Periodontal disease in low birth weight. Periodontal disease

689
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:16,980
and heart. That is the hypothesis, of course, is all based on the insult of the bacteria causing

690
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:24,340
inflammation and systemic health. We know that. And other things, Alzheimer's, for example,

691
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:33,860
amyloid in the brain. And a few studies that we did showed markers as well. Periodontal disease

692
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:41,620
and markers of Alzheimer's. So, they're all associations. But the only way you can say

693
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:48,340
causality is if you do a clinical trial. You need to treat those patients and see changes on those

694
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:53,060
markers. And then you say, see, I changed their behavior. They're brushing their teeth. Now,

695
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:57,140
look how better they became. So, we need to do those things. We have a group of people that I

696
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:05,380
work with from NYU since I was at NYU. Monique de Leon is his name. And Dr. Kamer. She's been for

697
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:13,060
over 10 years trying to make the point. She has all those papers. She saw, for example, children

698
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:27,860
with, that have motor skills or I think her study was in, I just blinked here now, the name of the

699
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:35,300
disease. But we found in children that they have amyloid better, amyloid in their brains,

700
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:42,260
accumulation. And we know this population has very poor oral health. They have cold on tidings

701
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:49,460
and six years old, it's Down syndrome. So, the first study that she looked, it was Down syndrome.

702
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:57,700
So, we know because they have motor skills, they have cognition issues and it's a very hard to brush.

703
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:02,260
So, that's interesting. So, because we know that children with Down syndrome

704
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:06,580
are very susceptible to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease, in fact,

705
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:14,980
people with Down syndrome usually do not live a normal lifespan and they usually succumb to

706
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:22,820
these chronic conditions much sooner, as early as in their 40s or 50s. So, you're saying that,

707
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:30,900
well, again, it's hard to know if the increase that she sees in amyloid is an independent process

708
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:38,180
that's being driven by the chromosomal abnormalities that are found in Down syndrome versus

709
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:43,700
related to the poor oral care, which could be true and unrelated. It could be that they have

710
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:48,980
poor oral care because they don't have the life skills developed to provide oral care. So,

711
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:58,260
an interesting experiment would be a longitudinal study of two groups of peers with Down syndrome,

712
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:05,380
one that are provided intensive support for oral care and one that are sort of standard of care.

713
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:09,060
But again, those are very difficult studies to do because they're very time consuming.

714
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:18,340
Well, they are. It's all about prevention, right? How about if you intensify a very intense

715
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:25,940
preventive approach so you don't let that child be with carries and predile disease and pain and

716
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:32,420
inflammation and all of that. It's not only that disease, it's any people with disability.

717
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:42,660
Like we just opened at Penn right now because the dean's visionary, he's really focused on

718
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:49,700
prevention. He opens a center for people with disabilities. So, any person who has any

719
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:58,340
motor skills or has any disease that impacts cognition, we're going to create this program

720
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:04,900
that we can do a lot of research. How is the best way of cleaning toothpaste, toothbrushes,

721
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:10,340
what can intensify this population? We reach through caregivers. It's a whole educational

722
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:16,020
process because it's not them. We need to educate people who are taking care of those

723
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:23,780
injured needles to do an optimal oral hygiene. It's simple as that. Can we just brush, brush,

724
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:30,020
brush, fluoride, intensify because you can prevent all those things are highly preventable.

725
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:36,500
But I was looking for say, what are we going to measure? There is no outcome assessment that you

726
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,900
can use for this specific population because they're so neglected.

727
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:45,140
But going back to your earlier point, just to make sure I understood,

728
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:52,500
did you say that if you took two groups of people and one group received excellent oral care and

729
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:58,340
the other group did not, and this is not in cancer patients. Let's just say patients who are not

730
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:04,100
immune compromised and whose oral mucosa is not compromised. So, if this hasn't been done,

731
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:09,700
consider it a thought experiment. One group receives best in class oral care, which I want

732
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:16,980
to come back and define. The other group receives horrible oral care or mediocre at best. Would you

733
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:26,340
expect to see a difference in inflammatory markers, including cytokines and inflammatory cells,

734
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:36,260
macrophage monocyte derived lineage cells across those two groups? Because if that's true, that

735
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:42,580
alone could explain the increase in systemic disease. In other words, that could be a causal

736
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:49,060
factor. It's undeniably well established the relationship between inflammation and

737
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:54,900
cardiovascular disease. You could take two people that have virtually an identical profile of

738
01:24:54,900 --> 01:25:00,900
lipoproteins, but in one group, the high amount of inflammation will lead to a greater burden

739
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:05,940
of disease than in the other. Inflammation plays an important role in cancer and certainly

740
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:10,500
inflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. So, that to me seems,

741
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,660
I guess the easiest hypothesis, that's the Occam's razor approach here, which is poor oral health

742
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:25,620
leads to poor or substandard amounts of inflammatory environment, and that's the

743
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:32,420
driver of these diseases. That would be my guess. Yeah, it's very simple, Nick. But think about,

744
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:41,380
Peter, when did you ever go to a doctor? You are MG, that the doctors ask you,

745
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:47,780
how's your mouth? Do you have periodontal disease? How do you brush your teeth? Think about when.

746
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,900
Sure. It's not at all part of the doctor's toolkit.

747
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:58,980
Ever. So, look what's going on with COVID. COVID is an infectious disease. What is the

748
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:06,420
transmission of COVID saliva? It's the mouth. Now, there are papers coming up because the

749
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:12,100
AC2 receptors, which is the COVID bind to enter the body, they are highly expressed in your

750
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,420
country. Look at the literature. They're in the tongue, the floor of mouth,

751
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:23,060
gingebo, curvicular food, they're everywhere in your mouth. So, a patient gets COVID.

752
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:31,300
The two things that I'm very surprised and saying why people are not doing anything.

753
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:38,020
So, people get COVID, they go to the hospital. The first thing that they do, they put them on a mask.

754
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:42,580
They never brush their teeth. They don't look if they have periodontal disease. How is the quality

755
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:47,620
of the oral cavity? They put on the subpoena position because they need to free up the lungs.

756
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:53,540
That patient spends a month, some people, more than that, in a very critical condition. They

757
01:26:53,540 --> 01:27:00,340
think this is going to lead to pulmonary infection. Of course, we are. If someone has periodontal

758
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:06,260
disease and already have a lot of bacteria and pockets, all the periodontal pockets, it's a

759
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:13,700
perfect reservoir for the virus to thrive. Even like the new, if you saw, there is a publication

760
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:19,940
that just came out, only hypothesis because nobody ever tested it. That it might be, if you look at the

761
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:27,540
characteristics or actual risk of COVID, the way it manifests, the upper respiratory tract,

762
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:32,740
in terms of secretion, how congested you have is very minimal. You might have a stuffed nose,

763
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:41,620
but from the mouth goes directly to the lungs. So, there is a huge connection there. No one is

764
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:47,460
doing anything to tell people, can you brush your teeth? Do a mouthwash. Clean your mouth. If you

765
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:53,620
have COVID, you have to have an excellent, in the hospitals. Give the nurses, you have to ask this

766
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:59,860
patient to brush because no one is doing that. Look at the committee. So, of course, now,

767
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:06,180
science is going back because our new president, they have, they're very, they're fostering all

768
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:12,420
those prevention maps and everything. Look at the committee that we have that has been put to

769
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:18,580
support COVID. Is there any, one of them is an oral expert?

770
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,100
I'm guessing not.

771
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:27,300
An oral epidemiologist, an oral periodontist. Is there anyone there, if there are anyone there that

772
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:34,340
understands a little bit about the mouth, if you connect the mouth with the body, I can guarantee

773
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:40,500
that you can present. Look what's going on in Brazil, China. It's just ridiculous because there's

774
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:45,940
no prevention. The only prevention is the mask, which we could do something better, right?

775
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:55,140
Some argued that last year we saw a great increase in the rise of dental carees. Some

776
01:28:55,140 --> 01:29:01,300
suggest that it had to do with mask wearing. To me, it seems the most obvious explanation would

777
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:06,500
be simply that people sought less dental care last year. Do you have a point of view on, first

778
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,740
of all, is it true that dental carees went up last year?

779
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:17,620
Well, so what happened, that we're still dealing with that, is that when COVID hit,

780
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:27,540
dentists was considered not essential. So they shut down everything that wasn't essential,

781
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:34,340
which health care and places that you can buy food and things like that. So dentists was left

782
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:41,060
behind. So dental clinics, I know because I had to suspend my clinical trial for

783
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:47,220
three or four months. I came back immediately the moment they allowed me to open the clinic. But

784
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:54,500
dental clinics, they were closed, completely closed for about almost a year. And on top of that,

785
01:29:54,500 --> 01:30:01,860
they suspended every single type of procedure that produces a result because they thought that

786
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:08,900
was a way of infecting people. So people couldn't go to the dentist. You saw horrible things on the

787
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:18,020
internet. We left our emergency clinic open only. And we saw really detrimental things because

788
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:25,460
people couldn't get access to care. So combined with, of course, putting masks. And if you're

789
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:32,660
wearing a mask at work a whole day, you forget to brush because you can't drink too much because

790
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:38,260
you need to hide because you have to drink water or eat. So everything is detrimental. You might

791
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:43,460
breathe more through your mouth because the mask, people don't know how to breathe well through the

792
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:49,940
mask. So it dries your mouth. You have dry mouth because you're breathing. So this combination of

793
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:58,180
poor or hygiene, you have dry mouth, you have a mask. So it's not the mask that is causing anything,

794
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:01,860
but it's just a cumulative effect of everything that is going on.

795
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:10,500
Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. You mentioned thrush earlier, so oral candida. And you mentioned

796
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:14,980
it in the obvious context of people who are immune compromised. But from time to time,

797
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:21,460
I've seen people with a totally normal immune system develop oral thrush. Now, I will say

798
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:28,500
there's usually something going on, like they're usually on an inhaled steroid for asthma or

799
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:33,780
something like that. So maybe that's partially explaining it. But do you have any other

800
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:40,180
explanations for how a person with a normal immune system could develop oral candida or thrush?

801
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:50,980
It's highly associated with candida infection. And it can be through, I think the primary reason

802
01:31:50,980 --> 01:32:01,060
is lack of saliva, because your mouth is dry. So that's why MDs, they show up at their patients and

803
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:07,220
how much in which picture they have. And ask the question, you have dry mouth. They might have in

804
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:16,740
other complications and don't even know why. But primarily, I think it's poor oral hygiene,

805
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:21,620
because if you have no donor disease and poor oral hygiene, you're going to allow those

806
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:36,580
opportunistic species to grow. And medication, they don't have a specific cause, but mainly,

807
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:43,380
I would say medication and poor oral health would allow virus to grow. We see it a lot in HIV.

808
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,100
You mean fungus.

809
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:47,540
Fungal. Yeah. Fungal. Yeah.

810
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:54,980
I said virus, because virus and fungal, they work really well together. Like people with HIV,

811
01:32:55,540 --> 01:33:03,460
they have episodes constant of fungal infection in their mouth.

812
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:11,060
So there are lots of reasons why people could have dry mouth. Certainly one of the most popular

813
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:16,500
classes of drugs that would do it are anticholinergics. It's also interesting, by the way,

814
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:22,740
that there's some strong associations between anticholinergics and Alzheimer's disease.

815
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:30,020
It hasn't been demonstrated whether that's causal, but if indeed anticholinergics, which lead to a

816
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:40,260
very dry mouth, would decrease the resistance of the bacteria in the mouth to the systemic system.

817
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:45,060
And that could play a role. So it becomes very interesting. But for an individual who has dry

818
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:54,420
mouth, is there a downside in using sugarless chewing gum or lozenges or having something in

819
01:33:54,420 --> 01:34:00,340
the mouth to induce saliva? Is there a downside to that? Is that considered one of the effective

820
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:03,940
methods that someone can use to keep their mouth lubricated?

821
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:12,180
Yeah. Yeah. I don't see any wrong doing that, but never use anything that is sugar

822
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:18,580
content. There are a lot of sugar substitutes that you can do because you can stimulate

823
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:25,140
the salivary lens and you're constantly moving your tongue and your mouth. And I will say

824
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:33,460
hydration, it's extremely important as well. If you don't like to drink, just get a sip water

825
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:39,220
all day long. You're always washing the oil cavity, the gastrointestinal tract, because it's all one

826
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:48,180
system. It starts in the mouth and go to the bacteria they are all together. So always

827
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:52,580
hydration and drinking water, I think it's very important for oral health as well.

828
01:34:53,460 --> 01:35:01,620
Now, have you looked into xylitol specifically? I've seen some literature to suggest that xylitol

829
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:05,780
may actually not only not be harmful, because I think there are lots of things out there that

830
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:11,940
are not harmful, aspartame or any other things that might be thrown into gum that are sugar

831
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:18,740
substitutes, but that xylitol specifically could be beneficial. And so my practice has been to have

832
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:26,500
some xylitol-based chewing gum that if I'm out and I eat, I can chew it for a while to serve two

833
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:31,220
purposes. One is get saliva there, but two also clean the food out of teeth. Do you recommend

834
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:36,420
anything like that? Because a person can't brush their teeth four times a day, presumably. At some

835
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:42,500
point, it becomes counterproductive. Yeah, that's the one that I like the most. I actually did some

836
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:50,900
research a long time ago where we are looking for mothers to child transmission of dental care.

837
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:59,380
We know that as mutants can be highly transmissible from mothers to child. For different things like

838
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:06,980
the mom who proved the food and put in the child's mouth. It's proven that it transmits

839
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:13,540
the struck mutants of the child. They've done some research about kissing in the mouth. They didn't

840
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:21,060
find a hinge correlation that they know that proving and tasting their food, which is you

841
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:29,300
should take a look at nannies and people who are watching children. But I really like xylitol

842
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:34,420
and we found that we prevented the transmission because we gave the xylitol to the moms.

843
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:41,380
During the gestation time, we asked them to chew on xylitol just to prevent that

844
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:48,500
vertical transmission of the mutants that struck mutants. It prevents the K2

845
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:56,980
because the bacteria does not metabolize that. That's great. I'll plug my favorite brand of it.

846
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:04,500
I use one called Pure. You can buy it on Amazon and I like the Pure gum and the Pure mints.

847
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:11,540
Let's talk about teeth whitening. Generally, the two things people notice about somebody's teeth

848
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:17,220
when they smile is how straight are they and how white are they? Let's talk a little bit about the

849
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:24,740
latter. Is the color of a person's tooth genetically determined?

850
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:34,980
Somehow, yes. We can see that different races, they might have more white, but it's relative as well

851
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:40,420
because let's say if this person with the darker skin, the teeth are going to become much more

852
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:49,140
whiter. It's almost blend with someone who has a very white skin. Most of the changes on tooth

853
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:58,100
color can either be done by some genetic factors that people who might have a lot of very yellow

854
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:05,940
and that will never change but since they're born or sometimes they're like in few countries, they

855
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:13,860
have fluid in the water so excess of fluoride might have some stains on your teeth but mostly

856
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:24,260
the color of the teeth is highly environmentally determined because we talk about my study with the

857
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:33,300
twins where we gave the same product for the two twins, they behave completely different.

858
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:41,220
Even they were identical 100% of their genes. The kid who had like drink a lot of tea,

859
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:48,820
coffee and things, they had much more stain in your teeth and of course the whitening wasn't

860
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:55,220
efficient of another one who had less. The environment takes place and it's highly

861
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:59,620
can modify just with those whitening products, brushing, things like that.

862
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:08,020
Yeah, I have found that for me, the two worst actors by far in terms of darkening my teeth are

863
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:16,660
black tea and red wine. We're going to talk about whitening in a second because I want to ask you

864
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:23,140
about it. I don't whiten my teeth due to sheer laziness. My approach has been to just try to

865
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:28,180
minimize how dark they get by always rinsing my mouth out with water or chewing gum or something

866
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:38,340
like that after I consume those things. Is whitening a safe procedure? Is it something that

867
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:45,220
harms the tooth in an effort to produce this aesthetic? Does it bleach the enamel away or

868
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:53,060
do something that's dangerous? Yeah, it's bleach and it's of course in excess, which most people do

869
01:39:53,940 --> 01:40:01,540
because they want to always have meaty wine. It's detrimental because somehow it has loss of

870
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:07,940
minerals because of the product is very strong. Also, if you're allowed to touch the gums,

871
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:15,540
it's very aggressive because you're bleaching and it cannot be for a long time. So what I tell people

872
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:22,340
is that if you want to do at home because it's less expensive, ideally you should do at the dentist.

873
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:27,220
If you care about your teeth, do at the dentist. They're going to protect your gum. They're not

874
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:32,100
going to apply the product if you have a disease, if you have root case and all those things. They

875
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:38,180
will know exactly what is the population who can have that but people just go and buy out of the

876
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:43,380
counter and they don't know what they're doing. Sometimes they place that and they watch TV,

877
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:49,060
they spend hours or every time they have a party, oh, I want my teeth, why? They put again and then

878
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:53,860
becomes that constant demetrization. Of course, you're going to have to stop with your teeth.

879
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:59,620
You're going to harm your gums and things like that. So if you want to do, talk to your dentist,

880
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:06,020
ask them, am I attending date for that? And do at the dentist, do at the correct timeline,

881
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:11,060
look at the prescription. Don't do cheap or products that are not FDA approved. So all

882
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:21,940
those considerations, if you do the right way, it's okay. It's just when they go outside to do

883
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:27,060
things that they should do. But it still seems that prevention is worth a lot here. If you

884
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:32,500
minimize the things that really discolor your teeth, it would at least reduce the need to

885
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:39,300
do those other things. I alluded to it earlier that one of my most miserable,

886
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:45,220
not one of my hands down, my most miserable dental experience of my life went as follows.

887
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:55,380
Mercury filling placed when I was whatever, 10, 30 years later, someone comes along and says,

888
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:01,620
you really ought to have that removed because your insurance company will now cover the replacement

889
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:07,300
of these and you can have something white instead of something silver. And that damaged

890
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:13,140
the dentin and or pulp enough that I needed a root canal, that root canal. I eventually,

891
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:18,660
that's the one where they missed the root. I had to go back and back and back and back and ultimately

892
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:25,140
led to an injury that required the tooth coming up. Okay, let's go back to the jugular question.

893
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:33,060
Should we remove mercury fillings? No. If they're highly functioning, there is no decay

894
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:39,860
under there are several statements and research that has been done and that's the minimal,

895
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:49,380
they're afraid about the mercury that gets in there. It's proven that there is no harm with that.

896
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:56,740
So if it's working fine, if you ain't functioning and it doesn't affect the appearance, the status

897
01:42:56,740 --> 01:43:03,940
of the tooth, just leave it there. I don't think you should. Okay, you also talked about fluoride

898
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:10,260
earlier. This might sound like a naive question, but does all toothpaste have fluoride in it?

899
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:18,820
No, you have to look for and not all of them have the correct amount. You want to like

900
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:31,860
1000 ppm to 1500 ppm of fluor. So that's very important. So you have to, and the ADA, the

901
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:37,060
American Mental Association, if you go to their website, they have all the toothpaste that they

902
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:43,620
endorsed, not for political reasons or anything, because we've done research and we know they work,

903
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:49,380
they have the correct amount of fluoride that prevents decay. So you just need to get from a

904
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:56,020
good source and it's extremely important to have fluoride in any toothpaste. Usually children,

905
01:43:56,020 --> 01:44:03,220
before one year, they recommend not to put it on because they swallow all the time,

906
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:09,860
but as long as they have the first tooth in their mouth, you can start putting very small amounts

907
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:17,540
and start the dredging to brush the child gets used to. But other than that, everybody should

908
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:22,660
use fluoride. And is there fluoride at all in any small amount in drinking water?

909
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:33,380
It depends. I know that the US is very particular with fluoride in many regions that people don't

910
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:42,660
like to have. Most countries, the drinking water is fluoride, but there are additional

911
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:49,620
sources of fluoride that pediatrician, they can do like drops that you, even when you're breastfeeding,

912
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:59,380
you can just put drops on the child and or varnish, which I think is extremely, extremely

913
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:07,380
preventative for children. It's so simple. It's like a varnish that you paint in your teeth every

914
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:14,420
six months. And guess what? We don't have the decay because it's just protecting more and more.

915
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:21,300
So I do that myself also. Yes, for any. I have discovered that I have one area in my mouth

916
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:28,820
where my gum has receded just a little bit. And as opposed to putting a filling there, I just use

917
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:34,020
every three to six months, a little bit of what you said, like sort of a fluoride varnish. Yeah.

918
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:40,660
And it reduces any sensitivity. And my goal is obviously just to prevent any decay there.

919
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:47,060
Yeah, the fluoride varnish, if someone is highly susceptible to decay, we have a,

920
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:55,300
it's a prescription base. You have to ask the doctor or the dentist to call. It's one of the

921
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:59,940
ones that we have in the market is prevalent. I give to my cancer patients, but they are highly

922
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:07,860
concentrated fluoride. And we recommend that they use once every night and for people who are high

923
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:15,780
risk of care, which is people undergoing radiation. And then you do a regular oral hygiene with the

924
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:20,980
regular fluoride toothpaste, your floss and everything. And then you put that toothpaste

925
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:29,940
on a toothbrush and then you brush and don't rinse with water. You want the product to just

926
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:37,700
treat the cavities and everything overnight. So that's very efficient as well. And mainly,

927
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:45,620
and it's a very fun story to ask my son because I have two kids and none of them have never had

928
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:57,300
decay. How old are they? Today they are 30, 34. So, but they never had decay. But if you think

929
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:04,500
Francis, which my youngest, he, because I was tell the stories about microbial that they're going to

930
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:09,380
eat your teeth. If you have food, they're going to eat the food that they're going to just go down

931
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:15,060
and make holes in your teeth. So I would tell them those stories overnight. And how many times

932
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:20,980
that kid in the middle of the night, cause he would fall asleep and I'll put him on like three

933
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:26,180
years old in the bed. And I would watch him in the middle of the night, brush the bathroom and brush

934
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:32,500
the teeth because you're afraid. I always told them because the most important time of the day

935
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:41,060
is actually the night rush and never give your child baby bottles and things overnight. Because

936
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:45,220
when you're sleeping, you have a suppress your saliva production.

937
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:52,020
And that's the perfect environment to the bacteria to grow. That's why child have baby

938
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:57,060
bottle decay because when they're sleeping and they put the bottle in their mouth,

939
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:05,780
the milk concentrates all on the anterior teeth and they get severe decay. So brushing before you

940
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:12,820
go to bed and you floss, you'd like to do that. You have me a optimal optimal or hygiene is really

941
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:16,740
high and you're going to prevent, right? It's a very important brushing time.

942
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:22,100
What are the implications of children having carries in their baby teeth? I mean, for example,

943
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:27,780
I assume we would never do a root canal in a child. You just yank the tooth out because you

944
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:34,420
know that the adult tooth is coming right behind it. Do people put fillings into children's teeth?

945
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:44,660
It's highly complicated to treat those kids. First, because you traumatize them, you cannot do local

946
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:50,740
anesthesia. They will never come back to the dentist to try to do that in a regular way because

947
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:58,020
they don't understand. They're very young. It's one, two, three years old that will start with

948
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:05,060
decay appear. So they do in the hospital under sedation. The teeth that they can't treat, they

949
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:10,740
treat, they will extract the ones that causing a lot of pain. Some of them just treat the pulp,

950
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:18,260
put some medication there and wait until the tooth is 48 just to preserve function because otherwise

951
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:23,700
they're not going to be able to chew. So every case they need to approach, there is another type

952
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:31,620
of fluoride as well. It's highly concentrated that they put it with a marrow together, but the

953
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:40,100
teeth becomes black. That's another resource that they have because they cannot open, put a hole,

954
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:46,180
and restoration because the child will never allow us to do. So excessive fluoride darkens teeth?

955
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:58,980
Just this specific time. It's mixed with a metal that the moment it gets in contact with this soft

956
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:03,300
denture, it hardens and becomes that very hard layer.

957
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:09,140
Okay. So it doesn't affect their adult teeth. It's just a temporary barrier until the tooth falls out.

958
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:17,540
Yeah, I rest the decay in a very nice way, but you need to tell the mom and say, I know it's going to

959
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:23,780
take the pain away. It's going to rest the decay, but the teeth is going to become black. So it's a

960
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:30,180
trait because we know that a couple years later the tooth is going to exfoliate. It's not going

961
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:37,060
to be black forever. So it's an approach that we can do for this age of children.

962
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:45,460
There's an entire cottage industry of products out there like oil for pulling through the teeth

963
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:52,980
and tongue scraping things. Are you aware of any research that supports the use of such devices?

964
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:58,420
You've obviously talked about brushing the tongue, but any research that suggests scraping the tongue

965
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:04,900
is efficacious or I don't even understand what oil pulling is, although I've seen the oils and

966
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:11,220
I don't think I fully understand what the claim is about why oil pulling is beneficial. Are you aware?

967
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:22,100
No, honestly, I've seen, I have no idea. There is no clinical or research evidence that shows that

968
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:30,580
it's good or bad. I've seen a few studies on the tongue scraping, which is similar with whatever

969
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:37,860
the brush is doing, but I really like much better the brush because I asked the patients to put a

970
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:43,860
little bit of toothpaste because toothpaste is also anti-bacteria and then you just brush.

971
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:50,980
It doesn't harm the cells or anything. You just brush the surface. If I had to choose between

972
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:58,420
this toothbrush brushing the tongue without scraping, I would say just brush. It's simple and easy.

973
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:05,300
Okay. Is there a difference between the types of dental flosses out there? The two most common

974
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:12,740
that I see, actually, let's say three. One is the ribbon. It's a very soft, almost looks like a

975
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:21,940
gortex-like ribbon. The other is a rope, a miniature rope. Then the third one would be a

976
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:28,260
miniature rope that's coated in wax. Are they all basically the same and you just pick the one

977
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:33,300
that is the most comfortable to you or do you have a preference for which type of floss a person uses?

978
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:40,740
Well, what I tell my patients, I have like 10 different ones. What I tell them, the true one,

979
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:47,620
you're more comfortable using. It's a mechanical, the bright one. It's disruption of the biofilm

980
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:53,620
and taking the food away from in between your teeth. There are people who have perfect teeth,

981
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:58,980
very close together. They might need to use the one that has the wax because they're going to go

982
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:06,980
in and out very quick and you don't want to harm your gums trying to pull in something very strong

983
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:11,220
and then it's going to cut through the ground. It has to be done very carefully. There are people

984
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:16,420
who have prosthetics or big holes. They are like little brushes that they can put inside.

985
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:23,460
There are people who have teeth that are connected to each other and they have another type of

986
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:30,100
device that they can go inside the bridge and clean. It doesn't really matter. You just need

987
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:37,300
to clean and you can clean. Most people don't floss. Really? Most people do. What does the

988
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:42,900
literature suggest? What percentage of the US adult population does floss once a day?

989
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:53,460
If I tell something, I might not be right, but I know by the whole population that I treated,

990
01:53:53,460 --> 01:54:01,300
it's like half of the people floss or they floss twice a week or something gets stuck,

991
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:08,740
they go and floss, but if you ask people do you floss every day, most people don't floss every day

992
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:19,300
and another consideration is that floss costs money. So you need to keep buying all those

993
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:24,820
supplies and you might not have the funds might be used for different things.

994
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:35,060
But if you think about flossing and brushing, I still think the floss is even more important than

995
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:43,700
brushing because it's all the research that I did. People can stop brushing and you recover health

996
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:52,260
easily. People stop flossing as the change of items, inflammation comes so quick because the plaque

997
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:59,220
that is in between your teeth, you can never change or clean if you don't have a device.

998
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:04,900
The plaque that is on top of the surface of your teeth, you're eating, you get an apple,

999
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:13,220
things that have fibers, somehow you just clean, you drink water, the saliva is constant cleaning

1000
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:21,140
your mouth. The flossing is where the one thing is a bad bacteria because they love the anaerobic

1001
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:27,940
bacteria that causes most of the systemic health, such cardiovascular disease, diabetes, they all

1002
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:33,780
anaerobic and they are the ones that hide in the tongue, they hide in between your teeth,

1003
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:42,660
they can hide back in your throat as well because they like those niche that the oxygen don't go.

1004
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:51,540
Is a water pick an additional benefit to flossing? Is it at all a substitute? I mean, obviously,

1005
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:56,500
there are some cases where it's very valuable, kids that have braces, things like that,

1006
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:01,540
but how do you incorporate the water pick into your oral care regimen?

1007
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:11,940
I like it, but I would say it's only if you're not able to use the traditional, the brushing is the

1008
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:19,140
best because the water is more if you brush, then do the water pick. Don't do just the water pick

1009
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:25,940
without brushing because the water pick is that flushing of all the toxins that are in between

1010
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:33,700
your teeth and between your gums and all of that, but it cannot be just water pick. It's a benefit,

1011
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:41,060
but don't do alone. Any harm or benefit to using toothpicks? This is just a personal obsession of

1012
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:48,660
mine. I love toothpicks. It sounds crazy, but when I find toothpicks I like, I buy them in massive

1013
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:55,300
quantities and there's this one toothpick I got at a steakhouse 10 years ago and I became so enamored

1014
01:56:55,300 --> 01:57:00,100
by it that I had to find out where they got it from and I found the company that made it, but the

1015
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:05,700
minimum order was something like 20,000 packages. I had to buy 20,000 packages of this toothpick,

1016
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:10,660
which I still have to this day. I love them. Point is, I always have a toothpick in my mouth

1017
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:16,420
am I hurting myself? Am I helping myself? What am I doing? I don't think you've heard of yourself.

1018
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:22,980
They even had research in the past that they say that stimulates your gums and things like that.

1019
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:27,780
Well, honestly, that's part of what it is. There's a use case, which is anytime I have food in my

1020
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:33,700
teeth, I love doing it, but what I've also realized is I find myself massaging my gums with the side

1021
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:40,180
of the pick. I put the toothpick in and I'm grinding it on my gum surface and it just feels

1022
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:45,060
so good to me. I still floss every day, so it's not a substitute for flossing.

1023
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:46,340
That's what I was going to say.

1024
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:47,380
Yes, not a substitute.

1025
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:48,500
Yes, I still floss every day.

1026
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:56,340
It doesn't do the same job because the floss goes around too, then go up and down, but it's benign.

1027
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:00,740
There's nothing that I don't think any wrong of doing.

1028
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:05,860
That's good because I have enough to last me, my children, my children's children, and their

1029
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:11,460
children for the rest of our lives. People talk about generational wealth. I don't have

1030
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,620
generational wealth, but I have generational toothpicks.

1031
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:19,220
Talking about that, the electric toothbrush, I like it a lot.

1032
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:26,340
I was going to ask you about that. I'm an Oral-B guy. I've tried the Braun and I've tried the Oral-B.

1033
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:32,100
Something about the Braun one bothered me. I don't know if the frequency that it vibrated at

1034
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:35,460
resonated too much with my head, but it didn't feel good.

1035
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:35,860
Yes.

1036
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:36,900
But I love the Oral-B.

1037
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:37,700
I had the same.

1038
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:40,420
Okay. Is one superior?

1039
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:42,980
I actually did clinical trials with both.

1040
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:43,220
Okay.

1041
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:51,780
They equally good. The difference is the technology. One is sonic. When you're doing

1042
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:55,460
that, it's almost a few vibrations in your head.

1043
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:55,460


1044
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:56,020
Right?

1045
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,660
Oral-B is much more like...

1046
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:00,980
It's mechanical.

1047
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:02,660
...the vibrations much more natural.

1048
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:02,980
Yeah.

1049
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:06,980
Mechanical. I love the mechanical because it simulates your gums.

1050
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:14,260
There are people who loves doing the other one. It's very fast and cleans very quick.

1051
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:19,300
I like the Oral-B a lot. That's the one that I have.

1052
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:24,340
So bottom line is they're both efficacious if you can use them both

1053
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:26,260
and use the one that you enjoy more.

1054
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:30,660
Yes. It is just whatever you're comfortable and whatever you know,

1055
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:32,820
you're going to clean your mouth. That's what I say.

1056
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:39,860
I've done anything, all types of floss, all types of toothpaste, and it's a device

1057
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:42,980
that is there for you to do your oral hygiene.

1058
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:52,100
So let's now talk about the ideal reasonable regimen of oral care.

1059
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:56,740
Let's start with what I do and use me as an example of how I could do it better.

1060
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:00,820
When I wake up in the morning, I do nothing.

1061
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:04,740
And the reason is I don't usually eat in the morning, but I drink coffee.

1062
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:08,260
So I don't know why. For some reason, I think it's a waste of time to brush my teeth first

1063
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,900
thing in the morning because all I'm going to go to do is drink coffee.

1064
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:15,220
So let's say I get up and I drink my coffee. Oh, by the way, I used to scrape my tongue.

1065
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:17,860
I have one of those tongue scrapers. I used to do that.

1066
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:20,580
And then my wife got so mad at me because she said,

1067
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:23,300
that's so disgusting. It makes me sick.

1068
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:27,380
Get rid of that stupid tongue scraping piece of expletive.

1069
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:32,900
So I still have it. Don't tell her, but I don't use it anymore.

1070
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:39,140
So I go and I drink my coffee and I kind of do all my, I usually exercise in the morning

1071
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:43,380
and I usually don't eat my first thing until maybe 11 o'clock in the morning.

1072
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:48,580
At that point, I then go and I get my oral bee toothbrush and I brush my teeth.

1073
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:53,460
And as you probably know, the oral bee toothbrush has like this little 30 second timer

1074
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:58,820
that it does, allows you to go two minutes. So I'm very, very robotic about this.

1075
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:05,300
I 30 seconds on the top, 30 seconds on the top, 30 seconds on the bottom inside, 30 seconds on

1076
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:10,500
the bottom. And then I'm done. And then I don't do anything again, except use my toothpick all day

1077
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:18,900
until dinner after dinner. I then floss. And I, I like that. I like both. I like any floss,

1078
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:23,940
actually. I just love flossing. So I'll use the little ropey floss and I'll use the tape floss,

1079
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:27,860
whatever I've got. And then I do the same thing with the oral bee toothbrush. By the way, I'm

1080
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:33,780
using a xylitol based toothpaste for what it's worth, if that matters. And that's it.

1081
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:39,380
That's it has for it has fluoride. That's that's my only oral care regimen.

1082
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:45,780
I don't use mouthwash. I don't use a water pick. I used to, but then I gave it to my daughter

1083
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:51,140
because she got braces. I figured she needed it more than I do. That's all I'm doing. So

1084
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:59,620
what could I do to be, am I getting 80% of the benefit a person can have? Am I at 60% benefit?

1085
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:07,380
And what should I, what else should I be doing? So one little adjustment. So usually back to near

1086
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:15,940
the biofilm, it takes like overnight. That's where you have the most suspicious bacteria.

1087
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:19,860
They start growing in your mouth. All those reasons that I said your mouth is closed,

1088
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:28,900
no oxygen, reduce saliva flow, sorry, by flow is almost zero because you sleep and things like so

1089
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:35,860
people, when you wake up, you feel, if you stop and thinking, you're going to see, yes,

1090
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:42,020
my mouth is dry. If you cross your tongue on the surface of your teeth, you're going to feel the

1091
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:48,980
biofilm. That's the only, that biofilm is invisible to your eyes, but you can feel with your tongue.

1092
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:55,140
That's the morning that you're going to see. So there's nothing wrong of you. I do that as well.

1093
02:02:55,140 --> 02:03:00,180
I like to take my coffee in my bed. I just read a little bit and I take my coffee without brushing.

1094
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:02,100
Brazilian coffee, I hope.

1095
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:12,900
Exactly. Espresso. Espresso. So then you get out of the bed and you brush your teeth.

1096
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:17,700
You have to wash out from your night.

1097
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:25,780
Okay. So what, so the change you're suggesting is before I begin my day, do a first brush. So I'm

1098
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:30,660
going to be now brushing my teeth three times a day. I'm going to do the first, the morning.

1099
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:31,620
That's the idea.

1100
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:38,340
Okay. And is it okay if that, should they all be done with the Oral-B toothbrush or is there a time

1101
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:45,220
and a place to just use a regular toothbrush? You can use any toothbrush if you're out. If you're

1102
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:51,140
in a place where you can brush, you can use any. If you have that, because the mechanical toothbrush,

1103
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:55,460
they do such a good job. Although I have to be honest with you, I've never been able to

1104
02:03:55,620 --> 02:04:01,060
brush my teeth, sorry, brush my tongue with the mechanical toothbrush. Because I, the, no.

1105
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:04,420
Yeah. I have to use the, okay. All right. I got it.

1106
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:10,260
You have, find a, I usually write, I like a children toothbrush.

1107
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:12,980
Yeah. So you want a soft, a versatile toothbrush, right?

1108
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:19,780
Soft, soft with the tongue. Yeah. Just get a separate one. And I tell people that every time

1109
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:25,140
that you use a toothbrush, which most people don't do as well, you rinse your toothbrush.

1110
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:31,780
You can even rinse with soap. Like put water, soap, you decontaminate. You need to clean your toothbrush.

1111
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:36,820
Oh, I never thought of that. So I, you're saying like, this is, you're really adding,

1112
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:40,820
you're, you're literally going to add another four minutes to my day. You realize that?

1113
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:48,740
Four minutes to my day, 28 minutes to my week. You know how many hours you're adding to my year?

1114
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:54,020
This is ridiculous. Well, look, it's worth it though. So, so I'm going to be healthy.

1115
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:57,140
So I'm going to now be rinsing my toothbrush with soap and water.

1116
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:01,380
If you don't want to put the soap, just rinse with water.

1117
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:06,100
Well, I always do that, but now I'm committed to doing this. Maybe salt. Would salt water be

1118
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:12,100
beneficial? You don't need, you don't need, no. Just even hand soap, just rinse with water and

1119
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:17,380
soap and dry. You have to dry because my tear loves the moisture in butter.

1120
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:23,860
I hate the taste of soap because as a child, my mom would often wash my mouth out with soap

1121
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:28,500
because of how foul a mouth I had. So I'm still traumatized by the taste of soap.

1122
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:38,340
It's an awful taste. Rinse with like hot, hot water. It is very hot. So that is soapy toothpaste

1123
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:44,340
because soap disrupts my COVID. Like the COVID can be disrupted by soap. You know that, right?

1124
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:51,300
So every toothpaste has soap because of that. Because most bacteria have the lipid protein in

1125
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:56,180
their surface. So that's why we have, but they put all the flavors. They put the fluoride. So that's

1126
02:05:56,180 --> 02:06:02,820
why they don't feel that soap taste, but that is soap and antibacterial. But, and that's all.

1127
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:08,180
Any role for mouthwash, which I don't, I don't, my wife loves it. I don't, I just,

1128
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:14,580
it's one more dumb thing that I don't do. The thing that I just like with mouthwash is that

1129
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:20,980
it kills every single, it just wipes out all your microbiome, including the good ones,

1130
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:29,140
because they're all antibacterial. So I am in favor, if you like, in a situation that you're

1131
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:36,820
not going to be able to brush much, like for short periods of time, let your body do normal,

1132
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:41,300
like recolonize with the good, without any interference. The same thing about antibiotics.

1133
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:48,420
If you take too much antibiotics, you're going to be resistant to bugs and bacteria. So if you use

1134
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:53,700
every day, in one point, you're going to have a virus in your cavity, but that's going to be

1135
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:59,540
very resistant compared to someone else. That's very interesting. Is there any evidence that

1136
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:05,540
excessive use of mouthwash, for example, leads to candidaal overgrowth or fungal overgrowth? I mean,

1137
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:13,700
that would certainly be one hypothesis worth testing. I don't remember, Peter.

1138
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:21,700
So I don't want to say anything that I don't remember, but I can go back and look. But the

1139
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:28,660
studies that I did, it changes the microflora. So that's why I'm very concerned about changing

1140
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:34,740
an oral environment that is healthy. So if you're healthy, why are you going to use the mouthwash?

1141
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:44,580
You don't need that. Okay. Anything else that we would consider best practices for the average

1142
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:51,460
person who is looking to preserve the quality function of their teeth and by extension,

1143
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:59,060
their overall health, besides what we've discussed? Well, I think everything that we discussed,

1144
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:07,860
and we talked so many times about prevention. So dental care is a chronic non-communicable

1145
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:14,580
disease, and then it's through life. People have dental care their whole life. The only way

1146
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:23,380
to control is preventing. So preventing means every six months, you need to go to a dentist,

1147
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:27,700
and you need to do a clean at a minute. At that time, they're going to look if you have any

1148
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:33,300
cavities because the cavities is a niche for the bacteria to grow as well. By the way, is six

1149
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:37,700
months a magic number? I mean, the only reason most of us go every six months is because that's what

1150
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:42,820
insurance covers for free. But if you decided you were willing to pay out of pocket, would it be

1151
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:48,180
better to go every three months or every four months to do an overall cleaning? Well, there

1152
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:56,660
is a lot of research about if you maintain a good oral health, you don't need to do more often.

1153
02:08:56,660 --> 02:09:03,940
Someone who is at high risk, you have a systemic health, you have diabetes, you can

1154
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:12,740
do three times a year, for example. But the six months is how dentists recommend it, and it's

1155
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:17,380
through research that shows cause for the dental disease, it's a very slow progression. I see.

1156
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:20,660
It's not a disease that you have today. In three months, you're going to have two

1157
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:25,940
millimeters of bone loss, unless you have something else in your body that combined with the

1158
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:33,060
inflammation that is triggering systemically, then your bone is going to go away very quick.

1159
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:37,540
But I think because for the dental disease, it's a slow progression. And I know we did a study

1160
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:44,180
three years ago that we looked at people and we measured the dental disease every two months.

1161
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:51,620
We held the treatment, we didn't do the treatment, and we watched how people would progress. And it's

1162
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:55,620
crazy. There are people who progress very quick. There are people who never progress, and there

1163
02:09:55,620 --> 02:10:00,740
people would take two years to progress. Wow. So- What do you think explain those differences?

1164
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:06,100
Systemic, because periodontal disease is a highly

1165
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:13,460
common case with your body. If you have a systemic issue, it's going to exacerbate inflammation.

1166
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:21,060
So- Wait, so you could predict the extent of disease a person has if you knew how systemically

1167
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:24,580
healthy or sick they were? Yeah, you can. If you have a lot of infections,

1168
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:29,540
you have diabetes, we know you're more susceptible to help with the dental disease. So there are

1169
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:35,780
groups of risk that those particular group, they need to see a dentist more often, they need to do

1170
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:42,500
more cleanings and they need to prevent. But there was a huge study that was done five years ago,

1171
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:48,900
but was not conclusive. It's all, they'll never know this. When they finish, they say they don't

1172
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:56,500
know which way it's coming. If it is the diabetes, that triggers or if it is the burden and the

1173
02:10:56,500 --> 02:11:04,100
orocavity that is treating the diabetes, they couldn't dissect that. I think the good news is

1174
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:09,700
they're both preventable diseases. So that again, goes back to the point of prevention.

1175
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:18,340
Well, Pat, this has been super interesting. Just on a purely selfish basis, I learned a lot. So

1176
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:25,860
that will immediately go into practice effective, I guess, tonight and tomorrow morning. So thank

1177
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:31,780
you very much for the insights you've shared. And I think people will take a lot of practical

1178
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:35,780
information from this. Very welcome. It was my pleasure.
