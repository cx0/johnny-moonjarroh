00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,920
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
along with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,680
years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,120
this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,040
a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,040
Welcome to episode one of the Peter Attia drive. I can think of no better person to begin this

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,880
podcast with than my very dear friend, Tim Ferriss. Not only is Tim a really close friend,

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,960
but he's also almost single handedly the reason this podcast is coming into existence. In other

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,560
words, if you hate it, you can blame Tim. Tim has been kind of on my case for about two years to do

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:10,040
this. And more than anything else, he's just really helped me think about how I can sort of put

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,480
something together that allows me to create something that is sort of new and isn't already

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,560
out there in terms of content, but also is something that I'll find enjoyable to do. And

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,360
that hopefully will come across as this podcast gets underway. I'm guessing most people listening

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,280
to this know a lot about Tim, but on the off chance that there are some who don't, I think it's just

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,240
worth kind of giving a little bit of background on Tim. He's been described as a quote, a cross

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,960
between Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk by the New York Times. He's one of fast companies, most

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,520
innovative business people. He's an early stage tech investor and advisor. And that includes a

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,440
number of companies that most people have heard of such as Uber, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify,

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,040
Alibaba, and at least 50 others. He's also the author of five number one New York Times best

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,320
sellers and Wall Street Journal best sellers. The four hour work week, the four hour body,

23
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,160
the four hour chef, tools of Titans, also known as biggest tools. That's an inside joke in reference

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,720
to the podcast and tribe of mentors. The observer and other media outlets have described him as the

25
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,400
Oprah of audio due to the influence of his podcast, the Tim Ferriss show, which has about 300 million

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,120
downloads at the time of this recording. It's also been selected as the best of iTunes for three

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,240
years running. Now I want to say something about this episode that will become apparent obviously

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,040
once we get started. One, we talk a lot about things that are topics that Tim and I don't really

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,040
spend a lot of time discussing publicly and certainly personally. And so it's important

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,080
to understand here that while Tim and I do talk quite openly about psychedelic experiences we've

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,160
shared in South America, it shouldn't be taken to mean that that's what we're recommending that

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,960
anybody go out and do. We're absolutely not doing that. There are physical, there are psychological,

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,920
and there are legal risks among these things. And it's important to remember that in the United

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,200
States at the time of this recording psychedelics like psilocybin, which we speak about quite a bit

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,760
along with mescaline and things that we don't get into much detail around such as ayahuasca,

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,120
these are currently schedule one, which means that they are illegal. And while we believe obviously

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,320
that that designation is completely unwarranted and will likely, you know, eventually no longer

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,040
be the case when the scientific community has a chance to catch up and understand the great

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,920
potential of these things, really the purpose of this podcast is informational only. And while

40
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,880
I do generally provide a disclaimer at the end of my podcast that explains that all of this

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,600
information is informational, I want to be really clear about this particular issue. We talk a lot

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,840
about these things, we talk about a few other things as well, and I think even for the listener

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,040
who doesn't find this topic to be particularly interesting, one thing that we talk about at the

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,680
very end of the podcast that I'd been meaning to ask Tim for a while, and certainly I get asked a

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,560
lot is, what are the things that you still incorporate in your daily routine? Tim has

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,880
written so eloquently about this stuff and has codified so many ways to find these minimum

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,360
effective doses and to optimize everything he's doing, that I think people wonder, hey,

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,360
which are the things that have really stood the test of time? And so I actually found that last

49
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,040
part of the podcast to be especially interesting, even for me, though I knew these things and I can

50
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,960
see all the things that Tim does day in and day out, but to sort of have him say, look, if I had to

51
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,000
pick five, these would be the five. Tim can be found all over the place, but I think the best

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,960
places to see him are on his blog, which is tim.blog. You can follow him at Tferris, that's F-E-R-R-I-S-S,

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:38,600
on Twitter, and you find him at Tim Fares on Facebook and Instagram. I hope you enjoy this

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,800
first episode half as much as I enjoyed recording it, and there will be lots more of these to follow.

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:54,360
So with all of that said, please welcome Tim Fares. Hey, Tim. Peter. Thank you for having me

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,280
out in Austin this weekend. My pleasure. It's been a good weekend. Good view too. Yeah. What I can't

57
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,960
believe is in the relatively short period of time you have lived here, you've become essentially the

58
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:14,600
unofficial mayor of Austin. Well, I like to get involved and to explore all the various nooks and

59
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,880
crannies of any city that I live in. And after 17 years in the Bay Area, I felt like I'd left almost

60
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,880
no stone unturned. Many dear friends are still there, but many of them have traveled outside. And

61
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,800
one of the places that was an annual migration was South by Southwest here in Austin and had wanted

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,440
to move here right after college, gotten to know it year by year with increasingly longer stays

63
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,880
in the city before and after the festival itself. And now it's home. Couldn't be happier. I feel like

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,360
every place we went in the last three days, everybody knew you like the owner of the

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,920
restaurant would know you and the coffee shop. And it was, I don't think I've drank more coffee

66
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:08,600
and Topo Chico in a short period of time. Yes. Coffee, Topo Chico. And so many things here.

67
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,680
Yeah. Breakfast tacos is something I haven't yet explored. That's another form of religion here

68
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,200
right next to barbecue and a bunch of other things, but it's a cozy feel. It has a neighborhood

69
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:29,080
feel and I've come to value that type of neighborhood feel and cohesion, which is

70
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,080
something I probably wouldn't have paid much attention to 10 years ago. Yeah. I've sort of

71
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,240
always assumed I would live forever in California. And I got to say all your hard work here to get

72
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,520
your friends to move out here. I think it's going to pay off. I think I can see Austin in my future.

73
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:54,440
Yeah. I have a lot of friends who are moving and I think in many respects, it's defined by the fact

74
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,560
that it's difficult to categorize. There is no one mono conversation about tech or entertainment or

75
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,160
finance. And some people might view that as a weakness, meaning if you're looking to live

76
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,400
in the epicenter of a certain industry and you're in your early twenties and want to cut your teeth

77
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,360
and live that hyperkinetic, super aggressive lifestyle while you're building your foundation

78
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:29,880
for the future. That's one thing. But in my case, I much more so am placing value on the general

79
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,680
friendliness, the cultural diversity, which is not just skin deep. It covers so many different

80
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:44,520
bases here. And I enjoy the fact that you can go from a strict vegan restaurant to a

81
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:52,760
deer processing plant to an electric scooter startup office to a cowboy boot store all in

82
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,520
the stretch of a few blocks. That's exciting to me. And though I've never really bought the

83
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,440
argument that people in New York and Southern California, which are the two places I spend

84
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,040
most of my time are, you know, I've never bought the argument that those are snotty,

85
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,280
super snotty places and nobody's nice. Because I do think that people are actually pretty decent

86
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,840
everywhere, including in the middle of Manhattan. But that said, it's a different level of nice here

87
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,760
that is completely foreign to me. Yeah, it is. I remember when I first moved to Austin and I had

88
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,400
a number of neighbors drop off cards or come to the door to ring the bell to ask if I want to come

89
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,200
over for dinner. And I didn't even know how to respond, which, which really, you're like, what

90
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,160
are they selling me more about myself that I was so mistrusting perhaps, but in San Francisco,

91
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,200
that does not happen. As far as I know, I've never heard of that happening. Certainly in New York,

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,360
it'd be, you know, time to check your security system and, and consider your, your avenues of

93
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,640
getting out of the house. But here, that's just par for the course. And it's, it's really been nice

94
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:08,520
to embrace that. And even within Texas, Austin is known for being very, very friendly. And I've,

95
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,280
I've met many different people here who've moved from Houston and other parts, which are also

96
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,920
fantastic in their own way because of the general level of friendliness. So I'm a fan. I'm a fan.

97
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,400
You know, I always thought I would be felt the gravitational pull here when I graduated.

98
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:31,240
And did not get the job here that I was so coveted at trilogy. And it turned out being a blessing

99
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,840
disguise that I didn't get the job. And I think also for trilogy, because I most likely would have

100
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,640
been a terrible employee. But that took me to NorCal had a great stint there. But that chapter

101
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,880
came to a close and it was just the right time. Well, as I said, it's been amazing to be here,

102
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,320
not my first time here, but each time I come, I like it more and more. And I guess with that said,

103
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:01,320
we are kicking off effectively the first episode of a podcast that you more than any other friend,

104
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,800
although several friends have played an enormous role in the so-called cajoling, as I referred to

105
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,680
it earlier in making this happen. So if this ends up sucking, I'll take all the blame. I'm blaming you.

106
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,440
If this ends up doing okay, I'm thanking you. But either way, I think this has been,

107
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,640
this will be fun. I think my customary 30% is very reasonable.

108
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,520
30% of what, right?

109
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,440
Now, obviously, this podcast is on some level and probably on a large level going to come down to

110
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,920
things that I think a lot about and hope to bring to people. You asked me the other day,

111
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,240
you know, what am I hoping to accomplish with this? And I don't have a great elevator pitch on it.

112
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,000
But one of the things is I find myself so often having conversations with people that I think,

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
God, this person is so much smarter than me and knows so much more than me. And they're letting

114
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,680
me be a sponge right now and absorb so much information from them. And so many times I find

115
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,920
myself at the end of those discussions thinking, I can't believe nobody else got to hear that.

116
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,840
What if I didn't extract everything from that correctly? What if there was more to be gathered?

117
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,080
And so it's really that desire to sort of have as many of these conversations as possible and be able

118
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,680
to sort of share them in their natural state that I think is a large part of this motivation. And

119
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,560
while most people sort of associate me, I suspect with thinking about longevity, we probably don't

120
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,240
spend enough time talking about what longevity means. But the way I talk about it with my patients

121
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,200
is it's both enhancing lifespan, but also health span and lifespan is the easier of those two to

122
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,000
understand because enhancing lifespan just means not dying, which is not to say that that's easy.

123
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,040
But it's conceptually easy. I think the health span stuff is harder to understand.

124
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,960
And as I have come to learn in the past three or four years, I believe for most people,

125
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,120
it actually matters more. Many people think, you know, if you helping me doesn't add one day to

126
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,160
the length of my life, but improves the quality of my life, especially at the end, that would be

127
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,680
sufficient. And so in many ways, I want to talk about today is one piece of health span that I

128
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,000
I know the least about by far, but also I think is the one that we are least likely to talk about

129
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,200
as a society, which is sort of mental health. Now, you've spoken really publicly about your

130
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,760
interest in that. I knew a lot of this before you talked about it at TED, but can you tell me a

131
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,600
little bit about that? I can. And I'm thrilled you're doing a podcast. Because I do think that

132
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,160
just as as a bit of overlay on what you said, there is so much focus on extending lifespan,

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:38,680
rightly so. But the equal obsession equal level of obsession that you bring to performance and

134
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,520
health span, I think, creates a compelling combination that I don't find in many places,

135
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,520
I find the combination of those interests very common, but the combination of competencies,

136
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,760
broadly speaking, in both of those domains is very uncommon. So I'm excited to listen to

137
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:05,960
other episodes of the podcast. And as it relates to mental health, I should as maybe an introductory

138
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,400
preamble say that this is not a topic I've always been comfortable talking about publicly. And

139
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,760
in fact, I would say for the vast majority of my adolescents, and certainly throughout high school

140
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,400
and college, I somehow came to the conclusion that I was just not designed to be happy, that

141
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,320
evolution did not optimize for happiness. And I just did not have the code for happy. And that

142
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,640
was okay, that I would be an instrument of competition, I would learn to be good at various

143
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:52,440
things that were valued at colleges, and then by the business worlds and so on, and that it was

144
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:08,840
it was not worth trying to be happy or to not just love myself, but really have a high opinion

145
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,040
of myself. And in fact, that was self indulgent, and that I would just focus on being the best

146
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,880
competitor possible and hopefully turning that into something that was not only of value to me

147
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,960
or that I was rewarded for, but that would help other people and that perhaps I would find some

148
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:31,480
joy in the joy of other people, but that was the extent of it. And suffered from many different

149
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,600
bouts of extended depression, for as long as I can recall, really, and that is also something that

150
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:47,560
you can spot very easily looking back at my family history on both sides. And if you look back to

151
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,480
grandparents and great-great-grandparents, a fair amount of alcohol consumption, certainly a fair

152
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,680
amount of alcoholism. I thankfully have not soothed myself with excessive amounts of alcohol, but you

153
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,080
see a lot of patterns that scared me certainly, but the depression was one that I could just not

154
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:15,560
seemingly navigate around. And the TED Talk opened with a particularly close call, the closest call

155
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,880
I've ever had. This is not a common experience for me, but in college where I came very, very close

156
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,840
to killing myself and actually got to the planning stages, it wasn't just rumination about what if I

157
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,440
wonder what it would be like to take my life. No, it was a decision that had been made and I was

158
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,400
already in the planning stages. And to give people the short punchline to that, which explains why

159
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,520
I'm here today, I had reserved a book, which was going to be the last of many that I had read on

160
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,840
this subject related to suicide. It was already checked out of the Firestone Library at Princeton,

161
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,840
where I was at the time taking a year away from. And it was checked out to some other poor student,

162
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:06,760
so I put in a request to be notified when it came back into the library. But I forgot to update my

163
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,120
address at the registrar's office. And the address that I had on file after taking this leave of

164
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,880
absence was my home address in New York where my parents lived. And so my mom got this postcard,

165
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,680
which was, dear Tim Ferriss, this is to notify you that, and then whatever it was, you know,

166
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,400
the final solution, da da da da da, whatever it might have been, the how to kill yourself manual

167
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,600
has arrived. Please come to claim your book within the next X number of weeks, or it'll be released to

168
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,680
the next person who has it on reservation, whatever the postcard said. And I got this very

169
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:46,440
heartfelt, understandably nervous call from my mom with her voice cracking, asking about it. And I

170
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,920
lied. I said it was I was very fast on my feet. And I said it was for a friend at Rutgers who

171
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:57,320
wasn't able to get the book for a dissertation or a thesis he was working on. So I reserved it for

172
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:05,240
him. No, everything's fine. But in that moment after that call, I realized how these, in retrospect,

173
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:13,400
little waves, small events can be blown, or even large events can be blown so out of proportion

174
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:21,560
or seen as permanent in such a way that regardless of socioeconomic status, regardless of race,

175
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,200
regardless of gender, people can be so knocked off course, that they end up taking their own lives.

176
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,960
And certainly recently, that's been very dramatically demonstrated and tragically

177
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,080
demonstrated with the deaths of many people, including Anthony Bourdain, who comes to mind

178
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,640
most recently. And that's just on the high profile side. But in my case, personally, I realized how

179
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,920
my blinders and pessimism in this downward spiral had led me to really only focus on my pain. I

180
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:02,200
didn't realize how until that phone call committing suicide would have been like taking 10 times the

181
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,840
pain that I felt and imposing it on the people who loved me the most. And that was a huge wake

182
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:18,600
up call. So that is why I'm here today is the lucky accident that I did not update my address

183
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,640
at the registrar's office. And if that had not happened, I mean, I was ready to pull the trigger,

184
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,840
so to speak, although that wasn't how I was going to go. But it was all specked out. It's terrifying

185
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,360
to think of really, really terrifying to think of. And I have some of my best friends in high school,

186
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,720
who you never would have suspected from the outside looking in killed themselves college,

187
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,680
same story. I just know so many people who have taken their own lives. And it always came as a

188
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:57,000
shock to people, at least who knew them in school, for instance, they seem to have it all together.

189
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,560
They seem to have the good relationship or the good job or the good grades or whatever it might

190
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,560
be the good family. And that's led me in the last few years in particular to at the very least,

191
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,560
want to focus on discussing mental health, different facets of mental health,

192
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,280
from an experiential firsthand basis, simply to tell people if assuming I don't have any type of

193
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,480
ready answer for them, you are not alone. This is exceptionally, exceptionally common.

194
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,720
But it's the dirty little secret that so many people carry around and are unwilling to discuss.

195
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,560
And so at the very least, I want to say, you're not alone. There are millions upon millions of

196
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,320
people fighting similar battles, and everyone you meet is fighting some inner battle you know nothing

197
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,360
about. So do not assume that you're alone. And I think in that, hopefully people can find some

198
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,880
solace. And then beyond that, I've spent the last few years really investigating using the

199
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,440
contacts and network that I've developed through the books and the podcast and the tech investing

200
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,240
to explore avenues and potential treatments or interventions that can certainly help people who

201
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,360
are on the brink get back to stability potentially, but also to take people who are, who might view

202
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,600
themselves as stable or normal and to mitigate against the potential of losing their footing.

203
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:38,440
And then there are, we can go beyond that certainly. But that is the my interest in this

204
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,160
certainly began on a very personal level. How do I, is it possible, I should say, forget about

205
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:51,880
how is it possible for me to manage this? And the type of thinking that triggers the most dangerous

206
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,160
downward spirals is what's the point if I'm if I'm constantly going to default to this

207
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:07,800
negative thinking, and I'm so blessed for A, B and C reasons, what's the point? And that is a really,

208
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:16,040
really poisonous, toxic mental landscape to immerse yourself into and get caught in. So is it

209
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:23,320
possible for me to somehow decrease the frequency of those types of episodes? Is it possible somehow

210
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:31,320
to decrease the severity of those episodes? Is it possible to look at my quirky biochemistry, my

211
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,200
software in a way that I see some blessings within my day-to-day month-to-month experience,

212
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:45,640
that in some way counteract the tendency to view myself so harshly when the inevitable dips come?

213
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:54,280
Long answer to a short question, but that's really been particularly in the last, I would say, two

214
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,840
years, three, mostly starting about five years ago, but in the last two or three, really diverting a

215
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,720
lot of my attention that was going to start up investing a lot of my resources that were going

216
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,280
to start up investing to areas that are related to this. And there's so much of that stuff I can't

217
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,560
wait to talk about today, because you've brought a lot of people along on this ride with you. So

218
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,040
obviously, I can only speak from my own personal experience, but we have so many mutual friends who

219
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,800
have also been heavily influenced by sort of a sense of awareness that you've brought to us with

220
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,120
respect to all of these things, but also potential solution spaces that are outside of our realm of

221
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,400
thinking. You said something at the outset, which was, you just thought you weren't wired to be happy,

222
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,800
which I mean, I can resonate with that completely. I remember as a child, my mom would always say to

223
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,680
me, Peter, do you just not want to be happy? And I would look at her like, I don't know what kind

224
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,200
of dumb question that is. It's not an option. You might as well be asking me if I want to be 12 feet

225
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,520
tall. Like I have some say in the matter. It's not about wanting to be happy. It's just about

226
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,920
metaphysically not being able to be happy. And then furthermore, my thought, which was even a

227
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,760
bit more obscure or maybe bizarre was happiness was a bad thing because you would stop being hungry.

228
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,840
Makes you complacent. Yes. So right along with self-indulgence, there was that.

229
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,960
Yeah, it was like, Mom, if I was happy, I wouldn't get up at 430 in the morning and run

230
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,440
harder and faster than anybody else to. And of course, I didn't have the,

231
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,640
I don't think I had the mental framework to probe that idea further, which is what are you proving?

232
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,360
Who are you proving it to? Why do you feel the need to do all of these things? But it wasn't until

233
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,320
quite recently that I even began to entertain the idea that being happy is not a bad thing.

234
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,880
Put another way that it's a good thing. Yeah. The double negative. Yeah. Right. Right.

235
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,520
Just to touch on a few things that you just mentioned, which I think are really important.

236
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:53,000
And the self-talk Jim Lehrer, who's a performance coach who has worked with many,

237
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,800
many of the most famous tennis players and other athletes in the world. I had a chance to spend

238
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,400
time with him for my last book and then also for some tennis training in Florida. And he's,

239
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,520
he spent time with one of my very close friends, Josh Waitskin, as well, who's, who's best known

240
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,520
for being the basis for searching for Bobby Fischer, for those people who are familiar.

241
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:21,960
And he talks a lot about the inner voice, the most important coach and voice you ever hear

242
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,640
is your inner voice. So I've learned to pay increasing attention to the words I use,

243
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:35,400
particularly when I'm ruminating, referring to myself, talking to myself, making a note to self.

244
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:45,240
That's a long story inside joke, guys. Another time. And I found myself using perhaps very

245
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:52,440
unsurprisingly similar language to yourself. If I were happy, I wouldn't be doing the things that

246
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:00,600
are very clearly contributing to my success, whatever that means. And not only that, but

247
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:10,360
on every possible level, if I were to find joy in too many moments, or to not feel deficient or

248
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,880
inadequate, or loath, loath, worthy, which is honestly how I've, I felt for the majority of my

249
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,560
life. No, I don't just not love myself. Like there's a deep sense of, well, I hate to use the

250
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,880
word hate, but it's the right word. Like loathing, like how could you be so stupid? How could you be

251
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,840
so lazy? How could you be so fill in the blank, toughen the fuck up. And you may not have control

252
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,400
over all things, but you know what you can get really, really good at doing is absorbing pain.

253
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,280
I get really good at absorbing pain. It's like, okay, if you work hard and have a high pain

254
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:51,160
tolerance, maybe you can win. Maybe you can be successful. And I should put win in successful in

255
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,040
quotation marks because they're so seldom well-defined by people who use this type of

256
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,800
language, including myself for decades. But what I've come to realize, and this, this is also a,

257
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:08,440
I think a common concern among type A personalities who consider or are told by people they respect

258
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,160
that they should take a stab at meditation for a period of time. There is this highly prevalent,

259
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,840
almost universal concern among type A personalities, by which I just mean driven,

260
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,320
like hard charging head through walls. I can take the pain, fuck it. I'm just going to grip

261
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,440
my teeth and white knuckle through anything that comes my way, which, hey, let's, let's face it,

262
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,280
that serves people very well up to a point in certain ways. They worry about losing their edge.

263
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,040
This is the exact wording that I hear so often in the exact wording that I use with my friends when

264
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,080
they first recommended a few of them, Rick Rubin and Chase Jarvis, very specifically Rick Rubin,

265
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,680
legendary music producer, although that doesn't even, it's not even a drop in the ocean of what

266
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,800
Rick does and who Rick is, but Rick Rubin and then Chase, very, very famous photographer,

267
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,520
also the CEO of a company called Creative Live, which is an incredible company in and of itself.

268
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,880
Both of them recommended meditation to me and I resisted for more than a year, I want to say,

269
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,480
because I was afraid of losing my edge. Even though what I came to realize was,

270
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:25,320
if you want to use your edge indiscriminately, like a kitchen knife, which is only a blade,

271
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,240
like the handle is also bladed on both sides, you can continue doing what you're doing. If on the

272
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,680
other hand, you want to put a nice ergonomic handle on that beautifully honed blade so that

273
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:45,160
you can use it as an instrument for its highest purposes, you can utilize different tools,

274
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,080
meditation being one of them. And we could talk about all the different types of meditation as

275
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,760
well, because I think they do have slightly different applications, is a tool in the toolkit

276
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,920
that allows you to build this beautiful kitchen knife instead of holding onto the blade itself,

277
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:07,160
just bleeding over and over again, scabbing, bleeding, scabbing, bleeding, which is I think

278
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:14,360
day to day how many driven people experience life, whether they are financially stable or not,

279
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:23,960
if they are compulsively active, if they are using the distraction of constant motion and absorbing

280
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,320
pain and seeking pain to numb themselves so that they don't have to be in their own head any longer

281
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,840
than possible, which is what I did for a fucking long time, pardon my French, but I mean decades.

282
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:47,640
If they're able to develop other skills that allow them to, and I've certainly less than seeking

283
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,960
happiness, I have been looking for ways to both develop in myself and help others to develop a

284
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:03,800
sense of peace, even if it's 10 minutes a day, that does nothing negative in my book other than

285
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,400
magnify your strengths and allow you to maybe for the first time, see some of your weaknesses that

286
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:17,800
are very often self-imposed. And the blind spots that have been like an invisible hand guiding your

287
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:25,320
life for, in some cases, decades. I see no, I really see no downside to that. And since I've

288
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,080
had two cappuccinos and I guess have some extra personality, I'll further extend my long-ass answer

289
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:41,400
by saying my books very clearly track my priorities in some respects. You have the four-hour work week,

290
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,640
which looked at different types of currencies, time being the most valuable non-renewable

291
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:59,000
of those, and how to address a few rungs on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And as I've moved along

292
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,840
and suffered my own burnout of different types, not necessarily financially related, but certainly

293
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,920
four-hour chef took me out for the count. I bit off more than I could chew in part because I was

294
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,720
having some personal difficulties and some relationships and I wanted to numb myself. I

295
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,400
went back to that numbing behavior, which included taking stimulants, which included over-caffeinating,

296
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:29,320
in addition to the pills and so on, using alcohol at night to wind down, engaging in exercise that

297
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,880
was far more painful and ridiculously punishing than it had to be for any type of health or

298
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:45,000
performance purpose. And I crashed and burned and that led to the podcast as a way to take a

299
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,240
break from book writing, which led to the explorations and talking to people like Brene Brown,

300
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,640
talking to people like Tara Brock, talking to people like Jack Kornfield, and many, many others

301
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,680
that then led to say, Trava mentors or Tools of Titans, then Trava mentors and where I am now,

302
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:06,200
where I look at this Maslow's hierarchy of needs and realize, at least for myself,

303
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:14,040
let's say you cover your food, you cover your shelter, you cover and you get up to these

304
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:22,040
rungs on the ladder where you've checked off success. You are blessed, you are hopefully

305
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,320
healthy, your family might be healthy, and you can meet all of your basic needs and probably

306
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,400
have some disposable income and yet you have trouble living with yourself. That's a fucking

307
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:47,080
tragedy. I mean, it's to have deciphered how to achieve and yet not be able to appreciate

308
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:55,080
is that it's just the tragedy of tragedies. It's this kind of fools errand that could have taken

309
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,240
five years, could have taken 10, could have taken 20. And then you see people like that who

310
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:07,240
do not know which way to turn and then perhaps just withdraw into a shell and sit at a table with

311
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,680
their family and look at their phone for the entire dinner over and over and over again,

312
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,120
because they don't know how to emotionally engage with themselves, let alone other people.

313
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,000
Or you see the more dramatic cases where they're like, all right, I thought these things would

314
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,600
make me happy. I was told these things were the necessary ingredients for eventually solving this

315
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,320
emotional Rubik's Cube that I've been struggling with my whole life, where I assumed that poof,

316
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,520
one day I would just wake up and have made it. Even if having made it just means you're not

317
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,880
struggling with alcoholism and rent like your parents did or something like that.

318
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:49,560
And I've come to realize you don't need to and you should not wait until you think you have all of

319
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:56,520
the other pieces, non emotional, non psychological pieces of the puzzle together to start working on

320
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:02,440
self acceptance, among other things, and untying some of those Gordian knots that you have that

321
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:11,720
you might have carried for decades since your childhood. And that it is not esoteric, it is not

322
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:18,920
intangible when you start to address some of those things. It makes everything more effortless,

323
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:28,280
it makes everything more rewarding. And that I think is a project worth tackling. It's a lot,

324
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:35,480
but that's yeah, this this depression, I think, particularly among men who are very, very, very

325
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,400
bad, generally, and I'm just going to paint with a broad brush, because that makes this type of

326
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,240
conversation a little easier. But broadly speaking, cross across cultures, it really doesn't matter

327
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:54,120
where you go. Women are generally better at social cohesion and building groups of friends

328
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,080
who are mutually supportive. And we look at it through an evolutionary lens, but men very often

329
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:08,120
are biologically culturally who knows fill in the blank trained and maybe born to just bite their

330
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,880
lip and suffer in silence. And I do think there are certain places for that look, if you're going

331
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,400
to be a Navy SEAL commander, waking up every morning and like telling your direct reports,

332
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,200
like about your really hard dream you had, probably not like strategically, tactically,

333
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,000
professionally, or ethically, the right thing to do when you have to go out and then risk your lives,

334
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,280
doing things that are mission critical to fill in the blank, right? So there is a time for that. But

335
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:40,280
to make that your one coping mechanism for navigating life, or like the sort of the mesh

336
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,720
that is imposed on everything else that you suffer in silence, and that the solution to that is just

337
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:55,480
to get tougher, to get better at accepting pain, to use cheesy tech parlance doesn't scale. It just

338
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,120
doesn't scale. You know, when I was on your podcast, the first time, which I don't know how long ago that

339
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,640
was, it feels like it's probably been three or four years ago. One of the questions I remember you

340
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,720
asked me, which of course you asked many of your guests is what book have you gifted more than any

341
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,640
other? And I remember the book I mentioned at the time, it was and remains a great book, but

342
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,520
I now have to update that answer. What wasn't just for people who were curious? It was Mistakes Were

343
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,840
Made, but Not by Me, which is just an amazing book on the psychology of cognitive dissonance.

344
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,960
But of course, that now has been surpassed. There is now a new book that is my most gifted book.

345
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,040
And amazingly, I can't believe I didn't bring a copy to Austin to give you because I now

346
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,560
I probably I think I just buy Amazon out of this book. Like I just have stacks of it all over. Like

347
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,720
you have stacks of certain books in your place. And this book is called I Don't Want to Talk About

348
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,560
It by Terrence Reel, who have since reading the book and becoming obsessed with actually it comes

349
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:54,360
back to you. You introduced me to Esther Perel. Esther recommended the book. The book was one of

350
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,000
a series of little nudges that ultimately led to me meeting Terry. And of course, that book has now

351
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,920
been the book I have given most. But what you said is spot on, which is there is just this epidemic

352
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,240
of male depression. And it's not always overt. That's the thing, right? People have this image

353
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,560
of what depression is. But, you know, like a guy who's constantly angry or emotionally volatile,

354
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,800
he can be quite depressed. So depression isn't always dysthymia. And I think that's where people

355
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,960
miss this idea of how much pain people both men and women carry around, but how men have this

356
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,400
more orthogonal way of displaying it that makes it get masked longer and longer. And I want to go

357
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,600
back to something you said earlier, because it really hit home about a year ago when a mutual

358
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:51,240
friend of ours, Paul Conti, made this point to me, which was the way you treat yourself is

359
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:58,040
ultimately how you will treat those you love most. And, you know, when he really pushed me to think

360
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,640
about that, which is, do you want to be the guy who treats his kids the way you treat yourself?

361
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:12,200
And I had to be put that way for me to think, no, I mean, if I'm going to be brutally honest,

362
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,080
I would not want to watch my kids get treated by another human the way I treat myself,

363
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,680
even though I think it's good for me to treat myself this way. So again, I think the challenge is,

364
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,480
by far, the hardest part is getting people to accept that maybe what they're doing isn't the

365
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,960
right thing, or isn't it maybe writes the wrong word? It's not the best thing. It's not the optimal

366
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,080
thing. I loved your analogy of taking the best blade in the world and not having a handle on it.

367
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:47,080
I mean, it's a limited tool. Yeah. And there are so I would say, just to maybe put a fine point on it,

368
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,960
going through life merely tolerating yourself, which would have been a dream for me, I mean, I

369
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:02,040
actively loathed myself and any weakness, any mistake, any foible, any flaw I was,

370
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:11,880
I was, and still at times, I'm so incredibly, violently critical in my own head that it is not

371
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:20,760
the treatment I would wish on anyone I care about. That is not a state you have to accept.

372
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:30,360
It is not programming that you have to accept. And there are ways to begin to chip away at that

373
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:39,400
and to rewire it and to reformat in a sense, certain behaviors that you've experienced for

374
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,520
so long, many of them are thought patterns, self talk, that you've come to believe they're

375
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:51,400
completely unchangeable. And in my experience, and more and more the experience of dozens and

376
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,880
hundreds of that and thousands of other people I've observed in the last five years, it is

377
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:03,000
is patent, it is patently untrue that you have to accept them. And I think what you said is really,

378
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,280
really important to digest and ponder. And that is how you treat yourself is how you are going to

379
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,280
treat the people you care most about. And I think it was actually Gloria Steinem who had a quote,

380
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,760
and I don't know if this is accurate, but somebody on the internet, I'm sure will fact check this,

381
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,360
who said, in effect, I'm paraphrasing here, but the goal, you have to remember that the golden

382
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,800
rule goes both ways. So we all know, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

383
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:44,040
If you flip that around, it is do unto yourself as you would do unto others. And that is really has

384
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,760
very profound and wide-wrenching implications. When you really sit with it for a minute.

385
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:58,520
And suffice to say, though, you do not have to accept the inner voice or the patterns that have

386
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:04,840
led you to pursue success with rare glimpses of any type of inner peace that is not something you

387
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:12,600
have to accept. So one of the most sort of profound experiences I've had, sets of experiences I've had

388
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:19,400
in the past few years, are experiences we've shared together around certain plants. That

389
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,760
honestly, I was completely unaware of and ignorant of for most of my life, had never really given

390
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:31,320
them any thought. And probably much of the stuff that you've talked about, written about in the

391
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,440
past in particular, there were two podcasts that you did. One was with Martin and I'm trying to

392
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,280
think who the other one was. Martin Polanco and Dan Engel. Dan Engel, that was the other one. Yeah.

393
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,320
And those were two separate podcasts, but they were very close together, if I recall.

394
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,640
They were a couple of months apart. There were a few together and then a few apart. So you had

395
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:56,920
James Fadiman and then Dan Engel and Martin together. That's right. And then later Michael

396
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:05,240
Pollan. Yeah. But that first wave was probably 2015-ish. Yeah, it was a few years ago. That

397
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,440
was the thin end of the wedge. And interestingly, the thin end of the wedge for me was around

398
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,400
something that wasn't a personal issue, but more of a societal issue, which is I was blown away by

399
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:22,200
the discussion and the clinical results that they were achieving in Mexico using a plant called

400
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:28,440
Iboga and using Ibogaine as well to treat patients who were opiate addicted. And that's something

401
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,880
that even back when I was sort of in my residency and you would see in a city like Baltimore what

402
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,640
the effects of heroin addiction are. And of course today it's even a much bigger issue and it's spread

403
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,160
far beyond just heroin. So that just interested me purely from an intellectual standpoint, which is

404
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,160
wait a minute, we have a drug or set of drugs that are so categorically addictive to so many

405
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:00,600
for which our only treatments are at best useless. And there's this other thing that

406
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:07,080
admittedly comes with plenty of risk and plenty of unknowns, but it seems to fundamentally change

407
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,800
the way a person's brain is wired, which would seem to address the root issue as opposed to

408
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,800
the bandaid. That led of course to me wanting to understand more about those entire classes of

409
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,680
compounds. And that led to my very first experience with them, which I shared with you, meaning which

410
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,120
you helped me through, which to this day remains one of the most profound things I've ever done.

411
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,360
And if anybody's listening to this who's thinking, what are they talking about? What are these

412
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,480
psychedelic agents? Aren't those drugs? You know, all these things. One of the most remarkable

413
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,000
things I remember after the first time I tried psilocybin was I don't feel like doing that again

414
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:56,600
anytime soon. These are the most anti addictive compounds on the planet. What started your interest

415
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,880
into that space? The interest began. And for those people listening who are wondering if we'll

416
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,680
discuss any other tools, I think we should also discuss some other options on the table aside from

417
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:12,680
this, although this is very fertile ground for discussion. So we can talk about meditation,

418
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:18,920
some other tools and books and so on later. But the, my interest in psychedelics began

419
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:30,600
long ago with a close friend who introduced me to psilocybin contained in what is commonly called

420
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:39,960
magic mushrooms, must have been in college midpoint, perhaps in college. And it became an annual

421
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:47,320
ritual. And once a year, I would meet up with a few of my closest friends and we would consume

422
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,840
mushrooms in retrospect, it was very haphazard. We were not measuring any doses. We just have a big

423
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:59,480
bag of mushrooms and split it up and then hope for the best, which is not ideally how you go about

424
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:08,040
things. And nonetheless, despite the lack of controls, and I do not recommend anyone use these

425
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:17,000
compounds under uncontrolled circumstances, I experienced what I began to refer to as a reboot.

426
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,240
And I would have this anxiety and depression plaguing me. I would go very, very deep. And

427
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:32,600
looking back now, I was almost certainly consuming minimum of five grams. I'm sure I was consuming

428
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:41,080
quite a high dose of mushrooms, which is for those people who might read the writing or listen

429
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,040
to some of the presentations of someone in Terrence McKenna, five grams is referred to as a heroic

430
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,160
dose. And that is a dose sufficient to flatten even the most resistant ego, I believe is the

431
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:59,960
wording that was used. In any case, I felt this decrease or even complete removal of depression

432
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:07,800
anxiety that extended far beyond the supposed duration of effect. Let's just call it five to

433
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,680
eight hours. And there would be this afterglow period that certainly lasted most acutely for

434
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,640
a day or two after the experience. And I was going into this also with none of the best practices

435
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:26,440
that we know of now in terms of preparation, intention setting, perhaps some of the preparatory

436
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,440
steps you can take and then integration. There's none of that. So this was very bare bones,

437
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,920
haphazard experimentation with few friends. Nonetheless, there were these periods of,

438
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:48,360
let's just call it two weeks to two months where I was able to finally see things clearly, appreciate

439
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:56,760
all of the incredible chance blessings that I experienced in my life and make decisions about

440
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,440
things I viewed as serious problems or challenges or opportunities, whether it was

441
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,880
making a decision about academics, making a decision about a relationship to either start

442
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,040
a relationship or end a long standing relationship. These were things I was able to look at very

443
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:21,960
calmly and make decisions about. And ultimately, after I want to say four or five years of this,

444
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:28,120
had a very, very, very scary and dangerous experience, which was again with no sitters,

445
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,720
in other words, no sober person supervising this. Any number of things can go wrong. And

446
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,320
one is people can wander around and get themselves into dangerous situations. And in my case,

447
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:47,240
I ended up coming out of my trip very late at night, walking on the side of a street with cars

448
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:53,880
whizzing by me. I mean, that could have very easily been the end. And that scared me enough that I

449
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:00,440
stopped. So never again, too dangerous. And I stopped. I didn't revisit psychedelics until,

450
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:08,680
let's just call it, let's think about this, 10 to 15 years later, when a

451
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:17,400
girlfriend at the time who had some very, very, very difficult, traumatic experiences as a child

452
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:25,160
traveled to Peru, which has its own set of very real risks that we can talk about if we would like,

453
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,160
if you were going down explicitly for the purpose of using a psychedelic, most commonly in this case,

454
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:38,120
ayahuasca. But her experience was strong enough and meaningful enough that she came back and said

455
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,240
to me that she wished it for me because it was like 15 years of therapy in two nights.

456
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:50,840
Now, if anyone knows anything about any of the books I've written or the way that I tend to

457
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:57,960
view the world, that is a very, very effective sales pitch for Tim. 15 years of therapy in two

458
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:07,000
nights. Interesting. And I put that in the back of my mind, did not move ahead with it because of my

459
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,920
fear, which I think was very, it was well-founded. I had a, what could have been a very, very dangerous

460
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:22,600
experience or fatal experience. Things had to get much worse for me to finally decide to reenter

461
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:29,560
that world, which I did first through a guided psilocybin experience. I did not want to go straight

462
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:35,080
to ayahuasca, which I to this day believe is a very, very big gun and can be very destabilizing.

463
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,960
I didn't want to go, I didn't want that to be my reintroduction. So I did, I had one guided

464
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:49,960
psilocybin experience, which also lacked much in terms of any type of prep integration or post.

465
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,440
So it was effective in the sense that it, it was like a returning home and it was a familiar

466
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,520
feeling that I came out of unscathed. I took an absurdly high dose because I didn't know what I

467
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,240
had taken before. So for those people who know anything about it, I began at seven and a half

468
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:16,520
and then did a booster in nine, which for me is it is such an absurd overkill as to almost defy

469
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:24,600
belief at this point, which by the way, is a counterproductive taking too much is counterproductive.

470
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,880
It is not more as better by any stretch of the imagination. Being strapped to the icebreaker

471
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:39,320
is not as very rarely what someone needs in any case came out of it, realizing that you could

472
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:45,720
approach this in a safer fashion with a container physical and otherwise that allowed you to avoid

473
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:55,640
the risk I had that it scared me off. Then went into the ayahuasca experience about six months,

474
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,720
perhaps six months later, took it very seriously. Had people sign non-disclosure agreements,

475
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:09,240
had someone act as my proxy to try to vet people in several different countries and ultimately honed

476
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:17,080
in on someone I spent two nights with. And it was one of the most disorienting, awe-inspiring

477
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:23,960
experiences of my life without question. The first night I was prepared for all of the

478
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:30,200
sickness and vomiting and terror that I knew could be part of the experience. And it was

479
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:38,760
blissful. It was an incredible first night. Second night was without any exaggeration,

480
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:45,800
the most painful experience of my life. At one point I experienced full body seizures

481
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:53,480
so grand mal, uncontrolled, uncontrollable seizures for about, I would estimate two and a half hours,

482
00:50:53,480 --> 00:51:02,760
ended up with rug burns all over my face and hands and feet and was completely lost. There was no

483
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:11,960
contact, no footing in this reality whatsoever. And my subjective felt experience was one of

484
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:19,400
being torn apart a thousand times a second, dying a thousand times a second, only to re-manifest

485
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:29,160
and have that repeat infinitum. It was beyond horror. And when I came out of the experience,

486
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:37,560
or the main roller coaster was coasting to an end after, let's call it, six to eight hours,

487
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:45,400
I was partially detached from reality for probably 36 hours. And I had very fortunately

488
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,160
paid someone in advance to babysit me and act as a chaperone for that extended period,

489
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:58,200
in the off chance that it happened, which ends up being the case. And the entire time,

490
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,680
as soon as I was coherent enough to even think in English, which took a while,

491
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:13,720
I thought, never again, never again will I touch anything like this. And it was only six to eight

492
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:20,040
weeks later. And I should mention that my intention, I did have an intention this time going in to the

493
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,160
second night specifically, which was to let go of anger towards myself, towards other people,

494
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,040
very, a handful of very specific people. And I swore I would never touch this stuff again.

495
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,320
It was just too scary, too potentially dangerous. I thought there was a real chance that I could

496
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:44,760
lose my mooring from a sanity perspective and never come back. And I realized six to eight

497
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:52,600
weeks later, after spending a lot of time with someone I've known forever, who I've had a very

498
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:59,160
contentious, emotionally volatile relationship with lots of triggers, things I thought were

499
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:06,840
beyond repair, meaning couldn't spend more than an hour with this person without feeling extreme

500
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:13,720
agitation and anger well up in some fashion. And I had I had given up on that, changing that long

501
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:21,960
ago, I realized, let's just call it six weeks after my two nights, that 90% of that was gone

502
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:31,800
with this person. And completely gone. And to this day, it has not come back.

503
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:39,000
And that has repeated itself, or I've seen that in a number of my closest relationships.

504
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:47,800
The value of that is hard to overemphasize. It's hard to even put into words. And it's so far

505
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:57,160
outside any conceptual schema in medicine or therapy that I've run into. It's hard to

506
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,880
convey in a way that makes any sense. Because I've had so many people ask me, well,

507
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:09,480
how did that happen? I do not have a good explanation for that. All I do know is,

508
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:16,360
since then, having explored this both on an experiential level, having spent time in several

509
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,960
countries working with people who are some of the best at what they do. And I do think I'm very,

510
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,000
very good at vetting that. Hopefully people believe that after looking at the books and the

511
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,240
podcasts and so on. I'm really good at getting hold of people who are really, really good.

512
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,640
I'm very good at vetting. And having explored this space also from a scientific standpoint,

513
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:45,480
it just gets more interesting. It just gets more unbelievable yet at the same time compelling

514
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:55,560
and some of the changes I have seen in people are they defy explanation by any conventional means.

515
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,640
And I'll throw out a few examples. But before I throw out the examples, I want to make it really

516
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:08,760
clear that these compounds are not for everyone. There are contraindications. Things can go wrong

517
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:15,320
and they're not a panacea. They do not fix everything by any stretch of the imagination.

518
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:22,920
But for certain types of depilitating conditions, thought patterns, and fear,

519
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:33,560
they are remarkable. Really, really impressive to the point that it is outside of the care and

520
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:39,720
feeding and love of my family and myself and my closest friends. It is what I am most focused on,

521
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,000
furthering from a scientific standpoint, certainly.

522
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,720
So you and another friend, who's a mutual friend of ours, so it's all this big circle of

523
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:55,000
people we know, but shared an equally remarkable story with me about a single experience he had

524
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,760
had. In this case, it was psilocybin, as opposed to ayahuasca, that also took him to this place of

525
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:09,160
incredible emotional pain that led to a change in a belief. In this case, for this individual,

526
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,600
it was a belief system around a person who was no longer alive. So someone they had lost.

527
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:20,680
I will never probably forget my first experience with psilocybin for the same reason. It's

528
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,840
interesting. I didn't know that that experience you described came from your very second time

529
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,920
with ayahuasca. I was familiar with that story because you'd shared it with me before, but

530
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:35,960
hadn't pegged it to such an early time. But my first experience with psilocybin, if not for the

531
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,480
fact that I had that experience, I wouldn't know what the hell you were talking about right now,

532
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:47,720
because it seems so improbable, implausible, and impossible that something that occurs over a span

533
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:54,200
of six or eight hours, that is nothing more than these compounds that come from these plants,

534
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:00,120
could so fundamentally alter the way we interact with other people. In my case, it was very similar.

535
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,960
It was a very important person in my life for whom I'd not had a great relationship in a very

536
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,040
long time, because I simply had no empathy. Now, Michael Pollan has written about this so eloquently,

537
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:17,800
and I wish I could even half reiterate what he said, because I remember him writing about it

538
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:24,120
going, that's exactly it, which is, for the first time in your life, or at least for me, I'm not

539
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,080
seeing the world through my eyes anymore. And David Foster Wallace has talked about this so

540
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,880
eloquently in his talk, which is one of my favorite talks, this is water, every experience we have is

541
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:43,160
through our own eyes. And these plants give you that ability to be out of that. And I still remember

542
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:50,600
watching myself as a 13 year old boy in this situation, and for the first time ever not seeing

543
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:56,840
that situation from my vantage point, instead seeing it from the vantage point of others. And that led to

544
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:05,000
the most profound emotional breakdown, which again, these are very durable changes. I mean,

545
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,360
I'm a couple of years out of this, but I truly believe that 40 years from now, I will still have

546
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:17,320
this exact set of feelings about this particular individual and this particular experience. And

547
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,760
you're right, there is. How do you explain that? It's very difficult. And these compounds, many of

548
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:28,200
the classic psychedelics, let's just for the sake of argument, we'll leave LSD out of the running for

549
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:34,360
a number of reasons, including just the political PR baggage that that acronym carries. If we're

550
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:41,400
looking at say, mescaline, which is found in peyote, it's found in the San Pedro or Huachuma cactus

551
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,320
in South America, among other places. And we're looking at psilocybin, found in quite a few

552
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:54,200
different mushrooms. These are compounds that have been used for hundreds of years, probably

553
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:02,120
millennia by different civilizations. And you have Ammonita muscaria, which was used in Europe.

554
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:09,000
You have psychedelics that have been used all over the world, psychedelics referring to, and there's

555
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,080
there are different ways to try to define this term. But mind manifesting is what the word refers

556
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:21,320
to, if you look at the etymology, but I would say experientially, one of the defining characteristics

557
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:26,840
of psychedelics. And we probably will talk about, we might have a chance to talk about MDMA later,

558
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:34,920
which is in some way can be used for for many of the same conditions. But I wouldn't consider a

559
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:43,160
psychedelic simply because psychedelics provide what is often referred to at high enough dosages,

560
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:51,720
ego dissolution, or a controlled death experience where you cease to exist as this subject who is

561
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:58,280
viewing your experience of reality. That is so powerful that I again, we talk about it with these

562
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:05,560
sort of in this sort of banal way. But until you experience that, that statement is so difficult to

563
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:12,120
comprehend. It is. Imagine if you will, and there are different analogies or metaphors you can use,

564
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:19,720
but imagine if your whole life you have been the protagonist, at least in your own mind, you are

565
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:27,080
the primary actor in the play of your life. And you've always been the primary actor in the play

566
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:32,120
of your life. There are other actors, of course, all these people you've ever met. And for the first

567
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,760
time, you realize that it's a play, and you're sitting in the audience, and you're the playwright,

568
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:46,920
you're the person who has the ability to look at it from every perspective. And you can change the

569
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:52,520
lines of the primary actor, that person known as Tim, in my case, that person known as Peter.

570
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,160
If you want to change their lines, you want to change their backstory, you want to change the

571
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,560
stories they tell themselves, you have the ability to do that because you're sitting in the audience

572
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:11,720
as an observer of this person who is known as Peter or Tim. And this is similar to the type of

573
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:18,280
experience that people can have through meditation. And they might describe it as instead of being

574
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,920
outside standing in the storm, you're standing inside looking through the window at the storm,

575
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:28,920
or you are instead of being inside the washing machine, you're zooming out 18 inches so that

576
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,200
you're looking into the washing machine and you're observing what is happening as opposed to being

577
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:41,240
tumbled by it. And in fact, the states achieved through psychedelics and in very experienced

578
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,920
meditators, although I'm convinced that you can achieve this state pretty quickly through meditation,

579
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:50,920
it doesn't have to take 20 years, is remarkably similar, as best we know, or there are some

580
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:58,440
similarities, I should say, neurophysiologically, in the sense that both seem to not necessarily

581
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,640
deactivate but decrease activity in something referred to as the default mode network. And this

582
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,600
default mode network, and Peter, you may do a better job of explaining this, Michael Pollan does a

583
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,600
fantastic job of describing this in his book, How to Change Your Mind, which I recommend to everyone.

584
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,680
Yeah, we'll link to the book. We'll also link to your interview with Michael recently, which was

585
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,720
excellent as well, even if people say they're not quite ready to read the book. At the very least,

586
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,040
they should invest the time and listen to the podcast. And by the way, I would not suggest that

587
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:33,400
anyone jump out and tomorrow go on Craigslist to try to find a shaman to take you through

588
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,360
some experience. Even if you felt like that was an inevitable step you ultimately want to take,

589
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:44,680
there are some things that I would recommend first, that can by themselves be exceptionally,

590
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:52,200
exceptionally useful. So to come back to it, though, it's the ability to, for the first time,

591
01:02:53,160 --> 01:03:02,280
view this ego that refers to itself, in my case as Tim, who is a combination of many different

592
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:08,280
things, the identity that we have had foisted upon us or conditioned into us, but also that we've

593
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:14,200
created for ourselves by the stories we tell ourselves that we've always told ourselves,

594
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:21,080
oh, my, you know, my wife always does this, my dad always does that, I always do this, I never do

595
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:26,200
that. These stories that we've told ourselves for so long that we've come to accept it as just a

596
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:34,040
fiber in our being, to look at it and realize that you can reformat almost every part of that,

597
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:39,160
or you can take trauma that you experienced as a child and for the first time ever recontextualize

598
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:47,480
it as an adult without emotion to look at it with a level of emotional calmness so that you can

599
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:56,120
finally close that circle is difficult to describe. So I don't want to try too hard to

600
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:02,360
put words to something which, by definition, if we're talking about mystical experiences,

601
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:08,760
which is a corollary to the durability of these effects, let me restate that in English that is

602
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:14,920
a little easier to understand. When you look at, for instance, studies that have been done,

603
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,760
research that has been done at whether it's Johns Hopkins, NYU, or other places,

604
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,520
and I've gotten to know the team at Johns Hopkins quite well and I've a huge amount of respect

605
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:31,320
and admiration for what they've done and continue to do. In many of the studies, whether they're

606
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:40,520
looking at terminal cancer patients and end-of-life anxiety, or they're looking at lifelong smokers

607
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:46,440
who came into a study specifically to look at how psilocybin could be used for the cessation

608
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:56,120
of smoking, the duration of effect, the durability of effect, is very closely linked to something

609
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:02,840
that you could refer to as a mystical experience. And it turns out, as you would hope, there are

610
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:11,640
different types of scales and measurements one can use to determine if something is a mystical

611
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:17,080
experience or not. And there's some debate about this, but there are ways that you can assess

612
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:22,280
whether something qualifies as a mystical experience based on looking at the historical accounts

613
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,680
and writings of people who would consider mystics. And one of them is ineffability,

614
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:34,600
the inability for someone to verbalize their experience, that the words somehow do violence

615
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:41,160
to the experience or don't do it justice. Paulin gives a great example of that in his book. I

616
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:46,040
believe it was Michael Paulin in his book, How to Change Your Mind, about you take somebody from,

617
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,960
you know, whatever, a thousand years ago, put him in a time machine, bring him to Times Square,

618
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:57,080
let him hang out for five hours, shoot him back. Can they describe what they saw? Not really. They

619
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:03,400
could say that it was big, loud and bright. But other than that, they couldn't explain what a car

620
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:08,920
is. They couldn't explain what a building is or a skyscraper because the vocabulary hadn't even

621
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:16,120
been developed. And that to me is like the greatest example, albeit somewhat glib of this idea of being

622
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:21,960
ineffable, which is you and I can sit here and talk about it in shorthand, but it's very difficult to

623
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,240
explain to one of our friends maybe who hasn't experienced this. And when you, you know, again,

624
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:35,400
these things sound so goofy when you say them, like these experiences, seeing yourself from outside

625
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,080
of yourself. You know, if someone hasn't experienced that, I can understand why they would look at you

626
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,400
a little funny and say, okay, intellectually, I understand what you mean by that. But why would

627
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:48,120
that matter? Why would that be profound? How would that disrupt your ego? It's very difficult to

628
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:57,640
convey. And I would say that what I've experienced and what I've certainly seen and heard other

629
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:06,040
people experience in their reports to me and in writing in various books that I've read is the

630
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:12,120
importance of the felt experience. And that in some senses, it's not that you have a psychedelic

631
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:20,120
experience. You have three realizations, you bring those realizations back to this ordinary

632
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:28,680
reality, you take certain actions based on those realizations. And based on that intellectual legwork,

633
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:36,440
your life changes. It is not something strictly in the domain of words, and thinking and just

634
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:41,000
thinking harder and working harder. In other words, you're not taking the things that got you here,

635
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,000
if you've achieved anything professional or personally, the pro and con lists, the spreadsheets,

636
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,720
the logical arguments. It's not that you just get a better set of those things that you bring back.

637
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:57,880
It's that you are finally able to see and experience and feel something like empathy,

638
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:04,760
deeply for the first time for someone you've never felt it for, or you feel love for yourself truly

639
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:10,600
for the first time. And you think holy shit, like that's what's been missing. I've never even felt

640
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,760
that. And if someone had asked me what does self love feel like, I wouldn't have had an answer for

641
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,600
it. These are the things that really stick. And I think given the plasticity of the mind or plasticity

642
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:27,400
of the brain, that allow as one researcher put it to me, you to instead of going to the top of the

643
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:32,360
ski slope, and then taking the tracks that have been worn, and of course, the deeper the tracks

644
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:37,000
get, the harder it is to kind of hop out of them as you're skiing, but to get to the top and to

645
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:46,600
have four fresh feet of powder fall on the entire mountains that you have the ability to choose an

646
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,840
entirely new path, an entirely new record to play. It's hard to verbalize. But one way to think about

647
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,560
it for me has allowed me to come to grips with this, because there's a part of me that has sometimes

648
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,000
thought like, this is too good to be true, it's going to go away. This newfound empathy I have

649
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,320
for person x or this reduction in this horrible negative emotion I've had, that's going to go

650
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:15,080
away in six months. And I've thought of something which is, when you look at the opposite of that,

651
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:23,240
which is, how often is a person's life changed for the worse based on one event? And the answer is,

652
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:31,240
all the goddamn time, a child could be abused once, and that can change their life forever. And again,

653
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:36,840
we're not going to go into that now, because that is its own topic. But so many of the horrible

654
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:43,320
habits that we carry into adulthood are really because we never became adults, we are basically

655
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:49,080
adaptive children who are taking on a set of behaviors to protect wounded children. And

656
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:55,000
sometimes those wounds occurred very acutely. And so in many ways, these experiences with psychedelics,

657
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,000
if administered correctly in the correct setting, with the correct integration, can act as the exact

658
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,720
opposite of a wounding event. In other words, with something that is so acute and so poignant,

659
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:11,080
you can just change the direction of this trajectory, this vehicle doesn't necessarily

660
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:15,720
mean it's orthogonal. And of course, there's so much more to it than that. Many people go through

661
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:20,760
similar types of abuse, and they don't all have the same impact. And similarly, many people can

662
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,800
experience a psychedelic and not have the same impact. But I think when I started to think of

663
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,800
it in that way, it started it started to become much more understandable why this could happen,

664
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:35,560
just as something horrible could alter the course of your life. And you know, I'm gonna,

665
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,080
one of the podcasts I've already recorded that will be coming out later this summer will be with

666
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:45,160
Corey, who you and I spent a couple of days with up at Kern. It's a maximum security prison. Yeah,

667
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,800
when we did this, we spent this this time up there with the five ventures. The story of Corey's life

668
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:55,160
is unbelievable. And it's just a, again, at no point in there, I think is Corey using any of

669
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,840
these things that happened to him when he was young as excuses for the road he went down.

670
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,240
But it's impossible to argue that those experiences, many of them very acute, in this moment, on this

671
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:10,680
day, in this place at this time, completely set him on a different path than he could have been

672
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:17,240
otherwise. So, as you said, I love the idea of the stage analogy, because to me, that's actually one

673
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:22,840
of the best analogies I've ever heard about how mindfulness meditation works, is it's the awareness

674
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:29,640
that there is a stage, that's simply what it comes down to. And to be able to leave your vantage point

675
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:35,560
as one actor to step back and see that you are an actor on a stage is, I think one of the most

676
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:41,480
empowering things. And that's why I sort of love this interplay between, you know, meditation and

677
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:47,880
these psychedelic agents. There's an interplay, there's an interrelatedness, there is a reinforcement,

678
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,520
a mutual reinforcement also, which is why I'd love to mention a few things, just to give people

679
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:00,760
a chance to crack their knuckles and stretch for a second in non-psychadelic territory.

680
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:07,880
There are a few things that I'd love to suggest to people, which help you to develop the same types

681
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:16,920
of meta-awareness that you can be thrust into through psychedelics, that serve a purpose

682
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:23,160
whether or not you ever choose to take one of these compounds. One would be certainly mindfulness

683
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:31,320
meditation, and I think by the time this podcast we're recording right now is live, Sam Harris's

684
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:37,720
Waking Up app, I think is just tremendous. I think it does an exceptionally, exceptionally good job

685
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:43,560
of this. And there's certainly guided meditations. If you search, say, mindfulness meditation, Jack

686
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:50,040
Cornfield, Tara Brock, both outstanding. Sam Harris also has some guided meditations that he's

687
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:55,960
recorded. Awareness meditation, and Peter, feel free to jump in if I don't do this justice, but

688
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:02,040
awareness meditation being different from, say, other forms of meditation, many of which I have

689
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:07,000
used and still use on occasion, perhaps one of the more popular of which being, say, transcendental

690
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,160
meditation, mantra-based. It is a concentration practice where you are repeating a mantra to

691
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:20,440
yourself over and over and over and over again as a way to hone concentration and, although not

692
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:25,640
everyone's going to love this description, to give your psyche and self a break from the incessant

693
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:32,600
monkey mind. And you really can reach a transcendent space where you feel like you are a point of

694
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:39,240
consciousness floating if you do the 20 minutes twice a day very consistently. That is a concentration

695
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:44,920
practice. If you were thinking of a candle flame and that were a focal point for a period of

696
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,640
meditation, whenever you found yourself swept up in thought, you returned to a candle flame. That

697
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:55,640
would also be a concentration practice. If you're doing, there are many also within awareness

698
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,480
meditation, there are different types. But if you're doing, say, something referred to as,

699
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:04,440
I think it's sometimes called open monitoring, where you're paying attention to anything that

700
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,920
comes up as it comes up. And there are different ways to approach this, but very often begins with

701
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,720
the breath. So it is, in some sense, a concentration practice, but you're focusing on the breath,

702
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:20,280
you're not chasing it, you're simply observing it, then you focus on sounds, then you focus on

703
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,040
any discomfort or weight that you feel in your body, then you, perhaps later after 10 sessions,

704
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:33,560
10 daily sessions, begin to practice with your eyes open, which I had never really done before

705
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:40,200
Sam's app, which I found tremendously helpful as a bridge into then waking reality.

706
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:54,520
These are all practices that help you to spot the gap between sensory input and cognitive response.

707
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:03,960
So that you become more response able. And so much as you have a tiny gap within which you can

708
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:09,640
choose your response, as opposed to simply reflexively going through life, like some type

709
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:17,240
of slug that's been shocked in a Skinner box or something. And you have more optionality,

710
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:22,440
you suddenly realize there are just more options on the menu, then, oh, whenever so and so does this,

711
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,960
I always get pissed off. There are more options on the menu. And that, by the way,

712
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:35,720
having that basic ability, having the just the ABCs of that awareness and control will

713
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:42,520
give you a tremendous advantage and allow you to get very often much more value out of any

714
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:49,000
psychedelic experience. Because you will have had, let's just call it 50 sessions on a boogie board

715
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,720
before they're like, Oh, cool, here's a surfboard. It's hurricane season. Have fun. Good luck. Like

716
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:59,960
maybe you catch a wave. Chances are your first experience is going to be getting tumbled a lot

717
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:06,840
and you can accelerate the you can steep in the learning curve really dramatically for later

718
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:13,320
getting more out of psychedelics very often if you develop some of this basic awareness beforehand.

719
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:19,160
I'm kind of amazed at how difficult it is for me to convince some of my patients at the importance

720
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:25,720
of meditation. And I find sometimes by just telling them about my own struggles and my own journey to

721
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,040
accept first of all that this was something that was beneficial, even when it didn't feel

722
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:35,400
beneficial and to to realize that you have to sort of figure out what's going to work for you.

723
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:42,120
But it's worth making that effort. I agree with you. I think that just even putting the apps

724
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:47,320
aside, it's different people have different ways of explaining things. And I remember a math

725
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:52,120
professor I had in in college, and this was early, this might have been like, I must have been,

726
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:56,760
I was either a freshman or a sophomore. But he said something that always resonated with me,

727
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,600
because now you were sort of getting outside of like, you know, rudimentary calculus and stuff.

728
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,600
And mathematics was starting to get very abstract. And he said, Look, if you're reading a proof,

729
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,880
and you don't understand it, assume that the person who is presenting it doesn't know how

730
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,720
to present it to you find somebody else. And so I think that that really holds also for meditation,

731
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:20,600
which is, there are just going to be some people who guide in a way that you're willing to be

732
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,000
guided. And so you shouldn't be put off if someone's listening to this thinking, Oh, you know,

733
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,320
every time I try meditation, it doesn't work for me or something like that. And so I don't want to

734
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:33,160
sort of name the apps I went through. But there were many apps that I went through that just

735
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:38,280
didn't resonate for me, you know, just the way that they talked about this didn't make sense to me.

736
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,400
But then when you find the ones that do, and there are several that do for me, including Sam's

737
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,480
waking up, which you and I have been lucky enough along with a number of other folks to get the

738
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,720
beta version of that, which God, it's been six months. It's been a while. Yeah, I think I remember

739
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:56,760
Sam giving it to me in January. The way Sam explains it really resonates with me. And there

740
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:02,920
are others that do so the same. Jeff Warren is also one of the guides on Dan Harris is no relation to

741
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:10,360
Sam Harris 10% happier. I just love the way he explains stuff. And so you know, I would say to

742
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:16,840
anybody who's listening to this, who's feeling sort of bearish on meditation, try a different app,

743
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:22,840
try a different guide, try a different book, try another way, keep going till you find someone

744
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:28,680
who can walk you through how to do this in a way that resonates. And the others mentioned two

745
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:35,080
others, since they're very easy to test. Another is headspace. The 10 in 10 program, I think is a

746
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:42,840
very, very well done format for beginning this 10 minutes a day for 10 days. And it's quite well done

747
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:47,640
calm for some people who like the background nature sounds, for instance, I've used that app.

748
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:54,680
And many of my friends really find that to be with a female guide to be their preferred mode

749
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:59,480
of meditation. And then you can meditate in silence, you can consider taking a TM course,

750
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:05,560
as I did, which actually really served to kickstart a lot of my meditation, because it cost money.

751
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:13,160
So I had that sunk cost working in my favor. And it's effectively for lunch breaks.

752
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:19,240
Over four days, I want to say if I'm remembering correctly, and you have to meditate in between

753
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:24,120
those sessions. So you have homework, and you are going to feel like a doofus and a disappointment.

754
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:29,480
And be embarrassed if you don't do those sessions. So you have someone holding you accountable,

755
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:35,480
ie the teacher, to actually put this into practice for at least a four day period.

756
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:43,320
And that in and of itself, I pushed off for so long, for so, so long. And I remember Chase

757
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:50,280
Jarvis, I'll give him credit again, at one point said, Tim, you can afford it. It worked for me.

758
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:56,040
What is the downside if it doesn't work for you? You still get to meditate with someone else for

759
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:01,960
four days, might that be worth it? And I didn't have a good counter argument. So eventually,

760
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:08,600
I acquiesced and took that step, which was, which was very, it was one of the first times

761
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:18,760
I finally felt what I had the firsthand experience of what meditation could deliver,

762
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:23,800
which is in some ways equally difficult to describe as the psychedelic experience. When

763
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:31,400
you have your first session, where you've completely lost any rumination or compulsive

764
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:36,280
thinking about your to do list, and it might just be the last five minutes of a 20 minute session,

765
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,080
and you come out of it, and you just feel this serene piece that perhaps you haven't even touched

766
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:48,840
on for 10 years, you go, Oh, okay, now I get it. If this is something that I could actually call

767
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:56,840
upon reliably, that is a superpower. And for that reason, I would say for that, if you're going to

768
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:02,120
commit to this, commit to it like you would a workout program or a diet. You don't go to the

769
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:07,240
gym once and come back and wake up with a six pack abs the next morning. For me at least,

770
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:10,840
if I take a break, and there are periods when I lapse, especially by the way, if you eat like

771
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:14,840
we've eaten in Austin, yeah, we have eaten, there's so much good food here, you have to be very

772
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:22,040
careful about portion control. But if you want to get a taste for what meditation can do, I would

773
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:26,840
say commit to 10 days. And for me at least, if for whatever reason, I lapse, and there's certainly

774
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,560
periods when I lapse, this happens to me a diet happens in San Francisco, but I don't have

775
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,920
since it happens to be with exercise and occasion. It's like, you know what, I haven't meditated for

776
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:41,400
two weeks, for whatever number of reasons. It will take me, I would say five to seven days

777
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:49,240
to finally stop grinding gears and shift into a calmer state. There's a certain loading phase

778
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:55,880
almost like creatine or something there. It takes me five to seven days to click into that different

779
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:00,920
gear at which point I go, Oh, yes, this is why it's so important. Now I remember.

780
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:06,600
There's a great book out there called altered states, which I read this year that I think does

781
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:11,720
a great job of parsing that concept out, which is that we heard states are altered traits.

782
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:17,160
Oh, it's altered traits. And it makes the point that it's not about the state. Thank you for that

783
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,640
correction. We've had a whole bunch of people potentially going to Amazon going, I can't find

784
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,240
this book, or maybe they read that book does exist. And it's completely the wrong book.

785
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:30,760
But that's exactly the point, right, which is that we don't meditate for the state. The state can be

786
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:36,440
pleasurable. I ought to be honest, I don't find it that pleasurable. I don't actually enjoy

787
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:41,640
meditating that much. Sometimes I do, but but as many times as I do, I it's difficult for me,

788
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:47,720
it's work. It's sometimes truthfully, it feels like I suck. Like I'm boy, it's really amazing

789
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:52,600
the frequency with which thoughts keep entering my mind. I think I forget who and again, I can't

790
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:57,400
remember if it was Sam Harris or a different guide who made this point, which was actually,

791
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:03,800
I think it was actually Jeff Warren, which was, he described it as the bicep curl of the brain

792
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:10,840
is not the cessation of thought. It's the recognition of the thought that then allows

793
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:16,520
you to go back to the breath or whatever the focus is. And boy, that really, again,

794
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:20,120
that's just an example of like, that's not a particularly like, profound, difficult to

795
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,920
understand concept. But it's exactly what I needed to hear, which is, don't be discouraged

796
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,480
that you keep having thoughts. That's the exercise. The exercise is acknowledging it,

797
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:33,960
recognizing it, going back to the focus, which in this case could be the breath or a sound or

798
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:40,120
something like that. And so it's not about that state that you may or may not achieve.

799
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,200
Just as some people who like you and I, we love exercising. So we actually get a pretty good state

800
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:49,480
out of it. I actually if exercise provided no benefit, I would still do it just because of how

801
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:54,680
I feel when I do it. But for many people, that's not the case. But exercise is still valuable.

802
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:58,360
If you spend an hour a day exercising, it's really what it's what's what's doing for you that

803
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:02,120
other 23 hours. So that's, I guess that would be the next thing I would say to anybody listening

804
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:06,680
to this who's tried meditation, who has found it to be unpleasurable or uninteresting or whatever,

805
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:10,680
it's like, that's okay. You're not doing it for what you experience in that 20 minutes.

806
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:16,600
I would also add, and this just just occurred to me, because I think you're, you're in some ways

807
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:24,760
alluding to this that, in my experience, having observed hundreds of thousands of listeners and

808
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:32,120
readers attempt or not attempt, succeed or not succeed with different forms of meditation.

809
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:37,720
It's very important. And this applies to many, many different things, including physical

810
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:44,600
exercise as far as, as I'm concerned, but the good program that you follow, I let's, let's lower it

811
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,640
even further. The consistent program that you follow is better than the perfect program that

812
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:56,120
you quit. So if you're having trouble following a meditation program, and you've committed to doing

813
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:04,600
it daily, which is a very important commitment in the beginning, keep lowering the bar. If you think

814
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:11,160
20 minutes is too much, do 10 minutes. 10 minutes is too much, do five minutes. If concentration

815
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:18,520
meditation is too difficult, use a guided meditation. And I recall at one point, there

816
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:25,880
were two things that I recall having been said to me, I think Tara Brock mentioned the first,

817
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:30,840
I could be misattributing, but I think it was Tara Brock who first said this to me, her book,

818
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,600
Radical Acceptance, by the way, ties into everything that we're talking about beautifully.

819
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:39,320
It had a huge impact on me and has had a huge impact on many people. It's the type of title

820
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,440
that's going to scare off a lot of people because I think it's going to be a bunch of woo hand

821
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:48,840
wavy stuff. There's a little bit of woo in there, but it is a incredibly good book, Radical Acceptance.

822
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:54,280
If you have any type of emotional patterns or thought patterns that seem to control you as

823
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:59,320
opposed to the other way around, this is a worthwhile book. And her guided meditation

824
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:03,800
is very good, but we were chatting, I had her on the podcast, on my own podcast, and I believe

825
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:09,960
what Tara said, the repetition, if we're doing the bicep curl, isn't the 20 minute session where

826
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:16,520
you sit perfectly without having a single extraneous thought occur. The repetition is when

827
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,520
you get distracted and something comes up and then bringing it back to the breath. So you should be

828
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,200
happy when that happens because that is the work. The work isn't doing it perfectly every time.

829
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:36,280
It took me three years to understand that. Yeah. Three years of frustration and am I doing this

830
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:42,680
right? And you know, why can't I stop thinking and just all of this misunderstanding? But boy,

831
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:51,560
once you get what the bicep curl is, it's freeing and it makes the pass fail bar lower, which for

832
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:55,960
many of the people who most need meditation, which I think has a brand new branding problem,

833
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:01,720
it should be called emotional non-reactivity training or something that sounds very appealing

834
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:12,360
to type A driven people. Emotional non-reactivity conditioning program, there you go, or just warm

835
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:17,320
bath for the mind might be appealing to other people. But meditation as such, it's a word that

836
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:24,600
becomes, it's so overused and unfortunately could use a rebrand. But for the time being,

837
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:32,680
meditation and a successful meditation session should in the beginning be as easy as possible

838
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:38,520
to fit into your life. You need to stack the deck, particularly in the beginning. And TM, Transcendental

839
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,680
Meditation was very good at instilling this in the training for me at least. They said,

840
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:49,160
if you say the mantra once in a session, that is a successful session. You have 20 minutes to say a

841
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:54,040
two syllable mantra once that's a successful session. And you might even drop it further and

842
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:59,560
say, you know what, this is the goal. This would be miraculous. But if I just sit for 20 minutes

843
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:06,280
with my eyes closed, that's a successful meditation session. And sometimes I've honestly wondered how

844
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:13,160
much of the benefit comes from some of the mental practices versus just sitting still and breathing

845
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:18,040
with my eyes closed. Well, that's actually really interesting. That gets to something I want to talk

846
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,120
a little bit about, which is the study of psychedelics. But while we're on that topic,

847
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:26,440
it's hard to sometimes study these things because of these performance biases.

848
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:33,240
It's hard to disaggregate the effect of just sitting there for 20 minutes. And luckily,

849
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:37,640
some of those experiments have been done, which is you take a group and instead of saying the

850
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:42,520
control group just doesn't do anything, maybe you have the control group sit in silence for 20

851
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:48,440
minutes, and then you can sort of disaggregate those things. So Tim, you've spoken with me quite

852
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:53,560
a bit about your interest in funding science. And that goes back to even before the discussion of

853
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,640
psychedelics. But very recently, you've made a pretty large commitment. Are you comfortable

854
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,960
talking about that publicly? I am. I am very, very comfortable talking about publicly. I have

855
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:10,200
almost entirely redirected not just what I would have invested in startups, but a multiple of that

856
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:17,720
into scientific research. So I've made the commitment for me, which is by far the largest

857
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:24,360
commitment to not just science, but even any given startup that I've ever made financially.

858
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:28,840
And that's a million dollars, a minimum of a million dollars over the next several years,

859
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:36,200
several meaning three or four. And I expect I'll exceed that $1 million amount with primarily a

860
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:46,360
focus on psilocybin and MDMA. But that could extend to other compounds, which I also find to be

861
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:53,640
understudied and that have been in some ways shelved for decades for primarily political

862
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,520
and not scientifically justifiable reasons. When we started talking about this, when you were

863
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:06,680
thinking about it, I remember one of the stories that you really liked was a relatively unknown

864
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:11,160
story in the world of philanthropy, unless you dig deep in the annals about a woman by the name of

865
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,880
Catherine McCormick. That story really resonated with you. What was it about that story?

866
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:23,800
Well, you should tell this story because I think it's so noteworthy on a number of different

867
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:32,680
levels. But what struck me was how if timed right and if thought about intelligently where you're

868
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:40,440
focusing on points of leverage, how even a single person with relatively moderate amounts of

869
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:48,360
investment and moderate is relative, right? But let me rephrase that how someone or a small group

870
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:55,240
of people, if concentrating on points of leverage in furthering, in this case, scientific studies,

871
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:05,160
can really bend the arc of history in a way that most people would find unbelievable. Because when

872
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:14,760
folks think of, say, pharma or bringing a new drug to market in the largest scale census,

873
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,960
it's billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars. But that story was appealing to me

874
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:28,120
on many levels. But what I'd love to do is have you tell it. And then I will point out

875
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:35,240
the parts, if this were a kindled chapter, which parts I would highlight to go back to to remind

876
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:40,680
myself of certain things. But why don't you tell the story? Because it's such a great example of

877
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:47,240
what one person or small group of committed people can do. I'll leave it at that. Well,

878
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:51,160
it can be probably be read about more eloquently than I can restate it. But the gist of it was

879
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:57,720
Catherine McCormick in I believe the early 60s or late 50s, met a gentleman I believe his name was

880
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,840
Gregory Pincus, if I'm not mistaken. And I think that's right at a dinner party or a cocktail party.

881
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:09,880
Yeah. And basically, he explained to her that he was pretty convinced he could chemically synthesize

882
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:14,680
hormones that could be served as a birth control pill or serve as a birth control pill for women.

883
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:18,200
And she was no dummy herself. She went to MIT. Yeah, I believe so.

884
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:24,200
Had been involved with also funding housing for additional female students so they could attend.

885
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:32,040
Yeah, and her hypothesis was, if we could create a birth control pill, we could completely change

886
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:39,480
the interaction that women can have with education, with work, with the family balance, etc.

887
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:43,240
Now we take this, we listen to the story today and we think, well, what's the big deal? Like,

888
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:47,560
so what she funded the research for the birth control pill. But the reality of it is at the time,

889
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:53,320
again, I can't remember, I must have the dates wrong, but certainly it was long enough ago

890
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:59,480
that this was viewed as an absolute no-go. I mean, there was simply, you know, birth control was such

891
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:04,440
a taboo. And what's really interesting is she decided to fund something that was incredibly

892
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,560
risky that no pharma company was willing to touch with a 10 foot pole because it was viewed as just

893
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:16,040
a way to sink money into a bottomless pit that could never achieve the regulatory approval. And

894
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:22,600
using, again, a relatively small sum of money. And I believe in today's dollars, it's to the tune of

895
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:28,600
about 25 million dollars. She sunk into the work of this guy, Pincus, and one other gentleman whose

896
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:33,720
name is escaping me over the span of something like about a decade, about a decade, maybe eight

897
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:40,200
years. And when you my favorite graph that I ever saw, which was kind of the holy shit moment was

898
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,400
the graph of the number of women in graduate schools, professional school, law school,

899
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:49,240
business school, whatever, pre and post the introduction of the birth control pill. And

900
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:53,720
you don't get to see a lot of hockey sticks, you know, as one of my friends once put it.

901
01:33:54,680 --> 01:34:00,040
It's really cool when the data don't need statistics to be analyzed. It's not like,

902
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:04,520
well, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate at which women entered the

903
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:09,000
workforce. No, no, like you didn't have to say the word statistically significant. It was a step

904
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,120
function change. And I don't know, I just I thought that was such an interesting story. And I remember

905
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:19,000
when you and I were talking about this a while ago, I don't even know why I told you the story,

906
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,320
but you you seem to really grip to it. There were many reasons for it. I think partially being at

907
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:31,240
the time in Silicon Valley and surrounded by venture capital, I saw some of the stupidest,

908
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:39,560
I don't know how else to put it just stupidest non viable ideas, raise tens of millions or

909
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:44,440
hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's just stick with philanthropic dollars or profit,

910
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:50,920
startups repeatedly. I mean, you just saw dozens and hundreds of examples over time of this.

911
01:34:51,800 --> 01:35:02,040
And it struck me that we find ourselves in a unique time, which I suppose is something that

912
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:08,280
goes without saying every time is a unique time. But in the sense that long ago, this is worth

913
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:14,360
discussing for a quick second. psychedelics, specifically LSD, were through the controlled

914
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:20,840
I think it's the controlled substances act scheduled, put into the the schedule one class

915
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:28,040
of drug classification, which means high potential for addiction, no, no known medical or no medical

916
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:33,320
application, no demonstrated medical application, putting them in the same classes heroin. And to be

917
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:39,000
clear for the listener who might not appreciate that even cocaine is scheduled to write, which

918
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,760
means it still has potential for addiction that everybody acknowledges, but it does have at least

919
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:48,200
one viable medical application, which is it turns out to be a pretty good local anesthetic in the

920
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:55,960
nose, which is ironic, of course. But it therefore does have a medical use, and it's used routinely

921
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:01,640
in ENT surgery. So if these compounds are so useful, if they can have some of the effects,

922
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:07,720
without guarantee, of course, it's not batting 1000 every time, if you have 100 people at random

923
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:13,400
who are using these, some with direction, some without, you're not going to have a perfect record.

924
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:19,000
But if, if even some of the time the effects can be achieved, the outcomes can be seen that we're

925
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:26,760
discussing, how did these compounds including LSD end up in this category? And there, it's a it's a

926
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:33,720
multi factorial problem. And it's hard to say there's one causal agent. But there are few things

927
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:37,880
that happened at the time. Number one, many people don't realize pollen gets into this, it's really

928
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:45,560
fascinating. But LSD 25, which was first isolated, or synthesized by Albert Hoffman, was developed on

929
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:53,240
the part or on behalf of a pharma company, it was later used rosh, correct? I want to say was sandals.

930
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:58,760
Oh, you're right. You're right. It was sandals. And then it was later used in a program that,

931
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:06,200
if I'm remembering correctly, was CIA led called MK ultra, where it might be used as a truth serum

932
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:15,320
for interrogations and things of this type, or to confuse and sabotage enemies of the state. And

933
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:26,920
it got out into the wild. And then the adventure began, so to speak. And LSD was widely distributed.

934
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:34,040
And at the time you had parents who had never experienced psychedelics, we were going into the

935
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:41,160
Vietnam era. And we had a number of characters come on to the scene in a very high profile ways,

936
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:46,680
one of them being and he cannot be even though he is often given the blame. I don't think it's

937
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:53,160
fair to do this unilaterally. But Tim Leary came onto the scene, he was at Harvard, as was Richard

938
01:37:53,160 --> 01:38:01,480
Alpert, who later became Ram Dass. And the things exploded at Harvard and they were both, I believe,

939
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:08,360
fired. I don't think they resigned preemptively, because soul Simon was given to an undergraduate

940
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:15,480
when it was only supposed to be administered to graduate students. And at some point, Leary

941
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:21,000
decided that science was too slow, and that the way to affect cultural change was to have tens of

942
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,120
millions of people, he had a specific number in mind, and that that would effectively lead to a

943
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:34,200
tipping point, where all these positive effects on society would be inevitable. And if you think

944
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:42,360
about the cultural setting, you have a lot of young people being told to drop out of school,

945
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:49,960
to resist war efforts. And all of that made a number of figures, including Leary, very high

946
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:55,960
profile targets that could not in some ways be ignored by the administration. And so Nixon

947
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:01,720
famously said, Timothy Leary is the most dangerous man in America. And you had parents who could not

948
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:06,040
in any way conceive of the experiences that their children were having on these compounds.

949
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:12,600
And that along with dozens of other things was a recipe for political crackdown, which is exactly

950
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:20,680
what happened. What you have now is you have parents who are, well, in many cases, certainly

951
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:25,000
products of the 60s, who have had psychedelics experiences, you have people who are in positions

952
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:32,360
of power, or in regulatory organizations who have, in some cases, experienced psychedelics.

953
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:39,400
You also have studies now being conducted, even though it's with great difficulty because of all

954
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:46,440
of the approvals and DEA oversight and so on that's required, that are going back to the dozens

955
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:53,160
and hundreds of studies that were performed before the the crackdown, and rescheduling,

956
01:39:53,160 --> 01:40:01,880
and applying more rigorous scientific standards. And that is combined with a number of, as you

957
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:08,520
mentioned earlier, epidemic level problems that we're experiencing that are costing, I would have

958
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:16,040
to imagine, billions upon billions of dollars, namely opiate addiction, depression, PTSD, right?

959
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:20,680
If you add up the costs associated with those three, if we want to be a little crass about it

960
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:28,440
and just look at the profit loss, it makes a lot of sense based on the data thus far to explore

961
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:32,360
some of these compounds. And that's part of the reason why, for instance, in the case of MDMA and

962
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:41,560
PTSD, the FDA has granted MDMA breakthrough therapy designation, which means that not only is the

963
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:49,160
process expedited for ultimately phase three trials, that the FDA is in a sense a collaborator.

964
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:54,040
So instead of saying, all right, your methodology is approved, and I'm going to apologize in advance,

965
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,560
this is not, phase three trials are not my area of expertise. So if I misspeak, I apologize,

966
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:04,840
and certainly feel free to correct me in comments somewhere. But the FDA is effectively a partner

967
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:09,080
who helps them to navigate the entire process. Instead of saying your methodology is approved,

968
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:15,720
see in three years, and you're going to get a pass fail, which is a precarious position for any

969
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:20,840
compound, let alone something that is currently scheduled the way that MDMA is. And we don't have

970
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:25,080
to get into right now, but there's also something called the special protocol assessment, SPA,

971
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:31,240
which should hopefully, if the stars align in some ways, which I think they very well might,

972
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:40,120
give MDMA a very high probability of ultimately being prescribable with and used in supervised

973
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:47,880
settings, it would not be a take home drug, in other words, but PTSD, and specifically with respect

974
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:56,520
to, let's say, returning war veterans, or victims of sexual abuse is a, it is a highly bipartisan

975
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:01,720
issue, I should better say it's a nonpartisan issue. It's very hard for someone to say fuck the vets.

976
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:08,440
So the risk of that getting shot down politically, I'm not going to say zero, because it's never zero,

977
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:13,720
but it's, there are more attractive targets. If you're looking for reelection or looking for press

978
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:19,480
time, there are safer targets to go after to achieve that than this. And then within the

979
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:26,120
scientific community looking at psilocybin, which there are at least two entities right now that are

980
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:32,760
presenting phase two data to the FDA, and I'm optimistic that within the next year, at least

981
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,800
one of them will proceed into phase three trials. psilocybin has shown remarkable efficacy, at least

982
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:47,400
based on preliminary data for end of life, or I should say event based depression, and people with

983
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:54,280
terminal diagnoses, terminal cancer diagnoses, and that may end up getting extended to major

984
01:42:54,280 --> 01:43:01,000
depressive disorder, which is to be continued to be determined. But I've already helped to raise

985
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,680
funding and also applied funding myself to a study that will be looking at treatment resistant

986
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:13,560
depression at Johns Hopkins utilizing psilocybin. And that means I believe, by the book,

987
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:19,640
chronic depression that has failed at least two interventions, or two other treatments.

988
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:23,400
Are there other agents, Tim, I mean, loosely speaking, and this is a gross oversimplification,

989
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:27,960
and we will probably get into a few of these time permitting, certainly, as you said, MDMA

990
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:34,680
has really shown pretty remarkable efficacy in PTSD. It's, it's wild. It's one of those similar

991
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:39,480
to the graph you mentioned, related to McCormick. Yeah, it's just not subtle. It's not subtle. You

992
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:44,120
don't need the p value to see the difference. No, no, no, it's, I think I'm getting this right.

993
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,360
Anyone interested can certainly look up maps, you can find them at maps.org,

994
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,600
who have spearheaded a lot of this, but I believe that psychotherapy alone, something like 27%

995
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:01,960
effective at reducing the scale measurement. And I'm ad-libbing a little bit here. But let's just

996
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:07,320
say that there is a rating of zero to 10 for determining the severity of PTSD, anything above

997
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:13,560
a three is PTSD. Something along those lines, this is a bit of ad-lib, but I think it's something

998
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:19,800
between 20 and 27% decreased to below a three. So they were no longer, they would no longer be

999
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:25,240
diagnosed as having PTSD with psychotherapy alone. I don't remember the timeframe. When psychotherapy

1000
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:31,320
was combined with MDMA was something like 70%. I mean, it's just not subtle at all. So, which,

1001
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:36,600
again, we could spend just two hours just talking about the role, the relationship of trauma and

1002
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:41,480
psychological damage and how MDMA can help with that. The other thing, of course, which we talked

1003
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:46,920
about very briefly earlier was iboga and ibogaine in the treatment of opiate addiction, which

1004
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:52,680
probably has the worst success rate amongst societal epidemics that are being treated by

1005
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:57,640
conventional means. I mean, there really aren't great options for the individuals with, with

1006
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:03,560
opiate addiction. And then of course psilocybin, as you said, on end of life depression, major

1007
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:08,920
depressive, along with smoking cessation, I heard it's even being looked at now for alcoholism.

1008
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:15,720
It is. And there are a few predominant classes people can look at when it comes to psychedelics.

1009
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:20,680
I believe you have the, there are the tryptamines and then the phenethylamines, I believe it is,

1010
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:24,120
but we don't have to get into all that partially because I'll just embarrass myself. But

1011
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,200
coming back to the default node network, which I think is worth returning to for a second,

1012
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:37,000
which listeners might recall is this collection of different parts of the brain that appear to

1013
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:43,000
be active when you are doing nothing. What is doing nothing mean? And this was discovered,

1014
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,800
I believe, in part when scientists were doing calibrations within fMRI machines. I said,

1015
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,920
all right, just do nothing. We want to get a baseline. And this is the part of the brain

1016
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:55,960
that keeps the lighting on. What the hell is going on? And it appears to be highly activated

1017
01:45:55,960 --> 01:46:01,480
when people are engaging in any type of self-referential thinking. I, how does it affect?

1018
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:07,800
So not only like think about fear, but what makes you fear, what makes you fearful? Okay, boom. And

1019
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:14,200
then default mode network seems to light up any type of temporal projection. In other words,

1020
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:19,400
thinking about the past, thinking about the future, it seems to also light this up. And

1021
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:24,520
Paulin does a great job of digging into this in the book. And a number of people have written

1022
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:32,280
about this in very eloquent terms, Robin Carhart Harris out of the UK is one of them. But to just

1023
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:38,360
pose a question that I think is something that's being explored currently, if say anxiety is being

1024
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:43,000
stuck in the future and being depressed as being stuck in the past, what happens if you're able to

1025
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:50,440
temporarily suspend or deactivate that system to some extent, and to give yourself that witness

1026
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:59,400
perspective so you can look at yourself without being yourself. And the implication if many of

1027
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:05,720
these psychedelic compounds are able to achieve that is an even Tom Insull, who I think is the

1028
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:12,360
former head of the National Institute on or of mental health, and IMH. If you look at OCD, you

1029
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:16,040
look at different types of depression, different types of anxiety, and so on. These are nice,

1030
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:22,280
these are very cleanly separated out in some type of what is the term for this desk reference that

1031
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:30,360
people use for DSM, DSM in the DSM. But they may all be slightly different species of the same thing,

1032
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:38,760
which is why something like psilocybin appears to be LSD, very similar story,

1033
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:44,600
mescaline, probably very similar story at high enough doses, can be used for anything that

1034
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:53,080
appears to involve obsessive thought patterns or behaviors. That includes alcoholism, it includes

1035
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:59,480
smoking, it includes opiate addiction. And there are studies that are seeking funding right now,

1036
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:05,320
I know at Johns Hopkins related to opiate addiction through the lens of psilocybin treatment,

1037
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:11,960
which I'm very, very interested in eating disorders, like anorexia. These may in fact be

1038
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:22,120
very interrelated phenomena and conditions. So you mentioned a few that are LSD, I think is off the

1039
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:28,680
table, not for scientific reasons, but for political reasons, it's just too loaded, there's too much

1040
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:35,000
baggage. And let us not forget that the media plays a very large role in how politics respond

1041
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,640
to things. And in today's day and age, I do not have a high level of confidence that LSD, since it

1042
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:48,520
was once painted as the villain is not, it's too seductive, I think, in a clickbait world,

1043
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:57,800
to not fall into the same bear trap in a way. So psilocybin, then you have MDMA, which is thought by

1044
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:04,760
referred to as some people as an actogen or empathogen. This is not probably not scientifically

1045
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:11,000
too granularly accurate, but it appears to tone down, that's not a scientific term,

1046
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:19,000
but tone down the amygdala and fear response that we have to say recalling or reliving

1047
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:28,200
traumatic events. And it allows us to people say with PTSD, who have seen their friends heads blown

1048
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,680
off or had to blow other people's heads off, whatever might be, people have been raped, etc.

1049
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:44,840
to, in some sense, clean up a very messy experience that did a lot of damage. And to help people

1050
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:52,600
to heal themselves in nonverbal ways. This is really key. It's very, it's very hard for many

1051
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:57,640
people to talk their way out of something they didn't talk their way into. That's so well said.

1052
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:02,840
I mean, you said in one sentence, what I tried to say in like 20 sentences a while ago about the

1053
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:11,080
experiences that can cause pain can be so jarring, that it should be at least acknowledged or

1054
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:16,840
considered that equally jarring chemical experiences might be necessary to put that

1055
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:24,840
new powder on the slope. Definitely. So you have MDMA, MDMA, I'll be honest, I was, I was biased in

1056
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:34,600
some ways against MDMA for a long time, because a I didn't have much personal experience with

1057
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:41,160
anything chemically related to MDMA. I had a fear associated with it because of research, which I

1058
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:47,320
think has since been largely debunked in terms of risks for people who are predisposed to depression,

1059
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:54,040
for instance, it was also at one point viewed as and is still used recreational as a party drug.

1060
01:50:54,840 --> 01:51:02,760
And I've, I've, I've really been swayed to the other side. I'm very bullish on MDMA as a therapy. I think that it is extremely,

1061
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:09,960
it's an extremely powerful and flexible tool that does not entail the type of

1062
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:17,000
perceptual distortion that some of these psychedelics do, which is not to say I am not bullish on

1063
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:23,320
psychedelics, I am, but it requires much more sophisticated training to administer. So MDMA,

1064
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:28,680
I booger and I began going back to MDMA, I do think it is important to point out if anybody's

1065
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:33,160
listening to this thinking, well, of all of these compounds, MDMA is pretty easy to get. And you know,

1066
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:37,880
you can get it packaged and other things and it's ecstasy, etc. But this goes back to

1067
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:45,160
intent, setting and integration. I really do not, I am not convinced that just taking MDMA,

1068
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:51,320
going to a party is somehow going to unwind any of these problems. I mean, this really,

1069
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:55,160
I would go further than that and I would bet against it. If someone gave me a hundred grand

1070
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:59,560
and they said, all right, this person is going to take MDMA and go to a party 10 times.

1071
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:06,760
What is the likelihood that it's going to fix X long standing problem? I'd go a hundred thousand

1072
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:10,920
dollars every single dollar against. Yeah. I would short it. And I know people in fact,

1073
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:20,600
who have used MDMA recreationally and then used it in supervised settings. And it is as if they

1074
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:25,000
are taking a different drug. Yeah, that just can't be overstated. And I'm not just saying that

1075
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,200
because I'm a doctor and I'm supposed to say something responsible, but I mean that regardless,

1076
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:37,400
and that for me is the urgency around this stuff. I think about myself, frankly, but I think about

1077
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:41,160
my patients and I think about a lot of my patients that would benefit from these things that I've

1078
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:44,280
experienced or even things that I haven't experienced that I've seen people experience.

1079
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:50,520
And I've never had such a sense of urgency around this. I mean, prior to this, the most urgency I

1080
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,320
ever had was waiting for PCSK9 inhibitors to come on the market. When I read that first paper in the

1081
01:52:55,320 --> 01:53:00,600
New England Journal of Medicine about 12 years ago on the discovery of this type of, you know,

1082
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:06,440
these individuals who had missense mutations in that enzyme that lowered their LDL significantly.

1083
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:13,480
But boy, the anxiety might be the wrong word, but the anticipation I had for that class of drugs,

1084
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:17,800
which anybody listening to this is probably falling asleep thinking, that's, you're an

1085
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:21,960
interesting guy, if that's what was keeping you up at night waiting for that drug. But this takes

1086
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:28,280
it to another level, which is almost nobody I know has not been traumatized on some level. And it

1087
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:33,160
doesn't always have to be something that is so obvious. So, you know, we've all been traumatized.

1088
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:38,440
We've all sort of been hurt. We're all dealing with these things. And yet I feel how quickly can

1089
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:43,240
these things go through this regulatory pathway to get into the hands of people who would know how

1090
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:47,480
to administer them? I certainly wouldn't, right? Even if these things were legal today, that's only

1091
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:53,880
half the battle. It's can you create enough practitioners that know, you know, how to select

1092
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:59,320
the right patients and how to apply the treatment? Because this is in many ways harder than any other

1093
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:03,480
treatments we have today. You know, people talk today about the importance of combining psychotherapy

1094
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:09,160
with antidepressants, but that's really the tip of the iceberg compared to this stuff. And it's also

1095
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:16,360
tricky from a commercial standpoint, in so much as part of the reason these compounds haven't been

1096
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:24,760
picked up like a football and run to the end zone by Big Pharma is that many of these studies

1097
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:32,920
only involve two or three sessions with psilocybin, a naturally occurring molecule. In these cases,

1098
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:38,200
it's synthesized, but there is a lot more money to be made in something that you can charge an arm

1099
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:43,480
and a leg for that you have to take on a daily basis or an every other day basis indefinitely,

1100
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:51,240
as opposed to two or three times with some pre-work and post-work with durable effects in many cases.

1101
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:56,200
That's financially an unattractive model to many people. And I think it's a mistake. There are some

1102
01:54:56,200 --> 01:55:01,640
for-profit companies out there, I should say startups who are going after this, and I'll be very

1103
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:06,440
disappointed if they try to make their money on the molecule by blocking other people from doing

1104
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:12,120
research or manufacturing and good manufacturing in GMP facilities and so on. Rather, I think they

1105
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:18,280
should make their money on the services, on the therapy. So that's maybe a separate discussion.

1106
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:25,320
Now, why has Ibogaine taken the longest track and why is that still the one that seems to have

1107
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:31,160
gained the least traction for testing in the United States? I've spoken to a number of people,

1108
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:36,440
philanthropists, who are really interested in this opiate addiction problem, and yet they are

1109
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:41,240
understandably not interested in funding research outside of the United States. And basically,

1110
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:48,040
their view is until the DEA and the FDA allow for a similar pathway, we're not interested in

1111
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:52,040
funding this. And I worry that there's a bit of a stalemate there. Is this thawing?

1112
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:56,920
I don't think it is yet to thaw. There are some researchers, and I'm blanking on names,

1113
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:02,200
I apologize, but there are a number of researchers who are doing very good work looking at Ibogaine

1114
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:08,440
and have been studying it, Iboga and Ibogaine, in the United States. Part of what makes Ibogaine

1115
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:15,400
tricky, if on one end of the spectrum you have MDMA, which again, I don't consider a classical

1116
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:22,760
psychedelic, but as a tool that can be applied to some of the same conditions, what makes MDMA

1117
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:31,800
attractive is general low toxicity, relative ease of administration, short duration, if we're looking

1118
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,800
at, I want to say four to six hours, let's say maybe a little bit longer, four to eight hours.

1119
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:42,440
Ibogaine falls on the opposite end of the spectrum. Now, before we get to what puts it on the opposite

1120
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:48,520
end of the spectrum, I should say I know people very directly who had family members who were

1121
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:55,720
heroin addicts and say, prostituting themselves, I mean, on death's door. If they weren't going to

1122
01:56:55,720 --> 01:57:00,760
die from an overdose, they might die from getting shot in the street. And in a case like that,

1123
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:07,560
where nothing else has worked, including some say alternatives like methadone, I've seen cases

1124
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:13,080
where Ibogaine has worked. I mean, don't the practitioners of this offer that at one year,

1125
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:20,520
the recidivism is only 20%. I don't know the exact numbers, but that's given what else I've seen with

1126
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:28,280
these compounds that wouldn't, I don't find that unbelievable. Yeah, if I'm recalling,

1127
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:32,360
that's only with two weeks of intervention. Now, these are people that are put into a,

1128
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:40,680
you know, a very heavily supervised detox environment where the Iboga and the Ibogaine

1129
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:46,360
itself are administered over a one week period outside of the, you know, pre and post integration.

1130
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:50,120
So I think the entire therapy, if I recall, was about six weeks. There are, there are many

1131
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:54,760
different formats and I know people who have been involved with running some of these clinics.

1132
01:57:55,720 --> 01:58:02,280
And certainly there are people like Gabor Mate, who have looked at opiate addiction very closely,

1133
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:08,920
but ended up, as I understand it at least, looking at Ayahuasca and others for

1134
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:19,640
helping people who are addicted to opiates. Ibogaine is very, it's unlike some of the others,

1135
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:24,680
such as psilocybin, in that it acts on a whole slew of different receptors.

1136
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:30,920
And let's discuss what puts it on the opposite end. So yes, it can have these seemingly miraculous

1137
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:37,160
effects on opiate addiction. And part of the reason for that experientially is I understand it. And

1138
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:42,920
I've never gone for a full ride Ibogaine or Iboga psychedelic experience and I have no desire to.

1139
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:49,480
It is very unpleasant. It is very long. So it can last, as I understand it, people feel free to

1140
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:57,000
correct me, but 24 to 36 hours. That is a long time. And many people experience a full review

1141
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
of their lives and a controlled death experience whereby they get to see from the beginning of

1142
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,640
life, almost like a slideshow, the decisions they've made, how they've hurt themselves,

1143
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:10,840
the other people they've hurt, how their addiction has affected things. And what Gabor Mate would,

1144
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:15,480
how he might frame it is instead of asking why the addiction, ask why the pain.

1145
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:22,280
And the addiction is often a response almost inevitably, but often a response, I'll say often,

1146
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:30,040
to some type of trauma or pain. And if you don't address that in some fashion, allow people to

1147
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:34,360
reintegrate that somehow, the likelihood of recidivism is very, very high. So just from a

1148
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:40,760
phenomenal, phenomenological perspective, which is fancy of saying subjective experiential standpoint,

1149
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:47,000
many people report that biochemically. And there are people who are looking at, for instance,

1150
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:53,560
using a metabolite of Ibogaine nor Ibogaine, which may mitigate some of the risks. And this is this

1151
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:58,600
is part of the reason why I began hasn't taken and the risk that I think we've stated explicitly

1152
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:06,280
cardiac, cardiac arrhythmias people have and can die of cardiac events in using Ibogaine.

1153
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:11,720
I don't know the specifics, but I believe you can screen for this in a number of different ways to

1154
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:17,320
minimize the risk. And then certainly you can monitor in ways having other types of more

1155
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:23,400
conventional pharmaceuticals on hand. In the case, there is some indicator of, of a pending

1156
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:30,040
cardiac event or cardiac event itself. That's one of the major risks. It is one of the more

1157
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:34,840
potentially dangerous psychedelics. It almost certainly is because compared at least to say

1158
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:42,920
LSD or psilocybin for which I don't believe there is a known LD50 meaning, well, you could

1159
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:47,320
explain this better than I can. Yeah, the LD50 being the dose at which 50% of a population

1160
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:52,200
would receive a lethal dose. Exactly. Biochemically, what I was going to say this, putting, putting all

1161
02:00:52,200 --> 02:01:00,200
that stuff aside for a moment, what's so odd about this, and I'm not an opiate specialist, but I've

1162
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:04,280
had family members die from opiate overdoses. I don't even know if I told you about this

1163
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:11,800
relatively recently. And my best friend growing up on Long Island also died of a fentanyl overdose.

1164
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:19,160
So I have firsthand experience with the pain of losing loved ones to this epidemic. It appears

1165
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:27,400
that many people can come out of these Ibogaine treatments with close to no physical withdrawal

1166
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:34,360
symptoms. And I don't know how that works. I really don't. But it does seem to be certainly one of

1167
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,760
the constituent pieces of this experience that lead to the success rate that many people are

1168
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:45,880
reporting. Which is really interesting because it's true that opiate addiction,

1169
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:50,920
opiate withdrawal is not physiologically harmful the way alcohol withdrawal is. So

1170
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:55,560
delirium stremmons, so these DTs that people get when they withdraw from alcohol will be fatal.

1171
02:01:55,560 --> 02:02:00,360
So you actually have to manage these people with benzodiazepines and other medications

1172
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:06,040
as you taper someone off. You don't have to do that with opiates, but the withdrawal is nevertheless

1173
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:12,360
psychologically devastating. So that's interesting that you could mitigate that. I've read accounts

1174
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:18,520
where people talk very similarly about Ibogaine the way you described, or the way I don't know if

1175
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:24,280
it was you or if it was Michael Pollan on the podcast talking about the smoker. I think it was

1176
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:28,760
Michael Pollan talking about the smoker who says, you know, my lungs are just too beautiful to be

1177
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:33,160
insulted with this stuff. And like, I realized that and I'm like, and it's like, as silly as that

1178
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:37,640
might sound to someone listening to it, that experience, if profound enough, can have a

1179
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:42,120
have a life changing event that is durable. And that's the key is the durability. And similarly,

1180
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:46,280
I've heard these I've read these accounts of people who, you know, have been completely addicted to

1181
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:51,400
narcotics. You know, the account I'm thinking of in particular was someone using heroin. And they

1182
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:58,200
came away from this thinking, I could never stick that needle in my arm again, like I could never do

1183
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:05,880
that to myself again. Because I now saw this connection I have to a plant and or another

1184
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:11,160
person and or another organism. And again, I know that I realized that when I say that it sounds

1185
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:16,520
really silly, it takes us or brings us full circle in a sense also back to the beginning when I said

1186
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:23,240
that you shouldn't and you don't have to go through life simply tolerating yourself at best.

1187
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:30,600
Because there are 1000 things that could follow because but in part, if you don't have any regard

1188
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:34,440
for yourself, if you think you're worthless, or if you think you're fatally flawed, if you think

1189
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:39,640
you're a fuck up, if you think you can't get anything right, or you just don't, you don't have

1190
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:44,440
some intrinsic love for yourself, you don't see any beauty in yourself, why wouldn't you be addicted?

1191
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:49,480
Why wouldn't you stick that needle in your arm? Why wouldn't you smoke pot five times a day and

1192
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:53,560
tune out? Why wouldn't not to say there aren't applications of cannabis don't freak out people

1193
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:59,800
out there. It's an interesting space, we don't have time to get into it right now. But there are so

1194
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:06,840
many ways you can numb or damage yourself, which is a in some ways a logical coping mechanism,

1195
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:11,720
if you have a low regard for yourself. But when you sense an interconnectedness,

1196
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:17,560
and you suddenly have empathy, not just for other people, like we've felt through our experiences,

1197
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:22,440
but an empathy for yourself. You look back at like the 10 year old Peter, the 10 year old Tim,

1198
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:29,080
and I'm just like, Jesus Christ, fucking poor kid. I mean, and I can sit with that feeling and actually

1199
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:35,240
identify with that kid and forgive that kid and assure that kid everything's going to be all right.

1200
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:42,040
It's right now in words through this microphone, probably not going to have the impact that I would

1201
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:48,200
hope it to have. But for people to feel that as if you are in the same room with that younger

1202
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:55,880
version of yourself can be transformative beyond anything that I could convey right now. And when

1203
02:04:55,880 --> 02:05:03,160
you have an experience like that, as ludicrous as it might sound, the idea of injecting some type of

1204
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:08,200
numbing agent into your body just becomes inconceivable. In the same way that it would be

1205
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:12,200
inconceivable, as you mentioned earlier, how you treat yourself is ultimately how you would treat

1206
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:19,160
others like what would you like inject your son with that you're like to numb his experience of

1207
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:25,320
life? Of course not. Yeah, that was just one of the most powerful experiences I ever had when I

1208
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:31,160
really finally accepted all of the issues I needed to accept and go into therapy was something they

1209
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:36,600
made me do, which was carry around a picture of me at a certain age before certain things had

1210
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:42,600
happened that were pivotal in sort of shaping both the positive and negative aspects of my

1211
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:47,800
personality. And the idea was, and again, it just works out that way. It worked out that way for me

1212
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:54,200
that my oldest son is at about that age, and just for what it's worth looks like me. So it became a

1213
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:59,720
very easy way to look at him and say, well, that was me. And it turns out that that was the

1214
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:05,480
that was the bridge to understanding it's very, it's actually if you're a parent,

1215
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:11,480
what parent can't find empathy for their child. And that's like this stepping stone. And so to

1216
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:16,200
think that these agents can do that, because maybe not everybody has that luxury of having a child or

1217
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:20,040
having a child that looks like them at the same age when they were traumatized or something like

1218
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:30,680
that. I mean, it's it's very powerful. And, you know, it just, I guess it's there are many problems

1219
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:35,800
to which I really honestly have no it not even the foggiest clue how to go about solving them from a

1220
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:40,200
practical standpoint, like like talk about climate change, like we could talk about climate change

1221
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:46,200
all day long, and we could certainly wax philosophically on lots of regulatory things that could be done

1222
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:50,360
to mitigate it. But you start to realize very quickly that politically, these things become

1223
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:54,680
challenging. And you have all sorts of different economies around the world, and they'd all have to

1224
02:06:54,680 --> 02:07:00,040
be in lockstep. And, and you sort of not to be dismissive of these things or say we shouldn't work

1225
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:05,240
very hard at solving these, but the solution space isn't that clear to me. And yet when you see a

1226
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:11,080
problem that in my mind is the single most important problem that's plaguing our civilization. And I know

1227
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:16,120
that's a big statement. That's a super big statement. And I realize it's also probably naive when you

1228
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:24,200
consider that there are many other problems going on. But unhappiness is at the root of

1229
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:30,120
more pain, I would suspect than any ailment that falls in the quote unquote physical body.

1230
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:36,840
And to think that we have compounds that could play such an important role that are

1231
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:42,840
really facing, you know, challenges and getting approved, I just find that really frustrating.

1232
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:48,840
It's frustrating. And it has been frustrating for people like for instance, Rick Doblin, who heads

1233
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:55,640
up maps who've been he's been at it since 1986 1986, which is just to me, probably beforehand,

1234
02:07:55,640 --> 02:08:00,040
if you take into account, I believe that that's when maps was officially formed, if I'm not getting

1235
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:08,360
my facts wrong. And we're at a very exciting time now, where MDMA is being expedited.

1236
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:15,320
psilocybin is certainly on its way for people who are interested in learning more about this,

1237
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:25,400
I think maps.org is fantastic place to to look. In fact, one of the areas where maps could use

1238
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:37,000
support, as I understand it is in taking their approach to legitimizing MDMA use therapeutically

1239
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:43,480
in the US to Europe. So there will be steps they'll take with the EMA I think it is, which is the FDA

1240
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:51,720
equivalent in the EU, for hopefully facilitating MDMA use in Europe. So that that certainly,

1241
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:56,520
if you're looking to become involved with exploring and potentially supporting this as I am,

1242
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:03,320
that is one clear and present need. And it's it's we're also a very exciting point, because psilocybin

1243
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:08,840
is one example, which has a lot of good research to support it. There's a lot more being done at

1244
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:17,000
places like Hopkins and NYU and many other places now, may have, and this remains to be studied, but

1245
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:23,080
it's plausible that it could have profound applications to opiate addiction, for instance.

1246
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:30,760
And it this comes back also to the McCormick story with birth control, because the I don't

1247
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:37,000
recall what the first compound was, that was FDA approved. But it wasn't approved for birth control,

1248
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:42,200
I think it was approved for menstrual disorders. That's right. That was the thin end of the wedge

1249
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:48,520
was women whose menstrual cycles were unusually heavy or uncomfortable, were the first approval.

1250
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:54,280
Exactly. So and that's the most important step is it's much easier to use something off label once

1251
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:59,240
it's been approved, than to get something approved. Right. So you pick the right indication. That's

1252
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:04,280
what's also impressed me about these organizations is just the strategic thought they've put into

1253
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:13,000
this, which is understanding a roadmap that is interested in the least resistance. Right. Because

1254
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:18,360
to what does it take to reschedule something, if you want to take it from the same class as a

1255
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:22,840
heroine and put it into a class where it can be prescribed with proper supervision, medical

1256
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:31,720
supervision, you need to, well, you you one of the approaches like cocaine and the the

1257
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:41,720
nasal anesthetic demonstrate one clear medical application. And if that is depression in terminal

1258
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:48,680
cancer patients, that is a legitimate medical application. And then that entire train can get

1259
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:52,840
in motion. That's one nice thing about where the DEA and the FDA fall out is for the most part,

1260
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:58,360
there's a sense that, look, once we've as these agencies done our job in scheduling something,

1261
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:04,440
we're going to put faith in the practitioner to use his or her judgment as to how much latitude

1262
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:10,040
to grant around the application. And and I'll also mention one thing just in case we have

1263
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:16,360
regulators or lawmakers, policymakers, people within the FDA or DEA who are listening.

1264
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:23,000
And that is read Paulins book, check out Paulins book and immerse yourself in this fascinating

1265
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:30,280
area of research. And I'll give if, like a lot of people, you just don't have the bandwidth to

1266
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:36,040
dedicate a lot of time to this, a something that Paulin has referred to on a number of different

1267
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:42,680
occasions, and that is the addictive potential. So what is the addictive potential of these

1268
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:47,640
compounds for looking at, say, psilocybin specifically, we could use other examples.

1269
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:53,640
But if you take a rat, put it in a cage, and you give it one dispenser, a little,

1270
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:59,480
little lever that they can push to dispense food, and another dispenser with cocaine that

1271
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:04,520
it can use to dispense cocaine, it will consume cocaine to the exclusion of food until it dies,

1272
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:11,880
in many cases. If you do that with food and say psilocybin, and it gets delivered a whopping dose

1273
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:19,240
of psilocybin, it will press that lever once. And the rats like, okay, that was enough. And it goes

1274
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:25,720
to the food. And that rather than having high addictive potential, many of these compounds

1275
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:31,720
have anti as we've already discussed anti addictive potential. And my God, it's,

1276
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:39,000
it is terrifying when I look at where I grew up on, say, Long Island, and you look at the obvious,

1277
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:45,800
put putting aside the all the stuff that I don't see or hear about, but the obvious among people

1278
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:50,600
I grew up with among my friends who have died of overdoses, family members who have died of

1279
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:55,240
overdoses, these are in some cases educated people, in some cases not, they're using

1280
02:12:55,240 --> 02:13:02,600
prescription medications. These are widely distributed, easily prescribed medications

1281
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:10,760
that have demonstrated incredible abuse of potential. And to think that we have these

1282
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:17,400
molecules that can be produced at relatively low cost at scale, that are not just non addictive,

1283
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:25,720
but anti addictive, really provide some hope that we can counteract some of these incredible

1284
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:29,000
epidemics. I mean, I, you might have been the person who told me this could have been someone

1285
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:35,480
else. But was it last year that opiate deaths exceeded automotive accidents? Yeah, for it used

1286
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:39,880
to be that automotive accident was the leading cause of death for people up to a certain age,

1287
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:45,880
and I believe the age is 40. And now opiate overdose has offset that. So, you know, this

1288
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:50,680
isn't an isolated issue anymore. You know, for me, I think, I think the rate limiting step is

1289
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:54,840
actually going to be training the clinicians to administer these things. I think that's going to

1290
02:13:54,840 --> 02:14:00,840
become the bottleneck. And that's why I hope that, you know, you know, and we we have friends who

1291
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:04,920
are psychiatrists, psychologists who have become very interested in this. And that to me is really

1292
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:09,400
heartwarming, because they're actually going to be among the people who need to lead the charge on

1293
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:15,640
this. Yeah, there are groups thinking about this, certainly both maps and other organizations that

1294
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:21,800
are involved, still sad and are thinking about this, people who have come to the table to provide

1295
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:29,160
some funding, like myself, and for instance, the Bronner family of Bronner soap, and others,

1296
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:33,160
certainly their technologists who have who have come to the table, many of many of them have done so

1297
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:42,840
anonymously, are very well aware that having these compounds legalized for supervised use is step one,

1298
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:47,800
and that there will be a very, very real need for training clinicians. And the wheels are already

1299
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:53,320
in motion with prototyping some of this, there's a there's a group called CIIS out of California,

1300
02:14:54,040 --> 02:15:00,600
which is prototyping some some training protocols for therapists who are licensed in various ways

1301
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:06,200
already. So that when these compounds are available through prescription that there are

1302
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:11,880
trained clinicians who could administer. So we'll see, we'll see. I'm very optimistic, but this is

1303
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:19,960
where I will be applying a lot of my focus. And these problems do not, they do not discriminate

1304
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:26,520
these problems, these addictions, depression, anxiety, that people experience on a daily basis,

1305
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,280
don't care what color you are, don't care what gender you are, don't care how much or how little

1306
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:37,960
money you have. I mean, given how publicly I've talked about, for instance, the content of the

1307
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:42,920
TED Talk that I put out there in the depression, I've had people come out of the woodwork from my

1308
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:49,880
listenership, my readership, some of the wealthiest people in the world who suffer from debilitating

1309
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:54,840
depression, whose kids are addicted to heroin. And then on the opposite end of the spectrum,

1310
02:15:54,840 --> 02:16:02,120
people who listen to the podcast who are just scraping by the same set of issues, debilitating,

1311
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:14,520
and, you know, for the, in the last few years, I've developed a real sense of optimism about

1312
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:19,720
myself and my life, quite frankly, number one is a starting point, which I think is a starting point,

1313
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:25,240
like before you try to save the world is a good idea to try to save yourself. And I have come away

1314
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:30,920
completely convinced that many of these stories I told myself, which were crippling,

1315
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:38,600
were unnecessary, and that they can be wiped. And you can write new stories, new narratives for

1316
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:45,320
yourself. And we talked about meditation. There's a book you introduced me to that I think we should

1317
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:51,160
we should certainly mention also solve for happy solve for happy. Can you talk about this? Yeah.

1318
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:56,520
So Rick Gerson, who is a mutual friend, and you actually introduced me to Rick probably about

1319
02:16:56,520 --> 02:17:03,560
five years ago, he gave me a copy of this book. And it was one of those things that just sort of

1320
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:09,080
sat there for, I don't know, six months. And it was just in the queue. But didn't, you know,

1321
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:15,240
I didn't really appreciate why I ought to read it as soon as it was given to me. You know,

1322
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:19,960
something in the midst of a crisis sort of brought it to my to my attention a little more quickly.

1323
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:27,080
And I just devoured it. And so if if the Terrence real book, I don't want to talk about it has now

1324
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:33,080
jumped into the number one spot of books I've gifted most solve for happy is probably in the

1325
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:39,640
number two spot. And no go that I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that right. But mo last name,

1326
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:45,640
g a w d a t. Yeah. And that's sort of pushed mistakes were made, but not by me into the

1327
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:51,080
now number three spot. Just ahead probably of surely you're joking Mr. Feynman. It's weird,

1328
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:54,200
it's interesting. It says something about us the books we like to give people doesn't it?

1329
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:59,080
You thanked Michael Paulin at the end of your interview, or maybe it was somewhere in the

1330
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:02,840
midst of it. But I thought it was at the end of the interview for writing the book that he did,

1331
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:07,640
because you said it was the book you wanted to read, and that you wish you could have written.

1332
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:12,120
But you're no slots yourself when it comes to writing books. Is there is there anything that

1333
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:15,480
if you if Michael hadn't have done that, and you would have been writing that book, in addition

1334
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:18,200
to all the stuff we've talked about today, is there anything else that you would have included

1335
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:22,760
in that book that that wasn't included? And that's hard. That's a hard he's a tough act to follow.

1336
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:28,680
Oh, very tough act to follow. And I'm so pleased that he wrote the book, because I have been very

1337
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:39,240
clearly biased in the sense that I am a I've seen the power of these compounds firsthand. And I'm

1338
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:47,400
not shy about, as we've seen in this conversation, putting myself clearly on the side of support.

1339
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:51,320
I don't think they should be available at every 711. Some people think it should be every,

1340
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:55,400
every drug should just be available for anyone who wants to pick them up at any time. I disagree

1341
02:18:55,400 --> 02:19:02,680
with that position completely. But I am nonetheless exceptionally bullish on the scientific research,

1342
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:10,600
and ultimately, the rescheduling and widening of making these compounds available to people

1343
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:18,280
through qualified professionals and supervision. Michael has such a pedigree, and is so widely

1344
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:22,840
respected as a and I don't think he would mind me saying this a skeptical, highly skeptical

1345
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:29,560
investigative journalist that I'm I couldn't be happier that he published his book before anything

1346
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:37,160
that I might write on the subject. If I were to write a book about or including, I should say,

1347
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:48,120
a discussion of psychedelics, it would differ in along the lines of Pollens and my writing

1348
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:58,200
styles, meaning pollen is is so brilliant at taking the history and science and characters

1349
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:03,960
in a given field and weaving it into a first person narrative of his exploration of all of

1350
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:09,720
those things. Much like John McPhee, I don't want to digress. He's also just a hero of mine, but

1351
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:15,320
they're both so good at that. I would never try to out pollen pollen, I'll get I'll get my face

1352
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:20,440
ripped off. I could my book would just be a poor, poor, poor imitation of something that he would do

1353
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:25,960
masterfully. You know, as I'm writing a book now, sort of interrupt, it makes it that much more

1354
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:31,800
apparent to me when I read good books, how much I suck. And I'm not saying that in a that's not a

1355
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:35,240
negative self talk, although it sounds like it is just the reality of it's like, look, I mean,

1356
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:40,840
these people are great for a reason. And it's exactly what you said. It's like, the best books

1357
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:46,360
are not lecturing you. They're bringing you on a journey. And when when they can do that in really

1358
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:53,720
complicated topics and bring you along, and also interweave history nonlinearly. That's yeah. Oh,

1359
02:20:53,720 --> 02:21:00,840
it's it's it's amazing. But I would say, just to give you a smooch on the forehead that much like

1360
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:09,480
the best meditation approach or app or teacher in the world for me, may very likely drive you nuts.

1361
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:15,800
And is not the right person for you, that stylistically, some writers, some books will

1362
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:23,000
speak to you or grab your attention in an otherwise overflowing workload, and some won't.

1363
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,800
And that differs person to person. So rather than trying to out pollen pollen or out McPhee McPhee,

1364
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:34,680
for God's sake, that would be a losing attempt. I've realized that I'm not what I enjoy doing is

1365
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:41,240
providing firsthand accounts of my self experimentation, followed by prescriptive

1366
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:44,920
recommendations that aren't intended to work for everybody, but that serve as more of a

1367
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:52,200
choose your own adventure buffet of options that I have vetted to at least work on myself and a

1368
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:58,520
number of close friends who span some different genders, different age groups and so on. And

1369
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:01,960
that's what I did with For Our Body. That's what I've done with all these different books. So if I

1370
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:06,840
were to write a book, including psychedelics, it would likely include experiments with other

1371
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:18,840
modalities, other vehicles, other tools that also produce not minutely noticeable, but profound

1372
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:25,880
changes in consciousness, which is really the stage upon which everything happens, right.

1373
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:33,160
And in doing so provide you with an opportunity to rewrite the story of your life or to

1374
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:39,560
gain perspectives that are otherwise inaccessible. And that might include sensory deprivation tanks,

1375
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:47,080
it might include neurofeedback, it might include other types of non psychedelic pharmaceuticals,

1376
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:52,760
it might include ketamine, for example, ketamine, for instance, that would have taken a while.

1377
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:59,400
But yeah, ketamine is a whole separate kettle of fish. And I think my book would be more

1378
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:05,880
diffuse in that sense, thematically connected, but with independent modular chapters that

1379
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:14,200
include some likely extreme experiment that I conduct on myself, and then report back and say,

1380
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:19,160
Guess what, I pushed the envelope and went way too far. So you don't have to let's dial that,

1381
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:24,440
let's dial that back 80%. And here's something you can try that I think has an acceptable

1382
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:30,360
risk benefit profile. That's probably the book that that I would write. Speaking of your books,

1383
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:35,160
I don't know if I told you this story, I think I did. But if not, it's worth retelling totally

1384
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:40,360
unrelated to this, but it just made me think of it. So like maybe a year ago or so I'm in the

1385
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:44,920
airport. And I just remember like my flight was delayed. And I was sort of like a friend who I

1386
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:50,440
don't talk to that often, like maybe once a year, he called me and he's like, Dude, I just read

1387
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:56,760
about you in a book today. Think I know where you're going. And I was like, I was like, Really,

1388
02:23:56,760 --> 02:24:04,680
I what do you mean? He's like, Yeah, you're in this book. It's called biggest tools. And I was

1389
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:09,240
like, What? He goes, Yeah, yeah, like, there's a chapter on you in this book. And I mean, Oh,

1390
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:14,040
do you mean tools of Titans? He's like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. And just kept

1391
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:20,520
like, he just didn't even and it was just and he's Israeli and he has like an accent. So it's like,

1392
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:25,240
you could tell that, like the expression biggest tools didn't mean to him what it meant to me. And

1393
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:30,040
I just thought that was the funniest thing. So to this day, I feel like proud to be one of the

1394
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:35,800
biggest tools. Well, you know, that would be maybe the alternate title of the the podcast that you

1395
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:41,400
and I have joked about, which is dumb things that smart people do. And that's a separate

1396
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:48,120
conversation. But there are so many ridiculous habits and obsessions that anyone who could be

1397
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:53,960
considered smart has, if you have not seen it already, just where should people find eggboxing?

1398
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:59,560
We'll link to it. But there's it's got its own Facebook page at this point. It's hilarious.

1399
02:24:59,560 --> 02:25:04,040
That'll be a teaser. I do have one final question that's not on the topic at all of what we've

1400
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:08,840
discussed. But given that we have now between the two of us in the past two and a half hours

1401
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:19,000
drank, I want to say 20 topo cheek. My bladder right now is probably at its maximum capacity.

1402
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:23,880
I think pretty soon I'm going to develop hydro nephrosis. So we're going to have to bring this

1403
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:29,640
thing to a close. One of the questions I get asked all the time is, you know, people say,

1404
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:35,160
oh, you're such good friends with Tim. Like, does he still do X? Does he still do Y? He wrote about

1405
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:40,440
this. He talked about this. I wondered, does he still do it? And so I was thinking for the person

1406
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:45,080
out there who's sort of wondering, like, what how has Tim evolved? When you think of all the things

1407
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:49,160
you have written about, when you think about all the lessons you have codified for people,

1408
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:56,200
what are the three, four, maybe five things that you have written about in some of your books that

1409
02:25:56,280 --> 02:26:06,440
still consistently shape how you have continued to optimize your trajectory? So the three to five

1410
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:13,400
things that I would say I return to most reliably are perhaps unsexy to some people. But

1411
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:22,280
one would be some type of hinging exercise movement. I noticed that problems crop up when

1412
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:27,000
these are omitted for any extended period of time. By hinging movement or hip hinging movement,

1413
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:33,800
I mean some type of deadlift or kettlebell swing, two handed kettlebell swing. Very, very simple to

1414
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:39,480
incorporate that into an exercise program. I do not believe unless you have some type of competitive

1415
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:43,800
agenda that you need to do these more than once a week. You can certainly do them twice a week for

1416
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:50,600
extra credit. But kettlebell swings or deadlifts once a week, prevent a whole host of issues and

1417
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:57,800
improve a whole host of performance factors. So that would be one. Number two would be fasting

1418
02:26:57,800 --> 02:27:06,680
and entering a state of ketosis for at least one week, at least once a quarter. In conversations

1419
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:12,840
with Peter, in conversations with Dhamda Agostino, who is a mutual friend. Very impressive, not just

1420
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:20,360
published researcher and scientist, but also athlete himself. The intermittent use of autophagy

1421
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:30,280
and entering this state of fasting and ketosis seems to me to deliver a host of potential benefits

1422
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:36,360
with very minimal downside. I also like the just the pure asceticism of the practice. So we have

1423
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:43,080
the hinging movement like a deadlift or kettlebell, we have fasting plus ketosis for an extended

1424
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:48,680
period, at least once a quarter, I just actually finished my latest segment about a month ago.

1425
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:56,520
Number three would be some type of meditative practice first thing in the morning. I'm also

1426
02:27:56,520 --> 02:28:01,480
asked constantly, one of the questions that I ask sometimes, which is what advice would you give

1427
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:05,480
your 20 year old self? What advice would you give your 30 year old self? And it would be

1428
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:12,440
meditate 10 to 20 minutes first thing in the morning. Don't do it after you check your email

1429
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:17,160
and do a B and C because you're going to fail 50% of the time you just will not go back to it.

1430
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:25,240
Wake up right now, for instance, I have a foldable chair that goes on the floor, I believe it's

1431
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:32,520
called a backjack or jack back something along those lines used quite often in meditation centers,

1432
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:37,560
right on the floor in front of my bed that faces out a window looking at a bunch of beautiful

1433
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:43,960
trees. And I get out of bed, throw some water on my face, sit down and meditate. And I would say

1434
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:53,080
that's number three, absolutely is some type of non reactivity training for 10 to 20 minutes or

1435
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:59,480
put another way, non reactivity rehearsal, which is another reason why meditation sessions where

1436
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:04,520
you feel entirely scattered, and you only return to the breath a few times feel like a waste of

1437
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:08,840
time, but they are absolutely not a waste of time is that there are going to be periods throughout

1438
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:15,400
your day on many days, when life is going to just roundhouse kick you in the face over and over

1439
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:21,400
again, and you are going to be in that scattered state. So it is good to rehearse mindfulness in

1440
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:25,720
that scattered state, which is exactly what you're doing. Alright, so we have the hip hinging movement

1441
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:32,760
at least once a week exercise wise, ketosis less fasting, meditation would be three. Number four

1442
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:40,280
would be the importance of group ritual. And this is something that very often falls by the wayside

1443
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:47,000
that I forget because I've so often retreated into myself whenever I felt pain or depression or

1444
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:52,280
anxiety, I don't want to impose that on anyone else. And I feel like I should be able to figure

1445
02:29:52,280 --> 02:30:00,040
it out on my own and just climb back into the cave that is my brain. And this very often results

1446
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:04,840
in isolation, or I'm just by myself, even if I'm surrounded by other people by myself sitting in

1447
02:30:04,840 --> 02:30:12,120
a coffee shop by myself in my own head group dinners, at least once or twice a week cooking

1448
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:15,880
I found and this was not always the case for people interested, you can check out the four hour

1449
02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:20,520
chef for all the reasons why I find this so incredibly therapeutic, but don't have to cook,

1450
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:26,280
I just happen to find it adds a new another level of decompression. But group meals,

1451
02:30:27,480 --> 02:30:33,640
at least once or twice a week would be number four. And then if I had to pick a number five,

1452
02:30:33,640 --> 02:30:38,680
I would say, I'm not going to use the psychedelics because we've been talking about this entire

1453
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:44,920
conversation. If you feel like you're having trouble making yourself happy, try to make someone

1454
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:52,760
else happy. And I think that that is the workaround that very often then improves your own state.

1455
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:58,680
So it's like if you're feeling just awful or depressed or in a funk, it's like, go get a

1456
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:04,360
coffee and pay for the person behind you. I mean, just exercise some of those random acts of kindness,

1457
02:31:04,360 --> 02:31:08,600
think about someone who has helped you and call them and leave them a voicemail and get them on

1458
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:14,920
the phone and thank them for how they've helped you. And closely related to that, that ties back

1459
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:21,320
into the meditative practice is if the me, me, me practice focusing on your breath, focusing on

1460
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:28,360
your thoughts, focusing on your, your, your, your, me, me, me, me is maybe exacerbating some of your

1461
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:33,400
problems and you feel like you're having trouble escaping your own head. Take a look at

1462
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:41,000
META meditation, M-E-T-T-A, also known as loving kindness meditation. And I have found that to just

1463
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:46,040
be powerful beyond belief. I didn't think it would do anything. I found it kind of cheesy. I thought

1464
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:52,920
it was kind of cliched. I wrote about this a bit, borrowing from the teaching of someone named

1465
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:59,800
Chade Mangtan, who was an early engineer at Google and created a class called Search Inside Yourself,

1466
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:04,920
which was hugely oversubscribed by employees at Google. I think it had some insane waiting list.

1467
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:10,280
And this was one of the techniques he recommended. So loving kindness, hyphenated loving kindness

1468
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:16,200
meditation, which Jack Kornfield has some, some fantastic examples of. So Jack Kornfield,

1469
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:23,640
K-O-R-N, field and loving kindness meditation, also known as meta, M-E-T-T-A meditation. And

1470
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:27,800
there've been multiple reports. I've certainly experienced this myself, but by doing meta

1471
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:34,760
meditation, say at night before going to bed, do that for a few days, and you might have the most

1472
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:40,760
at-peace week you have experienced in years. It's, it's really something else. It's worth experimenting

1473
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:45,640
with. So I would say those are my five, at least the five that come to mind right now that I would

1474
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:51,480
feel very comfortable defending and backing. Well, Tim, that's super helpful because I, we managed

1475
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:56,040
to somehow figure out a way to spend so much time together that I, when you say those things, I'm

1476
02:32:56,040 --> 02:33:01,080
like, yeah, of course, like we, that's just what you're always doing. So, but I think it's great for

1477
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:04,680
people who are listening to this who, who don't, you know, get to interact with you frequently, who,

1478
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:10,200
who to get that little update on stuff. So you've been incredibly generous with your time, but what

1479
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:14,280
people probably don't realize is how generous you've been with your time off this podcast, including

1480
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,800
sending me the links to like, which pieces of equipment to buy for the recordings and sitting

1481
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:25,160
down with me and giving me the, not just the one on one, but the, you know, the full course on luck,

1482
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:29,960
do this, don't do that waste time and energy on this. Don't waste time and energy on that. So

1483
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:35,560
I really want to thank you. I can't imagine having anybody else be the number one episode of this

1484
02:33:35,560 --> 02:33:41,160
podcast. And I do hope that this podcast continues beyond the initial 12 or 13, but even if it

1485
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:45,320
doesn't, this will have been incredibly worthwhile. And thank you again for your hospitality this

1486
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:48,840
weekend in particular. I remember I put out something on Instagram the other day about what

1487
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:53,400
was the over under on how many Topo Chico's I could drink in a weekend. And I think I said it at 15 or

1488
02:33:53,400 --> 02:34:01,080
16. We have blown through that so much. I can't imagine. I still don't to this. Anyone who's

1489
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:03,080
listening to this, who doesn't know what we're talking about, we're talking about a sort of

1490
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:09,000
bottled water. It's in a glass bottle and it's a, it's a carbonated water, but anybody who's tried it

1491
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,680
will agree. It's not like a Perrier. It's not, there's something different.

1492
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:16,600
A little touch of magic sodium to keep you coming back for more among other things.

1493
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:22,440
Anyway, Tim, I can't thank you enough for taking the time to be on a little

1494
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:26,360
rinky dink podcast at this point, but anyway, it's been, it's been wonderful.

1495
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:32,120
Oh, my pleasure, man. I expect to see you right up there with, with our mutual friend, Jocko,

1496
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:37,320
who you introduced me to. So thank you for helping to unleash Jocko on the internet.

1497
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:45,080
And ever since our episodes on my podcast, where I had you on as a guest, I've been

1498
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:52,200
beating the drum wanting you to start your own, because I think that you're just going to do a

1499
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:57,320
fantastic job and then it's going to become one of the regular listens in my own rotation

1500
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:01,320
of podcasts that I listen to. So keep it up, man.

1501
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:01,880
Thanks, brother.
