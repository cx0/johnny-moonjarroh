00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,240
today's episode. I guess this week is Stanley Perlman. Stanley is a professor of microbiology

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,560
and immunology, along with being a professor of pediatrics and the chair of virology at the

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,440
University of Iowa. Stanley has researched coronaviruses for nearly four decades, and his

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:13,680
lab is currently using mouse models for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the more

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,240
severe diseases that affect humans. I've wanted to talk with Stanley for a few months now.

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,080
Understandably, he has been incredibly busy. We have been part of a collaboration that is

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,280
working on a longer study trying to understand the durability of immune response and the impacts of

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,360
that, which we discussed very briefly at the end of this podcast. So most of our contact has actually

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,280
been through that, but as we got a little bit of breathing room in and around our other projects,

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,240
inclusive of the one we're working on together, we decided it made sense to finally sit down and

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,080
have this discussion, especially as a beautiful extension of the discussion that I already had

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,880
with David Watkins. So I do recommend that you would listen to these podcasts in that order. The

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,240
one with David Watkins, of course, goes over the immunology a little bit. Here we talk specifically

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,720
about coronaviruses, including the sort of common cold coronaviruses, and of course, more importantly,

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,200
the three versions that really have caused incredible damage to humans, none more so than

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,080
the one we're in today. In this episode, we talk about a whole bunch of things that, again, just,

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,520
you can probably imagine interest me to no end. When we were talking specifically about SARS 1 and

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,240
MERS, what did they teach us about this coronavirus? What does our knowledge of this coronavirus today

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,240
versus what we knew, say, five months ago tell us about how this story ends? And what do I mean by

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,320
ending? All of these are topics that we get into, along with a very interesting discussion around

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,840
the therapeutic side of things, the vaccination side of things, and ultimately, what could happen

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,720
again? So without further delay, I hope you enjoy my conversation with Dr. Stanley Crum.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
Hey, Stanley, thank you so much for making time to talk today. I've wanted to speak with you for a

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,120
couple of months now, and I know when we first connected, it was just nuts, and you said,

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
hey, Peter, thanks for reaching out. Can we talk when things calm down a little bit? And I was

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,040
so gracious that, first of all, that you even took the time to respond. And then, of course, now we've

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
been able to work together on a separate project that maybe we'll talk about down the line.

36
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,360
But I'll tell you, the reason I reached out in the first place was really the result of something

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
that my research team came to me and said, which was, look, Peter, if you want to understand

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,760
coronaviruses, you've got to speak to Stanley Perlman. Everybody is an armchair coronavirus

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
expert now, but you actually want to talk to the guy who is studying coronaviruses before they

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,760
were sexy, and that's Stanley. So before we get maybe into how you became obsessed with coronaviruses,

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
how did you get involved in medicine and immunology, per se?

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,200
Well, I actually started, I obtained a PhD many, many years ago in the areas, actually, of cell

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,160
biology and developmental biology and virology. So I did a whole potpourri of training as a PhD

44
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,840
student and then again during post-op. And then I went to medical school. So there was a period

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,720
there where I learned, I didn't do coronavirus research, but I learned how to do research.

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,960
And so then when I went to medical school, I became interested in pediatrics, men and infectious

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,560
diseases. And I don't know what my plans were exactly when I started medical school, but

48
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,720
became really interested in how baby brains interacted with viruses, which was not good.

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,040
So when babies are getting infected with viruses, especially in utero, it often has devastating

50
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,800
consequences. And I worked with somebody who was really good at thinking about those babies. And I

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,240
became just interested in research issues around how viruses interact with the brain. So at that

52
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,360
time point, I became interested, it turned out that coronaviruses and mice provided a model that

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,880
could lead to potentially important information. So I went from all the other things that I did,

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,440
and from being a pediatric infectious disease person, part of my training, I also started

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,400
working with coronaviruses. Now, what was the decision point that had you leave sort of a pure

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,120
academic track, which you would have been on from your PhD and your postdoc to sort of take that,

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't like to use the term backwards, but I think you sort of get what I mean. Take that

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
backwards step and go back to something remedial like medical school. In other words, what really

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,600
drove you to want to have a clinically active research focus? Well, I think there are two

60
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,360
things. One, I was interested in, I felt I was getting compartmentalized in a small area of

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,480
research. I don't think I wanted to be in something that was quite so confined and didn't have too

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,640
many relevance for general health issues. And the second thing is ironic. I started my PhD at an

63
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,840
early age, and it was almost like I was looking for a chance to take a little bit of a break.

64
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,840
A medical school in residency is more than a little bit of a break, but it was pretty fast.

65
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,720
There was a total of starting medical school to finishing fellowship was only six years,

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,360
which is a long time, but not compared to what most people do to this kind of training.

67
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,880
There's a combination of both those things of being wanting to really step back a bit and also

68
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,880
wanting to find more relevance for human disease. You're kind of a doogie howser because how is it

69
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,880
you could do med school and because today, med school is four years, pediatric residency is three,

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,160
and then pediatric infectious disease would add at least two to that, right?

71
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,040
Or three. It's actually three now, yeah.

72
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,720
You'd be talking about a 10-year training program that you did in six.

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,040
So I was lucky because when I went to medical school, there was a shortage of doctors,

74
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,520
and there was one or two programs that allowed people to truncate their medical school training.

75
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,440
I went to one in Miami that if you had a PhD, you could basically do the whole thing in 22 months.

76
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,480
What you did is you cut the first year down to six months, the second year down to about three

77
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,160
months, did the entire third year, and then you did the fourth year in eight weeks. So at the end

78
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
of it all, we did everything. We could do it to people who had PhDs, though I have to say they

79
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,120
took PhDs in whether it be physics or physics to psychology to biology to chemistry. So people had

80
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
different amounts of training. This training was good. The classes were really full of people who

81
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,080
were really creative and thinking about things. So it was a generally intense but very good

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
experience, and you were well trained at the end.

83
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
You did your residency at Boston Children's or fellowship or both?

84
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Both, yeah, both.

85
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,240
At the time and probably still to this day, Boston Children's Hospital remains easily in the top three

86
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
in the world, perhaps along with CHOP and Sick Kids and maybe a few others. So you're at the

87
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,160
premier pediatric hospital in the world. You're training with, I guess you're referring to

88
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Brazelton as your mentor there?

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
Yeah, yeah, so right there.

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,480
So tell me more about childhood development. I mean, I don't know much about it, obviously,

91
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,640
and it certainly rings a bell when you say that viruses can really wreak havoc. One of the few

92
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,240
things I remember from OBGYN is the lengths you would go to to ensure that a mother wasn't

93
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,320
infected actively during childbirth.

94
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,320
Yeah, so we don't understand everything about this, but certain viruses that invade the brain

95
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,840
during the first trimester really cause devastating loss of neurological function.

96
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,520
And the later you go in the pregnancy, the more likely it is to cause less disease. But even when

97
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,360
you're infected during delivery, babies infected with certain viruses always have hearing problems,

98
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,560
visual problems, and even cognitive problems. So the babies, just because they're developing,

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,400
they're incredibly sensitive to anything that disrupts their development. And when I think

100
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,240
about it, the direct relationship to what I later did with research was really not so strong,

101
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,200
but it was just the whole notion of could you do anything to prevent these viruses from

102
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,560
spreading in the human brain? And then also, the way they do spread within the human brain,

103
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,880
could this be something that would be useful for understanding other functions if you did

104
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,080
this in an experimentally infected animal. So that's kind of the way. And then coronavirus

105
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,000
has turned out to have this interesting ability to cause demyelination, which was similar to what

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,360
we see in multiple sclerosis. So it sort of ended up in a long roundabout way for my studying this

107
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,520
multiple sclerosis-like disease for 20 years before SARS came about.

108
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,080
Maybe this is probably just as good a time as any, Stanley, to really give people a bit of the

109
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,400
lay of the land on what a coronavirus is, because anybody listening to this, when they hear

110
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,200
coronavirus, they're thinking of SARS-CoV-2. It might be helpful to put that in a much broader

111
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,080
context, which is what does a family of viruses actually mean? When we say the Joneses and the

112
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,040
Smiths, we're talking about a family, not Billy Smith necessarily. So what does that look like?

113
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,640
So the coronaviruses are like any other set of viruses. Their viruses are put into that

114
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,040
category because of what they look like under the microscope, what they look like under the

115
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,880
electron microscope, or how they make new viruses, the kind of replication strategy we call it that

116
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,720
they use to make new viruses. In the old days, you might have some serological testing that would

117
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,000
tell you about relatedness. I say in the old days, we still use that, of course, but we have genetic

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,120
ways now to really see how close viruses are. So you put all those things together, and particularly

119
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,560
looking under the microscope, we can say coronaviruses have a certain pattern under the microscope.

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,000
All viruses that are coronaviruses have those patterns. It doesn't mean that they all can

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,200
infect people, or they all can infect this animal or that animal. They're really very, very different.

122
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,320
The ones that were known before SARS came about really were the experimental ones, like the ones

123
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:39,520
we use, which infected mice, and then also these other coronaviruses that infect swine and cows and

124
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,280
cats and dogs. And even now, they're finding viruses that are not quite coronaviruses, but are

125
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,360
very closely related that affect insects and snakes. So these viruses infect across lots of species.

126
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,720
And bats, of course, we know, because that's been made very clear in the COVID-19 outbreak,

127
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
because that's where this virus undoubtedly started, at least distantly.

128
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,200
So is it safe to say that coronaviruses as a family, probably when compared to any other

129
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,040
family of viruses, flaviviruses that produce hep C that otherwise would have nothing in common,

130
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,880
about the only thing that's true of viruses is they need a host to replicate. Is that about

131
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,600
where the similarities end across the broadest discrimination of viruses, or are there other

132
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,160
things that are uniquely... I mean, I guess they all have either DNA or RNA, but typically not both,

133
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,720
right? Yeah, except maybe HIV seems to have both. But generally, they have one or the other.

134
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,280
Depending on the amount of genetic information they have, they can do more or less functions

135
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,280
than other viruses. This is gigantic viruses, or these giant viruses, which they've called, that

136
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,520
seem to have almost all the material. You need to almost be a cell, but not a cell.

137
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,960
But they have a lot of their own material for making proteins and RNA. Most RNA viruses just

138
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,640
have the genetic material for programming the functions needed to reproduce the virus and also

139
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,520
make the proteins that cause the structure of the virus, that form the structure of the virus.

140
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,840
So those are simpler viruses. Coronaviruses have the unusual characteristic of being huge.

141
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,280
So the genetic information of a coronavirus is about four times that of the polio virus,

142
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,240
and yet the virus doesn't seem to do that much more than polio virus. So a little uncertain

143
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,760
exactly why it needs all that genetic information. And when you say huge, Stanley, do you just mean

144
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,560
the amount of RNA in it, or do you mean the actual diameter under an electron microscope as well?

145
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,480
The amount of RNA in it. Certainly the coronavirus is bigger than the polio virus,

146
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
but that's because it has all this genetic material stuffed into the middle of it.

147
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,800
Can you put it in context for us? If you take the genetic material contained within a typical

148
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,840
coronavirus, how does it stack up against a human gene? I mean, the listener might not understand

149
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,360
what base pairs look like or how many kilodaltons we're talking about, but just

150
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,520
contextualize it in some way. Well, let me see how I can do that. Because it's big for a virus,

151
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:05,120
a gene. If you took genes and laid them side by side, it could be equivalent to 15 human genes

152
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,240
laid side by side in terms of length, but human genes have variable length. So if it was a longer

153
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,800
human gene, it could be fewer of those for the viral genome. This particular virus codes around

154
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,000
probably about 25 or so different proteins varying size. A lot of them are pretty small.

155
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So it's a lot of information, but it's not compared to the human genome, which has 20,000

156
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,840
genes. It's a very tiny amount when you think about 25. And does it like human DNA contain

157
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:46,320
coding and non-coding segments alike that are just as important? No. Human DNA contains both

158
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,720
non-coding sequences within genes and non-coding sequences outside. The vast majority of the human

159
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,560
genome is not for coding. With a virus, the vast majority is for coding. There may be stretches

160
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,560
here and there that are spacers, as there were, between genes, but they're a real and a minority.

161
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,160
The strict answer to your question is yes, there's parts that are non-coding, but it's a tiny fraction

162
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,920
compared to the amount that actually codes for genes. Just to go down the path of some speculation,

163
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,840
do we have a sense of what the evolutionary pressure was for coronavirus? I've never really

164
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,200
stopped to think about it, but it always struck me as viruses, unlike bacteria, don't really serve

165
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,880
a useful purpose. I mean, it's true that maybe most of them don't directly harm us, but if you

166
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,320
eradicated this planet of bacteria, we would all die pretty quickly. We live in a very healthy

167
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,800
symbiotic relationship, despite a pathologic relationship with a small few of them. But

168
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,880
if I could conduct a thought experiment and remove every virus from this universe, wouldn't

169
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,640
the world just keep ticking along fine, or is there something I'm missing about their function?

170
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,920
Well, I don't think you're right. We have lots of great examples. For example, in the ocean,

171
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,520
there's zillions of viruses that interact with bacteria. I would bet if you took that interaction

172
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,720
away that there would be a problem. And in the people talk about, even in the human gut, there's

173
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,000
all these viruses that people find. Some of them, I think, interact with those commensal bacteria

174
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,920
and are useful. Whether they're absolutely necessary, I don't think we know as much as we

175
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,440
do about commensal bacteria, which are really important for human life and animal life.

176
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,320
But I would bet if you took away all the viruses in the world, sure, you'd eliminate some of the

177
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,880
ones that cause human disease or non-human animal disease. But I think you might get away from

178
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,000
others that are actually beneficial. Yeah, so there might be some knockoff effect where they're

179
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,880
helping something that's second order to us. They're helping the bacteria that are helping us,

180
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,720
or helping some other distant organism that's way down the plankton sub-chain that I haven't

181
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,560
considered fully. I think that that's a possibility. And then bacteriophage on bacteria are going to

182
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,360
be even different than the ones directly on human cells. But there may even be animal viruses

183
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,560
that have roles that we don't understand very well that are important. I know there's some

184
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,840
animal viruses that interact. The insects have a relationship with each other, and the animal

185
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,360
viruses have an important part in maintaining some of the developmental patterns in those insects.

186
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,960
I know that some of them are lost, but I can't tell you more, remember. But there's definitely

187
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,920
viruses that, without which, there would be problems. So I'm sure you're tired of telling

188
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,880
this, but I think everyone should know this by now. But if not, why does it derive the name

189
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,560
corona virus? What is the corona referring to? If you look under the electron microscope, it has

190
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,640
these projections from the surface of the virus that look like either the corona of the sun or

191
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,240
the corona of a crown. So I think the first people who saw it under the electron microscope decided

192
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,800
to name it based on that. You have to have a little imagination, but it's not so far off.

193
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,360
And of course, this is relevant when we start to talk about the immune response to it, because the

194
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,600
immune response is particularly strong when it comes to certain parts of the viral coat. And

195
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,480
we'll probably come back and talk about spike proteins and things like that. So when did these

196
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,840
corona viruses show up in terms of our understanding of common colds?

197
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,000
I think we identified the first one in the 1930s and 40s from chicken. That's what I remember,

198
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,320
that the infectious bronchitis virus was found in chickens. And then in the 1960s,

199
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,600
people identified viruses that caused the common cold that had the same kind of appearance as the

200
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,720
infectious bronchitis virus. And I think by then we knew something about some of the pig viruses

201
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,560
as well. So the human, it was isolated from people with colds and had the same structure

202
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,560
as corona viruses and chickens and pigs. So that's how the new was in the coronavirus family.

203
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,400
Is it the exception or the rule, Stanley, that a virus that infects humans also has an animal host?

204
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,760
I think I would say it can go either way so much that it's hard to make a strong conclusion.

205
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,560
Viruses like measles virus infects only people, smallpox only infects people. That's why we can

206
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:24,480
eliminate them from human populations, in theory. Viruses or the corona viruses mostly seem to be

207
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,160
able to infect other animals as well. But the virus that I worked with for years in the lab,

208
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
mouse hepatitis virus was a mouse virus. And I don't think it affected anything but mice.

209
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,520
The human viruses, even now, so we're seeing that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can infect

210
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,320
animals. So humans can infect these other animals by spreading the virus. SARS-CoV certainly

211
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,000
infected other animals. MERS-CoV is really a camel virus, so by definition, it affects other animals.

212
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,400
The human common cold coronaviruses, at least one of them can infect other animals. And I don't know,

213
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,720
one of them probably came from bats, but I don't know if they can infect bats. So I think

214
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,520
coronaviruses usually can go across species, but I don't think always. And other viruses often can

215
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,120
go across species, but not always. And it's really going to play, as I was saying, into the ability to

216
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,800
eliminate a virus from the human population. So if you're keeping track of all the things that make

217
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:31,360
a virus difficult for us as a species, so if you're trying to build a super virus, having the ability

218
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,560
to go into an animal host is an important feature of that, because you can basically

219
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,440
quote-unquote hide outside of the humans for a while, even while a large population of the

220
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,400
humans are either vaccinated or acquiring natural immunity or even approaching herd immunity,

221
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
and you can effectively lay dormant outside of the humans for a while.

222
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,640
Maybe. When you think about different viruses, certainly that's true for West Nile virus. We

223
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,480
have the best vaccine in the world. We still have West Nile virus floating around in birds and other

224
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,680
animals. Of course, West Nile virus really isn't a human virus. It's a virus that ended up in humans

225
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,960
at the end, but it wasn't really the intent as a word of the virus to infect humans. Others,

226
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,640
like measles, did just fine with having infecting everybody and having huge amounts of herd immunity,

227
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,680
and still every three years are less coming out and infecting human populations again.

228
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,600
Is that because the R-naught of measles was just so high that it was like you just had one little

229
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,840
crack in the dam and it was a disaster, whereas for most things like influenza or even coronaviruses,

230
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,080
the R-naught is an order of magnitude lower? Yeah, I think that that certainly contributes

231
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,160
to measles. You had five people out of 100 not vaccinated or not resistant to the virus. Those

232
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,960
people would get infected if you put them in a room with somebody who was positive for the

233
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,440
measles virus. Same thing is true for smallpox too, where it spread out an animal host. Others,

234
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,760
I don't know, polio, I don't think of polio as having much of another animal host. I think that

235
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,840
continues to be in human populations mostly because of poor vaccination and because we

236
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,920
use live attenuated vaccine that ended up in water and either mutates or doesn't mutate,

237
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,720
it's not gone. Where did those viruses come from? If they never had an animal host,

238
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,560
where did they evolve? I think they did initially have an animal host. Measles is thought to evolve

239
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,680
from rinderpestin, which affects animals in Africa. You see, that's the other thing about

240
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,800
the animal host is if you evolve from an animal host, the virus evolved from animal host,

241
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,080
but then change so much to infect humans, it may not be able to then cause an infection in the

242
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,600
animal host. So these like the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, we don't really know what it

243
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,160
would do if you put it back in bats. No one's going to try it, but I don't know if a bat would

244
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,840
be infected by it because it may have changed enough even in the little bit of time it's been

245
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,320
out of the bat. So it can't infect the bat very well anymore. Wow, that's really interesting. So

246
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,120
ping pongs back and forth until it finds a more favorable host. I mean, this would suggest from

247
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,560
an evolutionary fitness standpoint that if it starts in an animal, comes to a human, stays in

248
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,240
a human, it must find the human on some level a more desirable host. I don't know, but that's

249
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,840
making the virus a little more anthropomorphic than it might be needed. If it's in humans,

250
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,120
it may never see a bat again. So it's not that it's more desirable host. That's a fair point.

251
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,440
Yeah, humans and bats don't interact that much even though they interact more than

252
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,680
maybe desirable given these viruses, but it's not like the virus can look around and say,

253
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,360
oh, there's a bat I think. Yeah, let me go try that out again and see how it compares to this.

254
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Last question on this topic, tell me a little bit about HIV. I'm just not a student of my

255
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,440
immunology. Is HIV a virus that is now believed to have evolved? I mean, I know back, I remember

256
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
a million years ago, people said, oh, it came from this monkey or that monkey. Do we have a

257
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,800
very clear sense of the lineage of HIV? I think it's beyond what I know well. I think that we

258
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:03,680
have a very strong sense that it came from non-human primates. I think we may know more exactly, but

259
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,800
what I read periodically is some studies, it seems like the virus was in human populations

260
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,880
or identified way before its first obvious entry into people who became HIV infected. So I think

261
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,440
it's clearly from non-human primates, but the exact details, I don't know. But I think some

262
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,920
people do and some of these sources, like some of the non-human primates have an HIV

263
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,520
like virus that's pretty close. Let's go into the, let's say it's the late 90s. So it's pre-SARS.

264
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,480
You're working hard on coronaviruses. At that point in time, am I doing the math right that

265
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,080
there are basically sort of four endemic coronaviruses that are not especially severe,

266
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,840
but just circulate through humans causing annoying respiratory infections year after year.

267
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,880
Is that directionally the lay of the land? It's actually only two in the mid-90s because two of

268
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,320
them discovered after SARS in 2004. Wow. Which were the two that came along and that were there in

269
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:07,280
the 90s? 229E and OC43. Okay. And what did we know about people's immune response to them? I mean,

270
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,200
did anybody ever say, hey, we should vaccinate against these? Or was it they're not that

271
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,520
interesting? They don't make people that sick. Who cares? Yeah, it was more of the latter.

272
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,360
Appropriately so. If you're going to spend a huge amount of money and we know that huge amounts of

273
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,960
money involved in making a vaccine, why would you spend it on a cold virus? People get colds. It's

274
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,840
annoying. The other thing is that really that may be relevant to, I think, about COVID-19 is that

275
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,320
people got these cold viruses. They could be reinfected. So they could be reinfected a year

276
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,680
later. And that's what the papers we were talking about earlier really talk about is that the immune

277
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,960
response may be, if you have a mild infection, you may have a more transient immune response.

278
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Yeah. There are three or four papers that I can't wait to dive into and we're going to do it. I just

279
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,840
want to make sure the listener doesn't get too lost in what we're talking about. But actually,

280
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,640
if you're listening to this now and you have not listened to the interview with David Watkins,

281
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,360
this would be a great time to hit pause, go back and do that. Because in that discussion, we really

282
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,800
do the immunology tour de force and we explain the difference between the innate immune system,

283
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,120
the adaptive immune system, and the two branches of the adaptive immune system,

284
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,560
the humoral system, which relies on B cells and their antibodies, and the cellular system,

285
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,720
which relies on T cells. And I have a very strong suspicion that very soon Stanley and I are going

286
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,840
to get into some of the weeds around the B cells versus the T cells. And again, I don't think you

287
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,680
can educate yourself enough on this topic if you want to truly understand what's going on with

288
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,520
these viruses. Bringing it back to the late 90s, tell me what your interest was at that time. So

289
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,760
obviously, you're a scholar, you're doing incredible work. Did you think at that point in time, gosh,

290
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,080
these coronaviruses aren't that interesting. They're not really a threat to humans. They're not really

291
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,600
a threat to my patients in the way other viruses are. Even RSV would be more of a threat to children.

292
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,720
Wupenkopf would be more of a threat to children. What is it that kept you in this at the time

293
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,120
relatively benign virus? Help me understand, was it kept you in a field that ultimately turned out

294
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,560
to be a very productive decision? At the time, we were interested mostly in this mouse virus and

295
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,800
the human disease multiple sclerosis. So thinking about how does a virus go into the brain end up

296
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,200
in the cells that make myelin, which are the sheets in the brain that cover the axons. And how does

297
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,080
the virus end up there? And then once the host realizes that the virus is there, how does it

298
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,360
manage to destroy tissue while it's eliminating the virus? How come the immune response can't

299
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,080
figure out how to rid the cells of virus without also destroying the cells themselves and destroying

300
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,200
the function of their cells? So that's what I was really studying. How does this occur?

301
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,280
What kind of immune responses were elicited by the virus? What mattered the most? What caused

302
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,080
demyelination? And what caused remyelination, which is the process of getting myelin back,

303
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,320
and which is in people with multiple sclerosis is the period when they have

304
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,400
immune emissions after relapsing and permissing or after relapsing have disease and they get better

305
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,320
again for a bit of time? For people who have some form where they get better to a large extent,

306
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,240
how does that occurring as well? So we were using the virus to try to study that.

307
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,560
But to be clear, was your personal interest at that time more in this is a virus that helps

308
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,960
us understand a disease like MS where we can understand the demyelination, remyelination process?

309
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,560
Or was it more, I think from a pediatric and a neurobiological development standpoint,

310
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,560
I want to make sure I understand what's happening in trimester one that is potentially injuring a

311
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,880
child's brain. Those two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, but were you bent more

312
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,240
towards one than the other? I think that by the mid 90s, I was thinking much more about the first.

313
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,200
How does the virus infecting the brain? How is it cleared? Why does clearance always involve

314
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,840
tissue destruction? Why is that happening like that? So you're basically now becoming a

315
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,600
neurobiologist with a background in immunology, virology, and pediatrics. Well, at that point,

316
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I became a neurobiologist with a background in virology and cell biology. I didn't really start

317
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:27,280
doing immunology till the early 90s, 1990s. So then we were doing some of it. Yes. The virus

318
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,480
preceded my doing immunology. So tell me what's going on when SARS hits. What is it? I can't even

319
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,360
remember exactly. Was this 02, 03? The end of 02 became a big deal in 2003 and then was eliminated

320
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,640
in July 2003 for all intents and purposes. So tell us this story in some detail. I think

321
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,680
for many people, I remember it because there was a component that was in Toronto. I grew up in

322
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,000
Toronto. I wasn't living there at the time, but just that sort of perked my ears. But at the same

323
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,760
time I was in residency, so I was so sleep deprived. If I could drive home without crashing,

324
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,160
that was an accomplishment. So it's not like I was really paying attention either, but can you

325
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,320
give us sort of a really detailed account of where this virus came from, how it emerged,

326
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,120
and what impact it had on you and how it may have shifted your thinking.

327
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,560
Yeah. So the way it emerged, we heard about this virus that was causing a respiratory disease in

328
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,840
southern China. And initially we all thought this was going to be a kind of flu virus because flu

329
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,600
viruses we know initiate often start in southern China, particularly in the city of Guangzhou,

330
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,800
which is across the bay from Hong Kong. So we heard about these viruses and then it became

331
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,920
clear that they were a coronavirus. This was isolated by several laboratories. But we learned

332
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,480
in retrospect is that they actually came from a live animal market in Guangzhou. And this was

333
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,240
a place where animals were all put together for sale for food and other purposes. And so there

334
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,880
were bats along with other exotic live animals. And we learned that the coronavirus, the SARS

335
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,760
coronavirus, was almost certainly a bat virus that spread to these other animals. And the

336
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,920
virus rapidly adapted to these other animals and sometimes infected human handlers of that market.

337
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:18,160
So people were actually handling the animals to sell them. And many of those became sick. Many

338
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,840
developed subclinical disease. And we know that up to a third of the handlers actually had antibodies

339
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,800
to SARS-CoV. So we know that this was going back and forth a lot. Then we know that some of the

340
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,800
time it spread to mainland China. How many times that occurred, we don't know whether it was exactly

341
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,000
the same virus that we study in the lab. I don't think we really know that well. The reason that this

342
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,480
became really was brought to the world's attention is that a single animal handler became ill enough

343
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,560
to see a physician. The physician actually became quite ill, didn't go home, rather went to a Hong

344
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:59,200
Kong hotel. And at that point, it was really sick and spread the virus to the other people on the

345
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,080
floor. And they all went through their homes. And that's how the virus ended up spreading around the

346
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,840
world because of this one physician who ended up going to Hong Kong. Whether this would have

347
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,400
occurred anyways is an open question, of course. The main set of events was single event. And that's

348
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,760
why the virus seemed to start from a single point source. Now, help me understand something. I think

349
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,200
most people listening to this are now familiar with R0, but we'll explain it again. What was the

350
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,960
R0 of that SARS virus? In retrospect, I guess, what do we believe it was? How transmissible was it?

351
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,200
Yeah, so this is a good question because the official numbers has an R0 of about two to three,

352
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,320
which means that a single person will infect two to three people. So clearly, as you can see,

353
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,440
without even thinking about it very hard, if a virus starts with one person, then infects two,

354
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,920
and then each of those infects two more people, you now have four infections, they infect two,

355
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,360
you get eight. So you can quickly get up to high numbers by this exponential growth.

356
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,160
And we'll hit pause there for one sec, just to put that in the context. Earlier, for example,

357
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,360
you talked a lot about measles. Measles has an R0 probably north of 10, correct?

358
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,640
Yeah, around 15.

359
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,400
I mean, that's about as high as they come. I mean, that's an explosive exponential multiplier.

360
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,720
At the other end of the spectrum, today, HIVs R0 would be less than one.

361
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,200
Yeah, and I think that HIV is a little different because it's not a respiratory spread.

362
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,360
Yeah, so let's use another respiratory example. What would be a low R0? Well,

363
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,280
let's use the other coronaviruses. If you take those other coronaviruses, they're one to two

364
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
at most, right?

365
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,360
Exactly. So one person infects someone else on the average. This is on the average, of course.

366
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,720
So going back to now SARS, sorry to interrupt you there, but now you've got a two to three R0. So

367
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,320
this is quite a spreading virus. This physician goes to the hotel, he gets a bunch of people

368
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,680
potentially sick. And obviously now that can take the virus around the world because presumably

369
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,000
people at hotels are going to go back someplace, right?

370
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,280
Yeah, so I think that the R0 of two to three though may be misleading because there's no

371
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,360
question that the R0 on the average was two to three, but it consisted of spread within the

372
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,880
hospital. Spread occurred much more readily. SARS was a virus that really caused pneumonia

373
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,640
and not much more. So the virus didn't readily spread from one person to another until that

374
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,080
first person was pretty ill. And then if that person went in the hospital and you now started

375
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,800
as a word mucking up their lung fluids so that virus was now released into the air by procedures,

376
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,880
either intubation or suctioning or whatever else needed to be done, then the R0 factor would be

377
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,160
much more than two or three. And the community, because this is a deep pneumonia, it really isn't

378
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,760
that contagious. So I think that if we split it up, those 8,000 cases would be an average of two

379
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,200
to three with quite a range depending on where the virus was acquired.

380
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,240
And I think the other lesson we have to take away from SARS is it gets widely quoted as having a

381
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,760
10% mortality rate. But again, how could we possibly say that when we don't know the total

382
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,600
number of cases that might be the case fatality rate? I mean, case fatality rate is not that

383
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,280
interesting. It's the infection fatality rate that really matters. And it's certainly possible,

384
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,760
isn't it, that many more people had it. Even let's say there was five times the number of people who

385
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,880
actually had the illness but didn't come down with a severe enough version that they warranted

386
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,680
hospitalization or testing. You would all of a sudden say technically the mortality of this is

387
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:45,440
2%, which is still absolutely devastating virus. But it's not the devastation of when you hear 10%

388
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,920
mortality. I mean, that's literally like playing Russian roulette.

389
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,880
That's a way to think about it. But it was very hard at the time finding patients who are

390
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:58,160
asymptomatic and were infected. So the thinking was that anybody who became infected actually

391
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,520
became symptomatic. What you say makes perfect sense. But I'll tell you another story. So the

392
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,920
next coronavirus that came upon us was the MERS coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory

393
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,160
coronavirus. And this is a disease that's exactly the same, not exactly, but very similar to SARS

394
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,760
and being a deep lung disease. This disease, the mortality is billed as 35%. So really terrible.

395
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,160
And it's different though. So what you just talked about, the 2002 to 2003 virus that started in a

396
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,280
market in Southern China who has the same name as the current virus we're talking about, but we

397
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,120
refer to them as SARS-1 and SARS-2, they're in the same beta family, which we didn't really get into.

398
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,000
Do you want to take a minute to explain that? Because MERS is a slightly different subdivision

399
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,880
of the family. Can you help people understand that nuance? Yeah. So it's all very similar.

400
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,480
They're all in the same general group of coronaviruses and within the same subgroup of

401
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,840
coronaviruses, but they're slightly different in their genome organization and in some of their

402
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,360
coding. So they're put into a separate category. So it's a coronavirus. Before we knew so much

403
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,520
about from sequence, they would have been considered the same type of coronavirus,

404
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,920
but it's different enough. So we classify it a little differently. What that means is it's a

405
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,440
little more distant from the SARS coronavirus. So there's less thinking that one could actually

406
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,720
provide immune protection from the other. Though in fact, there's some cross reactivity. MERS

407
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,280
coronavirus is recognized in part by SARS coronavirus sera from people who survive. They're close.

408
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,840
It's like your third cousin instead of your first cousin. It's pretty close, but not as close.

409
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,680
And this will obviously be interesting when we come back to this discussion of cross immunity.

410
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,200
And basically that's probably the biggest difference as opposed to a functional

411
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,640
difference about the virulence or the potential for virulence, correct?

412
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,240
Right. Right.

413
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,120
Okay. So again, let's not pick it back up. It's what is it? 2009 when MERS came along?

414
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:04,480
Well, MERS and camels probably came along at least in 1983, but in people it was found in 2012.

415
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,040
And that's the earliest cases. There's a few mysteries about MERS coronavirus. Why is it only

416
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,240
in the Arabian Peninsula? So tell me about that. Did people, and when I say people, I really mean

417
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,600
scientists. I'm sure the population wasn't wondering around thinking about this, but

418
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:27,200
did scientists appreciate that there was a coronavirus in camels in the 80s from the early

419
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,280
80s? Was that something appreciated? Nope. This was absolutely not appreciated because in camels,

420
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,960
these coronaviruses caused the common cold. Well, they could.

421
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,040
So that's why nobody would care. Camel gets a cold. You don't even know. He goes to camel

422
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,400
Walgreen and you never hear about him again. So what do we think accounts for the virus

423
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,360
jumping quite literally from a camel to a human and call it 2012-ish?

424
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,960
We don't know. The virus has been a camel since the 80s and probably earlier,

425
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,280
don't look earlier. And we know it doesn't jump in Africa or other parts of Asia. So this is real

426
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,880
mystery in this virus. Why is it only in the Arabian Peninsula? When you look at the MERS virus

427
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,800
in the camels, it's still the same in the Arabian Peninsula versus other camels?

428
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,800
Hard to know. It may be subtly different in parts of Africa where there's no MERS,

429
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,360
but we have a lot of trouble saying that those differences account for the fact that there's

430
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,880
basically no cases in Africa and you have these cases in Saudi Arabia rising all the time now.

431
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,240
And when you say Africa, do you include North Africa? Were there any cases that arose in Egypt

432
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,120
or Algeria, Libya, Morocco? Yes. They did not occur in those places? Yeah, yeah. The camels

433
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,360
are infected there, but people are not. Oh, wow. Because a lot of people would sort of say, look,

434
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,240
I mean, if something happens in Saudi Arabia, it would be just as likely to happen in Iran or

435
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,800
Egypt. I mean, even though they're technically belonging to different continents, they're very

436
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,760
similar geographically, but you're saying, no, there was a really hard line distinguishing that.

437
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,560
And we don't to this day have a sense of what allowed that jump. Yeah, we don't know. The fact

438
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,480
is not only occurred in 2012, it's occurring once or twice a week now because people are coming in

439
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,640
who actually have no contact with camels and are coming into the hospital with MERS. They often

440
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,800
have comorbidities that are older or they might have diabetes, but otherwise they don't even have

441
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,520
contact with camel. They have to get it from a camel, but not clear how. So wait a minute.

442
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,960
That was my next question. Do we know that it can or cannot spread human to human once a person gets

443
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,760
it from its most likely source of transmission, which is a camel? Can one person infect another?

444
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,120
Yeah. So this is where the R naught factor becomes important again, because the official number for

445
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:54,160
MERS is somewhere between zero and four. I think outside of hospitals is probably near to 0.35, 0.5,

446
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,160
somewhere in that low range. So it means it's not impossible, but all you need is somebody to be

447
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,600
infected and happen to infect someone else who's highly susceptible and that highly susceptible

448
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:12,240
person will then appear at the hospital not having had any contact with a camel. And that zero to four,

449
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,040
which is such a broad range. I've read that as the official range. It's so broad as to be unhelpful.

450
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,400
That's really the camel R naught. That's the spread from camel to human. And then as you said,

451
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,360
human to human transmission is probably going to occur in the hospital. And so MERS becomes the

452
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,880
scariest of them all just on mortality because the official numbers are basically it killed a third of

453
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,760
the people that were infected. It's about almost 900 deaths out of call it 2500 confirmed cases.

454
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:50,400
That's about as scary as any virus, maybe outside of Ebola. But again, the absolute numbers are so

455
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,280
low. The transmissibility human to human doesn't seem as high, especially when you

456
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,240
consider that the scariest viruses are ones that are transmitted from asymptomatic people, right?

457
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,960
Yeah. So this one, like SARS, is mostly transmitted from people who have lung disease already,

458
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,600
who have severe lung disease. I don't think the R naught is actually camel to camel. I don't think

459
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,320
it takes that into consideration. Rather than what it takes to the consideration is a hospital

460
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,560
spread. It's like SARS and some hospitals spread. And that's been basically not stopped completely,

461
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,360
because it's my friends in Saudi Arabia say somebody comes in with this disease. We think

462
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,800
about it quickly, but we may not think about it in every case quickly enough. So there may be still

463
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,520
some spread within the hospital. So nosocomial spread, which you're referring to in hospital

464
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,880
spread, is a big problem because you just don't have it on the front of your mind that every

465
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,080
person who shows up in respiratory distress could have this. And therefore, A, potentially the

466
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,000
healthcare workers themselves can be infected because it's not just the proximity, but it's

467
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,320
the type of procedures that are being done. When you put a breathing tube in somebody, you're

468
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:00,000
really creating an effective portal for the virus to get to you. And then obviously we know how

469
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,280
infections like that can spread through intensive care units and such.

470
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly why it's a problem.

471
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,880
So why did this not turn into even an epidemic within the Arabian Peninsula? I mean,

472
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,280
you did mention that we still see a few cases each year, but 2500 confirmed cases directionally

473
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,440
makes it not even a sort of an epidemic, really, let alone a pandemic. Why do you think this just

474
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,480
wasn't something that spread despite its potential for devastation at the mortality level?

475
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,560
Because I think that that R naught of 0.3 really makes it not possible or not likely.

476
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,120
There's plenty of cases with murders where people went back to relatively poor country

477
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,400
after having been a worker in Saudi Arabia, were found to be infected and infected nobody.

478
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,480
So that nobody became ill from that patient, even though they weren't really looked at.

479
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,040
That's as opposed to Korea where there's that one patient who infected 186 people.

480
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,360
So there was really a confluence of lots of bad luck for that to have occurred.

481
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,440
And then going back to SARS-CoV-1, what basically accounts for the eradication of that,

482
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,000
call it in 2003, 2004?

483
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,760
The combination of there being no reservoir. So it's not like camels, which could continue

484
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,360
introducing to human populations. And the fact that because you weren't contagious till you were

485
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,600
sick, it was easy to look at somebody and say, oh, that person has SARS. We're going to stick them

486
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,320
in a room by himself, take care of him and make sure he infects nobody else.

487
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,000
Then you would stop the disease. It's a classic kind of quarantining,

488
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,560
identification quarantining that we talk about all the time with COVID-19.

489
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,200
But it's really feasible with SARS when you're talking about a total of 8,000 cases around the

490
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,280
world. I mean, Stanley, to hear you tell the story this way, it's just it's like a bad movie,

491
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,960
because you could be lulled into a false sense of confidence by the time MERS blows over.

492
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,400
You can say, hey, OK, I got it. We've got a few of these coronaviruses. They cause a bunch of

493
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,800
colds. You get a runny nose in the summer, but it's really nothing. And yeah, it's true. Two

494
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,960
really bad actors showed up that on a virus to virus level can really hurt their host.

495
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,840
But they're nothing to really be afraid of. In the case of SARS 1, it has two things that make it

496
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,280
really friendly to humans. One, it can't bounce back and forth between humans and animals.

497
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,920
And two, you don't really spread it. You're very unlikely to spread it if you're not symptomatic.

498
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,480
You don't have to shut the world down. But not only that, you get to isolate people when they're

499
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,920
sick and treat them before they treat others. So the virus really gave up two big potential

500
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,640
superpowers. In the case of MERS, sure, it lives in animals and it's never going to leave those

501
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,720
animals. But it has such a poor ability to spread between humans almost under any circumstance,

502
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,760
unless you're probably sticking a breathing tube in them, that it was just so easy to contain.

503
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,280
If the stories stop there, you'd say coronaviruses are just not a threat to us.

504
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,560
Yeah, so I think some people in the field more than me said, well, let's go look at

505
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,800
coronaviruses and bats. And so what they did is they found other coronaviruses. And it was

506
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,200
actually for scientific reason or a different one than just searching for the viruses. We were

507
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,640
trying to figure out where did the SARS coronavirus really begin. So people went and looked at bat

508
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,920
colonies throughout a train accident. That's where SARS began and asked, can we find other bats,

509
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,520
other bat viruses that are more similar to SARS-CoV than the ones we know about right this minute?

510
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,640
Because we could isolate the virus in the wet markets in Wurundjel, but we didn't know where

511
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,640
they came from exactly, which kind of bats. And it was just a trick finding it in bats. And so,

512
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,600
but while doing that, people found other viruses that could, in theory, enter a human cell by using

513
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,560
the same kind of mechanism that SARS-CoV used to enter human cells. So there was some people who

514
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,320
were saying, there were a lot of people, some people in the field who were saying, well, we

515
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,240
potentially have more of a problem because there may be other ways to infect people. There may be

516
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,760
other viruses that can infect people. And so I think there was a concern that this could happen

517
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,200
again. And MERS is the same thing. We haven't identified the exact precursor to MERS in bats,

518
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,400
but it's clearly viruses that look like the MERS, coronavirus in bats. And so if they were able to

519
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,400
use the human receptor and didn't take too much adaptation to infect humans, then you can imagine

520
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,600
the same thing occurring with MERS sometimes in the future occurring again with SARS-CoV-like

521
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:45,520
viruses. So you're right, in 2015, we were thinking these viruses really caused bad pneumonia,

522
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,280
but it's going to be like influenza H5N1. It's going to have very, very little human to human

523
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:58,640
spread and mostly animal to human spread. Is there a necessary relationship that says

524
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:07,120
the viruses like MERS that are incredibly deadly if you get them, just luck is on our side and

525
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:12,800
they don't have much transmissibility? Or is that simply luck so far? And there's no reason to

526
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,800
suggest teleologically that that has to be the case. In other words, you could imagine a scenario

527
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,560
where you take something that has the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, which we'll get to

528
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,280
and explain why it is much more of a headache than SARS-CoV-1 or MERS. If you take the

529
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,760
transmissibility of that, which is both and primarily is a factor of the fact that it can

530
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,440
spread before you're symptomatic, coupled with the actual pathology of MERS, which I want to contrast

531
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,640
with these viruses. I mean, that's a double whammy. You can really get into a dangerous

532
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,520
situation. Not that this hasn't been a disaster, but it could be a 5x disaster. Is there anything

533
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,640
that tells us that's unlikely because of this feature of the biology of the virus?

534
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,840
I don't think there's anything that's unlikely. I don't think there's anything about the feature of

535
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:09,200
the virus. I think about this as SARS-CoV-2 being a mixture of the common cold coronavirus

536
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,360
and then a mixture of either SARS or MERS coronavirus in the lungs. That's why you have

537
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,920
the transmissibility and the severe disease because it does both. When you think about other

538
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,560
bad diseases, like even the epidemic flu in 1918, that really did about the same thing. It was very,

539
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,240
very, very transmissible and it killed about a few percent of the people infected. But if you infect

540
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,400
everybody and you kill 3% or 4%, you're killing a lot of people. That's what this virus is doing

541
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,200
also because it's transmissible so readily because it behaves like a common cold coronavirus. That

542
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,800
rate of lethality is not super high, but the denominator is so huge that you have a lot of

543
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,320
people dying from it. Is there something about the pathology of this virus? How does it differ?

544
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,000
I mean, when you think about SARS-1 and MERS, that let's just say directionally those numbers

545
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,400
are right in terms of the denominator wasn't bigger than we think and you're killing basically

546
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,320
1 in 10 or 1 in 3 people infected. What did the virus actually do in the lungs that would render

547
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,400
people so helpless? Yeah, I think it's the same thing that SARS-CoV-2 does in the lungs. In those

548
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,360
people who get severe disease, I think we don't really understand what's going on. We think that

549
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,000
there's lots of virus in the lungs and we think there's a very strong and probably inappropriate

550
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,240
immune response that's causing much of the damage that we see in lungs. It's a combination of those

551
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,480
two features. That's why people are, from the beginning with SARS, people are trying to figure

552
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:45,600
out a way to both limit virus replication and also decrease the host immune response so that you

553
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,680
don't have this extra result of an exuberant immune response. Do the other two viruses,

554
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,360
SARS-1 and MERS, do they also gain entry through the ACE2 receptor or did they use a different

555
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,600
receptor to enter the pneumocyte? Well, SARS uses the same receptor. MERS uses a different

556
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,400
receptor. One thing that's really curious is SARS doesn't affect the upper airway to an appreciable

557
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,680
extent even though it uses the same receptor. There's also one of the common cold coronaviruses,

558
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:19,840
NO63, uses ACE2 only affects the upper airway and doesn't affect the lungs to any appreciable extent.

559
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,880
And that could also account for the change in transmissibility because if you are only

560
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:31,040
infecting the lower airway, you're probably less transmissible than SARS-CoV-2, which can infect

561
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,680
both. Exactly, exactly. That's why SARS was not so contagious because it only stayed in the deep

562
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,280
lungs until you went to the hospital and had that tube put down for breathing or some other procedure done.

563
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:52,080
So do you think that SARS-1 and MERS were so much more lethal than SARS-2 because they elicited a

564
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:57,680
greater immune response once they infected the lung or because they caused greater pneumocyte

565
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,640
damage when they infected the lung? I think that it's actually because they all cause the same

566
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,920
amount of damage or pretty similar, but you have this huge denominator in SARS-CoV-2 if people have

567
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,360
mild disease. So I think that it's one way to look at these numbers and this is not a perfect

568
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:19,760
calculation, but if you have with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there were 100 people infected, they all get

569
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:26,880
some variation in pneumonia, and you have a certain mortality rate ranging from 10% to 30%.

570
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:34,240
SARS-CoV-2, of those 100 people, maybe 20 of them are going to get the lung disease, the other 18

571
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,680
are going to be asymptomatic, subclinical, have a cold, have something in the upper respiratory tract.

572
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,720
If you now take that 20% as your denominator and divide the 6% mortality that we're seeing,

573
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,520
the 5% mortality, I don't know what the number is exactly, but let's say 5% by 20%, you have a 25%

574
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,720
mortality, which is near the SARS and MERS. So just let me make sure I understand that.

575
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,080
Are you saying it's more the law of large numbers and we have such a big denominator with SARS-CoV-2

576
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:09,040
that you're going to normalize more or are you comparing case fatality to case fatality,

577
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,800
whereas I'm thinking of it as the IFR as opposed to the CFR for SARS? Because I think the IFR

578
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:21,520
of SARS-CoV-2 is very population dependent, but I think it's much closer to 1% to 2%

579
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,120
than the initial numbers that people feared of 5% to 10%, which would put it more in the

580
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,160
ballpark of SARS-2. That's the way I used to think about it when this first started.

581
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,920
In January and February, the mortality rate was 2.8%. And now if you look at anything official,

582
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,960
it's near to 5% to 6%. So what you say makes perfect sense, it should be near to 1% to 2%,

583
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,200
but it's been hard to prove that by all the official numbers. So what I was saying more is

584
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:56,880
that if the mortality rate in SARS and MERS out of everybody who was sick all had pneumonia,

585
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,320
and of those people some number died, and SARS-CoV-2, if only one out of five people or less

586
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:10,880
actually get pneumonia, then the fraction that died, if you use that same fraction who died

587
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,960
over that 20%, you basically are multiplying your number by five. So if your number is 5%,

588
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,520
then it goes up to 25%, if it's 3%, it goes up to 15%. So where we are exactly, I don't know, but

589
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,720
it may be that the upper transmission is the readily transmissibility of the virus is what's

590
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,920
really making the numbers so huge, and that everything else is doing is consistent with

591
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,600
what SARS and MERS did if you confine yourself to just looking at the lower respiratory tract disease.

592
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,240
Now this is something that might be a little bit outside of what you've studied, but I'll ask

593
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,960
anyway. One of the lingering questions, there are so many that I have, comes down to the survivors.

594
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,680
I mean, obviously we think a lot about the mortality of this, but if you take a person

595
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,400
who gets infected, and they're not asymptomatic, so we know that a lot of people kind of don't even

596
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,800
know they've got SARS-CoV-2, and the only reason you figure it out is after the fact serologic

597
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,320
analysis tells us that they did. But there's a non-trivial amount of people who get sick as hell,

598
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,840
and they get what they would describe as the worst cold of their life. I have at least two friends I

599
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,520
can think of in this situation who three months later can barely run a nine minute mile again,

600
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:27,520
and they're slowly getting back in shape. When I did a quick check on this, looking at the SARS,

601
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,080
MERS patient follow-up data, I didn't find a heck of a lot that told me about long-term lung function.

602
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,680
Do you know much about this? And I would imagine that there's now more of an interest to go back

603
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,760
and assess that than there was three months ago when I tried to look this up.

604
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,160
Yeah, even before this all occurred, I asked my friends in Saudi Arabia about follow-up on the

605
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,480
MERS patients, and I could never get information as to what exactly was going on. I suspect that

606
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:59,520
they had problems, whether they be forever or a few months is unclear, especially since your

607
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:05,120
friends were younger and fitter. In MERS, particularly MERS, if it's mostly older people,

608
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:10,720
people with diabetes, people who have comorbidities, they may take them longer to get back to base

609
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,320
or fine. It's probably not going to be running miles. I suspect it'll take a while to get back.

610
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,680
I don't know how much fibrosis was at the end of it all, how much permanent damage there was.

611
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,880
I suspect that there was a fair bit, but you always have, you know, at Kinsaurus, people

612
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,000
always talk about neurological disease without actually ever finding the virus in the brain.

613
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,840
And then it was attributed to being on ventilators and corticosteroids for long periods of time,

614
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,640
contributing to cognitive dysfunction. And occasionally, the virus was in the brain.

615
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,520
So it's all a mix that's hard to really sort out what the major components are,

616
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,240
because there's several things that contribute to the outcomes.

617
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,640
Well, based on your knowledge of coronaviruses and your knowledge, in particular, their impact on the

618
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,040
brain, do you think that there are plausible mechanisms by which, even for those who recover

619
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:10,560
from SARS, there could be lasting neurologic impact that is not the byproduct of hypoxia

620
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:16,800
or vent head, pump head, any of the other more mechanical or other physiologic accounts? In

621
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,160
other words, do you believe that there is a plausible scenario by which the virus

622
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,200
could have residual neurologic value? We can't find any evidence in the virus

623
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,840
in the brain that it seems less likely that it's direct virus infection.

624
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,360
What about an immune response?

625
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,360
Yeah, that's what I was going to say. If you take a disease like Kawasaki's in children,

626
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:40,880
we know that that's a disease that is mediated by some sort of immune response. We don't know

627
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,120
who it seems here, like COVID-19 is somehow provoking this response in this very, very small

628
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,960
subset of children. That certainly leads to consequences in the heart, long term consequences

629
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:59,120
or it can. You can certainly imagine scenarios like that. How often this occurs and what's going

630
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:07,280
on exactly, I don't think we know. Between the resolution, so to speak, of MERS and where we were,

631
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,840
call it a year ago today, Stanley, where was your head at with respect to the big one? Were you in

632
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,000
the camp that said, yeah, I've carved out a pretty nice niche here. I'm going to be studying

633
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,240
coronaviruses forever. Or was there a part of you that said, this is a threat to national security,

634
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,480
to the world. There's a pandemic brewing here. How did you think this could unfold?

635
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,960
I certainly wasn't smart enough to predict that there was going to be a pandemic. As I said,

636
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,360
some of my friends were worried about additional infections in humans. I don't know that anyone

637
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:41,120
would have predicted a pandemic like this one. I want to pause you there for a second. Why?

638
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,080
Not that I did, but I want to push on that for a moment. All the ingredients were there.

639
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:52,160
I was going to say is that Department of Defense in 2010 or 11 put out a report about possible

640
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,040
emerging viruses as being really the major threat. Coronaviruses were on that list.

641
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:02,720
Bill Gates talked about this. It's become a very well-known TED talk that is painful to watch now

642
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:10,080
because of how accurate it was. You have these two examples of viruses that have enormous potential

643
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:16,720
to cause harm, but fortunately for us at the time, they just don't spread well. A few tweaks, i.e.,

644
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,920
infection of the upper respiratory tract and a slower onset to symptoms would easily double

645
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:30,320
your R naught. Fair enough. I'm joking, of course. I'm joking on you guys for not thinking this could

646
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:36,880
happen. Let's fast forward now to when did you first hear about the outbreak in China? I'm

647
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,520
assuming it was early December, late November? No, I don't think it started quite that early.

648
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,080
I would say late December. The first official cases were in December. We think there may have

649
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,120
been some in November, but I think that the people in China, scientists and doctors in China,

650
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:55,920
knew something was going on in December. Then it was eventually reported very early January.

651
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,760
I think we knew a few weeks early, but even then we didn't really know how much human-to-human

652
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,080
transmission there was. Now, I have to say that at the time, given the number of cases, we should

653
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:11,760
have guessed that something unusual was going on. But to the SARS epidemic, we had these cases and

654
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,280
lots of people were infected. We didn't really know how the spread was occurring. At the time,

655
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:25,120
by early January or mid-January, we had 800 cases in the world. It didn't seem to be extraordinarily

656
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,240
different from these other viruses. Maybe if we had had more information about what was going on

657
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,040
in Wuhan, we would have realized, aha, this is doing something that's different than what SARS

658
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:42,400
and MERS did, but we didn't have that information. When did it become clear to you personally that

659
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,120
this was going to be a much bigger problem than SARS and MERS ever were?

660
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,920
Funny you ask that because I remember in December when we really didn't know anything about human-to-

661
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,560
human transmission. I spoke to my friends in China and I got off the phone and told my wife,

662
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,200
this is a big deal. So I'm not sure what I was basing that on because it wasn't so much evidence

663
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,760
of human-to-human transmission. It was pretty clear to me then that this was going to be a

664
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,040
major problem. At that time, could you have predicted it would have been this big an issue?

665
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:18,800
I don't think so. Mostly because all the previous diseases had remained geographically confined.

666
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:23,840
So SARS was really a disease in China with a little spread around the world. MERS was really

667
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,760
a disease in the Arabian Peninsula with that one case in spreading, infecting several people in

668
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,920
Korea. But this one, maybe the dynamics of everything are so different. People spread

669
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,800
travel from Wuhan much more frequently because people have more money. So they fly more, they

670
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:46,080
take the train more. So that helped to spread a lot. Then of course this is transmissible.

671
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,720
The other thing is that we had gone through some of this with H5N1. So in the late 1990s,

672
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,120
people were saying, all we need to do is have this be transmittable and it'd be a disaster

673
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,720
because we don't really have good immune responses to it. And it never happened.

674
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:05,600
So yeah, what happened in 2009 with H5N1? Because the skeptics would say, hey, we don't need to

675
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,880
worry about this SARS-CoV-2. The last time we cried that the sky was falling, it didn't fall.

676
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:18,560
Right. So that was H1N1 in 2009. And that started off as a lethal disease. It was identified in

677
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:24,240
Mexico. It seemed to have a high lethality, but it's more cases became clear, identified. It's

678
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,240
clear that it didn't. It just was lots of cases and very little mortality.

679
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,160
It was basically influenza.

680
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,200
It was influenza. It was just a variant of influenza. There wasn't H5N1, which causes

681
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,880
a severe pneumonia.

682
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,280
H5N1 is the 1919?

683
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,520
No, H5N1 is the one that's never made it to a human population to an appreciable extent.

684
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,120
Pure swine.

685
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,640
Yeah, it's mostly pigs and birds, but it kills birds and most food doesn't kill birds.

686
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:58,080
So the concern was that it would change to infect, to be transmissible human to human,

687
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:04,640
but it never did. So the same thing with thinking about coronaviruses. They hadn't done this so far.

688
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,360
We certainly thought they could do it. But this is an interesting question that's, how do you

689
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:15,520
prepare for a pandemic that you don't have? Because it's something I've been asked about and

690
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:22,240
thought about. So you're sitting there in 2005 and SARS goes away. How do you decide what kind

691
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:27,600
of resources you're going to put developing antivirals, developing vaccines against SARS,

692
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,600
a disease that doesn't exist anymore?

693
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:35,920
The way the American system is set up for this, if you have a good idea and you propose to the NIH,

694
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,680
you have a good chance of getting funding. But on the other hand, if you're competing against

695
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,280
other grants that make more compelling arguments for funding and deal with diseases that are

696
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,320
actually present, they're going to look better to a study section. So you have to figure out a way

697
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:56,080
to identify a disease that could be a problem without going overboard and using lots of

698
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,880
resources for diseases that never will be a problem.

699
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,960
I mean, it seems that you'd want to structure it in a way that says, look, there are some

700
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:10,080
no regret moves here for any viral infection. And then there are some things that are going

701
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:16,640
to be very specific. So for example, not that this is an NIH question, but what would a national

702
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:23,760
stockpile of PPE need to look like? What would an electronic infrastructure for contact tracing

703
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:34,080
need to look like? What would a national stash of reagents to develop serologic and PCR testing need

704
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:38,960
to look like? So we don't know what the gene sequence is, but the moment we know the gene sequence,

705
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:46,240
wouldn't it be great if we could hit go and actually deliver a million tests a day and not

706
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,960
talk about it for three months and not do it? Those strike me as just a no regret moves. You

707
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:56,240
don't need to know a single thing about what's coming other than it is infectious. It's the

708
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:01,280
little stuff. It's the nasal swabs. It's the reagents. It's all the stuff I just said and about

709
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:06,160
20 other things I've been thinking about that kind of I really hope that when this is said and done,

710
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,720
this doesn't get forgotten because it's not a staggering investment. When you consider what

711
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:16,560
we spend on health care and defense, which are disproportionate to any other country by a log

712
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:23,120
order and oftentimes by two log orders per capita, you put a few billion dollars into this type of

713
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:29,280
resource and you consider it more vital than you would consider our national surplus of oil or

714
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,640
other things. For example, most people I would assume know this, but if not, we keep an enormous

715
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:40,960
supply of oil on hand. If the world shut down and we couldn't get a drop of oil from anyone in the

716
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,360
world, we would at least have, I don't know, I don't remember these stats, but probably a 60 to 90

717
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:51,600
day supply of complete independence on oil, maybe more than that. And that's just a national defense

718
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,480
imperative. So this should easily be in that front. The other thing on the therapeutic side, I would

719
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:03,440
say is don't we already have enough evidence to suggest that at least one avenue to treatment

720
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,560
is immune modulating therapy. So maybe not antiviral because that can be quite specific,

721
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:13,440
but all of these diseases have an enormous component of an overactive immune response,

722
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,840
which we'll discuss. And therefore having a huge stockpile of immune modulating drugs to be

723
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:26,080
appropriately dosed also strikes me as a no brainer, right? Yeah, yeah. No, you could argue that. I'm

724
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:32,320
not sure that these diseases are all the same in terms of the cytokine storm type activity, but

725
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:38,720
they may be close enough so that your point is well taken. They are similar enough so that

726
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,840
that would be a reasonable thing to do to have those on hand. I think that's what Bill Gates was

727
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:49,200
probably talking about more than specific drugs against specific viruses, because you don't really

728
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,320
know those so well. Think about it. So the whole stuff with ventilators and all that, that was

729
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:00,640
really poorly done. Testing, I think once we know, you're right about nasopharyngeal swaps and

730
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,920
mechanics of being able to do the testing. The actual identification of targets for like R2P4

731
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:12,400
are not that hard. I mean, that probably took four days to figure out. But it took longer to scale

732
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,080
up. I mean, I think that's the point, right? It's not no, I mean, the virus was sequenced

733
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:21,440
in January 11th or 12th, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. Early in that, actually. It's just scaling up

734
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,720
the ability to do testing. So anybody who says, well, come on, it would be crazy to have $3

735
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,320
billion invested in that on the off chance that the virus doesn't even make it out of China.

736
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,240
To which the answer would be, did you look at what happened to the US economy? It's called a hedge.

737
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:43,040
This is what sophisticated companies do. Sophisticated companies hedge their bets. And if the answer is,

738
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:48,560
every time a really scary virus emerges in China, we have to spend $3 billion to be ready for it to

739
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:54,080
land here. But guess what? We don't have to shut our economy down as a result. We can instead

740
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,560
mitigate 90% of that damage. I mean, it's the wisest investment that could ever be made.

741
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,640
But I'll get off the soapbox now because nobody wants to hear me rant about that stuff. I want

742
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,160
to get back to kind of the interesting biology on this stuff. So let's now go back and talk about

743
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,160
these four viruses that cause us nothing more than nuisance when we get colds. Do they have any

744
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,400
seasonal variability to them, by the way? Are they winter viruses, summer viruses, or does it matter?

745
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,920
They tend to not be summer viruses, and they tend to be more winter, early spring viruses.

746
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,760
What determines that, by the way? Is that simply a function of being close to each other in the

747
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,960
winter and spreading it, or is it actually a property of the virus?

748
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,040
Yeah, we used to think it was that, but as we know more, I don't know the answer to that. I know

749
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,640
that some of these respiratory viruses are more active in the late fall, winter, and others in

750
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,720
the winter, early spring. And I don't know why there's a difference. I don't think anyone else

751
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,800
really knows either. We know these viruses are usually happier when it's a little cooler and a

752
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,840
little drier. But that wouldn't explain why one virus did well in November, and another one did

753
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:02,960
better in March. Interesting. And then from an immune response, why is it that these viruses

754
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,480
haven't basically become irrelevant in the sense that we all eventually get them and we all develop

755
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,360
immunity and we're sort of done? That's really the question about all common cold viruses, whether

756
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,960
they be Corona or otherwise. So why do you actually get reinfected? I don't think we understand it very

757
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:24,400
well. We know that there's an antibody response to these viruses. It seems to wane. It goes away.

758
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:29,840
We know that you need a specific kind of antibody, the IgA response, that seems to help. We don't

759
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:35,600
have that much information about IgA responses. They seem to wane as well. The T-cell response is

760
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,080
the other part of the immune system that you mentioned earlier. We don't know that much about

761
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:45,520
the T-cell response in common cold coronaviruses. Before all this began, we didn't think that was a

762
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,720
big deal because common colds usually go away in a few days before you actually have a T-cell response.

763
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:57,440
So we don't know why things will, why virus immunity wanes. We know there's such huge differences.

764
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:04,240
Smallpox you can detect and people had smallpox in 1918, 1995, they still had antibody responses

765
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:09,680
that were measurable. Here we have these common cold coronaviruses a year later. They've waned

766
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:14,480
and a couple of years later, they're probably almost gone. So we don't really understand that.

767
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:21,600
That's really a key question. And it both impacts the ability to people to be reinfected by SARS-CoV-2.

768
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,640
It impacts the vaccine responses and impacts general herd immunity as we try to get rid of

769
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:32,480
this virus. So really important for not knowing. There probably hasn't been a case of a coronavirus

770
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,880
before where we've cared enough about herd immunity to talk about it. But do you mind

771
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,920
explaining to folks what you're talking about with herd immunity, specifically with respect

772
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,120
to SARS-CoV-2 and what it means? Well, herd immunity is really the other side of what you

773
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:51,360
were talking about, the R-naught factor. So if the herd immunity means if you have a virus that's

774
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:57,360
extremely contagious for people who are susceptible to be protected from the infection, you have to

775
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,040
have most of the people around them be resistant to the virus. So to put this in a different context,

776
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:08,480
if somebody who's infected with whether it be SARS-CoV-2 or measles or anything else comes into

777
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:14,080
a room and they're spreading virus, the virus is going to land in various places. Some of it will

778
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:19,920
land on the floor. Some of it might land on somebody's hands and could in theory infect that

779
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,440
person. But if that person is immune to the virus, then it doesn't matter. The virus can land in that

780
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,160
person's hands and then that person can touch his face, but he won't get infected or he won't get

781
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:36,400
disease anyway. But if the person is susceptible, then he will. So then if that person is susceptible,

782
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,960
he could then spread it to other people in this proverbial large room if they all stayed together

783
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,240
for several days. Now, if you take a situation where you have an extremely contagious virus,

784
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:51,680
so in that room of 100 people, I was saying before with measles, if five of them are susceptible,

785
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:57,520
the virus might spread to 25, 30 people from that one susceptible person. And then if that 5%,

786
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:04,000
maybe one or more of those people will become infected. If you have a virus like SARS-CoV-2,

787
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,600
which has a lower R0 factor than at that same 100 people, if their five are susceptible,

788
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,360
the odds are it will not get to the point of infecting one of those five people. So herd

789
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:21,760
immunity is that ratio, the fraction of people who are immune to a disease. For measles, the number

790
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:29,280
is said to be 95%. If you don't have that 95%, then measles can infect people who are susceptible.

791
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:35,120
For most common viruses, it's around 60 or 70%. So that's the number that people are really

792
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:42,640
looking at in terms of immunization or infection with SARS-CoV-2 to protect the general population.

793
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,600
It's not the same as being immunized or having the previous infection. You're still susceptible,

794
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:52,320
but it just means that it's much more likely the virus won't spread. And if you get sick,

795
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:57,600
it's unlikely you'll spread it to that 30% of the population that has never seen the virus.

796
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:05,040
So that's why it matters. Yeah. And there's a very non-linear but monotonic inverse relationship

797
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,640
between R0 and herd immunity, which I can't believe I actually just said all that. It's

798
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:16,160
basically math speak for the higher the R0, the higher the need for herd immunity,

799
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:21,520
but the relationship gets there non-linearly. I don't have a non-math way to say that,

800
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,480
but the example you gave is a good one, which is, and I said inverse, it's actually not inverse,

801
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:32,720
it's direct. The R0 for measles is very high and the herd immunity threshold is very high, 95%.

802
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:40,720
Going down to an R0 of two to three, you have a herd immunity threshold of 60 to 70%. Now,

803
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:47,520
do you believe that based on everything we know today, and that includes potentially there being

804
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,800
many more asymptomatic people who are infected and who have gotten over the infection than we

805
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,880
previously believed, do you believe that the threshold for herd immunity is still as high

806
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,920
as 60 to 70% for SARS-CoV-2? Or do you think that it could be as low as 20 to 30%?

807
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,920
Well, I think it's still going to be 60 to 70%. It's just that there's a higher percentage of

808
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,280
people who have immunity already. So in other words, you're saying, yeah, it becomes a bit of

809
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:18,640
an academic or a moot point because it might be that of those 60 to 70% who have to be infected

810
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,320
for herd immunity, two thirds of them don't even know they were infected, but they actually were

811
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:28,400
from an immune, okay, fair point. So is there much genetic drift in these viruses? Like influenza,

812
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:33,120
I think most people know, hey, I got to get a flu shot every year. But what they might not

813
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,840
understand is the reason they're getting the flu shot is probably less because their immune system

814
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,320
forgets what influenza looked like and more because influenza looks different every year.

815
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,560
How much do these coronaviruses genetically drift to use the lingo?

816
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,320
So far, we haven't had evidence that this one drifts. I think when you look at the other viruses,

817
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:57,760
one of them seems to vary quite a bit. OC43 seems to have different variants. A lot of the others

818
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:04,240
don't seem to change that much. SARS was adapting to human populations, so it changed. But if it had

819
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,960
stayed around, I don't know that it would have changed much. MERS is completely a camel virus,

820
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,720
so any drift you see is what happens in camels, not in people. Again, both for MERS and the human,

821
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:19,600
the other coronaviruses is not really well, except for OC43. I don't think there's huge

822
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,520
effects on immunity. This virus is really, there's certainly a lot of talk about changes in the virus

823
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,360
and becoming more brutal and more weaker and more attenuated, but there's really no evidence so far

824
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:36,720
that says this virus has changed in a way that makes it unlikely a vaccine will work, unlikely

825
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:42,080
that a previous infection won't protect you from a second infection. There may be reasons why it

826
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,320
won't, but it won't be because the virus is changing so far. That's an important point. I

827
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,840
think we want to reiterate that, right? Which is the doomsday scenario would be a virus that retains

828
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:57,040
its virulence, but constantly drifts enough genetically that your immune system never

829
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,080
recognizes it again, but it retains all of its bad properties. I mean, that's a disaster. If you

830
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:07,680
had a new version of a deadly virus show up every year, it could hurt you just as badly, but somehow

831
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:14,080
its genetic drifting created a different coat on it, a different set of antigens, and every year

832
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,920
your immune system was caught off guard. That would be very painful. And what you're saying is,

833
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,080
hey, we don't have evidence of either of those things happening, that it's genetically becoming

834
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:29,680
more or frankly less harmful of equal, if not more importance, that it's not becoming a different

835
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:33,920
immune animal as time goes on, at least in the very short window we've studied it. But again,

836
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,480
it's helpful to go back and look at these other coronaviruses that you've studied because they've

837
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,920
given us a lot of insight, right? Yeah, exactly. The immunity when you have a mild infection just

838
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,880
do not develop great immunity. So let's double click on that. You've said already part of that.

839
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:54,480
I want to make sure I understood it. So part of it is the innate system, just for whatever reason,

840
01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:01,280
doesn't seem to do much. You've already talked about how a lot of times with at least the common

841
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:06,880
coronaviruses, they might not even stick around long enough to develop a T cell response. Can you

842
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:13,680
say a bit more about the adaptive humoral system? What do we know about the IgM and IgG, which again,

843
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:19,200
if you haven't listened to the interview and the discussion with David Watkins, I think this would

844
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,000
be a great time to go back and make sure you familiarize yourself with that so that we don't

845
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,520
have to go into the details of what those things mean. But six months after a person has a common

846
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:36,240
coronavirus, do you still see evidence of at least the IgG? Yes. And do you know how often it is

847
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:43,120
basically binding, non-binding? Do you have a sense of what the functionality of that IgG is?

848
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:48,240
Is it neutralizing fully necessarily? Not necessarily. I think the human volunteer

849
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:53,440
studies are best answers for that for the common cold coronaviruses. And they show that immunity is

850
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,960
there, it's measured by neutralizing anybody, and then it wanes with time. And that a year later,

851
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,320
it's there and may not prevent shedding. It's still, I think it sounds remarkably like what

852
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:09,360
I think we're going to hear about with COVID-19 and immunity when people have mild infections or

853
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:15,280
asymptomatic. Now, we've talked about this paper that came out, God, I think it's been maybe three

854
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:22,800
weeks ago. Alex Seddi was the senior author on it, 2020 cell paper that looked at 20 patients who

855
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:31,920
recovered from COVID-19. And I believe about two thirds of them actually had a CD8 T cell response

856
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,600
and a CD4 response that kind of correlated with that. The point being, they looked to have been

857
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:44,320
at least partially aided in their response to SARS-CoV-2 from T cells that looked like they had

858
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:50,800
been sensitized by other coronaviruses. Now, this was a small study and this was based on in vitro

859
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:56,160
assays. Can you explain that study a little bit or at least the idea behind it? Because it's an

860
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:00,400
incredibly interesting idea and it has clinical relevance if this turns out to be true.

861
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,680
Yeah. So I think this is one of actually several studies. This is the only published one, I think,

862
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:12,000
that shows that people who have never seen the virus have some sort of T cell response to

863
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,760
SARS-CoV-2. Now, there are some caveats when I read this paper that make me pause and drawing too

864
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,280
strong a conclusion. One is that in most of these papers, the way T cell responses are measured is

865
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:30,080
not by functionality, but rather by being activated in a certain way. And these activations, to my mind,

866
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:36,000
are surrogate for actual functionality. And the functionality was not well demonstrated in any of

867
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,840
these studies. You may see a little functionality, but it's not the major point. Second thing is the

868
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:47,600
targets for these virus, for the T cell response is not the usual response that you get in terms

869
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:53,200
of targets. And you see after the wild type infection, the SARS-CoV-2 infection. And because

870
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:58,160
of this difference, it makes it also a little unclear to me where this response is coming from.

871
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,560
So you can say, okay, that doesn't matter. It's still from a common cold coronavirus. But then

872
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:07,840
when people go back and look at the sequence of the common cold coronaviruses for the same targets,

873
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:14,480
there's actually very little homology with T cell responses that are recognized in these patients

874
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,840
who have never seen SARS-CoV-2. So altogether, on one hand, you could say, well, maybe this is

875
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:26,000
something that's important. Maybe it contributes to protection, pathogenicity. On the other hand,

876
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,600
it's a little odd because it's mostly measured by activation, not necessarily by function. And

877
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:37,360
that may matter. And it's also targets are not totally clear how that's working. So maybe it's

878
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:42,720
something that's not completely clear yet. So I'm a bit confused by that, Stanley, because if we were

879
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:50,480
doing this on the B cell side, which is where we normally would, you would do an in vitro assay

880
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:55,600
and demonstrate the presence of neutralizing antibodies, not just binding, but neutralizing.

881
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,720
And that would give us great confidence that the B cell response would translate from the

882
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:05,680
in vitro finding to the in vivo finding. Is that correct? I agree with you completely. Yes.

883
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:13,440
So we can do comparable T cell assays where we actually look at killing function and not just

884
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,560
signaling functions and things like that, right? Yeah. And this isn't really signaling. This is

885
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:25,360
protein, what was measured with proteins that come up if a cell has been activated at all.

886
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,360
So this is not killing assays, not even making cytokines, which are the my preferred way of

887
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,440
doing this could be easier. Yeah. So that's what I was going to say. Usually when you look at

888
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,480
typical studies that are looking at, say, response to flu vaccination, they look at cytokine response

889
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:46,240
on the T cell. So do you know if studies are looking to do that? Because that just seems to

890
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:51,120
be a very obvious thing to want to ask at this point. Well, for the people who are naive, who've

891
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:55,840
never seen the virus and who have these assays done, T cell responses are done, but they're

892
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:02,320
they're very, very low levels of activity. So the amount of cytokine produced are extremely low

893
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:08,800
or non-existent. So you just wonder, part of the issues, we do some of these assays and you can do

894
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:15,120
it very well. But the level of the background, as it were, is approaching what we're seeing in some

895
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:20,960
of these patients. So I think Jerry's just out on how important it is and what it means. To me,

896
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,240
it's really interesting. It kind of doesn't go with what we used to see, what we've seen in

897
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:31,440
MERS patients, where we don't really see much of a background, much evidence of cross-reactivity,

898
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,120
but we didn't actually do these surrogate assays, these assays for activation.

899
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:40,160
And there may be a temporal component. In other words, it could be that, let's assume that on

900
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:47,680
average, a person gets one year of quasi-protection from a given coronavirus until it can infect them

901
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:54,880
again. You now have a hundred people who are in various stages along a continuum of that recovery

902
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:01,120
from, pick your favorite endemic coronavirus. And then they all, at one day, get infected with

903
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:06,320
SARS-CoV-2. Well, presumably there's also a strength and a decline of immune response.

904
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:12,160
So even though they would all have some immune response lingering, some memory of immune response

905
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:18,960
to the benign coronavirus, they could technically mount very different responses to the much more

906
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:24,960
feared SARS-CoV-2, simply as a function of how far they are out from their initial infection, correct?

907
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,320
I think that's a different layer because it assumes that there's something there.

908
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,160
That's correct. If there's something there, yes, absolutely. This is a totally second layer.

909
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:37,600
Do you think there were other viruses or other vaccines that could provide cross-reactivity?

910
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,880
I don't think provide cross-reactivity is, of course, these ideas that you should immunize

911
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,920
everybody with attenuated polio virus because that'll activate the immune system and that'll

912
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:53,920
give you some protection. You should do something like that BCG, which we use for immunization

913
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,240
against tuberculosis, whether they have any effect. People are suggesting this, and I think

914
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,920
they're in trials even. But in terms of specificity of getting at the coronaviruses, I don't think so.

915
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,800
The BCG one's worth probably explaining a little bit to people because it got so much attention.

916
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:13,680
I think the other one that got quite a bit of attention was MMR. There's a very famous graph

917
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:20,800
that a friend of mine sent me that said, hey, the entire pandemic and the mortality profile,

918
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:27,600
which basically hockey sticks above 50, can be explained by exposure to MMR. People below 50

919
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:34,240
uniformly had MMR vaccination. People above 50, it's much more spotty. The further you get from

920
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:42,160
50, the less likely you were to have an MMR vaccine, and that explains it. Now, I can go on

921
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:46,320
why I don't believe that's the case, but I'd rather hear your views on whether that is or is not likely.

922
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,320
I think it's actually contrary to what one might think because those of us who are over 50 had.

923
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,760
You actually got the real virus.

924
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,800
You're really on all three of those infections. I don't consider myself resistant. In fact,

925
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,560
almost everybody my age had all three of those viruses. Everybody certainly had measles and mumps.

926
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,960
Our German measles may have been less frequent.

927
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,000
But from an immunologic perspective, Stanley, is there any reason to believe

928
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:19,760
that your memory T cells and B cells to measles, mumps, and or rubella would offer you some

929
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,760
protection against this particular coronavirus? Is there any evidence that they offer protection

930
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:29,760
against other coronaviruses? No, I can say that. No one's looked very, very hard, but there's no

931
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,000
reason to think that it would. If there was anything like that, we would all have some

932
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,640
preexisting immunity to the virus that's way higher than what we're talking about.

933
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,640
I'll just tell you why I'm also quite skeptical of the BCG claim, which is not to say that in

934
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,640
certain cases, maybe there's an anecdote that it works. I mean, obviously, one of the first

935
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:56,320
examples of cancer immunotherapy came out of an understanding of the Cooley's toxins that sort of

936
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:02,000
came out of this idea of BCG. But the reality of it is BCG has never shown enough specificity to be

937
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,880
a viable immunotherapy against cancer. And it's for that reason, I guess, even if that's overly

938
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:12,640
simplistic, that I really doubt that BCG could have a meaningful impact on a virus because it

939
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:17,600
requires just as much immune specificity as it does for the immune system to attack cancer.

940
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,320
Yeah, and you know, there's other agents, so we've worked with agents that turn on interferon.

941
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,040
And I think if you give interferon at the wrong time, these infections, you may make people worse.

942
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,640
So if you were exposed to COVID-19, you had a very good exposure right now. And I gave you one of

943
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:37,200
these agents that turn on interferon, that may well help you. Because before you really get an

944
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:43,120
infection, if we jazz up your immune system, that may help you do better with the virus. Once it

945
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:48,560
gets going, that probably isn't true. There's all these issues that one could imagine that if you

946
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,920
jazzed up the immune system of BCG, that it can help you if you got it right the right day, and

947
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:59,920
then you were exposed to COVID-19. But I wouldn't want to be inoculated with BCG just for fun with

948
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,280
the possibility that in the next two days, I get exposed to the virus. You provided a much more

949
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:12,560
elegant description of how you might possibly benefit from it in a Hail Mary, pure luck standpoint,

950
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,480
but how mechanistically it just doesn't even make sense. And you're right, by the way, I think the

951
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:21,280
broader point I would take away from your comment is, there's a really interesting way to think about

952
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,680
this from a targeted therapeutic standpoint. When you think about the sophistication with which we

953
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:32,560
try to treat other diseases with multiple lines of defense, this is a great example of one, going

954
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,640
back to everything I said before about when I was on my rant about how would you begin to prepare

955
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:42,320
for the next time a pandemic comes back, it's all that stuff. On the therapeutic side, I think it's

956
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:47,520
being more thoughtful about what the strategies are. The moment we identify those early cases and

957
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,120
say, boy, this is a disease that typically, like influenza, is a little bit more of an immune

958
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,640
paralysis disease, at least at one point here, you're seeing this hyperactivated immune sense. So

959
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:04,880
early treatment is antiviral with immune amplifier, late treatment is immune modulator,

960
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,360
antivirals long since gone, and respiratory support starts to matter. You can start to really

961
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,680
be more sophisticated in how you think of these things. I think that's probably something that

962
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:17,680
people are starting to think about now, and I suspect that a lot of the clinical trials now

963
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:24,000
will focus on more partitioning. So we don't just think of it as drug X, good or bad, drug Y,

964
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,480
good or bad. We don't have this sort of nonsense binary thinking. I agree with you completely,

965
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:34,720
because that's exactly the way I think about this disease, is that you need antiviral therapy early

966
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:40,960
on, and then maybe an immune modulator later. And in terms of immune activator, if you just catch it

967
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,200
just at the right time, maybe that would help. I think it's actually going to be the same for severe

968
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:51,760
flu, like the H5N1. I think the same scenario applies. The other thing you point out is that

969
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:58,080
with different patients in different disease courses, one has to be ready to modulate therapy.

970
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,880
And this is one of the things that I'd love to have that we don't have, which are biomarkers for

971
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:09,680
different stages of disease. Well, I think for so many diseases, we know that something works well,

972
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,760
and then we do large studies and we find out, you know, it didn't work as well as we think.

973
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:18,640
But if you go back, you say within this population, if we could have identified it first,

974
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:24,560
that would be the people who would have responded to this particular therapy. That's one of the

975
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:30,560
reasons that some therapies work that don't work that you might think would work, because if 20%

976
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:34,800
of people own a category of benefiting from it, would you treat 100%?

977
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,200
You dilute all the benefit. Exactly.

978
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,640
That's such an interesting idea. What do you think some of those biomarkers could look like?

979
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:47,600
There's some obvious ones. When a patient's in cytokines storm, you can measure the cytokines.

980
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,840
But if you could go deeper than that, and you could look at the proteome, and you could look

981
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,640
at metabolomics, or look at the gut, or something like that, where do you think the answer could lie?

982
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:01,360
Okay. So there's two parts of the question. First one is what would you sample? Because

983
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:06,480
the ideal person to be sampled is that person who comes in like your friend who had trouble running,

984
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:11,360
who didn't feel well. And I don't think he progressed to having disease enough to get

985
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:16,320
him in the hospital. No. Yeah. Young, healthy guy in his maybe early 40s, and yeah. Never

986
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:21,040
hospitalized, but sick as a dog for two weeks. Right. So that's a person you'd like to do a

987
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:26,080
test on and say, okay, is he going to progress or not? Clearly, in his case, we'd want something

988
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:31,520
to say he's sick, but he's not going to progress because he didn't progress. So that's a person

989
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,600
who you might not want to do anything for. On the other hand, he may look exactly like someone who

990
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:41,440
has diabetes and is sick in terms of how poorly he felt. And so what you'd want, you'd need a mark

991
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,440
in not only for severity, but you wanted something that would distinguish between the two of them,

992
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,040
and that you could sample easily in the blood because your friend would not have wanted to

993
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,840
undergo some sort of lung measurement because it would have been way more invasive than the

994
01:29:53,840 --> 01:30:00,000
sickness he felt. So that's why you come back. I think you can come back to things like cytokines

995
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,680
and metabolic products. The problem up till now has been that you can see an increase in

996
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:10,720
cytokine X in people who are going to be sick and not increased in people who are going to do better.

997
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:16,160
But when you put them all together, it's not like you have populations that are very high versus

998
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:23,040
very low. You have ones that have a range of X to Y, and the other one would have a range of 0.75X

999
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:31,040
to 1.5X. So you can see that. It seems to be a problem that is set up perfectly for some type

1000
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:37,440
of machine learning because everything you said is correct. And then as you also alluded to,

1001
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,200
there's another layer here, which is we know quite a bit about the epidemiology. All things equal,

1002
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:47,920
a 40-year-old without a single pre-existing condition, you're going to weigh that input

1003
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:54,080
differently than a 60-year-old with no pre-existing conditions or a 40-year-old with type 2

1004
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:59,200
diabetes versus a 60-year-old. They all have a very different physiologic age, even if their

1005
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:05,280
chronologic ages are similar. And so when you start to factor in that plus some of these signatures

1006
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:12,160
plus the temporal nature of the signature, when am I getting this? I think there is an amazing

1007
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:17,920
opportunity for information and data scientists to help prepare us for how we will think about

1008
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:23,520
this when it happens the next time. Yeah. And so what you need out of this is you need,

1009
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,360
as we've talked about for some of the projects we've talked about, what you'd ideally like to

1010
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:33,440
do is you'd like to take people, sample them every couple of days, see what their numbers look like,

1011
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:38,720
put them in the machine learning model that you're talking about. And then if you had enough money,

1012
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:42,800
so you can measure all these different cytokines, you might say, okay, this person has this block

1013
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:47,520
of markers that say he's going to get single. Whether it'd be the 40-year-old, because, you know,

1014
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:52,640
the 40-year-old can get sick, or whether it'd be an older person. And you put the other point you

1015
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:57,920
make about the epidemiology on top of that, and maybe you would not even bother testing the 40-year-old

1016
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:04,000
because the odds of his getting sicker and meriting all the costs and use of research is not worth it.

1017
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,120
We're not there yet in terms of thinking about which markers are best, and also how do you

1018
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:13,920
actually do this? How do you actually do a study where you can help a person by getting serial

1019
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,200
testing and seeing which way he or she is going in terms of disease? But that would be the ideal

1020
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,320
way, because that person, if you saw signs that things weren't bad, maybe that's the person you

1021
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:30,720
use, either remdesivir or hopefully an oral form of remdesivir, stop the virus in its tracks,

1022
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:36,080
maybe give him a immune activator. Again, unclear, I think if you give him immune activator,

1023
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:39,440
some people will be deleterious, so it has to be done so carefully.

1024
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,240
There are two last topics I want to get to, one being how we would study the durability of immune

1025
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:51,840
response, which is effectively the most jugular question out there today. I mean, if we're going

1026
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,520
to think about this through the lens of vaccination, and we're going to think about this through the

1027
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,640
lens of herd immunity, natural or otherwise, we better figure out exactly what's going to happen

1028
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:05,280
to these people who get infected and what superpowers they do or don't have in the future.

1029
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,920
Before I do that, though, I want to go back to one thing we kind of alluded to very briefly

1030
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:14,560
and then skipped ahead, which was that paper that came out kind of recently. Matt Ridley is the

1031
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,640
journalist who wrote about it, I think in the Wall Street Journal, but he refers to the paper by Zahn

1032
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:25,360
that came out, I think in April, that argued basically the virus may not have come from

1033
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,320
the wet market the way we think it does. I know we've been sending each other so many papers back

1034
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,440
and forth over the last few weeks. Did you have a chance to look at that paper? I think so. It's the

1035
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:40,720
one that says there's a bunch of these, so I'm not sure I have the Ridley one in mind, the one that

1036
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:45,760
says it was released accidentally from the Wuhan lab or the one that says it was- No, the one that

1037
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:52,560
said it was basically so genetically stable, it's mostly a person-to-person transmission. So I

1038
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,360
think it basically said, look, this is mostly a person-to-person transmission. And I think it

1039
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:01,840
said if it came out of animals, it was so long ago that we don't know about it. It basically

1040
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:08,560
argues that the narrative that this came from an animal source to a human source in somewhere

1041
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,200
between October, November, December of last year is not correct. Had you seen this paper? No,

1042
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:18,000
I don't know that paper then. Okay, all right. We won't dive into that too much. The point is

1043
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,760
well taken that it is remarkably fit for humans. I don't know about the first part of the conclusion

1044
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:28,720
that it came out earlier, but it is remarkably fit. Yeah, I mean, I think they basically looked

1045
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:34,640
at the amount of genetic drift that occurred and said, I read it I think four weeks ago, so I'm a

1046
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:38,240
little rusty on it other than a few notes I took that were somewhat cryptic. But I think the

1047
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:42,320
argument was, look, this has probably been in humans longer than we think. I'll re-forward it to

1048
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:48,240
after just for the purpose of pure interest. So how do we figure out how long people are going to,

1049
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:52,480
because it might not be that interesting how much immunity people have to regular common cold

1050
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,480
coronavirus, but it's going to be pretty darn interesting to know how long people are going

1051
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:02,640
to have immunity to this virus. I mean, we've already at a minimum seen close to 10 million

1052
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:08,080
people infected worldwide with this virus. Personally, I think that's a gross underestimate

1053
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:13,600
of how many people have been affected. I think it's probably closer to 100 million people have

1054
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:20,960
been infected. But regardless, the durability of their immune response has to be one of the most

1055
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,480
important questions we understand. How would we do that? Yeah, so just doing the things we're doing,

1056
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:31,920
people who are infected, measuring their antibody responses, if we can, measuring the T cell responses,

1057
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,080
the odds are that we're going to see waning immunity for people with mild disease. That's

1058
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:40,320
what we're hearing over and over again. And that's what's been true for other coronavirus infections.

1059
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:45,280
And what will the implication of that be? Will the implication then be that no matter how

1060
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:50,720
successful a vaccine is, it's going to need to be an annual vaccine? There's two goals. One is to

1061
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:56,160
protect the individual who's vaccinated from getting severe pneumonia, and that may actually

1062
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:03,200
occur already. That may be whether immunity wanes or not. That person may never get a severe pneumonia.

1063
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,920
The other issue, which is equally important, is how much immunity do you need to prevent shedding,

1064
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:13,760
to prevent transmissibility to other people? And that's the one that I think is really unknown,

1065
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,160
and to me is more important. Not important to the individual, but to society.

1066
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,840
To me, that's the jugular question that decides what do economies look like when we have subsequent

1067
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,680
waves of this. Because there is something on Instagram a few weeks ago where I did a kind of

1068
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:33,520
Q&A with my son who's five, and he asked a very honest question, which is, when is this virus

1069
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,000
going to be gone? And it was an interesting discussion to explain to him, actually, it's

1070
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,120
never going to be gone. This virus is never going away. There is nothing about this virus that

1071
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:48,240
suggests it's ever going away. And so now the question is, how do we coexist with this virus?

1072
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:54,880
So even putting aside future pandemics, which could be much worse, for example, an increase

1073
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:01,840
in the lethality while preserving the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 would be devastating.

1074
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:08,320
But just coping with this, if another one never shows up, we have to understand this question,

1075
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:13,520
especially if the vaccines are somewhat risky. One thing that doesn't get a lot of discussion is,

1076
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,880
how much risk is going to be posed by vaccines? There's a reason they never come up with RSV

1077
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:25,040
vaccines. It's a lot harder from a safe perspective to make an RSV vaccine, unlike an

1078
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:30,320
influenza vaccine. So if everything is going to be a risk trade-off, right, and we're going to decide,

1079
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:36,160
you might not want to vaccinate everybody with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine if the risk is slightly higher

1080
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:41,760
than we deem acceptable. So then you have to do a cost benefit analysis. And then to your point,

1081
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,480
which I think is even more important is, okay, what does the secondary shedding look like? What

1082
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:51,440
do these other factors look like? It's hard for me to imagine a world that's fully functioning

1083
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:56,560
without these questions resolved. Right. That's really the key question. The other hand, though,

1084
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:02,480
if you get to a point where there's enough herd immunity or that 100 million turns into a 6

1085
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:07,920
billion, people have seen the infection, so nobody gets pneumonia anymore and turns into a common

1086
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:13,920
cold, then there may be enough of a balance between the virus mutating a little to become

1087
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:20,000
a better common cold and no longer causing the pneumonia. But that's the point. It requires a

1088
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,080
mutation, doesn't it, Stanley? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't have the memory like we do with measles

1089
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:30,720
and polio and smallpox to truly generate herd immunity. In fact, we've never generated herd

1090
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:35,920
immunity to influenza commonly. In that case, of course, it's because of the genetic drift. And so

1091
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:42,080
isn't it a bit of a misnomer to suggest that we could ever have herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2?

1092
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,160
Let's just say if we knew that the immune response was gone after a year.

1093
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,640
The question is, what is immune response being gone?

1094
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:53,760
Yeah, a sufficient immune response. I mean, it becomes a sliding scale of efficacy, correct?

1095
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. But if you have enough immune response to protect you from

1096
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,640
pneumonia, then the question is, how much shedding do you have? So that would be actually a

1097
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:06,720
significant ... When we talk about studies, I was thinking about this a little while ago.

1098
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:12,560
The simplest study would be to take some human volunteers, give them a common cold coronavirus,

1099
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:17,200
and then a year later come back and do the exact experiment that was done in the 80s,

1100
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:22,320
measure do they get a cold? If you reinfect them a year later, do they get a cold? And how much

1101
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,200
shedding do they have? We know they shed, but if you are a naive person with a cold, you shed

1102
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,800
10 to the 8th, and now you shed 10 to the 3rd, and it doesn't matter.

1103
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,960
Yeah, then it doesn't matter. Yeah. Well, and of course, here ... So again, I completely agree

1104
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:40,000
with you. That's the single most important question. But the other thing is, I don't have

1105
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,560
my fingers crossed that this is perfect because of that upper respiratory part of this. So you said,

1106
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,800
well, what if you don't get the severe pneumonia before? Well, it turns out the severe pneumonia

1107
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:53,920
that came with SARS-1 and MERS isn't really what was the problem. I mean, that was the problem for

1108
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:58,000
the individual, but that was not the problem for society. The problem for society was the

1109
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,360
upper respiratory part. That's what we're seeing in SARS, or the lack thereof. And that might be

1110
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,880
what's making SARS-CoV-2 such a problem. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1111
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,280
Anyway, Stanley, as you can tell, we can talk about this for days, but I want to honor our

1112
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:16,000
commitment to get you out of here in a certain time. So I look forward to talking with you again

1113
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,040
very soon as we continue to work on the project we're working on with David and a group of other

1114
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:25,520
really amazing people. But thank you for your time and your generosity of insight. Anything else,

1115
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,160
any last thoughts you have on either this particular pandemic or just coronaviruses in general?

1116
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:35,200
No, I think the key thing we talked about is how do you prevent this in the future? We're going to

1117
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,440
muddle our way through this one. We're going to do, we'll get to points I think where we'll have

1118
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:45,280
antivirals, I hope, vaccines, even with the caveats that we talked about that should work,

1119
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:50,240
how long they'll work, I don't know. Whether people actually agree to be vaccinated is another

1120
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:55,280
issue we didn't really talk about. And then for safety, I mean, all these things we're going to

1121
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,200
know very quickly because we have to do it quickly. Well, that means we're going to have to talk

1122
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:06,800
again. Okay. Thanks, Stanley. Okay. Thanks, Peter. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of

1123
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,280
The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a

1124
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:16,160
membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying

1125
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:21,680
on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription.

1126
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:27,120
Now to that end, membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive

1127
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:32,960
podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word

1128
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:39,200
on the street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes,

1129
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:44,640
hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear

1130
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:50,560
everything without having to listen to spiels like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast,

1131
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:55,200
typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best

1132
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:59,680
questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great

1133
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:04,720
way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1134
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:10,720
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,

1135
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:14,880
and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you

1136
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,680
want to learn more and access these member-only benefits, you can head over to PeterAttiaMD.com
