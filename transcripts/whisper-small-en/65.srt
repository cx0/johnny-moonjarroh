00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,480
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,720
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,080
for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,680
simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,200
back more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,920
notes, including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
for each episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,000
of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,440
getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,040
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,240
consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Dr.

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,200
Rick Doblin. Rick is the founder and the executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for

47
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,240
Psychedelic Studies, better known as MAPS. Now, if you listen to the podcast that I did with Tim

48
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,680
Ferris, that name may sound familiar. We spoke quite a bit about Rick, well more so about MAPS

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,320
and really the work that they've been doing to legalize specifically MDMA, but other molecules

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,240
as well for medical use. Rick is, he's a force of nature and there's just no other way I can

51
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,000
describe this interview, how much I learned about a guy that I already sort of knew in terms of his

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,360
background, his passion, what motivated him. He's really a unique individual and at the very end of

53
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,080
the interview, I even sort of comment to that effect that there's just not that many people that can

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,600
really bend the arc of history the way I believe Rick is doing that. We spent about the first hour

55
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,360
and 20 minutes or so putting some background together, both Rick's background where his drive

56
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,520
for this came from and also the background of how these molecules, and we talked mostly about

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,160
LSD as an example, but how these molecules were synthesized, basically made broadly available and

58
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,360
utilized quite liberally and then ultimately how they were scheduled with the drug act of the early

59
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,080
70s. At that point in the podcast, we then turn our attention specifically to MDMA because what

60
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,720
I really wanted to focus on here was MDMA for several reasons. One, as I think I stayed in the

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,680
podcast, whether right or wrong, my personal opinion is MDMA is the single most important

62
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,600
synthetic molecule ever created by our species. Also, it's the closest one to being de-scheduled,

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,840
meaning taken from being an illegal drug that is a Schedule I to something that will have a medical

64
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,200
application and you'll see through this discussion how long it has taken to do that and what the

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,440
implications of that are. Of course, more importantly, you'll probably appreciate why we

66
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,440
would think that that's an important thing to do. When it comes to MDMA, we talk about a lot. We

67
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,760
talk about how it was created back in 1912, how it was rediscovered and resynthesized, where its

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,880
use, where it found its use, and how the parallel use of ecstasy as the party version of this drug

69
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,600
in some ways kind of, well not in some ways, I mean in many ways really hurt the clinical

70
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,400
application of MDMA, which was really where it started, how it was of course scheduled and made

71
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,400
illegal in 1985, which is relatively late compared to all of the other psychedelics. You can see that

72
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,200
through this discussion that MDMA is sort of not your typical psychedelic. Then how a year later,

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,360
Rick created maps and did everything from going off to the Harvard Kennedy School to get a PhD

74
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,000
to help him understand the regulatory morass he was going to have to navigate his way through

75
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,640
and right to where we are today, which is truly being on the cusp of legalizing this incredibly

76
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,240
powerful molecule that is going to help, in my opinion, literally millions of people.

77
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,400
So I'll just give you one example of something that we dive into pretty deep that I think people

78
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,160
are going to find very interesting, which is the toxicity of MDMA. So there are lots of rumors about

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,360
the toxicity of this drug and of course every drug has toxicity. So the point here isn't that it

80
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,080
doesn't have it, but the point is what is the toxicity and is it really what we were led to

81
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,520
believe with everything from depression, Parkinsonian syndromes, neuronal destruction, versus what's

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,800
actually happening. So a very nuanced discussion on that and I think we end with a message of hope,

83
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,040
which is one, there are going to be many people I think who listen to this who are going to wonder

84
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,200
what can they do to receive this therapy and we're going to talk about what those clinical trials

85
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,000
look like, what the enrollment looks like, and perhaps more importantly what a compassionate

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,800
use license would look like such that if there are patients who are in need of this therapy

87
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,720
prior to its approval, what are the legal paths to do that? I have to state something very important

88
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,720
that I feel strongly about. Of course, the Drug Enforcement Agency considers MDMA to be a schedule

89
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,280
one drug. That means it is illegal. That means according to the DEA, at least at the time of

90
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,600
that scheduling in 1985, they do not believe there to be a medical use and that they believe

91
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,240
that it has the high potential for abuse. Now, I think you'll see from this discussion, neither

92
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,080
Rick nor I agree with that at all, but we do have to respect the letter of the law. So there's

93
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,240
nothing in this podcast that I want to be construed as encouraging you and or endorsing the use of

94
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,640
illicit MDMA. I think there are more than sufficient legal channels by which people could pursue

95
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,560
compassionate exemption for the appropriate treatment of PTSD, which is at this point in time

96
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,480
where we believe MDMA is most valuable. So with that said, sit back and please enjoy

97
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:50,040
my interview and discussion with Dr. Rick Doblin. Before we begin this podcast, I want to point out

98
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,640
something that we did here a little different from what we've done in previous podcasts.

99
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,040
Rick and I sat down for a very lengthy conversation. And in the beginning, we spent a lot of time going

100
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,760
really deep into his background. Now, while I think this conversation is really interesting,

101
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,920
I also realize that the entire conversation is long and many of you may be tuning in

102
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,320
for more of what we talk about at the end, specifically as it pertains to MDMA. So what

103
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,440
we did is we took roughly the first hour and 15 minutes of this interview and put it at the end.

104
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,280
So what you're about to hear is where we pick up the conversation, again, roughly an hour 15 into

105
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,280
it, where we start to talk about maps and Rick's work on MDMA, which I think is what the majority

106
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,520
of you are probably wanting to hear about. Then at the end of that podcast, we will roll directly

107
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,640
into the initial conversation on Rick's background, which the diehards like me will find just as

108
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,760
interesting as this is a different sort of format than we typically do. Hopefully it makes sense and

109
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,320
you'll enjoy the interview, but it's our belief that this will create slightly better flow for

110
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,120
what you're about to hear. Rick, thanks so much for opening your home today. Oh, it's a pleasure

111
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,440
to have you here. Every once in a while, I get ready to sort of interview somebody and I think

112
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,760
to myself, this is highly applicable. This is incredibly broad. This topic we're discussing

113
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,520
is so important. And I don't know, as I was coming over here, I was talking to my wife

114
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,760
and she said, I can't believe I'm not there to listen to you guys have this discussion,

115
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,600
to which I said, you've never once listened to me record a single podcast. Why are you so interested

116
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,720
in this? And she's like, I don't know. I just, you've spoken about Rick so much and you've spoken

117
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,040
about MDMA so much that I just don't want to miss it. And I said, well, don't worry. It's going to

118
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,120
be recorded. You're going to be able to hear it with everybody else. But this is a discussion

119
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,480
I've wanted to have for such a long time. Now, in many ways, there's probably few people,

120
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:55,640
if any, that have done more to sort of right the wrongs of that era and that we're now 33 years

121
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,960
into an organization that you started that organization. You started in 1986 called MAPS.

122
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,640
Tell me what MAPS stands for and what you set out to do. So MAPS is multidisciplinary association

123
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,480
for psychedelic studies. I knew at the time that I wanted to have the word psychedelic in the title

124
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,960
of the nonprofit. So just to go back a little bit further. So in 1972, when I was at New College and

125
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,840
having difficulties with my psychedelic experiences, I went to the guidance counselor

126
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,880
at college and I asked for help. And I said, I'm having powerful, important experiences,

127
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,920
but I'm not able to fully integrate them. And I was just so fortunate. The guidance counselor gave

128
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,920
me a copy of a book, Realms of the Human Unconscious by Stan Groff about his work with LSD

129
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,520
before it was even published, manuscript copy. And it was reading that book that really helped me

130
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:55,400
see that here is science, here is spirituality, but viewed through a scientific lens. And it had

131
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,360
the reality check of therapy. It's focused on how do you help these people suffering from different

132
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,080
conditions grow. And so I felt that this was now everything together for me, science, mysticism,

133
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,880
spirituality, the sense of unity and therapy reality checks. So in 72 is when I decided to

134
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,760
become a psychedelic therapist. And I wrote a letter to Stan Groff and he ended up writing me

135
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,360
back. And I took a workshop with him in the summer of 72. And I did everything that I could

136
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,800
to try to elevate and expand my consciousness, including I have the delusion that the more I,

137
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,200
psychedelics I took, the faster I would evolve, which I underestimated the whole integration

138
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,840
process. So I basically then took 10 years to integrate. I dropped out of college. I didn't see

139
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Stan anymore. I spent 10 years trying to get prepared to make psychedelics the forefront.

140
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,720
So I was in the construction business and build houses and build various things and got grounded

141
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,560
in this 10 year period. And every once in a while would take LSD and work on my fear. And so I went

142
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,480
back to college in 1982 at new college, the same college I had dropped out of. I'd built houses for

143
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,800
a couple of the professors. I figured out how I could sort of frame what I was doing as studying

144
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,680
transpersonal psychology and psychedelic psychotherapy. And so the very first semester

145
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,440
that I went back to school, Stan Groff was giving a workshop, a month long workshop at Esalen called

146
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,040
the Mystical Quest. And where's Esalen? Esalen is in Big Sur. It's about three and a half hours

147
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,920
south of San Francisco. It's on, perched on the cliffs overlooking the ocean. There's hot springs

148
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,640
that come up there. There's baths. It's sort of the cradle of the human potential movement.

149
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,280
You were just there. I was just there for a week long program on psychedelics where the entire

150
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,720
property, which fits around 120 people, it's sort of a commune, you could say, where they grow their

151
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,640
own food. Their job is to provide housing and workshops for people. They've been involved

152
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,640
since the 60s started by Dick Price and Michael Murphy. Fritz Pearls from Gasol Therapy lived

153
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,560
there. Ida Rolf from Rolfing. Stan Groff was there for about almost 15 years as scholar in residence.

154
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,640
All sorts of people have taught there and still going. And so this particular workshop that I

155
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,840
was just at had the largest waiting list in the entire history of Esalen since the 60s. They had

156
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,640
over a thousand people try to get into this program for 120 people. But I went there in September of

157
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,720
82 as the beginning of my going back to school. My first semester was going to be about creating a

158
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,640
curriculum to become a psychedelic therapist. And so during this month long at Esalen with Stan and

159
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,680
Kristina Groff, his wife, this woman named Debbie Harlow came by. She wasn't in the workshop,

160
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,920
but she came by to Esalen and she started talking about this new drug called Adam, which was MDMA.

161
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,680
And that it was used in therapy. It had been used in underground therapy circles since the middle 70s.

162
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,880
It was itself legal at the time, but it was kept quiet because this was again during the drug war

163
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,720
period. And that if it were made public, chances are it would be criminalized. And when we learned

164
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,120
about it in 82, when Debbie started talking about it, she also shared that it had escaped these

165
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,720
therapeutic circles and was being sold as the drug ecstasy. So it was clear that it was doomed.

166
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,400
It just wasn't clear when. And my initial impression of it was that I underestimated it.

167
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,840
You underestimated the drug or the backlash that would come against it?

168
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,160
The drug.

169
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,800
Okay.

170
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah. So she said it helps you feel love. It helps you feel connected. It helps you be a better

171
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,080
listener and helps you talk to people, speak from your heart. And I felt that I'm in love. I feel

172
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,480
love. I feel like I can talk. I saw a group of people doing it and they were just sitting

173
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,280
around in a circle talking to each other. And I thought, how profound can that be? When you take

174
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,640
250 micrograms of LSD, you can't talk. You go into this nonverbal place. That's what's really

175
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
profound. You go beyond your ego.

176
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:50,040
At that time, Rick, was the language that we now use to describe that distinction known,

177
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,160
was it understood that for example, psilocybin was an entheogen while MDMA was an empathogen?

178
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,880
Did we even understand what that meant in 82?

179
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,120
In 82, not quite then. So entheogen, I don't actually use that word because that's the God

180
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,320
within to generate a spiritual experience. I think that that word was created by Jonathan

181
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,520
Ott and others to try to create a counter to the word hallucinogen. So hallucinogen is

182
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,640
pejorative, negative. It's a delusion. It's negatively loaded. Enthiogen is sort of

183
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,960
positively loaded. It's going to be spiritual. Psychedelic is mind manifesting. It's neutral.

184
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,920
And it describes what it actually does. So I've chosen to try to reclaim the word psychedelic.

185
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,480
The empathogen is a really good word for MDMA, that it produces empathy. Others, Dave Nichols,

186
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,160
that was Ralph Metzner's word, empathogen. Dave Nichols proposed entactogen to mean to touch

187
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,960
within. And what was going on there, so that was really created, those empathogen, entactogen,

188
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,400
those words were created once we needed in our legal case to try to protect the use of MDMA.

189
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,240
It was to try to say that it wasn't like a traditional psychedelic. So I think in 82,

190
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,040
when I was first learning about MDMA, when I was foolish enough to underestimate it,

191
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,760
but smart enough to buy some, that it was clear that MDMA was not like a classic psychedelic.

192
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:16,120
There's no dissociation. There's no hallucination. You remember it as though you're completely awake.

193
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,600
It is really in a class of its own in that way, isn't it?

194
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,560
Yeah. Yeah. It's very good. And so that was the attempt to try to, the entheogen

195
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,600
word was just to try to balance out hallucinogen, but empathogen and tactogen was part of our legal

196
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,920
case to try to say this was a different class of drugs and you couldn't criminalize it the way

197
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,920
these others had criminalized it. That in the end failed. And psychedelic is a broader word,

198
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,960
mind manifesting. So I think that MDMA is a psychedelic, but it's not a classic psychedelic.

199
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,760
So once I learned about it and actually underestimated it, but bought some and

200
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,520
tried some and was then just profoundly impacted by how subtle it was and how

201
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,480
incredible of a drug it was. Do you remember the first time you took it?

202
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,400
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I remembered it really well. I was with the girlfriend and we took it together.

203
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,480
And at one point we said this love we're expressing and experiencing is, it's really us. It's not a

204
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:14,280
drug delusion. It's liberating us to express what we really feel. I felt like the profundity and the

205
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,440
depth of connection was genuine and also something that we could learn from. I think one of the

206
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,800
things that makes this so helpful therapeutically in this drug is that because you're not dissolving

207
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,520
your ego, it's easier to integrate what happened. It's not that far away from normal consciousness.

208
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,920
It's a subtle shift with a reduction in fear and the amygdala in different areas.

209
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,320
It's just profound therapeutic. And so once I tried it, I thought that this was an incredible

210
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,360
opportunity because there was going to be a backlash, but it was still legal. And I had

211
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:54,200
learned about LSD, really the value of it in 71 and 72 after the backlash, which was 1970 and the

212
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,480
Controlled Substances Act and criminalization of all the psychedelics and the effort to squash

213
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,840
psychedelic research all over the world. So I felt I missed my moment.

214
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,080
You knew you had a small window, but you didn't know how big it was going to be.

215
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,720
Yeah. So I started a different nonprofit in 1984 before maps. What had happened actually,

216
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,960
and again, it's great that you're wearing the doors shirt because Laura Huxley was key to

217
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:26,760
my whole life. So in 1983, after I had learned about MDMA, I read this book by Robert Mueller,

218
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,800
who was the Assistant Secretary General of the UN. He was from France, a French resistance fighter.

219
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,720
He was the mystic of the UN. He'd been there for 40 years. The book was New Genesis,

220
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,360
Shaping a Global Spirituality. And so this book was about how the UN is for conflicts between

221
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,880
nations, but actually a lot of these conflicts are religious conflicts and how he felt we needed a

222
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,960
global spirituality that would enliven every particular religion. It's not like a one-world

223
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,560
religion, like one-world language, but it was the sense that religions are like languages. They're

224
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,560
all different ways of expressing something similar, a similar reality. And that if we move beyond my

225
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,560
religion as the one right religion, and if you don't follow it, you're an infidel or you're all

226
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,120
these religious wars that we've had over the centuries, this idea that there was this sort of,

227
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,200
we're all from the same planet. We all have more in common than separate. That's what Robert Mueller

228
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,160
wrote about this global spirituality and as the key to human survival. So I wrote him a letter

229
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,240
as a college undergraduate. And I said, I agree with what you say, but you don't say anything

230
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,800
about psychedelics. I told him about the Good Friday experiment. I mentioned MDMA as a tool

231
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,120
that could be used. And he wrote me back and introduced me to various people who were mystics

232
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,160
to share MDMA with them and see what they had to say. So this letter though, that I wrote to Robert

233
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,920
Mueller was Debbie Harlow Sott, who had introduced me to MDMA. She showed it to a friend of hers who

234
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,800
showed it to Laura Huxley. And so Laura thought, wow, I'm trying to do important political work,

235
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,840
outreach work. So I got invited to meetings that were taking place at Esalen organized by Dick

236
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,760
Price and others to try to figure out how to protect MDMA and how to bring this MDMA had sort

237
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,320
of revitalized the psychedelic underground because now there was a new tool that was tremendously

238
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,080
effective and it was legal. But there was a parallel sort of social drug that was coming out

239
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,640
as well. So when was ecstasy becoming the sort of parallel path for MDMA to become mainstream? Was

240
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,280
that about the same time? Yeah, that was about the same time. So Michael Klieg was one of the people

241
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,200
that had gotten MDMA under the name Adam in these sort of therapeutic contexts in private homes,

242
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,840
not all done by therapists and patients, but personal growth, private homes out of public

243
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,960
settings. Michael had been involved with being a cocaine dealer. Others, he knew other cocaine

244
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,560
dealers and he thought this was a tremendous drug and more people should know about it. And so he

245
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,840
created ecstasy. He created this ecstasy and started marketing it in public ways. And that was going

246
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,720
to attract the attention of the government, particularly at the Stark Club in Dallas was

247
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,800
where it became a real party drug. You could buy it over the counter 800 numbers. Michael had quite

248
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:13,800
a large operation. And was it at the time ecstasy pure MDMA or was it typically included with other

249
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,240
impurities or additional stimulants? It was pure MDMA. It was great quality and people had incredible

250
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,800
experiences and started sharing it more and more and more and more people wanted to do it. And so

251
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,600
it was used a lot. It was sort of the beginnings of the rave movement, the dance movement. It was

252
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,640
used in these more public settings. And so that was a concern to those of us that were interested

253
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,360
in trying to protect the therapeutic use that this public use was going to doom it. And we

254
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,960
actually contacted Michael and others. He approached us at different conferences. And so we got to know

255
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,000
who the underground manufacturers were. And basically I said that they owed a debt of gratitude

256
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,720
to the people that created MDMA and they should help us protect it. And so they did make some

257
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,200
donations for us to help in our legal efforts. And just to give listeners the background, right? I

258
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,520
mean, MDMA, again, like LSD, completely synthesized manmade originally synthesized in 1912, I believe.

259
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,600
Yeah. Somewhat forgotten about, correct? Yeah. So MDMA was invented by Merck Pharmaceutical in 1912.

260
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,640
They were actually looking to evade a competitor's patent on getting to a different drug. And so they

261
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,480
had a whole different synthetic route and they patented every step along the way, MDMA being one

262
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,600
of them, but they weren't looking for MDMA. It was just an intermediary towards the other ultimate

263
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,480
goal. Yeah. And then they did nothing with it. World War I came along. It's a German pharmaceutical

264
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,920
company and they actually didn't test it in animals until 1927. And at that point in time,

265
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,440
they found nothing of interest and abandoned it. It's funny to me, by the way, to imagine animals

266
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,960
on MDMA. That's such an interesting concept. Like would it do anything to an animal? Do they?

267
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,680
Well, it does actually. And so some researchers at Johns Hopkins have done studies with octopuses

268
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,680
with MDMA. So as it turns out, octopuses- You can make them less ornery? Yes, you can. They're

269
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,800
solitary creatures unless it's mating season. And so they've got this experimental contraption.

270
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,800
This is a digression, but it's worthwhile. They've got this experiment. So they put an octopus in the

271
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,520
center chamber and then they have two chambers off of each side. One has an inanimate object in it,

272
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,080
in a kind of a birdcage so that it doesn't move in a larger area. And the other has an octopus in

273
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,200
this sort of birdcage, so it doesn't move either. So under normal circumstances, the octopus will

274
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,280
spend way more time with the inanimate object than with the other octopus. They don't really like

275
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,640
being with other octopuses. We supplied the MDMA for this experiment, we meaning maps. So we ended

276
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,360
up that they figured out how to dose the proper amount of MDMA in the water. So they soak the

277
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,640
octopus in a bath of MDMA infused water for 10 minutes. And then they put the octopus back in

278
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,800
this experimental contraption. And lo and behold, now they spend way more time with the other

279
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,800
octopus. And humans and octopuses diverged 250 million years ago. And so the big question that

280
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,480
the experimenters had is first off, would octopuses react to MDMA at all? And then secondly,

281
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,040
even if they did, would it have any kind of similar effect as it does in humans? And it turns out that

282
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,960
it does. Suggesting that whatever MDMA is doing is in a primitive enough part of our brain,

283
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,440
meaning it was still there before the bifurcation of us. Yes, yeah, yeah. Suggesting it's not in the

284
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,400
cortex. Yes, and also that it's something that we're not only in the cortex. Exactly, not exclusively

285
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,880
in the cortex. And also that the FDA has told us that if we manage to prove safety and efficacy in

286
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,080
adults, they want us to do work in adolescence with PTSD. And if that works, they want us to go

287
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,360
down to seven to 11 year olds. So it suggests to me that working with the octopus that young children

288
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,680
who've been traumatized may still benefit from MDMA even if they don't have a lot of verbal

289
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:52,680
facilities. And so MDMA has also been given the same group at Hopkins just published a paper in

290
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,920
Nature, which we can reference to. We'll go to all these things, yeah. Yeah, they just published a

291
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,440
paper in Nature that was in mice. And what they showed is that MDMA releases oxytocin,

292
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,640
which causes neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons and new neural connections in pro-social

293
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,560
areas of the brain. And they speculated that that's what's underlying the increase in the

294
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,600
therapeutic alliance between patient and therapist that MDMA catalyzes this oxytocin release, hormones

295
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,400
of love and bonding and nurturing nursing mothers and when you're in love. But when Merck came back

296
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,880
to it, there's like this period where it was sort of forgotten about until Sasha came along and

297
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,680
started synthesizing. Sort of. So what happened then, so invented in 1912, 1927 Merck does studies

298
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,680
in animals and then gives it up. The next time that we know about it was in 1953 when the US Army

299
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,360
Chemical Warfare Service tested eight different drugs for toxicity in animals. This was classified,

300
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,760
it didn't come out until the early 70s. So very few people knew about it, but MDMA was one of those

301
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,040
drugs. And so what they did is they tested a series of eight drugs with mescaline on one side

302
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,400
and methamphetamine on the other and MDMA more in the middle. So I think that's a good way to

303
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,560
understand MDMA is that it has the energy properties of methamphetamine. That's why people can take it

304
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,200
and stay up all night and dance. It makes you alert, but it doesn't make you jittery like

305
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,800
methamphetamine. You can take it and be alert, but be perfectly still. You can use it in meditation

306
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,240
and many people have actually. Is it technically considered a stimulant? I mean, it is an amphetamine

307
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,160
chemically. Well, it has stimulant properties for sure, but it's also similar to mescaline,

308
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,920
but it doesn't have the ego dissolving sort of visual classic psychedelic properties that mescaline

309
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,520
has. So MDMA is kind of between mescaline and methamphetamine, but different from each end of

310
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,520
the spectrum. So that research was done in animals. There's no evidence that they did anything in

311
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,240
humans and that wasn't declassified till the early seventies. So then what happened though is that a

312
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,720
drug called MDA, methylenedioxymhetamine, was developed independently and it became quite

313
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,760
popular during the sixties and it was called the miracle drug of America. It's a little bit like

314
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,360
an MDMA LSD combination and a lot of people really used it during the sixties. It was a pretty

315
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,360
incredible experience and also kind of a different contrast to LSD, a softer version of LSD.

316
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,600
And so once all the drugs were criminalized in 1970 in this backlash in the controlled

317
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,680
substances act, then chemists like Sasha and others were looking to modify drugs that were

318
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,960
illegal to develop new versions that would be legal and might have therapeutic properties. So

319
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,520
it was because of the popularity of MDA that people started looking at that kind of molecule

320
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:45,560
and then MDMA was actually rediscovered without people knowing that it had been invented by Merck

321
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,080
or that the army chemical warfare service had used it. And then it became used. So Sasha Shulgin

322
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,040
actually was told by a graduate student of his that he should check into that particular molecule.

323
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,680
And then he took it and the way Sasha worked was incredible that he and his wife Anne,

324
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,320
he would invent these new drugs. He was looking for drugs for consciousness change. He had been

325
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,240
working for Dow and had invented a biodegradable insecticide and Dow had given him his own lab

326
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,120
and said, you could do whatever you wanted to do. But what he wanted to do was investigate psychedelics.

327
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,000
And he'd had his first experience was with mescaline and he had a very spiritual experience

328
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,840
with mescaline. After a while, it was clear that he wasn't going to be producing anything that

329
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,240
Dow wanted to market. And so he left and started on his own and taught chemistry, but really became

330
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:39,000
the premier American psychedelic chemist. And so he resynthesized MDMA and his process was he would

331
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,880
take things himself. He and Anne would take them. They had a group of 12 people that they would,

332
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,040
and these were the same 12 people that they would test all these new drugs. And he felt that

333
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,440
individuals are so different from each other. If you have 12 people and you all take the same drug,

334
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,920
you'll get a range of experiences and that gives you a good sense of what this drug might be.

335
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,760
And those drugs that this group of 12 thought might have therapeutic potential, then he worked

336
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,360
with a fellow named Leo Zeph, who was a clinical psychologist, PhD, who had, when the crackdown

337
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,360
came, decided to continue using psychedelics. And so Leo was sort of the leader of the underground

338
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,240
psychedelic psychotherapy movement. The first book that MAPS ever published was called The

339
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,560
Secret Chief. And then a few years after that, we were able to publish The Secret Chief Revealed,

340
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:29,240
once his family was comfortable with us talking about Leo. Leo was going to retire, but once he

341
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,120
did MDMA, he realized that this had incredible therapeutic potential. So he didn't retire and

342
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,440
Leo is the one that trained lots and lots of therapists and psychiatrists. And he really built

343
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:45,080
up the therapeutic use of MDMA. And so from the middle 70s to the middle 80s, half a million doses,

344
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,680
much of it made at MIT secretly. Chemists at MIT were making MDMA for this underground

345
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:57,000
therapy community. And it was out of that then that it leaked and Michael Klee turned it into ecstasy.

346
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,840
Is it your belief, Rick, that had ecstasy never made it to the public party scene,

347
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:13,160
that MDMA could have potentially evaded censorship that came with its criminalization as a schedule

348
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:19,720
one? Is it possible this could have just at that moment in history been integrated into

349
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,760
medically accepted psychotherapy? I don't think so. No, I think that there was the backlash against

350
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,040
the classic psychedelic. So the summer of 84, so I started going to these meetings at Esalen

351
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:40,840
in 83, 84 and 85. And we were planning how to protect MDMA. The summer of 84 is when I started

352
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,640
Earth Metabolic Design Lab. So that was the nonprofit that actually had been started by

353
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,200
Buckminster Fuller. And a friend of mine had a branch of it in Sarasota, Florida for alternative

354
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:57,160
energy. My friend hadn't used it. And so I was able to take over the nonprofit and interpret the

355
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,800
alternative energy to include mental energy as well. And so that was the nonprofit that we used

356
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:09,080
to try to organize to protect MDMA once the eventual backlash happened. So when the DEA

357
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,720
first moved to criminalize MDMA in the summer of 84, Sasha had had connections with an attorney,

358
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,760
Rick Cotton, with a big DC law firm. Andy Weill had gone to Harvard as an undergraduate with

359
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,960
Rick Cotton and now. So Rick was monitoring the DEA. And so once the DEA moved to criminalize

360
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,720
MDMA, he let Sasha know so that we had 30 days to go to Washington. And so I went to Washington on

361
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,920
like day 28 and filed for a lawsuit to try to DEA administrative law judge hearing. So if there

362
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,440
hadn't been the crackdown at that point, that was still an era when all psychedelic research was

363
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,280
banned. That didn't change till 1992 when the FDA had an advisory committee meeting and decided that

364
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,920
they would open the door to psychedelic research. That was where in 1990, a new group of people at

365
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,520
the FDA took over regulating schedule on drugs and they decided to put science before politics.

366
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,280
Let's pause for a moment and explain what are the criteria for schedule drugs. So you have

367
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,520
four schedules within the DEA. I'll let you explain what schedule one is and we'll work our way.

368
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:15,560
So schedule one is for drugs that have a high potential for abuse, no accepted safety under

369
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:22,680
medical supervision and no currently accepted medical use. That basically says this is incredibly

370
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:31,400
harmful, addictive, etc. And there is no benefit to using it medically. And so heroin is a schedule

371
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:38,040
one drug. Conversely, cocaine is not the listener might say, wait, how could cocaine, which of those

372
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,160
two does cocaine not satisfy? Well, it clearly satisfies the first one. It's highly addictive

373
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,280
and harmful, but it turns out it does have one very important medically valid use, which is

374
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,000
it's a remarkable local anesthetic in very vascular areas. And so cocaine is used quite carefully in

375
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,960
nasal surgery. If you're having a nose procedure done by an ENT surgeon, there's a reasonable

376
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:09,000
chance they use cocaine. So MDMA lands itself as a schedule one drug, meaning it's on the same

377
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,240
level as heroin or methamphetamine. Well, methamphetamine also has a medical use. Oh,

378
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,720
that's right. That's right. Yeah. So marijuana is a schedule one drug. So the way in which it's been

379
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,000
interpreted, high potential for abuse, they emphasize the word potential. So it doesn't

380
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,080
have to have a lot of people using it. It just has to have a high potential for abuse. And the

381
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:37,080
way they defined abuse is non-medical use. It's a very loose definition. It can encompass anything

382
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:45,400
because it doesn't have to actually have harm. It just has the high potential for abuse. So a grape,

383
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:51,400
technically, could be a schedule one agent. Well, what's the potential for abuse of a grape? I mean,

384
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,080
well, if you ate enough, you could get diabetes. Yeah, that'd be a bit strange. I don't think

385
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,600
grapes are likely to be scheduled, but I see your point. Yeah. I mean, it's so ridiculous is my point.

386
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:06,120
Yeah. No accepted safety under medical supervision just means that it's not a prescription drug.

387
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,760
The definition becomes a bit of a tautology. Yeah. And no currently accepted medical use.

388
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,800
I think where people misinterpret what schedule one means is that it doesn't mean that the

389
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:23,720
government has determined that there is no medical use. There's no currently accepted medical use.

390
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,560
And currently accepted has been interpreted as FDA approval. It's not that you have a whole bunch

391
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,720
of doctors that say, this looks like it's got incredible potential. They've made it so to get

392
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:40,120
out of schedule one, you have to have FDA approval. So schedule two is high potential for abuse, but it

393
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,040
has currently accepted safety under medical supervision and it's got a currently accepted

394
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:50,040
medical use. So opiates fit into this category, fentanyl, oxycodone, Oxycontin, cocaine, as we

395
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,360
discussed. Yeah, methamphetamine for attention deficit disorder. Schedule three is for drugs that

396
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,800
have less than high potential for abuse. Schedule two drugs, whenever there's a prescription,

397
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,240
one copy goes to the DEA. So there's a lot of special controls for schedule two drugs,

398
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,280
even though they're medically available. You can't write a prescription that's automatically renewed

399
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,480
for a schedule two drug. Every new prescription has to be written explicitly by your doctor. You

400
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,200
can't renew this every three months for the next couple of years. So, and it goes down there from

401
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,120
schedule three to schedule four to schedule five, where you get over the counter drugs, but they're

402
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,720
still controlled in certain ways, but minimally. So what we're anticipating and what we're trying

403
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:39,080
to do is move MDMA and also psilocybin is schedule one drug. LSD is schedule one drug. Mescaline is

404
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,560
a schedule one drug. All these psychedelics are schedule one drugs. Ketamine has been used as a

405
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,360
dissociative anesthetic by anesthesiologists and it's a prescription medicine. It was just approved

406
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,440
as ketamine, an isomer of ketamine was just approved for depression. And it's considered among

407
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,680
the most important, if not the most important new development in the treatment of mental illness in

408
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,320
the last several decades, because it's being used for depression and it's effective relatively

409
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,040
immediately rather than the current anti-depressives that sometimes take weeks and weeks of daily

410
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:14,120
dosing. So this schedule system, what eventually I think should happen is that the psychedelics

411
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:20,360
should be de-scheduled completely. I think that there's a fundamental human right that people

412
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,240
have to explore their consciousness, particularly when you think about it as spiritual experiences,

413
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,960
that we should have this fundamental human right. I believe we should have a system of licensed

414
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,960
legalization. Is there a precedent for the DEA taking something that is on schedule one and

415
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:43,640
moving it to schedule two? Yeah, the oral THC pill, Maranil, which was used in 85-86 for nausea

416
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:50,760
control for cancer chemotherapy was switched from schedule one to schedule two. GHB was in schedule

417
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,200
one, but it's now actually in schedule three. Yeah, and last year there was like 1.4 billion in sales.

418
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,680
So Xyrem, it's for narcolepsy. It's to help people sleep at night so that they don't fall

419
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,360
asleep during the day. Isn't Xyrem actually a chemical cousin of GHB and not actual GHB?

420
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,760
I'm not sure about that. I thought it was actual GHB. It's close enough that I can understand why,

421
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,320
but GHB of course being, what was its street name again? Well, that's what's called the date rape

422
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,840
drug. The date rape drug, yeah. Did it have another name? I'm not sure. It's the date rape

423
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,560
drug because you can put it in water and then it makes people sleepy, particularly when mixed with

424
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,560
alcohol. And so it does have a bit of a taste, but you put it in alcohol or something, it's hard

425
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,200
to taste it. So there is a precedent of moving drugs off of schedule one into other schedules.

426
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,600
Usually, initially it goes schedule two and then depending on how it goes, it could go down further.

427
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,920
So all of this is to get back around to this idea that the DEA moved to criminalize MDMA in

428
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,520
84, this nonprofit that I'd started with Debbie Harlow and Elise Agar to protect it. We got a

429
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:55,720
hearing and we eventually triumphed. So the DEA administrative law judge said that it should be

430
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,680
schedule three, but while the hearing was going on, that was in 1986. So while the hearing was

431
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,520
still going on in 1985, we were winning in the court. The DEA administrative law judge doesn't

432
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,800
work for the DEA. The administrative law judges are employed and paid separately, and then they're

433
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,160
inserted into the different agencies to administer disputes between people and the agencies and they

434
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,240
make recommendations to the head of the agency about what they should do. So they don't make

435
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,960
binding decisions. They are there as a quasi neutral arbitrator of dispute. Yeah, exactly.

436
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,600
If you don't like the decision that's been made by the head of the administrator of the agency,

437
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,320
then you can sue them in the appeals court. So that's what we did. So in 85 though, we're winning

438
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,800
in the court, which is dismaying to the DEA. The DEA didn't even anticipate that we would file

439
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,560
because they didn't know about therapeutic use of MDMA. So they just thought they're criminalizing

440
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,840
ecstasy. They're criminalizing a party drug, and in the final hour, you guys show up and say,

441
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,240
wait, please, this has really important therapeutic benefit, which by the way, Rick, we should circle

442
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,520
back and really talk through that. And now all of a sudden, quote unquote, their judge, although it's

443
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,640
not really their judge, agrees with you guys and says, this should be a schedule three agent. Yeah.

444
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,280
But before the judge issued his ruling, it was clear that we showed up with doctors, with

445
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,720
psychiatrists from Harvard Medical School from all over with testimony. We did a secret study,

446
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,440
actually, as the safety of MDMA. So we had data to present to them. We had all these things that

447
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,920
we kept a secret because we didn't want it to be criminalized before the DEA moved. So also,

448
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,240
we were winning in the court of public opinion. So Robert Miller, who had mentioned, was the

449
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:35,000
assistant secretary of general, the UN had referred me to various mystics to whom I had sent MDMA.

450
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,840
So in the very first article, it was early 1985 in Newsweek, the first large media article about

451
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:48,200
MDMA, Brother David Steinlerass spoke on behalf of MDMA and said that a monk spends his whole life

452
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,000
trying to cultivate the mental attitude that you can get from taking MDMA. There was this paper in

453
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,720
the Washington Post that Rabbi Zalman Schachter, who had also experimented with MDMA that I'd send

454
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,920
him, he compared MDMA to the Sabbath. So the idea of this as a party drug used by hedonistic kids,

455
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,000
just recklessly risking their brains. That narrative, which is what the DEA wanted to share,

456
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,040
was contradicted by this narrative of rabbis and monks and therapists and psychiatrists talking

457
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,880
about the value of MDMA. So we're winning in the court of public opinion, winning in the court,

458
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,680
and the DEA freaked out and declared MDMA illegal on an emergency basis in the middle of 1985,

459
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,640
while the hearings were still going on. And that was actually heartbreaking because we had thought

460
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,120
that the hearing might actually save it. So DEA criminalizes it on an emergency basis. Later,

461
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,520
it turned out that the DEA committed a crime in the sense that they didn't have the authority

462
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,360
to emergency schedule. I was just going to ask you both, do they have the authority? And secondly,

463
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,160
was there a precedent for that? Well, no, there was not a precedent for that. What had happened

464
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,200
is that Congress had given the attorney general the power to emergency schedule drugs. The attorney

465
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,080
general, not the DEA. Yeah, all the attorney general would have needed to do was to subdelegate

466
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,520
the power. They would have just had to file a piece of paper in the federal register saying

467
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,040
that the attorney general subdelegates down to the administrative of the DEA. But that had not

468
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,960
been done. Had not been done. Who was the AG at the time? I don't actually remember. Presumably,

469
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,680
the AG at the time was very sympathetic to the DEA. Oh, completely. Because this was, as you pointed

470
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,200
out, I mean, this was one of Reagan's signature policy pieces. Very much, the escalation of the

471
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,480
drug war. And so you could argue that the DEA, though technically in violation of the reg,

472
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,400
probably could have done it if they'd waited, gone through the proper channel. They probably

473
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,680
could have received authority from the AG to do this. The bigger question is why? Why were they

474
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,800
so afraid at that moment? Well, because here was a drug that was being used by a lot of people,

475
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,800
but it wasn't causing problems. Let's dig into this for a little bit. So I think there are going

476
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,560
to be many people listening to this who are up until this point in the podcast are thinking,

477
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,000
what the hell are these two guys talking about? You're sitting here glorifying drugs. And so let's

478
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,480
talk very specifically about ecstasy. I think back to when I was in college, I had never touched

479
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,600
this drug and certainly a lot of kids were using it. And the conventional wisdom was this drug

480
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,240
gives you hyperthermia. So you run this risk of overheating. You run this risk of getting long term

481
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,680
really depressed because you deplete serotonin levels. I mean, there was certainly a lot of

482
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:24,360
seemingly legitimate fear around this. What was actually happening? Well, MDMA can cause

483
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,240
hyperthermia. There are cases of people that have taken MDMA. Usually there are people that have

484
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,680
danced in hot environments and got overheated, didn't have enough fluid replacement. And so some

485
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,120
people have died from hyperthermia. And is it actually the MDMA that's precipitating the

486
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,920
hyperthermia or is it just that anybody who could dance that long and that heat could get

487
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,360
hyperthermia and the MDMA just sort of blunted their other ability to self-regulate? Well,

488
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,640
people generally don't die from hyperthermia from dancing all night. So the MDMA contributes. It's a

489
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,800
contributing factor. So the MDMA in therapeutic settings doesn't cause hyperthermia. So there's

490
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,320
something about MDMA combining with lots of movement and dehydration that creates this trifecta.

491
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,440
Yeah. What also was happening is that in a lot of these environments where people were doing

492
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,440
MDMA, these bars, people weren't buying alcohol. Alcohol kind of blunts the MDMA experience. People

493
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,520
weren't buying alcohol. And so what the bars would be doing would be shutting off the water in the

494
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,040
bathrooms and making people buy water. And so that's why sometimes people wouldn't drink. Now,

495
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,720
also occasionally people drink too much water. They dilute their blood, they get hyponitremia.

496
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,760
And so what we use in therapy is fruit juices or things with electrolytes. So for those people

497
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,840
that are looking for harm reduction tips, it's better to drink stuff with electrolytes and water

498
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,680
if you're doing MDMA. So you drink as much as you want, you're not going to dilute your blood and

499
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:53,640
get hyponitremia. It's very, very rare that people will have these side effects. MDMA doesn't cause

500
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,240
the same kind of dissolution of ego that the classic psychedelics do. So generally people

501
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:06,600
don't have difficult experiences. However, there are people that have had traumas in the past or

502
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,320
issues that are emotional issues, even without traumas. Because MDMA reduces activity in the

503
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,040
amygdala, it reduces your fear response to difficult emotions. A lot of times when people

504
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,360
do take MDMA, difficult things come to their awareness. And I've witnessed this in therapeutic

505
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:26,920
settings where the tears of past events just come out in a way that you could never imagine

506
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,800
this happening otherwise. Yeah. I mean, profound in ways that therapy, sometimes people are too

507
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:39,480
scared to let it out, but MDMA helps them to do that. And so people can have difficult experiences.

508
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,200
One of the stories I told during my TED talk, which we'll link to when it's out, was about a

509
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:51,160
woman who I worked with in 1984 who had PTSD. And she had taken MDMA, not in a therapeutic setting,

510
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,000
and this violent sexual assault that had happened to her years before came to the surface and

511
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,720
intensified her suicidal feelings. And she actually checked herself into a mental institution to

512
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,800
protect herself from committing suicide after having taken MDMA. And when she got out with the

513
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,320
same old drugs that had been given to her before, she was even more suicidal. And so a friend of

514
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,280
hers, I didn't know her at the time, contacted me about her. And so I started talking to her and

515
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:24,360
agreed to work with her. And under the influence of MDMA and then also an MDMA-LST combination,

516
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:30,840
she was able to overcome her PTSD. So in 1984 is when I learned about directly working with someone

517
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:36,280
and seeing that MDMA could be helpful for PTSD. Was that to your knowledge, Rick, the first time?

518
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,920
I mean, first of all, were you guys referring to the term PTSD? Was that a term that was

519
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,640
widely understood in 1984? No. There was a lot of people that had- I mean, clearly we'd seen it. I

520
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,440
mean, all these poor guys coming back from Vietnam when you were in college beyond traumatized, but

521
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:56,520
that term was not commonly used. I'm not sure the actual history of the term PTSD. I think it was

522
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:03,000
used somewhat, but people weren't as aware of how much trauma impacts so many, many different people.

523
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,960
So at that moment in 1984, really what you knew was this is a woman who'd been traumatized, for

524
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,840
lack of a better word. And you saw the potential in this agent to, while on its own, do something

525
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,760
potentially dangerous in a controlled setting. You actually felt what, that she could relive this

526
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,280
experience and do so safely and process it? Talk me through what you were really doing in 1984 to

527
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:32,200
understand that. Okay. So this woman's name is Marcella. So other people before this, so I had been

528
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:38,120
working with various people with MDMA before, both taking it myself and also sometimes with people

529
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,880
that had different issues and sometimes people just looking to communicate to others. I had spoken to

530
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,840
a soldier who had been shot in the back and he told me under the influence of MDMA that he was

531
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:55,320
able to relax in certain ways so that the pain in his back went away to a large degree, that sort

532
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,560
of combination of the impact of the bullets, but also the fear connected to all of that. This was

533
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,040
a key turning point in my life. So I had been back to Esalen for a month long workshop in the spring

534
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:09,080
of 1984. And this was again with Stan and Christina Groff and it was called the spiritual

535
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,360
emergence network. So there's a bunch of people that break down for different reasons and different

536
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:20,920
ways where people break down their path in life is not working for them. And often it gets pathologized

537
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,800
and people get tranquilized or they get hospitalized or different things. But what Stan Groff and

538
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,840
others were saying is that this can be a spiritual emergence. It can be seen as a spiritual crisis

539
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,120
that we're resisting. So it comes in dramatic ways, but the process of what's trying to emerge is

540
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,720
healthy. The process is not. So I had studied how to help people who were struggling to integrate

541
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,480
different either spiritual experiences or psychological experiences that were coming back

542
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,160
as part of my effort to become a psychedelic therapist. And I was only home for about less

543
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,640
than a week when I got a call from this friend of mine who I actually had sold the MDMA to

544
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,800
when it was still legal. And he said that he and Marcella had done this together in a

545
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,440
kind of a romantic situation and that her past trauma had emerged. He wasn't aware of that

546
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,440
and that she was now suicidal and that whatever had been tried by traditional psychiatry,

547
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,080
including the psychiatrist, the mental institution that not worked for her, she was suicidal even

548
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:21,240
worse. So I felt like I'm not qualified. This is a terrifying situation, somebody being suicidal,

549
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,680
but I didn't think that she had any other options. She tried her best in traditional psychiatry.

550
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,560
And I felt this is what I'm trying to do, learn how to be a therapist to work with this. And I

551
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,440
felt somewhat responsible for having sold them the MDMA. And so I agreed to talk to her, talk to her

552
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,800
on MDA or just talk to her on the phone. So during the discussion, she explained what had happened.

553
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:47,960
And I was saying that you'd taken this MDMA in a situation where you weren't really anticipating

554
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,440
that this would emerge or that you would process this and that it made you destabilized and now

555
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:00,120
you're suicidal. However, if we were to do this in a therapeutic setting where you're not trying to

556
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,800
be with someone where you're able to focus on this, the properties of MDMA may help you integrate it,

557
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:11,560
may help you fully experience it, look at it, come to peace with it. And I said that if she

558
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,000
were willing to promise not to commit suicide while we were working together, I would be willing

559
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,720
to try to work with her. Even though I said I'm not a fully trained therapist, this is something

560
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,200
that I have been training to become. I just went through this month long training. And so I'd be

561
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,600
willing to work with you and I would get a group of my friends, particularly female friends to come

562
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,320
and create a safe space around you. And you could come to my house and work and we would work with

563
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:42,120
you to try to help you integrate it. And so she agreed to do that. And so we created this context,

564
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:50,680
the first MDMA experience that she had turned out to be like a tour of the traumatic experiences of

565
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,960
her life. This violent rape and assault where she was almost left for dead was not the only trauma

566
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,280
that she had. There was a series of those other traumas that she had kidnapped when she was young,

567
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,240
different things. And she'd grown up in Columbia, South America. So we got a tour of all those

568
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,800
various traumas in her life. And it was progress. A lot of tears, a lot of processing. She didn't

569
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,480
feel as hopeless, but it didn't feel like it had sort of solved her problem. So I thought let's

570
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,400
switch to LSD for the next experience. And she agreed to do that. Just to say that the first use

571
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:30,280
of a psychedelic for treating PTSD was done by a Dutch psychiatrist, Dr. Jan Bastians. And he had

572
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,240
done this in the fifties, sixties, seventies, and he did LSD for what he called concentration camp

573
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,440
syndrome. So it was for people that were in the concentration camps traumatized by that. And that

574
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,200
he had found that LSD would bring a lot of the memories back to the surface and then they could

575
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,720
try to process them. But LSD doesn't really reduce the fear. There's an Israeli Holocaust writer,

576
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,920
Kat Setnik, which was his concentration camp number. And then his number who wrote a book called

577
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:01,240
Shaviti, a vision, which is tremendous because he went to get LSD therapy with Dr. Bastians. And

578
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,960
this is a book about his therapy. And it was very difficult. And a bunch of my Israeli relatives

579
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,000
knew him and said that it helped him, but he was still tormented a lot. So in any case,

580
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,520
with Marcello, he decided to switch to LSD. And so during the LSD experience, a lot of these

581
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,320
memories again resurfaced. What amount of time was separated between them? Two weeks. So it's

582
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,120
really important to integrate the experience before you're ready to do it again. So during

583
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,880
the LSD experience, what happened was that she started having this vision of a double sun. She

584
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,240
was on a foreign planet and there was a double sun and she was baking to death. And it was just

585
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,680
terrifying to her. And she was stuck. She couldn't process it. It was just overwhelming fear. And so

586
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:49,400
I suggested that she take half a dose of MDMA. Full dose is like 125 milligrams. So about 62 and

587
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,520
half. And I thought the MDMA would soften the LSD and might help her process it. And it turned out

588
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:00,760
that's what happened. And so once she took the MDMA, it condensed from this symbolic foreign thing

589
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:07,320
to actually her life where after she was raped and beaten and thrown out of the car and left

590
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:13,640
under the sun sort of way out to die. So it condensed the MDMA helped it turn into this

591
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,160
experience that had actually happened to her. And then she was starting to able to share that this

592
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:26,280
person had been a date rape situation. And there was times where she was seeing me as the rapist.

593
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,280
My feet were turning into his feet. Then they turned back to my feet, different kind of things.

594
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,720
And so you still had females there as well. Not at this one time, but around her and before

595
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,440
and after, but at this point it was just her and I. So I felt like I could take these projections

596
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,400
onto me because that wasn't really me. And so she was able to sort of clarify that she was seeing

597
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,720
the world through her own distrust or what had happened in the past. She wasn't sure what she

598
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,040
could trust through her own filters. And then when she could sort of feel more safe that it was me

599
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,360
and not the rapist. At one point I asked her when I realized it was date rape, I said, what did you

600
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:04,040
like about this guy? And she immediately vomited. And then she started sharing that he had liked

601
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,960
animals. And so what she was able to do, and one of the things that was making her suicidal was

602
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,320
that she felt that she could never find love again, because she could never trust herself.

603
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,680
Yeah, I was just about to say there's probably a piece of self-hatred, which is

604
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,480
at some level she made a decision to at least be with this guy in some capacity socially, right?

605
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,840
Or maybe they had a meal together or something. And it's like her judgment failed her is probably

606
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,080
part of this pain. Yeah, very much so. Yeah. It meant she could never trust herself. So how could

607
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,440
she find love? Because it could always turn into something like another date rape. But the fact

608
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,480
that she could go back and say, he liked animals. Okay, so now I could know that somebody else who

609
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,120
likes animals doesn't mean that I should automatically trust them. She was recovering her ability to be

610
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,960
discerning. You know, that's a really interesting story, Rick, because it illustrates something I

611
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,600
don't think I've ever thought of until you said it, which is that a woman who's been raped in that

612
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:04,680
situation has maybe an additional level of trauma that the equally tragic woman who gets yanked into

613
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:11,080
the alleyway by some stranger doesn't have, which is this sense of this loss of self-trust and maybe

614
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,800
even this sort of self-loathing of how could I have possibly let myself get into this situation.

615
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,640
Yeah, I think that's what made Marcella so suicidal is that knowing that she led herself into this

616
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,520
in a way, or she had made some fundamental misjudgment causing her to question everything

617
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,560
that she would then do in the future. And so I think once she was able to sort of say, yes,

618
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,880
he liked animals, but that's not a reason to automatically trust people, she was starting to

619
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:42,200
regain her discernment and regain her ability to feel hope that maybe she could go out and find love.

620
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,720
Were you afraid during this situation? I mean, I can't imagine what it would be like to

621
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,560
be flying by the seat of my pants in a situation like that. You're dealing with an incredibly

622
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:59,960
fragile woman who is broken and on the verge of something awful. And by your own admission,

623
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,080
you're not qualified to be doing this yet, but at the same time, there's no alternative it would

624
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,200
seem, which puts you in a tough situation. I mean, how frightened were you? Once she agreed not to

625
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:16,040
commit suicide, that reduced my fear a lot. And then I did see progress from the first MDMA

626
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:23,240
experience and she did too. So that made it less scary. And also I've had my own terrifying

627
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,960
blockages with LSD where I reached places where I wasn't able to really make any further progress,

628
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:34,040
wasn't able to integrate it. So it was scary, but once I could see that the MDMA was taking

629
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,400
an effect, once it moved from something that she was just overwhelmed and then that she was able

630
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,560
to process it, then my fear went down. And then when I saw her throw up and it's almost like she

631
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,560
was purging. Yeah, very much. It was like this. I think what did you like about him? The fact that

632
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,720
she immediately threw up, that was a clue that that was kind of part of the thing that was keeping

633
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,200
her. So this happened in 84. This happened in 84 and that was the breakthrough. I mean,

634
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,160
she didn't have any more sessions. We just did two sessions and then she felt able to also,

635
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,480
this person had told her that if she ever talked about what happened, he'd kill her. And so even

636
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,520
though this was years before, the fact that she hadn't been able to talk about it was prisoner in

637
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,440
her own mind. And so being able to talk about it and see that even though he was a continent away,

638
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,000
the fear was still implanted in her, but that she could overcome that. She could start talking

639
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:28,920
about it was also freeing for her. So a year later, you watch this molecule that you believe

640
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:34,120
has incredible potential. You watch it get scheduled as one and you realize it's only

641
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:40,440
going to be more difficult for patients like this woman to experience what she experienced. And at

642
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,000
that moment in time, because one of the things that so impressive about the work you've done at

643
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:53,560
maps is the, well, one, it's just been relentless. It's hard to, as someone myself who has dabbled in

644
00:57:53,560 --> 00:58:00,040
the sort of nonprofit slash policy world only to immediately realize like this is not for me,

645
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:05,000
it's the fortitude with which you can do it. But also it's sort of the clarity of purpose. Now,

646
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,200
I want to make sure we talk about certain concepts like the breakthrough therapy designation,

647
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,920
which is such an important piece of this story. But before we get to that, I guess what I want

648
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:22,920
to ask you is in 1985, 1986, how much of what would transpire over the next 30 years was clear

649
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:29,240
to you? In other words, how much of this strategy of we find an indication for which it is crystal

650
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,760
clear that this is valuable, the best indication would be one for which there is no other therapy.

651
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,640
Hence this notion of breakthrough therapy. Did you think that that was going to be PTSD? I mean,

652
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,080
what were you thinking about? You hadn't even started at grad school. Yeah, that I was still

653
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,080
an undergraduate. Yeah. Because your PhD is basically geared towards getting you ready to

654
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,560
fight this fight. Yeah. I think when I look back on my life, it was really at this period when I

655
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:57,320
was 18 in 1972, when I felt like I might be going to jail for being a draft position. I just felt

656
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,440
like the contribution I could make to the world that this support from my family, this multi

657
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,560
generational process that permitted me to look at deeper threats that I was terrified of the world

658
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,280
and terrified of what happens and terrified of our own human potential for murder and genocide. And

659
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:17,800
I felt that I had this rare gift from my family, this freedom to choose what I thought would be

660
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:23,960
the most strategic thing I could imagine, which was helping people to realize that we are more

661
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,080
in common than separate and that we're all part of one big family and that you shouldn't dehumanize

662
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:35,400
and kill that that decision at age 18, now that I've recently in November turned 65, it's always

663
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,120
made sense. So I feel incredibly lucky and fortunate that something that I stumbled on at age

664
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:45,560
18 still at this other period of my life still makes sense. And it has made sense continually.

665
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,440
And I've also thought that if not, but for an accident of birth, I could have been born earlier,

666
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,320
I could have been in the concentration camps, or I could have been sent off to Vietnam or

667
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,840
incinerated in nuclear warfare, that I always felt that whatever the struggles were that I was having

668
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,840
were nothing compared to what a lot of struggles that other people had to go through. And that

669
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,400
this dream that I had of a Holocaust survivor telling me to be a psychedelic therapist,

670
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:18,040
that that's where the motivation came from, that I had this rare opportunity to try to work on

671
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,320
long term threats that didn't have to directly lead to a job that didn't exist. So when I was 18,

672
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,880
I thought I would be an underground psychedelic therapist. The first day in the office of

673
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,680
President Carter, he pardoned all the draft resistors. So that started me starting to think

674
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,800
that I could have an above ground career. But it's a far away from being pardoned as a

675
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,280
draft resistor to the legalization of psychedelics. Are you saying that that was just

676
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,400
your first clue that the ice was melting a little bit? I identified myself as a counterculture drug

677
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,360
using criminal. So at age 18, that was my self identity counterculture drug using criminal,

678
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,160
a little bit of the criminal part was taken away. And then I thought I could sort of rejoin society

679
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,880
in a certain way. But I was still criminal from using psychedelics. Going to college was now in

680
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:10,040
82, starting was now psychedelics were forefront, but they were always what I had been planning to

681
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:15,000
in this 10 year period that I was building houses and preparing for doing this. And then the

682
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,880
transition of being politically involved with a nonprofit in 84, and then starting maps in 86,

683
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,400
that also changed my attitude, the fact that there was a nonprofit that this friend had started

684
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,280
John Lambie connected with Buckminster Fuller, the arithmetic metabolic design lab, I started

685
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,680
realizing that that was part of the system, this nonprofit and that the system permits you to fight

686
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:42,680
the system. So I was sort of outgrowing this idea of myself as counterculture and seeing that you

687
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,880
could work within and that there are opportunities for reform from inside. And then the work with

688
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:55,240
Marcella in 1984, and seeing her continually get better over time as the demonization of MDMA

689
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,200
increased. And as all of this NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse funded research,

690
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:06,520
started talking about MDMA neurotoxicity and all the concerns about hypothermia and hyponitremia,

691
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:11,160
just the demonization of MDMA, the blocking of all MDMA research, the whole part of that,

692
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,800
the big transition for me, once MDMA was criminalized by the DEA on an emergency basis,

693
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,680
the judge in 86 said that it should be schedule three, the DEA rejected those recommendations,

694
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,440
and then we sued in the appeals court and we won twice in the appeals court. Both at the time,

695
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,640
the appeals court tends to tell agencies what you did is wrong, they don't normally say you

696
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,480
should do this, they just say what you do is wrong, go back and rethink it. Do they have

697
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:39,560
authority to do anything other than just make a formal position on what was done? Yeah, so for

698
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:44,520
example in school integration, sometimes courts will take over school systems, courts can actually

699
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:49,480
compel, the appeals courts can compel. But this is unbelievable, I mean you have the DEA judge

700
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,240
says make it schedule three, and then you have two subsequent appeals saying that basically what

701
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,160
the judge said they agreed with or what the DEA did was incorrect. Yes, that's what they said,

702
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,880
so the rationale for the DEA to reject the recommendation, the first rationale was that

703
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,040
the DEA said they didn't have the authority to reschedule, only the FDA did. The Controlled

704
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:14,120
Substances Act of 1970 clearly says either the Attorney General or the HHS Secretary either could

705
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:19,480
reschedule to make the drug into a medicine. And the FDA sits under which branch? HHS. HHS,

706
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,440
yeah. Which is where, yeah okay, and the DEA sits under what? The Attorney General. The AG,

707
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,080
and you're saying the Controlled Substance Act made it clear either had the power to reschedule.

708
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:34,520
So the DEA basically said, it's sort of ironic, they had the power to schedule but not reschedule,

709
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,320
is what they're basically claiming. Yeah, so the DEA lawyers as I've learned over the decades,

710
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:45,480
they don't really care if their arguments are flawed because they delay. So delay is the same

711
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,520
as victory to them. So if they put out a ruling that's wrong, it can take you years to go through

712
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:55,400
the appeals court. And so justice delayed is justice denied. So they don't care about their

713
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,800
arguments, they just want to delay. So the first argument they made was that they didn't have the

714
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,960
authority. So the appeals court said yes, you do. Then they came up with an eight-part standard

715
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:11,640
that they said you have to meet these standards in order for us to reschedule. To whom? The DEA

716
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,920
lawyers would then put a new ruling in the Federal Register justifying why they rejected the

717
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,800
administrative law judge's recommendation. And so their new rationale was, okay, here's our

718
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:26,760
eight-part standard. So then we appealed on that because that was essentially the same as FDA. And

719
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,040
if the Congress had wanted the FDA to be the only agency to reschedule, that would have been one

720
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,960
thing. But the fact that they gave the DEA the authority to do it, the DEA couldn't say it's

721
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,200
exactly the same thing as the FDA. Why didn't you at this point go to the FDA, which because the

722
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,440
problem with the DEA at this point is the cognitive dissonance is overwhelming. You're asking someone

723
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,160
who's done something to openly acknowledge what they've done was incorrect. So why not go to a new

724
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:54,920
body? Well, we were also going to the FDA, but the FDA was rejecting all the protocols. So this was

725
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,400
a period of time when the backlash against psychedelic research was so strong that the FDA

726
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,720
was rejecting every single protocol. And so we were trying to go to the FDA, but they weren't

727
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:09,960
responsive either. And so then the courts rejected this eight-part standard as being too equivalent

728
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:16,440
to FDA. And then the DEA came up with a five-part standard, which the court accepted, which is still

729
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,560
essentially the FDA. You still need phase three studies. And so basically the DEA gave away their

730
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,720
authority to reschedule to the FDA because they didn't want to reschedule. They wanted to schedule,

731
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,760
but not reschedule. Is that pretty much how it stands today? Yeah, the DEA is. But what's happened

732
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:37,000
a few years ago is that Congress passed a law. It was always the case that if FDA says a drug is a

733
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,680
medicine, the DEA must reschedule, but they didn't have a time limit. So now they have 90 days that

734
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:51,800
they have to reschedule. So we had MDMA criminalized in 85, kept that way in 86, I start maps. And then

735
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:57,960
I thought that I would go and get a clinical psych PhD. So I graduated college in 87 with my Good

736
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:05,400
Friday follow-up as my senior thesis. And because New College didn't have any grades, I knew that to

737
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,920
get into graduate school, I had to really study well on the GREs. So I did great on the GREs. I had

738
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:16,520
incredible recommendations from this professor that had been head of the PhD program in psychology and

739
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,760
social change at Harvard, who had retired in Sarasota and who was my special teacher every

740
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,080
semester. I had one class with him on psychedel. So in any case, I tried to get into clinical psych

741
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:31,720
PhD programs, and nobody would let me in because I told them I want to do MDMA research. And I was

742
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:36,200
saying, we can't do it now, but I don't want to spend five years getting a PhD. And then I'm about

743
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,640
to do my dissertation. And then you tell me you won't let me do it. So I want to tell you what I

744
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:44,680
want to do now. And if we get there and the system won't let me do it, I'll do something else. It's

745
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:50,360
very hard to get into clinical psych PhD programs. But I came very close a couple of times in programs

746
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,880
that had psychotherapy outcome research as their specialties. And so I wasn't in the end able to get

747
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:03,320
in. And so I was confused because since 1972 till now it was 1988, that I had been on this track for

748
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,680
clinical psych PhD, learn how to do psychotherapy outcome research with psychedelics. So I went home

749
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,760
after the last rejection, I said I'm going to figure out what I need to do with my life. And so

750
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,320
I decided to smoke marijuana and think about it. And marijuana gives me a way to think about things

751
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,440
from a different perspective. I'll be trapped in a box. And so I had this realization that I want

752
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:29,080
too much too soon, that I want to do the science, but the politics is in the way. And so I'm leaping

753
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:35,400
over the culture isn't ready. I want too much too soon. And so I thought, okay, if I want to do the

754
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,760
science, but the politics in the way, maybe I have to study the politics. And I remembered reading an

755
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,800
interview in Harper's Magazine with several people talking about drug policy. And one of them was a

756
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,880
professor at Harvard at the Kennedy School of Government, Mark Kliman. And they talked about our

757
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,520
lawsuit against the DEA. I wasn't even aware of public policy schools or the Kennedy School

758
01:07:54,520 --> 01:08:00,040
of Government. But I remember that he had mentioned our lawsuit. So I called him up and I said,

759
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,600
I want to study the politics. I can't do the research I want to do. I can't do the education

760
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,320
I want. So would you be my mentor? And he said, if you can get into the Kennedy School, I would be

761
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:15,240
glad to be your mentor. And so I applied and I managed to get in sort of the token left wing

762
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:20,680
hippie of the year, Kennedy School. And so that also started changing who I thought I was.

763
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,280
And now I'm even more becoming part of the system rather than becoming part of the counterculture.

764
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,200
Now I'm at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard, and people are planning careers in the

765
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,520
federal government. And so what they had was there was a program called the Presidential

766
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,440
Management Internship. It's now the Presidential Management Fellowship. And so it's for people that

767
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:43,480
want careers in the federal government. It's a competitive situation. Federal employees watch

768
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:48,360
you as you do group exercises. There's all sorts of essays and things. And so I managed to,

769
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,920
it was at the same time that the Native American church was having a Supreme Court case about

770
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,480
whether the peyote would be protected by religious freedom. So that was my essay. I was able to write

771
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,400
an essay about a Supreme Court case, but it happened to be about psychedelics. And so I managed to get

772
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,400
a Presidential Management Internship. And then I tried to get a job at the FDA. I figured I want

773
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:13,320
to work at the FDA. And coincidentally, in 1990, is when I got my master's and when I was applying

774
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:20,120
for this job at the FDA, the group that regulated psychedelics switched in 1990 to a new group. So

775
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,600
the group that had blocked research basically for two decades was now out of the picture and a new

776
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,160
group took over. And my application ended up with this new group. It was called the Pilot Drug

777
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:34,200
Evaluation Staff. They were there in response to the AIDS epidemic where the FDA had been criticized

778
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,760
for being too slow to approve drugs. This was a group that was going to review new ways to

779
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,480
approve drugs in faster. And so they were looking around to the FDA, to other parts of the FDA, which

780
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:47,720
groups had drugs that they didn't care about that they could take over. So they'd have real life

781
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:52,440
examples. And the Schedule 1 drugs had been blocked by Paul Lieber, was this guy in charge of the

782
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,080
division that took care of Schedule 1 drugs. And so he gave them up to this Pilot Drug Evaluation

783
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,720
Staff. My application ended up with them. And we went through about a six month process of review,

784
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:06,120
whether I would be able to get this FDA job, including interviews with the number two guy,

785
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:11,320
Carl Peck, who was in charge of all drug research at FDA. And the FDA decided that they would hire

786
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,920
me. It was great. I was really excited. I was willing to give up doing drugs. I was willing

787
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:19,880
to wear a suit and die and do all this stuff to go work into the FDA for a couple of years,

788
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,200
learn how they work, and then come back and run maps and try to make MDMA into medicine.

789
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,920
But at the last minute, right before I got hired, the DEA told the FDA that they would refuse to

790
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,760
work with me because I'd sued them before. And this is the branch of the FDA that works with

791
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,680
scheduled drugs that deals with the DEA. So the FDA said that I couldn't be hired,

792
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,200
but they would work with me informally. It's hard to be listening to this story and have a lot of

793
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:48,280
empathy for the DEA. I'm trying to sort of put my DEA hat on and sort of say, look, these are good

794
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:52,360
people. They're doing their job. They believe that they're doing the right thing, but they really

795
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:57,880
come across as a petty bunch of, I don't know what the right word is, but just sort of intellectually

796
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:03,320
not particularly curious, not especially thoughtful. I mean, to say we're not going

797
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:07,960
to work with this guy just strikes me as a bit petty. Oh, extremely. Yeah. And then shunning

798
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:11,960
responsibility, deciding, well, we're going to schedule something, but we don't want to de-schedule

799
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,600
it. But my guess is if anybody's able to muster up some empathy for the DEA at the same time,

800
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,560
it's also you. Nothing about you resonates this disdain for them. It's more of a,

801
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:28,040
gosh, I wish I could help them see what I see and what I've seen and the potential benefit of this.

802
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,280
Yeah. And what has really changed is I have started having some sympathy for the police

803
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,360
and how difficult their job is. And so actually we have a senior retired DEA official who is now

804
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:43,000
acting as a consultant for us. The reason is because his son went into the military and has

805
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:50,280
PTSD and uses cannabis for his PTSD. So that changed the father's mind. And actually October

806
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:56,280
of last year, 2018, this fella, Tony Colson, Bormour from the DEA arranged for us to give a talk at

807
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,840
the international association of chiefs of police. So it's a convention that was all over the world.

808
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:06,280
It was 10,000 police chiefs and police officers. And so we actually had a veteran, one of our

809
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,160
therapists, me and our DEA consultant speak. And what's so exciting for me, what happened there

810
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:16,520
is that it was such a politically ripe environment for president Trump that two days before we were

811
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,960
supposed to speak, he decided he would speak there and they scheduled his talk at the same

812
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,280
time as ours. And almost everybody went to his talk, but 30 people came to our talk,

813
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:29,560
including a psychologist who works for the police, a police officer who helps other police with

814
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:34,280
psychological issues. And he said that at the end of our talk, he wanted to go through our training

815
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,160
and he has. And so next week I'm meeting with, he's actually from the Boston area. So I'm meeting

816
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:44,040
with his police chiefs about having police with trauma volunteer for our study. That was a big

817
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:49,880
step for me is trying to have sympathy for the police. And what's also ironic is that my sister,

818
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:54,200
an oldest of four, I have two brothers and a sister, both brothers have done MDMA, but my sister

819
01:12:54,200 --> 01:13:00,040
will never do a drug. She's very conservative in that way. Her son, her oldest son, Nathaniel,

820
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:05,240
my nephew is now a police officer in Washington DC. So I have a police officer in the family.

821
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:11,000
So all these us and them kind of barriers are dissolving. And in December of 2017,

822
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,040
we had a meeting with the police with the DEA headquarters. And it was to talk about what's

823
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,600
called expanded access, which is compassionate use of MDMA. And all sorts of people are going to

824
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,280
want to do that. And they're also going to need these DEA schedule and licenses. So we had a

825
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:29,160
meeting with the DEA to talk about that with our consultant again, to prepare them for all these

826
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,320
licenses. And they said that they would do that. One thing happened that was so personally

827
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:38,440
meaningful is that you can't go to DEA without an escort. When they take you into the building,

828
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:42,680
they don't want you to see somebody's desk or whatever. So we had an escort. So we're in this

829
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:48,440
elevator with the escort and we're going up to the fourth floor to where our meeting is. And for

830
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:54,120
whatever reason, it's only our team and this escort and the door opens on the second floor,

831
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,440
the elevator door, nobody got in, nobody got out. We didn't press number two, but for whatever

832
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:03,240
reason, the door opens on the second floor closes and then we go up to our meeting. And our

833
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:08,040
DEA consultant whispers to me that the second floor is where the courtroom is. So I was

834
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:14,120
previously in that building in 2005 suing the DEA, not on MDMA, but on another lawsuit for

835
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,680
marijuana, trying to get a license to grow marijuana. So it felt like the door opened on

836
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:24,040
the past conflict that we had with the DEA and then closed. We noticed it, but nobody else noticed

837
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,720
it. And then we went up to have a cooperative meeting about how we could work together with

838
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:31,720
the DEA. And the one part of the meeting that went flat, everything was really good. They're

839
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:37,160
willing to give all these licenses. I just said to them, if any of you have DEA officials or

840
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:41,240
officers that you know that have trauma that are in cities where we have studies, they can volunteer

841
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:46,360
for our project. And nobody smiled, nobody offered, but I just wanted them to know that this is for

842
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:51,560
them too, that I did have that level of compassion for them. And I knew it would be awkward for me to

843
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,880
say it, but I felt like I had to say that, that this is for them too. And now I understand more

844
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:00,680
and more about how police are traumatized. So this notion of, I don't know how to explain it,

845
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,680
there's a really nice video you guys made. It's a maps video. It's like maybe 10 minutes long.

846
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:10,760
It can't be that old because Sasha died how many years ago? Oh, quite a few. Like 2014 maybe? Yeah,

847
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:15,000
I'm not sure exactly what year. It was that year because at the end of the video, it notes that

848
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,800
he died about four months after the filming. Like I said, it's maybe 10 minutes long, but there were

849
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:26,680
many survivors in it talking about their experiences with MDMA. And it's very moving. Do you know the

850
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,160
video I'm talking about? We'll find this one and we'll link to it. But it's worth someone who either

851
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:36,280
doesn't have experience with PTSD, trauma, MDMA, to maybe pause for a moment and watch that and

852
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:44,360
get a sense of what it is that you saw in 1984 that kind of created an eternal flame inside of you

853
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:50,200
that said, look, until every person who has experienced trauma or is suffering from PTSD,

854
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,600
at least has the opportunity to experience this type of therapy, I'm not really going to stop.

855
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,840
That's sort of what I sense in how you talk about this. Yeah, yeah, that's true. I mean,

856
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:04,680
even if I'd never discovered MDMA, I would have tried to legitimize LSD in the classic psychedelics.

857
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:11,400
But seeing that there was a softer, gentler way of working with MDMA, I feel that it's very rare

858
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:17,080
that people who work on social justice movements live to see the change that they're working for

859
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:22,920
because a lot of these things are multi-generational. If you think about civil rights or end of slavery,

860
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,480
yes, of course. Yeah, I think that through an accident of history, I was born just at the right

861
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:32,040
time so that there was this backlash that I was able to see for psychedelics. The classic

862
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:37,880
psychedelics done this backlash against MDMA, but now I might actually live to see the medicalization

863
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:44,920
of psychedelics. And that would be an arc of a life contained. It'd be incredible. When did you

864
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:52,840
guys receive the breakthrough therapy designation? Started maps in 86. So from 86 to 92, we had five

865
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,640
different protocols all rejected by the FDA. And again, just for the listener to understand

866
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:03,880
what we're talking about, you are proposing to the FDA clinical trials that would necessitate

867
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,560
the FDA to create an exemption for the use of a Schedule I drug. It's a big deal. Yes, and DEA

868
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:14,040
would also have to approve it as well, and institutional review boards or ethics committees.

869
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,680
And then in California, that's the only state that actually has an additional review body

870
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:23,480
for scheduled drugs. So it is a lot of regulatory affairs, and I did learn a lot about it in the

871
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:29,960
Kennedy School, how to work through it. So in 92, the group at the FDA that regulated psychedelics

872
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:36,200
switched, and that group decided to put psychedelics on a track for science. So from 92, we got

873
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:41,560
permission for the Phase I safety study, the first dose response Phase I safety study. That took us

874
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:47,000
till about 96. Wow, I just want to pause for a second. That's 10 years of your life, and you

875
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,800
spent six of them just getting rejected, being told you're not even allowed to play the game,

876
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:59,960
get off the field. Then you spend four years demonstrating what you pretty much know is

877
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:06,840
already true, which is at a given range of doses, there's no toxicity to this drug. But of course,

878
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,720
that is a hoop you must jump through, understandably. Yeah, we had to do that. And then the doctor that

879
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:16,040
I was working with, Charlie Grove. Sorry, one other technical question. At any point in here,

880
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:21,400
did you have to file an IND? All the protocols that were rejected were INDs. Yeah. Maybe explain

881
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,480
to folks what that is and why that matters. IND stands for investigational new drug. It's

882
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:32,120
the formal application to do research with a drug to try to make it into a medicine. Before that,

883
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:38,440
actually in 1985, even before maps, I funded through this first nonprofit, animal studies,

884
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:44,600
28 day animal toxicity studies in the dog and the rat. So that was a requirement to do phase one or

885
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,240
phase two research. You have to have certain animal toxicity studies. So I did that already.

886
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:55,800
We had our MDMA manufactured by Dave Nichols at Purdue University in 1985. We're still using some

887
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:03,000
of that today. 34 years later, incredible stable molecule. We've had new MDMA made for phase three

888
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,680
and for commercial uses if we succeed. But it took till around 96 to get the safety study done.

889
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:13,320
And then Charlie Grove, the psychiatrist that we were working with, we were proposing a study on

890
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:17,560
cancer patients with anxiety. I knew about PTSD, but there was such a concern about

891
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:22,760
neurotoxicity, which was vastly exaggerated. Yeah. The other thing that people talked about a

892
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:26,520
lot was Parkinsonian like symptoms. My recollection is a lot of that research,

893
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,760
quote unquote research has been quite debunked. Is that the case? 100% debunked. Because it turns

894
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:35,800
out that the only claims that Parkinson's were again from George Riccardi and Una McCann,

895
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:41,960
these researchers that were at Johns Hopkins funded by NIDA. And they claimed, well, from the

896
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:48,680
middle 80s to near the end of the 90s, they were focused on MDMA supposedly hurting the serotonin

897
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:54,440
system and causing functional consequences of a serious nature so that nobody should even ever

898
01:19:54,440 --> 01:20:00,120
get MDMA even once. It was so serious. One dose, functional brain damage, stay away from it

899
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:04,200
completely. Shouldn't even be researched. I was taught that in medical school in 97,

900
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,560
taking pharmacology. It was this is a drug that can permanently alter your serotonin receptors.

901
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,720
Yeah, totally not true. But we started challenging that. So actually,

902
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:18,200
George Riccardi was my first Alliance was so I recognize that in the 60s, there was an

903
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:24,680
exaggeration of the risks by the prohibitionists and a denial of research and a denial of the

904
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,160
benefits, but the advocates like Leary were exaggerating the benefits and.

905
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:34,440
Both sides were doing the same thing. So I felt that maps had to be the expert on the benefits

906
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:39,320
and on the risks that we had to be reliable. People had to rely on our risk estimates.

907
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:46,600
And so once I started working with maps in 86, my first Alliance for six years basically was with

908
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:52,680
George Riccardi, the expert funded by NIDA to look at the risks of MDMA. And so I funded his

909
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:58,600
first monkeys to move from rats to monkeys. So this is a real team of rivals. Oh, yeah.

910
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:07,560
You are funding the person who is being sponsored by your opponent and basically suggesting things

911
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,640
that you believe are untrue. Now, presumably you don't believe that there's any fraud in this.

912
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:16,440
It comes to that. So with George Riccardi. So first off was I thought, OK, we're scientists.

913
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,080
We want to find out what's really going on. I am very interested in what's really going on. What

914
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:25,560
are the risks? I'm taking the drugs. I should know myself. Everybody should know. And we got as far

915
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:31,640
as we could with the animals and in the primates, we found out what was called the no effect level

916
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:39,880
for neurotoxicity. No as in N.O. Yeah. So it's N.O.E.L. no L. So no effect level. So it turns out

917
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:47,480
that five milligrams per kilogram in a primate given every two weeks for four months. So eight

918
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:53,240
exposures every two weeks and at five milligrams per kilogram. There was some nerve terminal

919
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:58,360
degeneration in the primate at two and a half milligrams per kilogram. There was no nerve

920
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:03,560
terminal degeneration. So again, I should say that there may be changes, but changes are not

921
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,880
necessarily bad. I mean, our brains are constantly changing. And in fact, when you have therapy with

922
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:13,640
MDMA, you have a reduction overall before and after in activity in the amygdala. So certain things are

923
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:18,360
definitely changing, which can be good. What were the changes that occurred phenotypically at the

924
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:24,040
five milligram per kilogram? Well, there's never a cell death. It's just nerve terminals degenerate.

925
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:30,600
Did that manifest itself in any cognitive deficit or behavioral deficit? No. The claim was that the

926
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,320
only functional consequence that could be identified in ecstasy users were neurocognitive

927
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:42,040
consequences supposedly memory. However, we've since done studies. A member of MAPS contacted me

928
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:46,760
to say that methodologically all these studies that were done in ecstasy users were

929
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,760
methodologically confounded because these users had done all sorts of other drugs. So how do you

930
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:56,600
say what's from MDMA? And also, there's no pre and post. It's only retrospective compared to

931
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:01,560
supposedly controlled groups. So this guy said, I have the solution that there's a group of people

932
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:07,160
that have done only MDMA and you need to study them. And so we're right here right now, just about

933
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,000
a mile from McLean hospital, which is more psychiatric research, part of Harvard Medical

934
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,520
School, more psychiatric research done there than any other private institution in America.

935
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,320
And there's some people there that are experts in neurocognitive studies. And so I told them,

936
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:24,040
maps will give you a grant. There's this group of people. So we gave them a $15,000 grant.

937
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:29,000
It turns out they're fallen Mormons. The study took place in Salt Lake City, a bunch of Mormons

938
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,240
who had never done coffee, never done tobacco, never done marijuana, never done alcohol,

939
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:39,400
but had done ecstasy because it wasn't formally prohibited. And so this population did exist. So

940
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,520
they went and did a pilot study, then they prepared the data and they submitted it to NIDA

941
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,880
and they got a $1.8 million grant to a major study of people who'd only used ecstasy. And they found

942
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:54,840
virtually nothing. There really is no strong evidence, no weak evidence even really about

943
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:59,800
neurocognitive consequences in heavy ecstasy users. And we've done neurocognitive studies in our

944
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,600
people in our therapy studies who only get them to a few times. There's no evidence whatsoever.

945
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,800
So with George Riccardi though, after we found them, he didn't publish the 2.5 milligram. He

946
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:15,160
published the five milligram per kilogram where there was some evidence of nerve terminal

947
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:19,000
degeneration, but he didn't publish the 2.5 milligram per kilogram. So I started thinking

948
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,080
this is not so much about science anymore. There is a political agenda, but then I went to him and

949
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:27,880
I said, I don't feel hurt. How can you go even further? And he said, well, the only thing we can

950
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:33,080
do now is spinal taps. So I said, all right, I will volunteer for a spinal tap. And so it didn't

951
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:37,320
hurt that much. It was terrible. At that point in time, how often had you been at or above the

952
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:42,840
five MIG per KIG dose? I had never really been above it, but most people had not been above it.

953
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,280
So I basically said, I'll be your guinea pig. So I got a spinal tap. And I thought about it as if

954
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:53,320
women could give birth, I could give birth to my spinal fluid for my purpose. And once it wasn't

955
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:57,880
so bad, then I got over 30 people to volunteer for spinal taps, which were done initially at

956
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,880
Stanford and then at Hopkins. So all of this is to say that it didn't seem like there was any harm

957
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,960
to dopamine was still all focused on serotonin. It didn't seem like there was much evidence that

958
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:11,000
there was any problems with our serotonin either. You only get serotonin metabolites in the spinal

959
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,520
fluid. But what then happened was that the escalating fears of the rave movement and so

960
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:22,680
the serotonin hypothesis of MDMA causing serious problems, it started being challenged more and

961
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,800
more by other scientists, by people at the CDC Center for Disease Control. So their neuroscientists

962
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:34,440
started challenging this exaggerated risk estimates of serotonin. And so then what happened

963
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:38,520
with George Ricardi and Una McCann is they realized this is in the end of the 90s that the

964
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:43,720
serotonin damage theories that they were using to try to block research was getting increasingly

965
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,680
dubious and challenged. Plus more and more people had been doing MDMA for decades and still seem

966
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:55,240
fine. They published an article in science that claimed that MDMA hurt dopamine and would

967
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,960
potentially cause Parkinson's. And that was outrageous because the spinal tap studies didn't

968
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:04,280
show any evidence of harm and dopamine. Other studies had not shown any harm and dopamine.

969
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,520
They were just searching and they killed a bunch of the animals died during their experiments. But

970
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,280
this was published in science. Yeah, I was just about to say how did science publish that? There

971
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:18,840
must have been something they saw. Alan Leshner, who was the head of NIDA, later left NIDA, he built

972
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:23,400
it up. He pandered to Congress. He scared them about MDMA and other drugs. He increased the

973
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:28,120
budget of NIDA up to over a billion dollars a year. And then he left to become the president of

974
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,360
the AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes science.

975
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,200
Yeah. So that former head of NIDA, who was the main patron of George Ricardi,

976
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,240
Which is a real shame. I mean, people listening to this might not appreciate the significance of

977
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:45,560
what you just said, but science and nature are the two most high impact journals in the entire

978
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:51,640
field of science. So in other words, most scientists will go their entire career and not even have the

979
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:57,160
ability to submit an article to one of those journals, let alone have an article be accepted

980
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:02,280
in one of those journals. I don't believe there is an equivalent outside of science in terms of

981
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,280
what the prestige it would mean to have your work published in that journal. So it is certainly

982
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,040
troubling to hear that, not surprising, of course, but it's not the first time I've heard these

983
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:14,200
stories. But I think for the listener to understand what the implication is, this isn't the national

984
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:19,480
inquirer. Right. And then there was an editorial in science that talked about MDMA as being Russian

985
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:25,320
Roulette for your brain by Alan Leshner. And this study though, that was published in science,

986
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,800
actually just why a couple of weeks ago, this paper in nature about MDMA positively causing

987
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:34,520
neurogenesis and oxytocin release. And well, that's why that's so significant. Yeah, exactly. Now you

988
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:39,480
have nature and science being on bookends of this interesting story of this arc. Michael Mitovar and

989
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:43,080
I and others of our lead psychiatrist and I, we wrote a letter to science and we said that the

990
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,600
letter to the other, this doesn't make sense, this paper to us, you've killed a bunch of animals,

991
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:52,040
other animals have not died in experiments. You didn't give the animals the MDMA orally in the way

992
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:56,120
that people normally take it. There's all this evidence that MDMA doesn't hurt, don't mean.

993
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:00,600
Nobody we know has Parkinson's. And so we challenged them. And so what we didn't know then is that they

994
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,560
spent a year trying to replicate their results. So our letter did get published in science or

995
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:11,560
critical letter, but this whole year they kept defending their studies in the media. But we later

996
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:16,680
found out that they were having increasing problems in replicating their results. And they

997
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:21,240
later out of frustration after they couldn't replicate their results took some of the animals

998
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:25,800
that had died, did a tissue analysis and had discovered that they had given the animals

999
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:33,960
methamphetamine instead of MDMA. It's a slight mistake. It's just a slight subtle difference.

1000
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,640
Yeah. And so they should never have published that paper because they should have known that.

1001
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,440
Did they print a retraction? They did. They had to retract it.

1002
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:47,240
That was 2004, end of 2003, 2004. So that was sort of the high watermark of the fear and

1003
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:52,760
paranoia about MDMA neurotoxicity. Okay. So that relates to that's when we got the first approval

1004
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:59,080
for our first PTSD study. So Charlie Grove, after we finished the safety study, he started getting

1005
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:04,680
worried about MDMA being so identified with ecstasy and the wave movement and neurotoxicity.

1006
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:10,120
So from a procedural standpoint, you have your IND filed, you've now documented through phase

1007
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:16,280
one that this is not toxic. More importantly, you're not just winning that battle there.

1008
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:22,120
More broadly, the scientific community is now realizing actually this is not a toxic compound

1009
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:27,880
whatsoever. But in some ways, that's just the end of chapter one. Chapter two is great. You have a

1010
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:34,120
safe compound. Now, what is the indication? What will be the medically valid use for this compound?

1011
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:38,840
Yeah, we had thought initially MDMA for cancer patients with anxiety because cancer patients

1012
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,720
would die and they wouldn't live long enough to supposedly show the effects of neurotoxicity.

1013
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:49,000
But Charlie, who I was going to work with on this, he decided that MDMA was too controversial and he

1014
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,720
wanted to switch to psilocybin. So that started the whole work with psilocybin with cancer patients.

1015
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:58,680
I knew from 84 working with Marcella and just by the way, Marcella is now one of our lead therapists,

1016
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,360
training other therapists. She later became a therapist. So it's a tremendous success

1017
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,480
in her life. So I returned to PTSD and Michael Midhofer, who's our lead psychiatrist, came to me

1018
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:14,920
in 2000 at a conference, the first conference ever on ayahuasca in America organized by Ralph

1019
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:19,720
Metzner in San Francisco. And he was a member of MAPS, but I didn't know him. And he'd also been

1020
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:24,120
trained in the holotropic breathwork by Stan Groff, which I'm also trained in. So it's

1021
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:29,160
hyperventilation to bring out experiences that are sort of like LSD or psilocybin. So Michael

1022
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:35,320
came to me in 2000 and he said, I want to work with you on creating an officer or clinic somewhere

1023
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,160
in the world. Was there any developed country in the world or any country for that matter

1024
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:43,080
for which MDMA wasn't scheduled? Because usually what happens is once the US schedules, other

1025
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:50,760
countries follow suit. Yeah. So very briefly in 85 when we were suing the DEA, we became aware of the

1026
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,920
DEA was trying to criminalize MDMA internationally through the world health organization, the

1027
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,800
international treaties. That's where I went back to Robert Mueller and said, can you help set up

1028
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,760
meetings? And just for the listener, because I know you've brought Robert Mueller up again,

1029
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,000
this has no bearing. It's a different name. Mueller. Yeah. Yeah. This is spelled M U L L E R.

1030
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,160
Yeah. And he was the assistant secretary general unit. And so he helped me set up meetings at the

1031
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:15,880
world health organization in Geneva. So I went to Geneva in 85 and brought information there

1032
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:21,400
to slow down the DEA criminalizing internationally. And in some incredible coincidence, the head of

1033
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:26,360
that committee, the expert outside committee was Paul Groff, Stan Groff's brother. And the committee

1034
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:31,720
endorsed the criminalization of MDMA except for one person, Paul. And he got a little footnote in

1035
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:35,160
there saying that this was an important compound. He was worried that the criminalization

1036
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,640
internationally would reduce research and the encourage the nations of the world to facilitate

1037
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:45,000
research, which led to the Swiss government from 88 to 91 permitting people to do compassionate

1038
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,960
use of MDMA and LSD. But when Michael came to me and said, so there's no place in the world

1039
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:55,000
because it did get criminalized internationally. But Michael had been in St. Kitts where there was

1040
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,280
a clinic that was set up for Ibogaine. Ibogaine is something that I very much want to research. It's

1041
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:05,400
for opiate addiction. We're in the massive crisis for opiate addiction. Ibogaine helps people through

1042
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:09,960
the withdrawals and it can give them spiritual experiences and brings up what they've

1043
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:14,840
repressed. So it can be very, very helpful in both going through withdrawal and also in reducing

1044
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,760
relapse. And it's illegal in the United States, but legal in Canada, Mexico,

1045
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:24,440
multiple places. So Michael had a patient of his guanda St. Kitts and he went with, and so he came

1046
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:28,920
to me and said, let's set up a clinic. Maybe we can find someplace where there's MDMA or LSD,

1047
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:33,160
we could set up a clinic. And I said, I'm totally 100% not interested in doing that.

1048
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:37,560
Because it sort of undercuts what you're doing at MAPS. It's sort of like saying, again, there's so

1049
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:42,600
many moments in your story, Rick, where I'm sort of struck by the maturity of the hippie.

1050
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:48,600
Like you're way smarter than anybody else. I wouldn't have had the foresight to have

1051
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:52,760
you just played the long game at every moment. And I just, I want to applaud you for that as

1052
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:57,960
someone who I just know personally, I just wouldn't have had the discipline or the foresight to have

1053
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:03,080
played that long game over and over and over again, which was this is about the highest

1054
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:07,160
integrity at the policy level. This is about the highest integrity at the scientific level.

1055
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:14,280
And it's a hard decision because along the way, fewer people had access to something that you

1056
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:20,120
felt very strongly could help them. But it was one of those examples of if it means that a few

1057
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:24,760
hundred people or a few thousand people are denied this opportunity today, as much as that's

1058
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:29,560
heartbreaking, this could mean millions of people can one day have access to this. And we won't

1059
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:34,680
sort of taint or undermine the rigor with which we get them there. Yeah. Yeah. And I've always had

1060
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:39,720
people in the back of my mind from the Holocaust saying, if we don't bring this forward and

1061
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:46,600
mainstream it, we could have another situation. We have the rise of authoritarianism, the rise of

1062
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:51,160
hatred for the immigrants. And we have a lot of that going on right now we can see. And so that

1063
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:55,880
just is further motivation for me to try to mainstream it. Even that's where the compassion

1064
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:01,320
for the police comes in. That's for them as well. And so I said, Michael, I'm totally not interested

1065
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,880
in setting up offshore clinic, but I think first off, there's no place. But secondly, it's about

1066
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:10,280
going to the heart of the system and making change happen from the inside out. Yeah. And your fight

1067
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:15,640
is here. Your fight is in DC. Yeah, exactly. And then the US is one of our most successful exports

1068
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:21,560
has been the drug war. And so other countries look around at us. If the US is changing, then the drug

1069
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:26,280
war will erode all over them. So I said, Michael, let think that now is the time we can work with

1070
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:30,440
the FDA. Would you work with me? And he was an expert in PTSD. And I'm like, fantastic. Because

1071
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:35,000
PTSD is the next thing. And now that we don't have to worry about people saying, oh, neurotoxicity,

1072
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,040
PTSD became the number one thing, the top priority. And Michael said, yes. Yeah. Before

1073
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:43,560
we leave the toxicity and start talking about the efficacy, I just want to ask, based on everything

1074
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:48,840
you know today, which patients would not be good candidates for MDMA from a safety perspective?

1075
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,840
Are there some patients that we would still say today? Because, you know, look, any drug we can

1076
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,080
say ibuprofen shouldn't be taken with by certain patients. Tylenol shouldn't be taken by certain

1077
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,000
patients, either over the counter. Who in your mind is not a good candidate for MDMA therapy?

1078
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,640
The most important thing is people with compromised hearts. So that MDMA increases

1079
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:11,320
blood pressure, not overwhelmingly, not substantially, but significantly, I can show you. But we work

1080
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:16,040
with people that have controlled hypertension, people that have had uncontrolled hypertension

1081
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:20,440
and only recently got it controlled. We'll say you need to do a stress test. But of all the tens

1082
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:24,440
of millions of doses of MDMA that are being used every year in the world, there's almost nobody

1083
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,160
ever has a heart attack. Almost nobody, really. I mean, there's hardly any cases like that. So,

1084
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:34,280
but still, that's the concern. When people are on a lot of other psychiatric medications,

1085
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:38,520
we ask them all to taper off of them. The SSRIs blunt the effects of MDMA.

1086
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:45,400
There's a remote chance that MDMA could trigger a seizure. Also, that seems to almost never happen,

1087
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,160
but so we will not at least initially work with people who are epileptic.

1088
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:53,640
I notice in the documentaries, the patients in the study have blood pressure cuffs on.

1089
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:59,080
Yeah, we have to monitor blood pressure and temperature. We exclude people that are psychotic

1090
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:04,360
we exclude people with schizophrenia. Although I think MDMA could be very helpful with schizophrenia,

1091
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:08,920
but it needs a different container because we basically do outpatient. I mean, they come in

1092
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:13,640
for the MDMA session, which is done under supervision. They spend the night after the

1093
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:19,000
MDMA session and then they get more integrative psychotherapy the next day, but then they go home.

1094
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:25,000
So if somebody was schizophrenic, we would want more of a longer containment window. Yeah. Bipolar.

1095
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,800
I don't think MDMA is likely to be helpful for people with bipolar. My brother is bipolar and

1096
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:34,280
he's tried MDMA and he had a good day, but it made him slightly manic and it didn't

1097
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:39,560
change things on a long-term basis. Let's talk about that actually, which is I've experienced

1098
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:44,840
MDMA in both settings. I've experienced MDMA in the setting of you're listening to music,

1099
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,760
you're having fun, you're out and about around other people. I've also experienced it in a

1100
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,520
very therapeutic setting and they're very different. It's so interesting that the same

1101
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:58,200
molecule could have such a different effect based on the term that gets used so often,

1102
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:03,160
the set and the setting, the intention and the way it's done. And I'm trying to think of the best

1103
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:07,320
way to explain to people the difference because I suspect there are people listening to this who

1104
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,960
have experienced MDMA vis-a-vis ecstasy, Molly at a party or something like that and can certainly

1105
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,440
speak to how you feel wonderful on it. But what we've been talking about is very different. What

1106
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:21,320
we've been talking about is very emotional. Anytime I've used it in this sort of therapeutic setting,

1107
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:29,400
I mean it's endless rivers of tears and it requires a lot of processing afterwards. It requires

1108
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:36,040
further discussion, journaling, these sorts of things. What is it about creating that setting

1109
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:42,680
with that intention, ideally with a therapist and with this sort of follow through that transforms

1110
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:49,160
something that is arguably one of the most feel-good drugs at a party into a drug that is healing

1111
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:55,160
the deepest emotional wounds that people have? I think it's the intent and it's whether your

1112
01:37:55,160 --> 01:38:01,160
focus is external or internal. So the best way to understand these things, they're just tools

1113
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:07,320
and they're not inherently therapeutic or inherently recreational or inherently dangerous

1114
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:12,520
or inherently safe. These are tools and how they're used makes all the difference. So when you take it

1115
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:18,040
at a party and you're externally focused and you're dancing and you're talking to other people,

1116
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,120
people still process a lot of important stuff and people have insights and can make therapeutic

1117
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:29,320
process even in recreational settings. They feel connected to this whole group. They feel less

1118
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:34,440
isolated. A lot of good can come from recreational settings but in general, people who use it in a

1119
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:39,320
recreational setting say they want to have the good slice of experiences and if something is

1120
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:44,040
difficult or painful, that's not what they're looking for. The thing about MDMA that's different

1121
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:48,440
from the classic psychedelics is you can negotiate with the content a little bit. By the way, I feel

1122
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:54,040
that is completely true, Rick. I mean psilocybin and ayahuasca are beautiful and powerful tools

1123
01:38:54,680 --> 01:39:01,080
but I have never for a second in using them felt like I had even a modicum of direction. I mean,

1124
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:05,320
I've never done bullfighting but when you watch it on TV where these guys are on the bull and they

1125
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:09,960
got the little taser on the bull's nuts and that's what it feels like to be on those agents at high

1126
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:15,720
enough doses which is there's probably something important to be gleaned here but I have no idea

1127
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:21,400
where it's going. I have no idea what's going to come up and I have at least personally have no

1128
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,960
ability to steer it even if it starts going in a bad direction. Yeah, the essence of doing the

1129
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:30,840
classic psychedelics is the art of surrender. It's the ego dissolution and that's exactly the

1130
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:37,320
difference that gives them their power but also to me there's just a finer therapeutic line.

1131
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:41,560
Yeah, very much so and that's where like where we talked about with Marcella, she got stuck with

1132
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:46,520
LSD. She couldn't control it. She couldn't turn elsewhere. It just was so powerful emergence and

1133
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:52,360
she couldn't handle it. So there's a way in which what differentiates sort of a good drip from a bad

1134
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:58,120
drip is this resistance. So what we like to say is difficult is not the same as bad. If you have

1135
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:01,880
difficult material but you're not resisting it, you can learn from it. You can grow from it but

1136
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:07,240
it's the resistance that freezes it in place and it causes friction and is painful but it's very

1137
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:13,240
difficult if not impossible to negotiate with the classic psychedelics but with MDMA you can

1138
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:18,040
so that people can say to some extent this is material that I don't want to deal with now and

1139
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:23,320
then you're out of focus and you're not processing that and I think unless there's a real safe

1140
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:27,160
setting people are going to say that that they don't want to deal with that because it is frightening

1141
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:33,240
so that therapeutic context where you're focused inward and you're open to whatever emerges even

1142
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:40,520
difficult things that's where the MDMA can be very very uniquely and remarkably helpful coming to a

1143
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:45,080
different relationship with these painful experiences that have happened in the past. So I think if

1144
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:49,080
many of the people that are in our study not I'd say most of them have never done MDMA before but

1145
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:53,560
some of them have and those that have say that it was so different in a recreational setting is in

1146
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:59,720
a therapeutic setting and so this idea of welcoming the conflict instead of trying to just have the

1147
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:08,200
slice the happy slice is what makes it a difference and so from 1999 2000 to 2016 is when we did what's

1148
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:13,720
called the phase two pilot studies. How many such studies were done? We did six different studies in

1149
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:20,920
Israel, Canada, Switzerland, and the United States and the purpose of pilot studies is to prepare for

1150
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,400
phase three. The whole purpose of phase two is to prepare for phase three. Which is to show efficacy.

1151
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:31,320
Phase three is to show large-scale studies to show safety and efficacy. Phase two is to figure out who

1152
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:36,120
is your patient population, what are your doses, what is your what's your indication. Yeah what are

1153
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:41,160
the people that you exclude and include and so that's where we did a whole series of studies with

1154
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:48,200
different patient populations. So basically from 1986 when I started MAPS to November 29 2016 it

1155
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:53,720
was 30 years of getting ready. We had what's called an end of phase two meeting and that's

1156
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:57,720
where the FDA said yes we could go to phase three. And is that when the designation of breakthrough

1157
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:02,760
therapy was given or was that later? No. So what happens is once you end up getting permission to

1158
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:07,560
go to phase three most pharmaceutical companies go to phase three but there's a program called

1159
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:13,240
special protocol assessment where you can voluntarily engage with FDA where you negotiate

1160
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:18,280
every aspect of the phase three design plus all the other information that they want to see. And

1161
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:23,720
if you come to agreement you get an agreement letter that means that the FDA is legally bound

1162
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:29,000
to approve the drug if you get statistically significant evidence of efficacy using this design

1163
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,880
and if no new safety problems come up. Since MDMA is unlike any other drug that the FDA has ever

1164
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:38,520
studied because tens of millions of people have taken it for multiple decades we have all this

1165
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,920
information about the safety risk we're pretty comfortable there's going to be no new safety

1166
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,920
things. So we went through this whole process of special protocol assessment and then we applied

1167
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,080
for breakthrough therapy. So we got special protocol assessment and then a couple weeks later

1168
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,840
we got breakthrough therapy. And tell people what that means in a sentence or two. Breakthrough

1169
01:42:56,840 --> 01:43:01,240
therapy designation is for the most promising drugs and if you get this breakthrough therapy

1170
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:06,280
designation the FDA partners with you to try to make it into a medicine. So you have shorter review

1171
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:11,560
timelines more meetings with FDA. And this is pegged to an indication in this case because the

1172
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:16,120
indication of PTSD has no other option that is appearing to have any medical efficacy. Well

1173
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:20,920
there are two drugs that are approved by the FDA for PTSD Zoloft and Paxil and both of those are

1174
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:27,160
SSRIs that diminish symptoms don't solve the problem and don't work in many many people. So

1175
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:32,680
it's the absence of other treatments a large group of treatment resistant people and breakthrough

1176
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:37,000
therapy we were able to get. So it's the most important program that the FDA has and that was

1177
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,720
the sign that now we had reached this place of legitimacy 30 years after we had started maps.

1178
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:47,720
Has the FDA ever encountered another situation that you're bringing which is you're not

1179
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:52,520
presumably just trying to seek legalization for a molecule that's going to be dispensed at a pharmacy

1180
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:58,120
but it's tied to a therapy. So how does the FDA think about what you're actually doing which is

1181
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:03,080
administering a therapeutic protocol not just a medication? It's new for the FDA. Yeah they've

1182
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,320
never approved a drug therapy combination. And that is what they're being asked to do now? Yeah.

1183
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:12,440
However there have been some drugs that have special risks that they approve certain kind

1184
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:18,280
of educational programs that are required. So the best example there is thalidomide. So the only

1185
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:24,600
person from the FDA that ever won the Presidential Medal of Honor was Frances Kelsey and she was the

1186
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:29,080
one in the early 60s that blocked thalidomide from becoming a medicine in the US. It was used for

1187
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:34,440
morning sickness caused all these birth defects. Years later, decades later, thalidomide became a

1188
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:40,360
medicine. It's useful for leprosy and some other kinds of cancers. And so the FDA developed a whole

1189
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:45,960
set of policy tools that they require a patient registry. Everybody who gets thalidomide is on a

1190
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:49,640
registry to see if there's any birth defects. There's requirements of education for the

1191
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:54,920
pharmacist, for the patient, for the prescriber. And so this has evolved into what's called the

1192
01:44:54,920 --> 01:45:01,240
REMS, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, that the FDA can now regulate different drugs

1193
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:07,640
according to their unique risks. So there's never been a drug therapy combination approved by FDA,

1194
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:12,040
but there have been drugs where they've had different kinds of REMS to control the risks

1195
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:17,320
and have required certain kind of policies. So the FDA is actually learning from and with us

1196
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:21,160
about how to regulate psychotherapy, which they don't actually have the authority to regulate

1197
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:27,560
psychotherapy. But we've came to them and said, the only people that we think should be directly

1198
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,040
treating patients if this drug is approved is people that have learned the therapy as well as

1199
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:37,720
the drug. And so that's what the FDA has agreed so that everybody who will be prescribing it and

1200
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:42,680
will be treating patients has to go through our training program. So there's one phase three study

1201
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:47,160
that has multi sites, I'm assuming. There'll be two. There'll be two phase three studies,

1202
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:52,280
each 100 persons, depending on the effect size, we think that probably, hopefully it'll be each,

1203
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:58,760
only 100 persons each. And we've enrolled 19 of the first 100. I've read that you think that this

1204
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:05,000
could be approved as soon as 2021. Yeah, the end of 2021, we think. But what people should also

1205
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,320
know is that because there's so many people with PTSD in America, and because we're only going to

1206
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:15,640
enroll, hopefully 200 people, the FDA has a program called expanded access, which is compassionate use.

1207
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:20,680
Yeah, tell me about how that works. If you have a disease that nothing has helped for you,

1208
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:25,640
and there's a drug being studied for that disease, and if the pharmaceutical company agrees,

1209
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:30,520
they will set up this compassionate use program where you can have access to the drug before it's

1210
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:37,000
approved while phase three is still going on. So your therapist gets a special designation from the

1211
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,080
FDA and the DEA to possess and use this not yet approved agent with you? Sort of. Because it's a

1212
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:47,480
controlled substance, only physicians will be able to get schedule and licenses to work with.

1213
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:51,080
So there'll be therapists working with the physicians or the physicians will be,

1214
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:55,800
but there's an overarching protocol that we negotiate with FDA. It's different than phase

1215
01:46:55,800 --> 01:47:00,680
three, because first off, people have to accept the risk, and they have to pay for it themselves,

1216
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:04,840
because the FDA doesn't use the data to approve it. So the pharmaceutical company isn't going to

1217
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:11,240
pay to have all these people treated. So the protocol can also be riskier patients. So we

1218
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:17,160
can let people in who, let's say we're talking now about certain kind of diabetes. For excessive

1219
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:20,440
caution, we exclude people with diabetes, even though loads of people with diabetes have done

1220
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:24,680
MDMA, but we can let people with diabetes in expanded action. What's the concern with patients

1221
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:29,800
with diabetes? Some sort of vascular problems and maybe they... Oh, but it doesn't alter blood sugar?

1222
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:34,120
No, it's not directly about that. It's more about a stroke or something like that. We are training

1223
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:39,400
now people for expanded access already, and that was the meetings we had with DEA and FDA. How long

1224
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:44,120
is that if I, for example, wanted to... I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist, nor am I a therapist in

1225
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:50,840
any way, shape, or form. Is it even possible for just a regular Joe Blow to become certified?

1226
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:55,400
Yes, it is. We have training programs. We're the only ones not with the training programs,

1227
01:47:55,400 --> 01:48:00,760
but our model is a male-female co-therapy team, and one of them needs to be licensed as a therapist

1228
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:06,440
or a psychiatrist. But the other one doesn't. It can be a student getting a license, can be a nurse,

1229
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:12,040
can be a social worker, can be somebody without a license. So what we're saying is that the two-person

1230
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:18,120
team works better than one person. It's not twice as good, but most people that are traumatized

1231
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:23,960
don't develop PTSD. Those that do tend to have a history of trauma before them, often going to

1232
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:29,240
childhood and attachment disorders. And so having a well-functioning male-female team as people go

1233
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:34,920
through their traumas can recreate sort of a loving kind of a situation that they didn't have

1234
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:39,320
when they were young. But we don't want to make it so that it's twice as expensive. So the idea

1235
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:44,200
will eventually be one person, licensed therapist, the other is a student working for free to get

1236
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:49,720
their hours or working for lower cost or something like that. And so we are now opening up the

1237
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:55,400
training to people that will set up expanded access sites. And the ideal, cities where we

1238
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:01,320
don't have phase three sites or cities where we do have phase three sites but where there's a lot

1239
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:07,320
of people that have PTSD. So to get into expanded access, you have to have treatment resistant PTSD.

1240
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:12,520
It means nothing else worked for you, but people can have less severe PTSD. So psychedelic clinics

1241
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:15,960
are going to be opening up throughout America at the end of this year. Someone listening to this

1242
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:23,320
who has PTSD does not have to wait until 2021 necessarily. Their best option is, one, identify

1243
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:27,880
a place where there's an ongoing phase three trial. You may be a candidate for it. And I assume

1244
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:33,080
there's no placebo. Does that mean that everybody in it will be treated? Well, in phase three, there

1245
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:37,080
has to be a placebo. It's a controlled study. So when you randomize, there's a chance you'll get

1246
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:40,920
the therapy without the... Yeah, you either get therapy without MDMA or therapy with active

1247
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:46,520
MDMA. However, everybody that gets randomized to the control group, once the study is over,

1248
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:51,000
they can cross over for free. So everybody is offered. In the expanded access, because you're

1249
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,840
paying for it, there is no control group. Yeah. Because I get asked this question all the time,

1250
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,320
Rick, even by patients and by people who know of my interest in this, which is how long do I have

1251
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:03,960
to wait? And it sounds like the answer is not as long as you thought really. In theory, this year,

1252
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,920
you can find compassionate use exemption. Yeah, I think so. I think the other part though to say

1253
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:15,560
is that in our phase two pilot studies, 23% of the people that got the therapy without active MDMA

1254
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:20,760
no longer had PTSD two months after the last experimental session. So that's actually pretty

1255
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:25,000
good in people that are severe treatment resistant chronic. So I'd like to encourage

1256
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,960
people if they are thinking about it to volunteer for phase three, you will get therapy, which can

1257
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:35,800
be very effective. And then in the end, you'll get MDMA. But there is a bit of sacrifice in a sense

1258
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:40,760
that you have to wait potentially, you have to wait, but we need that. So if phase three starts

1259
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:45,960
slowing down, FDA is going to shut down expanded access. I just wanted to add that the psychedelic

1260
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,440
clinics that we're going to open for expanded access, people are also being cross trained for

1261
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:55,720
ketamine. And eventually, these clinics will work with psilocybin. So the long term vision is that

1262
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:00,600
these psychedelic clinics that we're opening initially become places where people can go for

1263
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:05,640
therapy for MDMA or ketamine or psilocybin. But eventually, we hope that they become sites of

1264
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:10,600
initiation, where people who don't have a clinical diagnosis can go for psychedelic therapy for

1265
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:16,920
personal growth or for couples therapy or for a mystical experience. And then if it goes well,

1266
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:22,760
in your first experience with LSD or MDMA or psilocybin, then you get a license to go buy it

1267
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:28,200
and do it on your own. So the future is a system of licensed legalization, where people have access

1268
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:33,720
outside of religion and outside of medicine, but that there's also these opportunities for medical

1269
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:38,680
use that insurance would pay for if you have certain diagnoses. Psilocybin is sort of on the

1270
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:44,440
heels of MDMA. Yeah. Where do you see LSD in this? How far down the line? It all depends on resources.

1271
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:49,000
I mean, LSD, so we're anticipating that it's somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million

1272
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:53,960
to make a psychedelic drug into a medicine. That's about what you will have spent to go from your

1273
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:59,640
phase one to three on MDMA. In the history of maps, we spent another $10 million on the phase

1274
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:03,640
two studies. We've spent loads of money on a lot of the political work trying to get permission,

1275
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:09,400
so that isn't going to be necessary anymore. So if some of these billionaires out there that have

1276
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:14,200
the resources, if they wanted to make LSD into a medicine, what you've done is created a playbook.

1277
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:20,840
In many ways, MDMA is far and away the biggest lift because you had to do everything from soup

1278
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:27,880
to nuts, including the advocacy. Assuming MDMA is approved in 2021, there is now a playbook for how

1279
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:31,720
to do this with other agents, and psilocybin, of course, is right on the heels. The last thing I

1280
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:36,200
would say is I would encourage anybody who's listening to this, whose curiosity has been piqued

1281
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:41,240
to watch a documentary called A Trip of Compassion, which is, I hadn't heard of it actually until Tim

1282
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:44,840
Farris told me about it. I think he had just come back from Israel, but I can't remember if he had

1283
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:49,160
seen it before. He saw it in Israel. He saw it in Israel. It's hard to watch. There's just no doubt

1284
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,520
about it. It's very moving, but I think it's important. I think if you're listening to this

1285
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:57,720
and you're still a bit unclear about what Peter and Rick have been talking about, you invest an

1286
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:02,200
hour and a half in watching this documentary, just search Trip of Compassion and you'll find it,

1287
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:07,720
and you can stream it for five bucks or something. I can't think of many better uses of an hour and

1288
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:12,280
a half of your time, and I still maintain to this day that this, I acknowledge, is a slightly

1289
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:18,520
hyperbolic statement. I'm not convinced that there is a man-made molecule that is more important

1290
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:23,880
than MDMA. Again, it's hard to imagine a world with conflict if everybody had the opportunity

1291
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:29,320
to experience this drug in a supportive setting through the lens of, we didn't talk that much

1292
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:33,960
about it, but I think it becomes clear when people will watch this stuff, this ability to feel another

1293
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:39,320
person's pain is also very powerful, and I think that's a big part of what helps the trauma victim,

1294
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:45,080
is that someone else can feel that pain with them. They know that the person with them feels

1295
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:48,920
what they're going through, and that in and of itself begins the process of alleviation.

1296
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:53,720
That sounds hoity-toity, and if you haven't experienced it, I apologize. You will not know

1297
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:58,600
what I'm talking about, and that's okay. Yeah, the Trip of Compassion is about three of our Israeli

1298
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:03,640
PTSD patients in our Israeli study. So much of it is in Hebrew, some of it is in English, but it

1299
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:09,160
has English subtitles, and it's three different kinds of stories too, so you really get to see

1300
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:15,400
about how MDMA works. Sexual abuse, it's an explosion, like sort of terrorist violence,

1301
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:19,160
and what was the third? The third was kidnapping. That's right, the kidnapping moment, yes, yes.

1302
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:23,640
It's very powerful, and some of it too is where people are explaining what happened to them in a

1303
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:28,840
peaceful way, but others you can see how trauma is trapped in the body too, so a lot of it is people

1304
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:33,320
shaking and just letting out the fears that they had sort of suppressed in their body. So there's

1305
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:38,520
a book by Bessel van der Koch, who's a psychiatrist PTSD expert called The Body Keeps the Score.

1306
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:43,320
Yes. And so Bessel is actually the principal investigator of our Boston site, and so we're

1307
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:49,080
working with the leading PTSD researchers all over the world, and I think that MDMA will make a major,

1308
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:54,840
major contribution towards healing PTSD. And also, why I think it's so important, and why I think you

1309
01:54:54,840 --> 01:55:00,600
may mention that as well, is that it also heals multigenerational trauma, that we have conflicts

1310
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:05,800
that are passed on through epigenetics from generation to generation, and they can keep

1311
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:10,040
conflicts going for thousands of years. We can break those cycles within one generation,

1312
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:16,200
within one session sometimes. I think that's the real hope, is how can we move from this weight of

1313
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:21,320
trauma that has been plaguing humanity for thousands of years in our murderous nature,

1314
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:26,040
and how do we evolve from that to appreciate the other rather than being scared by the other,

1315
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:31,240
and to not have to define ourselves by who we're not, but how we're all more connected and celebrate

1316
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:37,480
differences rather than be scared of them. Hey, just as a reminder, this was technically the end

1317
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:43,320
of my interview with Rick. However, as I mentioned in the intro, we moved the first 75 minutes or so,

1318
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:49,880
and we bumped it to what you are about to hear now. This section dives really deep into Rick's

1319
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:55,160
background, his motivation for doing what he's doing, and basically what shaped Rick into becoming

1320
01:55:55,160 --> 01:56:01,880
the complete and utter force of nature that he is. Hope you enjoy. You dropped out of college,

1321
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:07,080
and there was a bit of a hiatus there. What year was that? Well, I started college in 71 and dropped

1322
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:13,640
out in 72, and when I dropped out, I had this really important exchange with my parents,

1323
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:19,560
where I said basically that I wanted to drop out of college. I wanted to study LSD and become an

1324
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:24,520
LSD therapist and bring back psychedelic research, and I wanted them to pay for it. They were

1325
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:29,880
initially shocked. I would say I'm the oldest of four kids, so I was the first one out of the nest,

1326
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:36,520
and then here I am at college, and within a few months, I'm taking LSD and deciding to drop out.

1327
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:43,640
What I ended up explaining to them was that they were very open-minded in different ways,

1328
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:49,960
and I felt that when I learned from LSD that I was unbalanced intellectually and emotionally.

1329
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:54,840
I was overdeveloped intellectually and underdeveloped emotionally and spiritually,

1330
01:56:54,840 --> 01:57:00,920
and the world I felt was the same. Albert Einstein said that our technology has exceeded our humanity,

1331
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:05,960
and so I felt that this was at a time of the height of the Cold War and not that long after

1332
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:11,080
the Cuban Missile Crisis, and this whole concern that we had this nuclear technology that we might

1333
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:18,680
not be able to handle as humans, mutual assured destruction, and that the world felt at risk,

1334
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:25,640
and so I felt that this imbalance that was in me that was also in the world and this ability of LSD

1335
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:31,320
to help me emotionally and spiritually. To explain a little bit more, I was a draft resistor to

1336
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:36,760
Vietnam, so this was during a period of time when I anticipated going to jail. I did a lot of study

1337
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:43,080
of nonviolent resistance, so I read Tolstoy and Thoreau and Emerson and Gandhi and Martin Luther

1338
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:50,920
King and a lot about that, and so I felt that I was not a pacifist, and so to be a conscientious

1339
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:55,960
objector to Vietnam, you had to be a pacifist. I was planning to go to college, and there's

1340
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:02,120
college deferments, but I felt like that wasn't really the proper kind of way to protest, and I

1341
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:08,280
felt like running to Canada was the wrong idea. I felt that it was important to directly confront

1342
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:14,440
the draft and to suffer the consequences, so what I felt was the best strategic approach was to not

1343
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:20,040
register for the draft at all, to drain the system of the most energy, to make them come after me.

1344
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:27,320
What I didn't realize is that the system itself wasn't as omnipotent as I thought it was,

1345
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:31,720
and roughly I learned later 60,000 people or so never registered for the draft,

1346
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:37,400
and so absolutely nothing happened to me. That later became a moral dilemma, like do I need to

1347
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:42,280
tell the draft board that I didn't register so they would come and put me in jail, but at this

1348
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:49,720
point I had discovered LSD and was seeing that this move beyond ego, this sense of spiritual

1349
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:55,800
connection, the sense of oneness, the sense of unity struck me as having incredible political

1350
01:58:55,800 --> 01:59:01,400
implications, and that's a lot of what I think was going on during the 60s, is that the common

1351
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:06,440
narrative looking back is that psychedelics gone wrong is what caused the backlash. People took it

1352
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:10,920
unprepared, they had psychotic episodes, they committed suicide, they jumped out of windows,

1353
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:17,480
they did all these things, and therefore the drug war was to help prevent drug abuse. When actually

1354
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:23,640
what I think happened more was that psychedelics went right, people had these experiences of going

1355
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:28,840
beyond their ego, going beyond their different ways that they identified themselves by their

1356
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:33,880
country, their religion, their gender, their race, their socioeconomic status, all these other ways

1357
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:39,480
that we define ourselves and divide ourselves, and that by having that fundamental connection

1358
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:46,120
to the earth, to the planet, to everybody, that that would be an antidote towards genocide,

1359
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:53,480
towards tribalism, fundamentalism, towards fear of the other. And so I thought that at a time

1360
01:59:54,200 --> 02:00:02,120
where the world could go up in nuclear explosions, and earlier I had been traumatized by learning

1361
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:06,840
about the Holocaust. So I was born in 53 and I have loads of Israeli relatives who fought in the

1362
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:13,160
48 war, been there for a long time. I had distant relatives killed in the Holocaust. My grandfather

1363
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:18,920
came from Poland in 1920 and so his family was left behind. My other relatives came a generation

1364
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:24,360
before and I grew up in a town called Skokie, Illinois, and I thought everybody was Jewish,

1365
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,840
everybody my family knew was Jewish, but I was six years old and it's kind of a family story about

1366
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:33,320
when I learned that the whole world wasn't Jewish and then it was just a tiny tiny fraction and I

1367
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:37,640
was like what if they're right, what if we're going to hell and Jesus is the only way, and but it made

1368
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:42,600
me feel like this tiny tiny minority and then the more that I learned about the Holocaust, I just

1369
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:49,640
had to wrestle with that level of magnitude of human cruelty. But I was protected by this

1370
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:54,840
incredible loving family and at the same time I realized I've had almost all the possible ways

1371
02:00:54,840 --> 02:01:00,360
to feel safe. So I was born in America at the peak of American power and I sort of bought into

1372
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:07,880
this American exceptionalism. I was also a male, I was also the first born male child, and I was also

1373
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:14,120
my family, my dad was a doctor, my mother was a teacher, but my mother's father was an industrialist

1374
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:19,960
and had made a big success in business and so we were economically secure and I was Jewish, part of

1375
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:25,080
the chosen people. So I had every kind of thing to think about that I was safe and protected, plus

1376
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:32,200
when we were 12 we moved to a town called Winnetka which was a further north wealthier town and

1377
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:37,160
people were leading different businesses and government. Donald Rumsfeld lived across the

1378
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:44,040
street and so I was I guess just thinking that I had the ability to make an influence on the world

1379
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:51,400
and that safety gave me I think the sense of capacity in a way to look at bigger threats

1380
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:57,720
without being terrified. I also knew as I was growing up that my grandfather had created this

1381
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:03,480
trust for all of his grandchildren. By today's standards it wasn't that much but it was enough

1382
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:09,000
that I would be able to pay for food and shelter and so that meant that I didn't need to compromise

1383
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,960
with what I would do with my life. I didn't have to find a job for survival, I could find a job

1384
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:21,000
for whatever I thought was most important and so there was also a period of time where I was just

1385
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:28,680
wrestling with this the cruelty of the Holocaust and then as a young boy being in school during the

1386
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:33,640
Cuban Missile Crisis and being told that you can hide under your desk and you might survive and

1387
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:37,640
so it was the Germans were the ones doing it to the Jews now it's the Russians doing it to the

1388
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:43,160
Americans then it was the Vietnam War my own country doing things and I got to know Daniel

1389
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:49,000
Ellsberg and at one point he talked about how he realized that initially that he thought we were

1390
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,440
on the wrong side of the war in Vietnam and then he realized we were the wrong side that sort of

1391
02:02:55,320 --> 02:03:00,440
sense of the world being crazy in peril and now my own country is wanting to send me to kill people

1392
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:07,160
or be killed for dubious reasons and then I became this draft resistor and struggling with what do I

1393
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:13,800
do with my life and so I felt that I was the product of three or four generations where

1394
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:17,880
the third and fourth generation my great grandparents and my grandparents their job

1395
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:24,200
was survival they left poor from pogroms from Russia and Poland they landed in America then

1396
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:30,360
they made financial successes and then I had the ability to look at deeper threats so I interpreted

1397
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:38,280
this freedom that I had to survive to buy food and shelter as a charge as a gift from generations

1398
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:44,920
before for me to look at deeper threats and that became the threat of nuclear annihilation or

1399
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:51,640
again threats of future prejudice and so I was just very much of a reader in high school and

1400
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:57,640
started reading Jung and thinking a lot about Herman Hess and kind of spirituality and I looked

1401
02:03:57,720 --> 02:04:03,400
at what was going on in the 60s I initially believed all the propaganda that LSD was terrible

1402
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:08,600
that it would cause chromosome damage that it would make you crazy if you did a certain numbers

1403
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:15,560
of times but the more I wised up the more I realized that I had been fed a lot of propaganda

1404
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:20,840
I actually was studying Russian to learn about the other my parents sent me to Russia after my junior

1405
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:25,000
year of high school so I spent the summer in Russia learning the language that would have been unusual

1406
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:30,840
right in the late 60s for an American to go to Russia it was incredible it was 1970 it was with

1407
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:35,560
60 high school students and we went to summer condon Tashkent people there had never seen Americans

1408
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:41,880
and ones that spoke Russian it was just an incredible eye-opener for me to see the other

1409
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:46,840
at one point where we were outside of Leningrad for most of the time for six weeks they were

1410
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:51,320
learning the language I went for a walk with a Russian girl down the beach and I just thought

1411
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:55,800
wow you're not this devil or you're not a monster you're just a person and then I started realizing

1412
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,200
these are conflicts between countries but the people aren't really necessarily hating each other

1413
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:07,240
political systems political leaders and conflict but I did want to study the other and so I was in

1414
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:12,520
my Russian class in my senior year of high school and a friend of mine knew I love books and he gave

1415
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:17,480
me a book to read I love this book and I turned it back to him and I said this is one of the best

1416
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:21,320
books I've ever read and he said do you know that this author wrote some of this book while he was

1417
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:27,240
under the influence of LSD and I'm like that's not possible LSD you can't produce it makes you crazy

1418
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:33,320
and he assured me that that was true and so I looked into it more it was one for over the

1419
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:38,360
cuckoo's nest by Ken Kesey and it turned out he had written some of it while it was under LSD so

1420
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:44,280
that's what really was the key turning point as far as me opening my eyes to LSD and then when I

1421
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:49,880
ended up at college it was a new college in Sarasota Florida it was an experimental college

1422
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:55,800
that had started in the 60s and it was designed as kind of an antidote to traditional education

1423
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:00,120
so the fundamental principle was that the student's curiosity is the most important thing

1424
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:06,280
IM Pei the architect had designed the buildings it was on the Ringling Brothers grounds the

1425
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:12,920
Ringling Circus grounds because that's where they wintered in Sarasota and it had no grades it had

1426
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:18,360
written evaluations it was very small classes independent study a lot everybody had to do a

1427
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:24,200
senior thesis but when I got to this college this is before I had done LSD there was two things that

1428
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:29,080
they didn't put in the brochure that I didn't expect but that both I was incredibly grateful

1429
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:36,120
for one was that they had this tradition of all-night dances under the stars with psychedelics

1430
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:40,840
and they had a tradition of people doing psychedelics individually for personal growth

1431
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:47,000
at the time the average dose of LSD was 250 micrograms so that you would go for an existential

1432
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:53,240
experience beyond verbal communication abilities and that was the standard dose now it's around

1433
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:57,720
one fourth or one third of that dose is the standard dose because a lot of people got into

1434
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:02,840
trouble and it was too much for them but they had this tradition of welcoming psychedelic use and

1435
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:08,280
it was brilliant people from all over the place the other tradition that they had was surprising

1436
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:14,280
there was a woman professor Marianne Hoppen who had studied directly with Jung and she had married

1437
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:19,160
someone who was quite wealthy and the school didn't have a lot of facilities and so they

1438
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:24,440
donated an olympic-sized swimming pool outdoors to the school and for whatever reason it turned

1439
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:30,760
into a nudist colony so I was a super shy guy in high school for two years I couldn't even speak

1440
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:35,560
to a girl other than my mother and my sister I was just too shy I just couldn't even do it now

1441
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:40,520
here I'm sitting at this pool with all these beautiful naked girls and and it felt somehow

1442
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:47,800
like this was a oasis of sanity that this college had created this place where we could be bringing

1443
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:54,040
things up from the underground from suppressed things so sexuality physicality psychedelics

1444
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:59,240
they were welcome the campus police job was to protect us from the real police they had two sets

1445
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:03,560
of room notes where people were living there was one where the rooms that you were assigned the

1446
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:07,160
other where the rooms where you really were living and so they would permit guys and girls

1447
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:12,600
to live together on campus it was just this oasis of sanity in a crazy world and then I started

1448
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:17,720
deciding to do psychedelics and so my first experience really it was difficult because I

1449
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:23,800
wasn't very fluid emotionally but it touched certain parts of my psyche that I felt that my

1450
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:29,720
bar mitzvah had failed to touch I thought the traditional rites of passage didn't work for me

1451
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:35,240
I was left hungry and wanting more and didn't feel a spiritual connection and so I felt the

1452
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:41,400
the psychedelics really had a big potential there and then I was reading the whole earth catalog

1453
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:47,240
by Stephen Brand and in it they had this advertisement or this review actually up for a

1454
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:52,040
book and the book was by John Lilly and it was called programming and metaprogramming in the

1455
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:58,520
human biocomputer and it was about the research that he did in the 50s funded by the navy where

1456
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:03,400
he developed the flotation tank and then he started doing LSD in the tank and trying to

1457
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:08,600
understand his mind as if it was a biocomputer trying to really understand I mean we know enormous

1458
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:12,760
amounts now about how specialized different brain regions are but they didn't really know that much

1459
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:18,040
back then so this was an incredible book about LSD to go into the unconscious and at the same time

1460
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:24,920
that this was happening this was 71 and 72 this was after the backlash against the 60s so the

1461
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:31,800
idealism of the 60s the spiritually motivated move towards the start of a lot of movements

1462
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:39,000
had backlash and had failed and a lot of it was because of the flaws of the advocates not just

1463
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:43,480
the evil system trying to squash everything which was going on too but there was also this

1464
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:47,400
sense that counterculture had failed people talk about the 70s as the me decade but I think a lot

1465
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:53,640
of it was about this where did we go wrong that our own instrument was was flawed so I felt like

1466
02:09:53,640 --> 02:10:00,920
this deep work was necessary to kind of purify and to refine so that when we try to bring this

1467
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:08,040
back again that it's mainstreamed and not rejected and I started doing flotation tank sort of we

1468
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:12,840
tried to create our own sensory isolation experiments with gloves and eye shades and

1469
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:17,560
different things we didn't actually have tanks at the time but some friends and I would do a large

1470
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:24,520
doses of LSD in isolation environments and I started having a lot of problems with my LSD trips

1471
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:29,560
also mexiclin somebody came by a campus with half a pound of mexiclin so I bought all of it

1472
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:34,520
and capped it hundreds of capsules and friends and I just did it for months and just to give you a

1473
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:38,760
sense of how new college was at the time I just had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of mexiclin

1474
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:43,400
capsules in my drawer in my room and people would come to me and they'd say I'd like to buy some

1475
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:47,480
mexiclin I'd say yeah go ahead here it is take as many as you want here's the money leave the money

1476
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:52,120
and nobody ever ripped me off nobody ever got in trouble it was just this sense that this was a

1477
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:57,320
crazy world the Vietnam war was raging and here we were trying to find a new way now at the time

1478
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:03,240
Rick was mexiclin and or LSD scheduled yeah yeah they were both illegal two things I just want to

1479
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:07,640
interject for historical context the first is just give folks a bit of a background on LSD when it

1480
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:11,240
was synthesized it's a completely synthesized molecule so it doesn't exist in nature and a

1481
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:15,960
number of the psychedelics do exist in nature so we can contrast that give me like a little bit of

1482
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:22,360
a background on LSD okay yeah also I'll say that Albert Hoffman who was the Sandoz chemist that

1483
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:29,240
first synthesized LSD in 38 and they were looking for drugs that might be helpful for

1484
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:34,680
Sandoz by the way is to this day is to a pharma giant well Sandoz has been purchased by Novartis

1485
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:39,480
yeah yeah it's funny there Sandoz makes like there are certain hormones like thyroid hormones

1486
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:44,680
where I actually always prefer patients get the generic Sandoz like the one made by Sandoz yeah

1487
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:48,920
I'm very particular about it if they get lebothiroxine I want it to be Sandoz

1488
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:54,200
wow that's neat what's really important for me symbolically is that are the maps public benefit

1489
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:58,920
corporation which is what conducts our research our drug development research with psychedelics

1490
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:03,880
it's led by a whole group of women who came from Novartis so we have the the Sandoz

1491
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:09,480
relationship yeah yeah training so we've got big pharma so what was Albert's motivation or the

1492
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:13,880
motivation of the corporation yeah they were looking for drugs for stopping postpartum bleeding

1493
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:21,240
ergot has been used for that purpose and so Albert was doing various derivatives from ergot

1494
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:27,640
and then chemically modifying them so LSD 25 is in the 25th of the series and they gave it to a

1495
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:34,520
bunch of animals and found nothing interesting and in the height of world war two in 43 after

1496
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:40,440
Albert had finished some other bit of work he had what he called a peculiar pre-sentiment that this

1497
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:46,760
drug that had been studied and abandoned might have some potential he almost never did that is

1498
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:51,640
gone back to drugs that he'd invented that had been tested in animals and found to be of no

1499
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:57,720
interest to Sandoz he almost never went back so he writes a lot about this peculiar pre-sentiment

1500
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:06,520
that he had and whether this was some kind of calling or so he re-synthesized it in April 16th

1501
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:12,920
of 1943 so this was five years after he had originally basically come to the conclusion

1502
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:17,800
this was not going to have any efficacy for postpartum bleeding yeah yeah or other things too i

1503
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:23,240
mean they were looking for other things as well maybe it had other potential purposes but five

1504
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:30,920
years later he re-synthesized it and during this re-synthesis process and he's an incredibly

1505
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:36,040
meticulous Swiss chemist he didn't know how he might have contaminated himself but he started

1506
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:41,480
closing his eyes and seeing colors and visions it lasted for a couple hours and kind of went away

1507
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:48,120
but it was a weird kind of an experience for him and he thought maybe maybe somehow he had

1508
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:53,720
contaminated himself with this LSD 25 that he was manufacturing and so that was on a Friday

1509
02:13:54,360 --> 02:14:02,360
April 16th 1943 and so he decided over the weekend that he would do a planned experiment

1510
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:07,960
on Monday the 19th and it would take a tiny fraction of this drug that he thought would have

1511
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:13,240
no effect but he would try to see if there was something to it if his visions that he had on

1512
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:20,200
Friday were related to this drug and so he took 250 micrograms 250 millionths of a gram and

1513
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:25,720
during that experience he went through this similar kind of vision so he became convinced

1514
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:31,400
that this was the cause of what had happened on Friday but it got stronger and stronger and

1515
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:38,920
he was starting to lose his normal frame of reference and worrying that he had poisoned

1516
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:44,200
himself and that he was going to die and he started feeling like he was going to die and so

1517
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:49,640
he ended up deciding that he would leave the laboratory and he would go home and so he rode

1518
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:54,920
his bicycle so now Tom Roberts who's a psychologist who helps transpersonal psychology has called it

1519
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:59,240
bicycle day and so now it's celebrated around the world that he took his bicycle home while

1520
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:03,880
he was tripping and there's been videos made about this but Albert gets home and they call

1521
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:09,000
his wife and tell his wife that he might be dying they get milk from a neighbor because they thought

1522
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:14,360
milk would be an antidote and he drinks gallon of milk and stuff and none of this helps and he goes

1523
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:20,360
through this whole existential crisis but then in the end he actually doesn't die and then he has

1524
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:26,920
spiritual experiences he's written about it it's beautiful LSD my problem child by Albert Hoffman

1525
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:32,200
we've actually maps has published that book we just got 3,500 copies of it delivered on Monday

1526
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:38,760
and so it's a beautiful book about the origins of LSD and this was just something that Albert was

1527
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:42,680
shocked about and then in the morning he felt great and so he thought that this drug

1528
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:49,080
was like a temporary voyage into insanity so they called it psychotomimetic meaning it mimics

1529
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:54,680
psychosis and they started sharing it Sandoz did they started well first off Albert's bosses didn't

1530
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:59,800
believe that this could be possible that a drug in that small amount could actually have such an

1531
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:06,760
effect it's worth noting for a listener what you said was micrograms so you said 250 micrograms

1532
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:11,880
but if any person thinking about a drug that they take if you take a drug for your blood pressure

1533
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:21,000
or your cholesterol or an antibiotic these are virtually always in milligrams which is 1000 times

1534
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:29,320
greater so 250 milligrams is 1000 times more than 250 micrograms turns out Synthroid or drugs

1535
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:34,520
for thyroid are some of the few drugs that are actually dosed in micrograms but you're right this

1536
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:40,920
is a very potent agent to be at the level of millionths of grams to reach significant clinical

1537
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:43,880
feeling I mean they obviously at the time didn't know what it was doing but they knew that they

1538
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:48,840
were dealing with something potent so several of Albert's bosses didn't believe him and they tried

1539
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:54,760
LSD as well and then they were persuaded that it really was from the LSD and then they started

1540
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:58,360
trying to figure out what they do with this incredible drug and so they started shipping

1541
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:02,600
it around to different researchers to see if they would look into it they said this could be used

1542
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:08,920
for psychiatry to help you have a temporary voyage into insanity the first research in the

1543
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:14,760
United States was in 1949 at Harvard and they ended up circulating it to different places in

1544
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:19,720
the 50s in the middle 50s they sent it to Czech Republic that's where Stan Groff ended up using

1545
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:25,880
it in the middle 50s but it also came to the attention of the military and began this whole

1546
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:32,280
effort to study mind control drugs and what they called non-lethal incapacitants and it became

1547
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:36,680
tangled up in the CIA they had a project called MK ultra they thought it would be good for

1548
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:41,000
stereotypically dosing world leaders and making them embarrassed when they're giving speeches

1549
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:45,960
or different things incapacitating a whole group of army people they tried to see if they could do

1550
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:51,960
it in aerosol sprays so it had this dual track of military applications which were mostly kept

1551
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:57,800
secret and then also therapeutic or temporary voyage to insanity but more people who took it

1552
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:02,040
realized that it wasn't temporary insanity it was something different and that there was this

1553
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:07,400
spiritual aspect to it it started being used in different ways for psychotherapy in particular it

1554
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:13,480
was being used for alcoholism and heroin addiction in the 50s and in the 60s and in the 50s

1555
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:19,240
w bill wilson who started aa actually tried lsd his first experience was of a psychedelic was with

1556
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:25,720
belladonna which was kind of something used by the witches it was more disorienting but during his

1557
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:31,400
belladonna experience he decided to get sober and then years later when this work with lsd was being

1558
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:36,920
developed he explored it and so bill w did lsd and thought it had tremendous potential for

1559
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:43,080
treatment of alcoholism and it helps the spiritual sense and it also brings to the surface things

1560
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:47,880
that people have suppressed and so it's good for psychotherapy and then it's also good for

1561
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:54,120
building sources of strength from these kind of spiritual experiences what also happened is the cia

1562
02:18:54,120 --> 02:19:03,160
funded some expeditions sent people to mexico with gordon wassain in 57 58 to search for mushrooms

1563
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:07,880
for other drugs that might be psychedelic now why did they realize that was it based on the

1564
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:13,960
similarity in chemical structure between a completely synthesized molecule like lsd and what they

1565
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:21,320
knew were similar molecules that would exist in nature well mexcalin had been extracted

1566
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:28,840
synthesized from peyote in like 1895 or so and it had been used in research a lot in the 20s and 30s

1567
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:35,000
mostly in europe also william james the father of american psychology had experimented also in

1568
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,360
like 1896 or so with nitrous oxide and wrote about it in the varieties of religious experience

1569
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:46,680
so there was already knowledge about how other substances had these properties i mean the word

1570
02:19:46,680 --> 02:19:53,000
psychedelic didn't get developed until 1958 by um humphrey osmond who wrote this poem to aldis

1571
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:58,040
huxley i'll just say that you're wearing the doors i've got a door shirt on here now i wore

1572
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:03,400
i wore this knowing that that you would appreciate it yeah and the doors got their name from the

1573
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:08,920
doors of perception which i read in high school and became obsessed with the band yeah and so that

1574
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:13,960
was from aldis huxley's discussion about his mexican experience is is writing about that and so

1575
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:20,680
there was this whole awareness of these kind of substances and so there was this expedition gordon

1576
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:26,280
wassain was going to track down this idea that mushrooms might be used as spiritual tools by

1577
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:31,560
the mazatec indians and the ci had somebody go along secretly as part of that expedition

1578
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:37,080
and once they got these mushrooms they did have these psychedelic experiences but they gave it to

1579
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:41,640
a bunch of different chemists and they weren't able to figure out what was in it what was the

1580
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:47,240
active ingredient so they decided they would send it to albert hoffman and albert was able to figure

1581
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:53,080
out that the active ingredient was psilocybin and the reason he said that he was able to figure it

1582
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:58,600
out and nobody else was is that he was willing to drink the different fractions and see which

1583
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:03,640
produced the similar effect to yeah what he had already known yeah and then he would continue

1584
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:07,240
trying to separate it out to find out what was the active ingredient oh my god do you want to talk

1585
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:12,680
about the citizen scientist right oh yeah but he's again working for sandos at the time and so

1586
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:17,960
albert figured it out so 15 years after he discovered lsd in 43 discovered really the

1587
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:22,760
psychedelic properties he was the one that isolated psilocybin and then shortly after that

1588
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:28,600
there was this whole effort to understand other sources in nature of psychedelics and it turns out

1589
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:34,920
that morning glory seeds have also been used for psychedelic properties and then albert looked at

1590
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:41,960
that and morning glory seeds have lsa which is lysergic acid amide and lsd is lysergic acid

1591
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:48,840
diethylamide so there is even though lsd came from ergot was modified so that it doesn't appear in

1592
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:54,520
nature decades later albert was able to figure out that there is something in nature that's quite

1593
02:21:54,520 --> 02:22:00,760
similar to lsd it's not the same and lsd i think is more powerful more effective people have had a

1594
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:07,000
tradition of morning glory seeds for getting high in different ways so because i know michael paulin

1595
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:11,560
has done a great job writing about this and i would encourage anyone who's interested in this topic

1596
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:17,000
to sort of go back and read his book how to change your mind where he details the history there is an

1597
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:24,440
important point i want you to bring up because his legacy in many ways provides a little bit of

1598
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:28,760
an undercurrent of the work you've done and that is the work of timothy leery where does leery fit

1599
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:35,960
into this story specifically so leery was an incredible psychologist who had written a book

1600
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:41,960
called the interpersonal diagnosis of personality that was heralded as brilliant it was the most

1601
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:48,520
important psychology book of the year this is like 58 59 he was working for kyzer out in california

1602
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:54,680
as a kyzer psychologist he was very rebellious kind of guy he had been in west point and got

1603
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:00,760
kicked out of west point for i think sharing alcohol and doing different things and he had

1604
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:07,320
actually had a friend who was involved in the cia who was a psychologist did a lot of work on

1605
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:13,960
creativity frank baron and frank baron had had knowledge about the mushrooms and had tried them

1606
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:19,640
and he recommended to timothy leery that he try these mushrooms and then tim had now also then

1607
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:23,880
been offered this appointment at harvard so he got this appointment at harvard before he'd even

1608
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:29,720
done any kind of psychedelics then he does these mushrooms and he thinks that he learned more from

1609
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:35,240
these mushroom experience than in this entire time in school about the mind and so he started trying

1610
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:43,400
to study psychedelics and got interested mostly again in psilocybin and so there was a series of

1611
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:49,720
projects that tim was here at harvard only for three years from 60 to 63 i've done long-term

1612
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:55,640
follow-ups to two of his main studies that he did at harvard one was the good friday experiment

1613
02:23:55,640 --> 02:24:02,360
that actually walter panky who was a doctor and a minister did this for phd and tim was his phd

1614
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:08,040
thesis advisor can you explain that experiment to people yeah i'd say the other is the concrete

1615
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:13,640
prison experiment i'll also explain so because of aldis huxley and writing about doors of perception

1616
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:20,760
and writing about the sort of spiritual aspects of mexican and even bill w feeling that lsd had

1617
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:28,360
spiritual capacities so what walter panky wanted to do was originally he was interested in doing

1618
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:33,320
something about the sex lives of radcliffe students which his wife wasn't too happy about

1619
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:38,680
and he met tim and tim suggested that they do something with psychedelics and since walter

1620
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:44,840
panky was both doctor and minister they decided to look scientifically at whether psychedelics

1621
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:51,160
really could produce spiritual mystical experiences whether they were similar identical pseudo whatever

1622
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:57,800
and so the first thing that walter panky did was he spent a year trying to devise a questionnaire

1623
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:03,640
to evaluate what the mystical experience was aldis huxley had talked about the perennial philosophy

1624
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:10,600
that keeps coming up and so what walter did was he looked at wt stace who had done work on the

1625
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:15,880
theory of the philosophy of religion and how you describe mystical experiences there's actually a

1626
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:22,680
scale that stace had made and others and so what walter did is he spent this year developing a

1627
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:29,560
series of questionnaires that were independent of any particular religious symbols or any

1628
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:37,000
particular religious system so even though this was an experiment that took place on good friday

1629
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:42,600
it didn't have any references to jesus this questionnaire and so basically the fundamental

1630
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:47,640
core element of this perennial philosophy of the mystical experience is this sense of unity

1631
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:51,160
and you get this from all different religions about everything's one everything's united

1632
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:57,160
somehow one big system so there's external reality where you can see that nature is all connected or

1633
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:02,120
internal reality sort of everything you know without form is still connected but that sense

1634
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:09,240
that it's all one thing transcendence of time and space deeply felt positive mood a sense of

1635
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:16,040
something sacred or holy a sense that it's ineffable that there's something beyond language about the

1636
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:20,840
experience so walter had developed this questionnaire which is in very minimally

1637
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:25,880
modified way is still used today in all of the psychedelic research to evaluate the mystical

1638
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:32,120
experience so what they decided to do was to take a group of 20 christian divinity students from

1639
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:39,400
andover newton theological seminary and bring them into church on good friday at boston university

1640
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:44,520
and the minister was reverend howard thermon and he was martin luther king's mentor he was an

1641
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:50,680
incredible dynamic black preacher and actually i was able during my follow-up study to obtain

1642
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:57,240
copies from walter panky's widow walter died in 71 in the scoop diving accident but his widow had

1643
02:26:57,240 --> 02:27:03,640
the actual copy of the service that they listened to during good friday which is just profoundly

1644
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:09,720
moving and it shows that in 1962 on good friday when they did this experiment that psychedelics

1645
02:27:09,800 --> 02:27:17,240
were just beginning to be controversial they really were not and so this was an experiment to see

1646
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:22,120
if these 20 divinity students in church on good friday and this was like a three and a half hour

1647
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:27,720
service three and a four hour service they all got a pill half got placebo half got psilocybin

1648
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:34,040
and they were divided these 20 people into groups of four five groups of four and two experimenters

1649
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:39,560
were assigned to each group of four and the experimenters also took these pills and one of

1650
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:44,680
the experimenter would get the placebo one would get the psilocybin these were people like tim leery

1651
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:50,760
ralph metzner richard alpert who later became ram das houston smith incredible people who were

1652
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:55,960
experts in the philosophy of religion and psychology and they were trying to break down the us them

1653
02:27:56,840 --> 02:28:02,600
experimenter subject dichotomies and that's why they had the experimenters also took the pills

1654
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:09,240
and what they then did was after the experiment after the service they had a chapel in the

1655
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:15,160
basement so while the main service was taking place in the upstairs chapel downstairs was the

1656
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:19,880
chapel where the experiment was taking place i've since visited its marsh chapel it's on commonwealth

1657
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:25,240
out for boston university there's a statue out in front of it for martin luther king that actually

1658
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:30,360
talked about my approach towards draft resistance it's like and the quote there is who believes the

1659
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:35,000
law is unjust and breaks it and is willingly suffering the consequences to be an example of

1660
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:39,320
others actually has the highest regard for the law so it's sort of showing the civil disobedience

1661
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:43,640
is people that believe in the law but want to modify it so that's out in front of mars chapel

1662
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:49,240
but then over the doorway to the main chapel before this experiment even took place

1663
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:55,160
is a quote about experimental religion it's just amazingly historically resonant that that place was

1664
02:28:55,160 --> 02:29:00,120
sympathetic with this idea of experimental religion but the idea was then that they would go

1665
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:05,080
through this experiment they would then give questionnaires about what their experience was

1666
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:09,480
how they described it and then they would do a six-month follow-up about the long-term effects

1667
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:16,120
as i mentioned walter died in a scuba diving accident in 1971 so i was convinced in the middle

1668
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:21,320
80s when i was wanting to do a thesis at new college i had to do senior thesis i want to do

1669
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:25,480
something with psychedelics but it was at a time when psychedelic research was all blocked

1670
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:31,240
and so i thought wow i could do a follow-up study and ask people what they thought about it it

1671
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:36,280
wouldn't involve drugs so i could get permission to do it so i ended up doing it to this 25 year

1672
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:41,240
follow-up to the good friday experiment what was the finding of the original experiment that nine

1673
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:47,480
out of the 20 people had a mystical experience and eight out of those nine had the psilocybin

1674
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:53,640
so they concluded that under the influence of psilocybin people who were religiously inclined

1675
02:29:53,720 --> 02:30:00,360
in a religious setting could have what looked like a mystical experience and so either it was

1676
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:05,560
genuine or it was similar but they concluded that according to this questionnaire that

1677
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:11,320
that psilocybin did indeed have the potential to catalyze mystical experiences and what was the

1678
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:17,880
approximate dose of psilocybin they took it was 30 milligrams so it was a major dose of psilocybin

1679
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:25,160
and the placebo it turned out was niacin to give them a flush without knowing that yeah we'll come

1680
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:30,440
back to this and psychedelic research one of the challenges is the placebos have to give you some

1681
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:36,520
feeling yeah my dissertation at the kennedy school a big part of it was on how to do double blind

1682
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:41,880
studies with psychedelics and the conclusion i came to and we'll get back to the good friday

1683
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:45,880
experiment but the conclusion i came to was that the best way to do a double blind experiment with

1684
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:50,920
psychedelics was to use low doses of the psychedelic versus full doses and that way

1685
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:54,920
everybody has the same demand characteristics they all think they're going to be getting the

1686
02:30:54,920 --> 02:31:00,680
test drug they just don't know what dose and all the experimenters know everybody's getting the drug

1687
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:06,280
and i thought that the real challenge was going to be to find the level of the low dose yeah so

1688
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:11,800
that it's below this step it's below the real activation well it has to be high enough so that

1689
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:16,360
you would have enough confusion between the full dose but not so high that you get all the

1690
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:21,880
therapeutic potential so i thought you'd get a little bit of the therapeutic potential but you

1691
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:25,720
didn't want to get too much because the more therapeutic potential you got the more difference

1692
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:29,000
it would be to find differences between the two groups the more difficult it would be

1693
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:36,360
and so in our work with mdma we'd looked at zero milligrams 25 milligrams 30 milligrams 40 milligrams

1694
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:43,800
50 milligrams 75 100 125 and 150 what we discovered was that the low doses did produce

1695
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:50,120
blinding that's what i had anticipated but what i didn't anticipate is that the low doses actually

1696
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:56,600
made people uncomfortable it activated them without reducing the fear and so the therapeutic

1697
02:31:56,600 --> 02:32:04,440
effect of just the therapy was compromised and so people who had therapy without any mdma did better

1698
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:10,680
than people that had therapy with low dose mdma and low in that situation was how low 25 to 40 25

1699
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:16,600
30 and 40 milligrams and then the 75 milligrams actually was very therapeutic so when we opened

1700
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:22,040
our meeting with the fda to talk about our phase three designs i started by saying there's a quote

1701
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:25,320
from i thought it was william james but it turned out it was little i think one of the early

1702
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:30,200
presidents of harvard and he said never forget there's always a harvard man on the wrong side

1703
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:34,600
of every issue and so i opened the meeting by saying there's this quote and unfortunately i'm

1704
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:39,480
the wrong side this person that's wrong is me because my dissertation was wrong and there is

1705
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:45,080
no solution to the double blind problem at least for mdma and so the fda accepted that and i said

1706
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:49,240
you could have us use low dose but you're going to make it easier for us to find a difference

1707
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:54,840
between the full dose and the therapy with low dose because it blunts the effect of the therapy

1708
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:58,760
and so the real question is if you can do it without a drug why add a drug if the therapy is

1709
02:32:58,760 --> 02:33:05,400
effective why add a drug so i said the best way to do this is therapy with inactive placebo versus

1710
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:11,240
therapy with full dose mdma and fda accepted that and so has ema the european medicines agency but

1711
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:16,120
back to the good friday experiment so what they discovered is that the double blind did not work

1712
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:22,280
nycen did not work as double blind people were initially confused but after a while this nycen

1713
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:27,400
flush wears off and then you've got these other people seeing colors and seeing sparkles and the

1714
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:32,600
candle flames and having all these unusual experiences so everybody was clear by the end

1715
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:38,120
of the experiment who had the nycen who had the psilocybin and at the six-month follow-up they

1716
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:43,560
showed that people had reported long-term positive benefits and so this was considered to be the most

1717
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:47,560
sophisticated experiment in the history of religion looking at the mystical experience

1718
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:54,200
and it demonstrated positive long-term benefits although compromised because of course it

1719
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:59,480
effectively wasn't blinded to the extent that you would say that's compromised yeah yeah what

1720
02:33:59,480 --> 02:34:06,440
makes me think that it wasn't so compromised is that i did my long-term follow-up 25 years later

1721
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:16,200
87 86 88 is when i kept so i went to andover newton theological seminary i went to the alumni

1722
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:21,640
office and to the president i said could we send a letter to everybody on your alumni newsletter

1723
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:27,240
asking who was in this experiment oh because you didn't know their names there's no record leery had

1724
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:32,600
no record the records were gone of who the people were andover newton this was at a time of nancy

1725
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:38,840
reagan escalation of the drug war and this was probably the nadir of views towards psychedelics

1726
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:44,520
and society andover newton refused to cooperate with the study they wouldn't put even a notice

1727
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:50,040
in their alumni newsletter or help me in any way find out who the subjects were and so i was super

1728
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:54,760
frustrated and i said while i was there i thought okay i'll just go into their library and see if

1729
02:34:54,760 --> 02:35:00,840
they've got thesis and if they've got the commentaries any discussions about this most important study

1730
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:04,520
that was done with their students and so it turned out that they didn't even have walter panky's

1731
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:09,320
thesis in their library it was so controversial actually that after the study was done you had

1732
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:15,640
to get a permission directly from walter in order to look at the thesis in the harvard library they

1733
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:19,880
didn't even put it out there they didn't want any people to know about it so i didn't even

1734
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:25,000
see the thesis i thought this is like massive cultural amnesia and here how embarrassing this

1735
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:28,840
is a school of religion and this is the most important study done and they don't even have

1736
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:32,760
a copy of it they don't even want to talk about it and i just wandered through their library a

1737
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:38,040
little bit and then i saw coincidentally a booklet of all of their alumni and their addresses and

1738
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:43,400
which years they were in the school and this was from like a 1972 book but it had people who were

1739
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:48,840
at school in 62 when the study was done so i ended up writing letters to like 300 people

1740
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:53,960
and i got about three responses back that they were actually in the study and it took me multiple

1741
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:59,160
years but eventually i was able to identify 19 out of the 20 of the people who were in the study

1742
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:03,800
and my parents were sympathetic at this point and so i would fly to wherever they were in the

1743
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:10,200
country and then interview them in person and what i discovered was first off shocking to me so at a

1744
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:15,960
point where every cultural indication would be that these persons should deny the value of the

1745
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:21,560
psychedelic experience massive escalation of the drug war republicans in charge people going to

1746
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:27,080
jail for all this kind of stuff everybody who had the psilocybin experience except for one person

1747
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:31,000
said that they had a mystical experience back then and they still considered it to be a mystical

1748
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:36,440
experience and they had had many non-drug mystical experiences since then as well to compare and

1749
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:40,840
contrast and they said that they preferred the non-drug mystical experiences because they tended

1750
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:46,280
to be more positive more in nature more just coming over them gratuitous grace sometimes they

1751
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:52,360
would call it but the psychedelic mystical experiences were more oscillating between fear

1752
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:58,280
and unit of experiences that they were deeper in some ways but were more difficult to manage but

1753
02:36:58,280 --> 02:37:03,400
they validated the importance of the experience and then i felt like i discovered the clue to the

1754
02:37:03,400 --> 02:37:09,000
60s by doing these interviews because what they told me is that first off everybody who had the

1755
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:14,520
psilocybin could remember with crystal clarity some moments of their psychedelic experience

1756
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:20,280
something about psychedelics imprint on memory you don't remember everything but some portions

1757
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:26,440
of it are just indelible and they validated that they were genuine but the key to the 60s for me

1758
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:31,880
was that they talked about how that unit of experience motivated them in different ways

1759
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:36,520
to get involved with social justice struggles now of course these were all ministers anyway they

1760
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:41,400
were thinking in that way it's not that everybody who takes this will be motivated in that way but

1761
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:47,400
one of them worked against the mx missile basing others of them participated in the civil rights

1762
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:51,960
movement the women's rights movement the environmental movement they felt that there was

1763
02:37:51,960 --> 02:37:59,080
this connection between this spiritual experience they lost a certain fear of death so they were

1764
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:05,720
more willing to take risks in their lives they learned the appreciation of the moment it's not

1765
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:12,680
that they didn't care about death but they death made life more precious they didn't go for this

1766
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:17,160
idea that heaven is later after you die it's like more that they wanted to create it on earth

1767
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:22,840
and so they used that psychedelic experience to be involved in challenging the status quo to try

1768
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:29,880
to make it a more spiritual loving world and i felt that that's where i really learned that

1769
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:34,360
the crackdown against the 60s was not because of psychedelics gone wrong but because of

1770
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:39,640
psychedelics gone right but i also learned something else which is that the placebo people

1771
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:43,240
had a hard time remembering what was going on i mean they knew they were in the experiment but

1772
02:38:43,240 --> 02:38:49,400
they didn't have as clear memories about what happened some of them were so upset by what they

1773
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:54,600
saw saw in the others in the others that they were disoriented that one person went up and tried to

1774
02:38:54,600 --> 02:39:00,520
be the preacher it scared them and they decided never to do psychedelics others decided that they

1775
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:05,240
were so inspired by what they saw that they wanted to do psychedelics so some of them did

1776
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:09,240
go back and do psychedelics from the placebo group but then what i discovered i started hearing these

1777
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:16,920
stories about how one person who had received the psilocybin had been listening to reverend howard

1778
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:21,800
thurman at one point where he's telling people that you need to tell people there's a man on the

1779
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:28,280
cross this is your obligation this jesus story that you must tell others about it and so this

1780
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:33,640
one person started to realize that he should do that and he thought well i should tell the

1781
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:38,040
president if i'm going to tell anybody i should tell the president and he then said oh you know

1782
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:43,320
the president's in washington and okay i'll tell the president of the university and so he left

1783
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:50,200
the basement chapel he went outside and he was wandering down the road going towards the

1784
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:55,640
president and this very much scared timothy leery and houston smith and they went after him and

1785
02:39:55,640 --> 02:40:00,120
they finally got him they protected him he didn't get hit by a car but he didn't want to go back in

1786
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:08,760
and so they ended up giving him a shot of thorazine a tranquilizer which was used at this time and

1787
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:12,280
when people had difficult trips sometimes they would tranquilize them we would not do that today

1788
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:17,800
it's it freezes the struggles in place it's not helpful at all better to just wait it out even

1789
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:22,440
if it's terrible because then at least you don't get the message you can't handle it if you wait

1790
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:27,480
it out at least you survived so it turned out though that this whole administration of thorazine

1791
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:32,360
to this one person was completely missing from any of the reports about the study which i considered

1792
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:38,920
to be another key to the 60s in that leery and the advocates underestimated the risks and over and

1793
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:44,600
exaggerated the benefits so the way this story the good friday experiment was reported in time

1794
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:49,240
magazine and elsewhere was that everybody who got the psilocybin had the mystical experience which

1795
02:40:49,240 --> 02:40:55,960
is not the case eventually i did manage to figure out who was the one that was tranquilized and when

1796
02:40:55,960 --> 02:41:02,040
i called him he was still a minister he was married he had kids but when i identified myself

1797
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:07,960
as wanting to talk to him about this experiment he was very upset and he said if i ever called

1798
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:13,480
him again he would sue me he didn't want to talk to me at all so i think that this idea that he had

1799
02:41:13,480 --> 02:41:18,680
been he was traumatized by that experience he was very traumatized by it and it was embarrassing and

1800
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:23,160
so he didn't want to talk about it but i heard about it from others and was able to figure out

1801
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:29,960
who it was and so i felt that this was the height of scientific irresponsibility and many people who

1802
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:35,240
have been through what you've been through meaning they have watched this journey are not especially

1803
02:41:35,240 --> 02:41:43,080
sympathetic to leery in fact many people just single-handedly identify leery's irresponsibility

1804
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:48,840
as the sole reason for the backlash which of course strikes me as hyperbolic and unlikely to

1805
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:53,960
be the case but i've certainly read accounts that you've written that come across as being slightly

1806
02:41:53,960 --> 02:41:59,000
more sympathetic to leery yeah i'm much more sympathetic in the sense that it's psychedelics

1807
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:04,840
gone right that really caused the backlash and while he was irresponsible in a lot of different

1808
02:42:04,840 --> 02:42:11,720
ways and was delighted to be a rebel and to be against the system and i think this identification

1809
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:17,640
as the counterculture was in itself a self-fulfilling doomed prophecy that you identify yourself as

1810
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:23,160
counterculture you're going to be crushed eventually but i think he saw that the

1811
02:42:23,160 --> 02:42:28,760
propaganda for the other side the negative exaggerations of the risks were so strong

1812
02:42:29,720 --> 02:42:35,640
that he justified in his own mind that he could exaggerate on the other side and minimize the

1813
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:41,320
risk so i do think he deserves a lot of criticism for what he said but he was very much about

1814
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:46,520
thinking for yourself questioning authority challenging the system all of which we need more

1815
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:53,880
of and what i fault him for the most was misrepresenting science it's okay to be a

1816
02:42:53,880 --> 02:43:00,920
cultural advocate but when science is holy in itself holy meaning h-o-l-y meaning that it's

1817
02:43:01,480 --> 02:43:07,240
sacred there's something sacred about our quest for knowledge through our bias i mean how we just

1818
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:12,040
discussed the double bind the whole purpose of the double bind is to eliminate or reduce

1819
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:16,520
experiment or bias we see what we want to see so how do we actually see what's really there

1820
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:23,080
and i think that's the beauty the holiness of science and so when tim misrepresented

1821
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:29,560
the scientific findings he had that i thought was a tremendous violation being a cheerleader against

1822
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:34,200
the drug war and for consciousness i think he deserves a lot of credit for that i think where

1823
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:41,160
he's also wrapped up in deserving criticism is that he underestimated the risks and overestimated

1824
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:45,640
the benefits so you take this drug you get enlightened you're smarter than everybody else

1825
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:49,240
and now you're part of this new counterculture and all you have to do is drop the pill

1826
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:55,080
that's wrong people don't always have these good experiences people do get messed up and end up

1827
02:43:55,080 --> 02:44:02,040
worse off so so what i discovered during the good friday experiment follow-up was that there had

1828
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:09,720
been this overhyping of the results and also this hiding of a problem and as it turned out

1829
02:44:09,720 --> 02:44:15,800
houston smith then validated it that it was true that this had really happened and that somebody

1830
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:20,280
did get thorazine and it was really the case even though that one person wouldn't talk to me but

1831
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:25,800
overall my conclusion was that the experiment was essentially validated that people did have mystical

1832
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:31,000
experiences they had subsequent experiences in their lives that were without drugs mystical

1833
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,320
experiences that they then said that made them think that the psilocybin mystical experience was

1834
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:40,040
legitimate it had positive benefits in their lives it had long-term impacts what i find most

1835
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:46,920
interesting having experienced this myself what resonates is this notion that after the fact

1836
02:44:47,480 --> 02:44:54,520
years after the fact in the case of your subjects 25 years after the fact with crystal clarity you

1837
02:44:54,520 --> 02:45:00,920
could remember something from that experience and i don't think i've ever been under the influence

1838
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:09,240
of psilocybin that i can't look back and recall with just the most vivid detail some aspects of

1839
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:16,680
it positive and negative some incredibly positive deeply emotional moving beyond words and also at

1840
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:21,400
times very in different settings or different times within the same experience incredibly

1841
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:25,240
frightening an incredible feeling of despair but with a degree of vividness that i can't remember

1842
02:45:25,320 --> 02:45:31,160
many things so what do you attribute that i don't know i mean i suspect that i don't know enough

1843
02:45:31,160 --> 02:45:36,520
about neuroscience i'm probably the wrong person to ask but i suspect that if you look at parts of

1844
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:42,920
the brain the hippocampus where we imprint memory there must be something about these molecules that

1845
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:48,120
enable during periods of the time because that's the thing it's such a non-linear experience it's

1846
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:52,440
sort of isolating that there must be moments in there where there's an overlap and i'm sort of

1847
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:57,960
putting my hands like a you sort of have to get an alignment of a couple of things one the experience

1848
02:45:57,960 --> 02:46:03,560
itself is profound enough and two so that's like the seed and then the soil itself at that moment

1849
02:46:03,560 --> 02:46:08,280
neurologically is fertile enough to take that seed and that produces this plant which is in the

1850
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:15,720
metaphor is this memory that is never going away and what's also interesting is i can still describe

1851
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:22,520
in some cases the feeling that accompanied that vision or that hallucination and what it connected

1852
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:28,680
me to someone that i cared about or something like that so that to me is a very powerful part of your

1853
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:34,040
follow-up whereas i can completely imagine that if you were getting the placebo i mean i've taken

1854
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:38,840
nyas and i know what it feels like it's miserable actually if you take a high enough dose the flush

1855
02:46:38,840 --> 02:46:45,960
is real i mean there's no denying it but if you asked me to recall a nyas and flush i had two years

1856
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:51,000
ago let alone 20 years ago i'd be hard pressed to remember anything about it so the sensory

1857
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:56,520
experience alone is not enough what i really want to get to now is and it will require backing up

1858
02:46:56,520 --> 02:47:01,880
slightly from historical context is let's talk about what's happening right now with mdma before

1859
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:06,520
we do that let me just explain briefly about the conquered prison experiment oh yes yes yes that's

1860
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:11,800
right that's right this is the second major experiment yeah so what leery recognized was

1861
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:16,840
that the good friday experiment you're basically relying on people to tell you what happened to

1862
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:23,960
them so that's sort of subjective reports he wanted to try to find an objective way to talk

1863
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:29,480
about the benefits of psychedelics and so what he started thinking about was prisoners at the

1864
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:35,240
conquered prison which is not 20 minutes away from here we're not that far from harvard square we're

1865
02:47:35,240 --> 02:47:40,200
doing this four miles from harvard square conquered prison that was nearby and so he thought that

1866
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:45,800
if you could work with prisoners while they're in prison and help them have a pro-social

1867
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:51,880
experience this kind of mystical experience that that might once they were released it might reduce

1868
02:47:51,880 --> 02:47:58,520
their recidivism and he thought that that is an objective measure of benefit if we can show that

1869
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:03,240
people don't go back to prison once they've released and that it's somehow correlated with this

1870
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:07,800
mystical experience with psilocybin that that would be a really good way of communicating to

1871
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:15,320
people so from 61 to 63 he started working with ralph metzner who was his phd student as well

1872
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:21,320
and they started doing a project at conquered prison and they ended up getting permission to

1873
02:48:21,320 --> 02:48:27,880
do psilocybin inside the prison with prisoners and the same situation is that the experimenters

1874
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:33,000
some of them would take the psilocybin as well and then prisoners were released and how many

1875
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:38,200
prisoners over the period of that time were treated about 36 or so and what was the average

1876
02:48:38,200 --> 02:48:44,040
number of treatments per prisoner two and so what what they ended up saying though is that this was

1877
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:49,160
one of the most successful experiments in the history of psychedelics showing benefit was there

1878
02:48:49,160 --> 02:48:55,480
a control group that were interacted with but without an agent no the control group was they

1879
02:48:55,480 --> 02:49:02,040
did a base rate study of everybody that had been released from prison in the year before they did

1880
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:06,120
this and then they tracked them and so they had this base rate study and then they compared

1881
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:11,800
against the base rate so one obvious flaw in this is that the people who are motivated to volunteer

1882
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:17,640
for this experiment might be more likely to want to stay out of prison maybe they're more motivated

1883
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:21,640
to get better so that would be huge and then the other one of course being this this performance

1884
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:27,480
bias which is just the fact that they're getting some positive attention while they're there it's

1885
02:49:27,480 --> 02:49:32,360
funny if you were to redo that experiment you would randomize people you take everybody you

1886
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:38,200
randomize them you're either randomized to the intervention with the psilocybin or the best

1887
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:42,600
example you can come up with of an intervention that is without psilocybin counseling positive

1888
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:46,760
therapy etc etc where you so you're not trying to be blinded to your point you're not going to be

1889
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:52,440
able to blind people but at least you can try to identify that if there is a benefit in the

1890
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:57,240
psilocybin group it's much more likely to be from the psilocybin than it is from selection

1891
02:49:57,240 --> 02:50:02,280
bias or performance bias exactly and so from the fda's point of view once we discussed how

1892
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:09,000
there is no solution to the double blind problem for mdm a they said that there are two other main

1893
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:14,040
ways that we had to incorporate into our protocol design to reduce experimenter bias and one was

1894
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:18,600
random assignment that everybody similarly motivated and then they just happen to get

1895
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:23,080
either your control group or your test group the other is the independent raters and how you

1896
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:27,400
evaluate the outcomes so it can't be done by the experimenters you have to have a whole different

1897
02:50:27,400 --> 02:50:33,800
pool of raters and then how they are structured so that they don't track the people through the

1898
02:50:33,800 --> 02:50:38,200
study they don't know if it's the beginning measurement the baseline or the follow-up and

1899
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:44,360
so what was the difference in recidivism between those two groups well it was substantial and so

1900
02:50:44,360 --> 02:50:50,440
it was terrific positive experiment so after i had done the or so it seemed so after i had done the

1901
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:56,200
good friday experiment follow-up and published it in 91 in the journal of transpersonal psychology

1902
02:50:56,200 --> 02:51:02,120
then there was an op-ed about my study in the boston globe and i got a call shortly after that

1903
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:06,520
from fellow michael forca who worked for the department of corrections and he said do you

1904
02:51:06,520 --> 02:51:10,760
want to do a follow-up to the conquered prison experiment i said i have been interested but

1905
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:15,800
there's no record of who the people were in that study either and he said that they actually had

1906
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:20,680
those records that the department of corrections had a storehouse of information about all their

1907
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:25,720
interesting prisoners malcolm x had been a prisoner they had all these stuff and he said that they had

1908
02:51:25,720 --> 02:51:30,600
a record of who these prisoners were and that i could work with him if we wanted to do a follow-up

1909
02:51:30,600 --> 02:51:35,720
to the conquered prison experiment and i thought god this is fantastic now i can help call attention

1910
02:51:35,720 --> 02:51:40,200
to one of the most important and successful experiments in the history of psychedelic research

1911
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:45,560
and so it took us a whole year to get permission to do this we had to go all the way up to the

1912
02:51:45,560 --> 02:51:49,960
governor's office it was william weald at the time who's now going to be running for president

1913
02:51:49,960 --> 02:51:55,080
trying to knock off trump in the primaries which won't work but it'll be good so william weald so

1914
02:51:55,080 --> 02:52:00,280
we got this piece of paper finally saying that we could go into the criminal justice system records

1915
02:52:00,280 --> 02:52:05,160
and track people's criminal records after they had been released from conquered but somebody had

1916
02:52:05,160 --> 02:52:10,520
written on it no psilocybin so we weren't asking for permission to give psilocybin but they just

1917
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:16,040
wanted to underscore that we could not give psilocybin so i ended up going into the criminal

1918
02:52:16,040 --> 02:52:22,360
justice system records it took quite a while to do this and the more that i looked into it one by one

1919
02:52:22,360 --> 02:52:29,160
and tracked people the more i started realizing that there had been something amiss that it didn't

1920
02:52:29,160 --> 02:52:35,400
look like it was really working the data that i was getting about their arrests were that they

1921
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:41,320
were arrested it didn't seem like there was this benefit that had been reported meaning during the

1922
02:52:41,320 --> 02:52:46,120
period when they were initially reported to have had a benefit you felt that those data were

1923
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:52,840
incorrect or over a longer follow-up period of time both groups converged it was more that there

1924
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:59,640
was some tricks in the way that leery and ralph metzner reported the data and it was also the case

1925
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:04,680
ralph metzner once i published my findings basically it was scientific fraud not by ralph

1926
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:11,160
but more by tim who was still alive at the time wasn't he was and i eventually visited him shortly

1927
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:15,560
before he died i mean i got to know him in a bunch of different ways but i also visited him with two

1928
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:20,520
other prisoners and one who had never gone back to prison and one who had gone back to prison and

1929
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:27,240
we had kind of a reunion that was really nice but i didn't have the courage i guess to ask why he

1930
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:34,040
fudged the data so what it turned out to be is that the longer time had elapsed from when the

1931
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:40,840
experiment took place the more that tim would tell the story of how more successful it was so the

1932
02:53:40,840 --> 02:53:46,120
results kept getting presented in better and better ways the longer it was from the study

1933
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:52,840
but even at the early stage what they had claimed was that their very initial thing was that while

1934
02:53:52,840 --> 02:53:57,880
some people did go back to prison from the psilocybin group that they were monitored more

1935
02:53:57,880 --> 02:54:01,960
carefully than others the normal prisoners and they went there for parole violations

1936
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:08,440
minor things not new crimes but then over time the results just kept being presented better and

1937
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:12,680
better and better and so i had not actually looked at the very early things but i'd looked at all

1938
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:17,400
their other reports so once i started doing the follow-up i looked at everything and i could track

1939
02:54:17,400 --> 02:54:22,520
it and i got back to the base rate study which i'd never looked at and what was surprising to me is

1940
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:28,200
here i am an advocate for psychedelics and this is one of the premier studies in psychedelics

1941
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:34,200
showing benefits but none of the critics had ever actually gone back to the very original documents

1942
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:39,320
the base rate study was published in a journal of criminology an obscure british journal of

1943
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:46,680
criminology which i managed to find and so what it turned out first off is that the base rate

1944
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:54,440
study was done an average of people out for two years the actual research with the prisoners was

1945
02:54:54,440 --> 02:55:00,280
done when people were out an average of 10 months and so what had happened was that obviously the

1946
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:03,480
longer you're out of prison the more likely you are to go back to prison right it's an apples

1947
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:09,400
oranges comparison yeah and so it turned out that the original study actually tracked people over

1948
02:55:09,400 --> 02:55:15,160
time so there was the data for 10 months in the control group the base rate when they were out 10

1949
02:55:15,240 --> 02:55:20,360
months their results were the same as what was reported in the psilocybin group so there was no

1950
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:25,800
difference whatsoever but what i also discovered is that the way in which tim was saying about how

1951
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:29,880
oh yeah people did go back to prison but for parole violations that they were actually

1952
02:55:29,880 --> 02:55:34,600
parole violations because they had committed new crimes for which they were later convicted

1953
02:55:35,880 --> 02:55:40,760
so i figured out how his counting rules permitted him to say things that weren't true

1954
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:48,120
but that might look on the surface to be true and i found the original base rate study so what i

1955
02:55:48,120 --> 02:55:53,960
concluded and what actually happened was that leery got kicked out of harvard in 63 he thought of it

1956
02:55:53,960 --> 02:56:01,160
as the scientific prison and they had started to recognize that just having a spiritual experience

1957
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:06,280
which many of these people did have in prison is not enough that you need support afterwards you

1958
02:56:06,360 --> 02:56:10,760
need to integrate the experience and have support yeah and the same with treatment for addiction

1959
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:15,160
that you need support groups afterwards and so they had actually created this support group for

1960
02:56:15,800 --> 02:56:21,560
the prisoners but then when they got kicked out of harvard that fell apart so my conclusion was

1961
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:28,520
that this experiment scientific fraud it didn't work but that some of the people who did have

1962
02:56:28,520 --> 02:56:34,520
the psilocybin who i was able to contact that was delicate because you're contacting former prisoners

1963
02:56:34,520 --> 02:56:38,120
so i had to make sure that i only spoke to them i didn't speak to their family members so they

1964
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:42,520
might not have spoken about their experiment but but some of them said that the psilocybin was

1965
02:56:42,520 --> 02:56:48,520
really helpful so what i concluded is that this was an experiment that should be repeated with

1966
02:56:48,520 --> 02:56:55,480
the combination of the experience and the support afterwards and that that it showed promise but what

1967
02:56:55,480 --> 02:57:01,240
i really felt also was that this was leery violating something that was sacred which was

1968
02:57:01,240 --> 02:57:08,200
the scientific data and presenting it in a wrong way and so i think in some ways people appreciated

1969
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:12,360
the fact that even though i was an advocate for psychedelics i was willing to report the data

1970
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:18,760
as i found it rather than as i wanted it to be so i think it was good for personally for my

1971
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:25,960
credibility but it was me ending up delegitimizing this crucial experiment that everybody had thought

1972
02:57:25,960 --> 02:57:31,160
was really successful that was my problem so those are the things that i fought leery for and i also

1973
02:57:31,640 --> 02:57:38,840
do fault him for just encouraging people to take psychedelics without sufficient cautions about the

1974
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:44,200
need for people who are not tripping to watch over you about the need to integrate it about how it's

1975
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:50,760
not automatically you learn something new it can be very frightening or terrifying but overall i do

1976
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:56,440
think that leery was a positive and i think that i might not have ever taken lsd if it weren't for

1977
02:57:56,440 --> 02:58:02,200
him and this idea that he was trying to democratize the mystical experience and and i also think i'll

1978
02:58:02,200 --> 02:58:08,920
just say that i had a ketamine experience where i was transported above and behind hitler as he was

1979
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:14,200
giving a one of those rallies this is one of the more profound psychedelic experiences of my life

1980
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:20,760
and i was i think primarily traumatized by the holocaust i've had dreams of holocaust survivors

1981
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:25,160
telling me that i needed to be a psychedelic therapist and that that was they'd survived the

1982
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:28,840
holocaust miraculously and that that was their mission and they didn't know what it was and it

1983
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:33,400
was to tell me to be psychedelic therapist so i think fundamentally what i've been motivated by

1984
02:58:33,400 --> 02:58:38,120
is how do we help people feel the connection so they don't dehumanize and murder others but

1985
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:47,400
there was this way in which that i felt that the problem of leery trying to exaggerate the benefits

1986
02:58:47,400 --> 02:58:54,520
left people unprepared but that the effort to have people to think for themselves and to

1987
02:58:55,240 --> 02:59:00,680
question authority was inherently a good thing but that the justification that he gave himself

1988
02:59:00,680 --> 02:59:06,040
for twisting the science because others were twisting it in the negative way was ultimately

1989
02:59:06,040 --> 02:59:11,720
very harmful rick on behalf of many people who are never going to necessarily know your name

1990
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:15,560
even after you're long gone from this planet people who have already benefited from your

1991
