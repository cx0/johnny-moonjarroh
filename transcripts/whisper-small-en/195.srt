00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:14,520
Sebastian, I have been looking forward to sitting down with you for God,

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,760
it's been 18 months. It was pre-COVID. I know when we first talked about sitting down and then for

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
obvious reasons, things got postponed, but nevertheless, here we are.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,200
It's thrilling to talk to you. We have a lot to talk about in our interview. I mean,

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,720
when I interviewed you, it was really fascinating. I mean, I loved our conversation.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,440
Well, there are a lot of things I'm looking forward to here, but perhaps the most trivial

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,840
of them is getting to listen to you speak. I'm sure you've been told this before,

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,440
but you may have the single greatest voice ever. So just the fact that I'm going to get to sit

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,480
and listen to you talk is fantastic. Where did you grow up, Sebastian?

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,880
I grew up outside of Boston in a little town called Belmont, Massachusetts.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,600
Okay. I want to understand a little bit better about, well, let's start with your dad. Your

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,120
dad's a veteran, correct? No, he's not a veteran. I mean, he was a refugee from two wars.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
Okay.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,640
Yeah. He grew up in Europe. His dad was a journalist in Europe, European-born, as well as

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,380
my dad, and they lived in Spain. And then they left when the fascists came in in 1936 under

17
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:39,200
Franco. They fled. His father was, my dad's dad was Jewish, and they fled to France. And then when

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,760
the Nazis came in a few years later, they fled to the United States. And my dad made his life

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,440
here, met my mom, and tried to join the US military and couldn't because he had asthma.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,920
So he served the country in other ways. He was a physicist, and he contributed to a lot of

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,080
important projects, some of which involved the US military and the US government. But he was

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,720
enormously grateful to this country for our sacrifice in World War II. And, you know, it's

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,280
interesting that his implacable pacifism was also mixed with an understanding that sometimes war,

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,160
sometimes force is necessary to protect humanity from fascism and other evils. So he had a very

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,800
complex sort of understanding of our duties as citizens and our place in the world as America.

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,440
How did he communicate that to you? And how old were you when some of those lessons started to mean

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,880
something more than just kind of the words that were spoken? And did he communicate through direct

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,280
words or was it more, you know, indirect means?

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,160
Well, I mean, yeah, when we were growing up, the word fascist was like a dirty word. I mean, I, you

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,200
know, I grew up knowing that that was the sort of ultimate evil. And America stood diametrically

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,840
opposed to fascism, that we were the opposite of fascism. We were the ultimate anti-fascist state.

32
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:11,120
And, uh, and, you know, I grew up during Vietnam and I grew up in a very liberal environment. And so

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:19,200
every adult I knew, everyone I knew was sort of anti-Vietnam, anti-war and by extension, and not

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,920
fairly, but by extension, sort of anti-US military. I mean, that's just the environment I grew up in,

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,560
right? So, um, I was very surprised and learned a lot when I said to my dad, you know, back then, I

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,920
was born in 1962. So in 1980, I turned 18 and I got a card in the mail from the US government saying,

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,200
you're an 18 year old, 18 year old male. We need to know where you live, physically what your address

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,040
is in case we need to call you into combat. Right? And I said to my father, who I knew was a pacifist,

39
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,680
I was like, what the hell is this? Like the draft is over. What do you mean? My, my government needs

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,280
to know where I am, uh, and not my, doesn't need to know where my sister is, but where I am in case

41
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,320
they need me to fight one of their wars. Right. And, uh, I was like, I'm not signing this. And,

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,320
uh, I expected my father to wholly approve the message. Right. And, uh, you know, my message

43
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,200
that I wasn't going to sign this. And, uh, he said, no, no, no, you're definitely signing it. He's like,

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,960
you know, you don't know, uh, what the next war is going to be. It may be a right to, it may be a

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,800
war that needs to be fought like World War II was. And you don't owe your country nothing. You owe it

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,360
something and you may owe it your life depending on the circumstances. And if a war comes along

47
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400
that you feel is immoral and unnecessary, then it's your duty to protest and go to prison if you need

48
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,760
to, to protest it. But you don't know that yet. And you're going to sign that card because you are

49
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,400
part of this country and it's a magnificent thing to be part of. And that completely turned

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,160
around my thinking about, um, what it means to be an American citizen and a human being and to be

51
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,480
part of a community. Uh, you know, I mean, you know, whatever it's, it's 40, 35 years later,

52
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm still chewing over that one. Yeah. Um, so you weren't really, I mean, yeah, you were probably a

53
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,120
teenager as Vietnam was coming to an end. What were your dad's thoughts on that? I mean, did he,

54
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,240
kind of view that as a different war from World War II? I mean, obviously it was, but, um, how,

55
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,440
how did he kind of vocalize that to you? Oh, totally different war. He says unnecessary. And

56
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,880
you know, the, the, um, the, the, the, the specter of communism taking over the world,

57
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
you know, he didn't believe that that was, you know, the Gulf of Tonkin was, it was the straight

58
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,880
up lie, right? So unlike nine 11 Vietnam started with, with a, a, a straight up lie. And they got

59
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,520
us into a war that everyone knew was sort of unwinnable. And a lot of people thought was,

60
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,720
was not needed. And, uh, which was very, very different from nine 11 and, and, and from World

61
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,040
War II, as far as my dad was concerned. Um, so he, you know, he hated the Vietnam war and, and, uh,

62
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,600
um, was very, um, you know, very, very adamant about it, as was every other adult I knew. I mean,

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,000
it speaks to the community I was in. I could have grown up somewhere else and it would have been the

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,240
opposite, but I didn't. But it is, it does sort of speak to his ability to kind of balance

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,000
simultaneous, uh, seemingly simultaneous contradictory facts, which is that he could

66
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,400
look five years later, right? Vietnam ends in what 74, 75. They're pulling the last troops out. And

67
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,200
in, you know, just five years later, you're getting a card that is effectively, you know,

68
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,920
a draft card. And yet he can immediately pivot and say, well, wait a minute. No, no, no. This

69
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,560
is very important. And I can put Vietnam out of my mind and say, because again, there's a recency

70
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,920
bias that could have easily sounded like, I don't want my son being what, you know, one of the boys

71
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,880
that got, you know, slaughtered there for no reason. Well, he made it clear to me that if it's

72
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,880
an immoral war, my job is to go to prison to protest it. If I need to like to say, absolutely

73
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,080
not, right. You're not going to use me for your immoral, your immoral designs, right? But, you

74
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,800
know, equally strongly, I mean, the Holocaust burned, my dad was half Jewish. I'm a quarter

75
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,520
Jewish, right? I mean, I don't identify in any cultural way with that quarter of me, but,

76
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:27,120
um, you know, the Holocaust seared itself into the minds of humanity, uh, in the 1940s. And

77
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,920
the sacrifice of American soldiers. Now America acted, you know, out of its own interest and

78
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,560
thought process, it didn't join world war two because of the Holocaust. But the fact is that

79
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,600
there are thousands, tens of thousands of American troops buried in France, his home country of France,

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,600
stopping fascism, uh, making sure that fascism did not take over Western Europe and the world. And,

81
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,000
and that's his home country, right? And he's seeing the graves of American soldiers, young men,

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,280
his age, right? I mean, his, his contribution to that was, you know, when they fled Paris

83
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,320
and the Germans had, um, they took Paris, you know, without a fight, it was a negotiated

84
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,720
surrender and they sent advanced units and tank columns deep, deep into France to grab the, the

85
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,680
Spanish border. And, uh, which of course, across the border with Franco, it was a friendly regime

86
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,200
and not friendly fascist regime regime. So my, my, my father and his family fled by car

87
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,000
and they were in Bayon and he, so he was out, he was 18. He's walking down the street

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,880
and he sees a, a German officer on foot in front of a column of tanks and they're creeping down a

89
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,880
boulevard. And the officer turns to him and says, do you know which way it is to the center of town?

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,240
Because they didn't know. They didn't have maps. They didn't know, right? This, and my father, um,

91
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,880
spoke German. I mean, he spoke just about every language in Europe because they lived all over

92
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,440
the place. My father was born in Dresden. He spoke German, you know, the German officer

93
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,040
was speaking bad French. My father spoke back to him in perfect German and, and lied to him and

94
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,760
said, yeah, the center of town's that way and pointed the entire tank column in the office,

95
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,960
opposite direction and off they went. So that was his little act of rebellion, right? And, uh,

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,400
um, his dad said, don't ever be that stupid again. Cause they will kill you. If they, if they,

97
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,320
if he found that out, he would have killed you right there. Right. So, so my father, you know,

98
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,440
that kind of experience doesn't, doesn't leave you. And his, his, um, his, he, you know,

99
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,760
he thought the world, the foremost threat to, to, to freedom and human dignity and the human,

100
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,800
and the human race was fascism in his mind. So Vietnam was a blip in the screen with that,

101
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,200
right? I mean, fascism was it. And, and, you know, I would argue it still is it like that is still

102
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,760
the threat. And we've, this country has gone through a little taste of it. And, uh, you know,

103
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,840
we came out hopefully stronger, but that, you know, that boogeyman has not gone away

104
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,840
in human society. So when did you, uh, decide what you wanted to study in college and what did you

105
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:08,160
study in college? Um, I grew up, my, my dad, you know, was a physicist, but he was very enamored

106
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,000
of history and of anthropology. And I grew up reading anthropology, anthropological works.

107
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,240
I was very interested in the native, native American society societies. And, um, uh,

108
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
I was also a really good long distance runner in high school and college. I ran a four 12 for

109
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,200
the mile and went on to run two 21 marathon. So I had some, you know, not, not world class,

110
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,560
obviously not even close, but I was like a pretty good runner. And I found out, uh, in college that

111
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,280
the Navajo were really good long distance runners. And you know, when I was in college, I wasn't in

112
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,280
college to get a career. I was in college to learn stuff that interested me, which was anthropology,

113
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,880
right? And a number of other things. And, uh, and so I majored in anthropology and I decided to do

114
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,240
field work on the Navajo reservation. And I went out there, uh, in 1983, I think it was, and spent

115
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,120
a summer on the reservation training with their best guys. And I wrote a thesis on Navajo long

116
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,280
distance runners. And that was the first time, like I researched something and then wrote about it,

117
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,600
you know, basically the work of journalism. So when I got out of college, I did construction

118
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,920
for a little while, trying to figure out what I was going to do. And I was on a, I was sponsored by,

119
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,040
um, etonic running shoes. I was running local road races. I was a sponsored athlete at sort of like

120
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,920
regional level and, uh, trying to figure out what am I going to do with my life? Oh, maybe I'll be a

121
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,480
journalist. Like that's pretty close to what my thesis was. And I, when I was writing my thesis,

122
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,960
I was just on fire and I just loved it. I was a very middling student and the thesis, I was,

123
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,600
I got honors and I just, I was like, Oh, I'm going to be a journalist. I was a long tortuous path to

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,680
get there. But that was my sort of naive decision when I was 21 or whatever. Now, I remember

125
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,960
hearing you in an interview years ago, I don't remember which interview it was,

126
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,720
but you talked about a job you had felling trees. You were, you were kind of in a, in a, in a logging

127
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,760
job. Where was that? And how old were you? Was that post-college as well? You know, it wasn't,

128
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,280
yeah, yeah, I was post-college. Uh, that was, I was in my late twenties. So, you know,

129
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,920
like fast forward some years out of college, I still haven't figured it out, right? I'm still not

130
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,880
trying to be a writer, trying to be a journalist. Basically, I don't have a clue. And, uh, but I'm

131
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,360
reading a lot, a lot of good writers, Peter Matheson, Joan Didion, Ernest Hemingway, a lot

132
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,120
of great writers. And I'm writing and writing and writing and getting occasional things published,

133
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,520
but I'm turning into a better writer, but I couldn't make a living. And I was sick of waiting

134
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,240
tables and I got a job as a climber for tree companies. And so it wasn't logging, it was

135
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
residential tree work, right? And you need climbers. You need, if you don't have a crane,

136
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,640
you need a guy up in the tree on a rope with a chainsaw. You know, I was a pretty athletic young

137
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,400
man and I took to it very, very quickly and I was good at it. And, you know, basically you're

138
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,080
swinging around on a rope with a pair of climbing irons, you know, strapped to your legs and to your

139
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,320
feet and, uh, with a chainsaw. And you have to, you know, I was taking down these big, big trees,

140
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,560
some of them, you know, a hundred, you know, white pines, a hundred feet high, topping them out and

141
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,000
taking them down in a fall in a small space. Like I can take a tree down in a space that's the size

142
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,160
of the like footprint of the tree, right? Like, I mean, the size that the tree is viewed from above,

143
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,520
I can take a tree down in that space with ropes and a chainsaw and a climbing saddle. And by the

144
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,640
way, I just want to point out how familiar I am with this because of my middle child who's

145
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,080
just turned seven, but he's obsessed with this process. And there's this series on YouTube called

146
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,160
Pine Tree Removal, part one, Pine Tree Removal, part two, and Pine Tree Removal, part three. Each

147
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,600
of these videos is about two hours long. So it's taken together. It's a six hour series exactly as

148
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,520
you're describing it, which is 120 foot pine tree in a subdivision between two houses that are 30

149
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,520
feet apart and it has to come down. And the six hour video is how long it takes to take,

150
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,320
bring the tree down minus any spaces. So it edits out, you know, the pauses and the lunch breaks and

151
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,640
the bathroom breaks. But basically there were three major sections that have to come down. So

152
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,520
they go to the top, they trim all the branches, cut the first part, it comes down, they just keep

153
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,680
doing this. Well, I think my son has seen the entirety of that 30, maybe 40 times. So by

154
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:28,160
extension, I've seen it like three times. He knows every move, meaning wherever you are, he'll tell

155
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,400
you, okay, that guy, he's going to take his chainsaw and he's going to cut this thing at that angle.

156
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,000
And then once he gets that branch down, he's going to wrap around this thing and then he's going to

157
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,960
cut this thing at this angle. And then they're going to do, and I mean, it is, it is his obsession.

158
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:50,800
When he turned five, he wanted a chainsaw for his birthday and he was so upset that he didn't get it.

159
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,880
And I tried to explain to him like, dude, like you'll kill yourself with this thing. And he's

160
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,120
like, I will not. Like I know how to use this thing. I mean, he was convinced he knew how to

161
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,800
use it because he'd watched so much pine tree removal. So you would literally be his hero.

162
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,840
That's awesome. Well, listen, I have a buddy who runs a tree company and he had, and he had a,

163
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
as a girl, as a teenager now, but she, you know, when she was young,

164
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,160
yes, seven, eight years old, whatever, he got her, he set her up on a climbing rig and, you know,

165
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,200
a little harness and he set the ropes up the way climbers use. And she learned how to like work her

166
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,240
way up, you know, a rope and repel back down. And it was all, you know, six feet off the ground. It

167
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,840
was all, you know, safe. And you can, so you might, if you, if you could find someone arborist in your

168
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,920
town to come show, you know, rig that up for you. Your son would love you forever,

169
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
which I'm sure he will anyway, but he'll love you even twice, twice as much forever.

170
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,440
Well, the compromise is we got him a gombo, you know, one of those big saws when he was five.

171
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,840
And at first I wouldn't let him touch it without me being right there. And then I figured out,

172
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,680
okay, he'd actually knows how to use this thing without killing himself. And now he's out there

173
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,760
running around in the woods with a saw that's almost as long as him just trimming every dead

174
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,600
branch. And when people come over and see it, they think we are the worst parents in the world.

175
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,680
Because like who would let a kid that little user saw that big, but I mean, I think, you know,

176
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,920
they get a healthy respect for it. I think he will be using a chainsaw before the age of 16,

177
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,640
which was when I told him he could have one. That's awesome. That's awesome. Well, one thing

178
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,800
to say about that work. I mean, I'm scared of heights. And I had to kind of control that fear

179
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,200
to work that high up in the air. Was that part of the appeal? Like, was that were you doing this to

180
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,800
overcome that fear? Or was that? No, no, no, no. I was doing it because I could make 500,000 bucks

181
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,040
a day back in the early 90s. Wow. And yeah, you know, if I contracted my own job and did the climbing

182
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,600
and you know, I could make pretty big money so I could work a couple of times a week. And then

183
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,440
the rest of the time I could, I could train, I could write, I could do whatever I wanted. So

184
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,760
for, you know, for a young man, it was a perfect job for me. And so I, you know, I,

185
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,600
I wouldn't say I'm without my anxieties and fears, but I have a fairly high risk tolerance.

186
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,000
And what I figured out about Tree Work was that there are no accidents. It's like there are no

187
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,800
accidents in the game of chess. Like you play poker and you might just draw the wrong card.

188
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,720
Right. There are no accidents in chess. If you lose a chess game, it's because you lost

189
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,600
the chess game because you made worse moves than the other guy. Right. Same thing with Tree Work.

190
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,520
So there's no chance and there's complete information at all times.

191
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,080
That's right. That's right. If you get hurt or killed doing Tree Work, it's because you,

192
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,760
you screwed up, right? You're dealing with the laws of physics. They're immutable. Right. And if

193
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,160
you do a front cut wrong and you top out a tree wrong and it comes back on you, it's because you

194
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,040
did it wrong. Right. And you didn't take into account the wind direction. And if you, whatever,

195
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,360
I mean, there's every, there are no variables that are outside of your control. Your, your own

196
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,640
stupidity is the, or carelessness is the only thing outside of your control and you can control

197
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,360
that. And so when I figured that out, I'm like, all right, I'm just going to make sure I don't

198
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,480
screw up. I screwed up once and I hit my leg with the chainsaw and tore it up and, you know,

199
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,600
it took a while to recover from that. But that was, that was the injury I needed. And after that,

200
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,160
I'm, you know, I actually wouldn't be that scared up there because I knew, although it was sometimes

201
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,440
terrifying to look down, I knew that I was way safer than I was in a car, ironically,

202
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,760
as long as I didn't make a mistake. And that kind of agency, having that kind of agency over

203
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,840
an outcome, unlike driving, unlike combat, unlike a lot of things, that kind of agency was

204
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,600
very exciting to have. It made, gave me a kind of Zen focus, like in the moment, like you are here

205
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,920
right now, do not blow this. And that, that kind of practice was, you know, extremely good for me.

206
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,240
So talk to me a little bit about this process of becoming a better writer. I mean,

207
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,160
it fascinates me to no end because I enjoy writing, but I'm obviously not very good at it yet, but I'm

208
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,520
getting better, right? Like I'm better today than I was 10 years ago. And, but when I look at people

209
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,160
who do this for a living, I'm very interested in what the reps look like, what the feedback

210
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,280
process looks like. Is it something that can be done in isolation or is it something that requires

211
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:33,200
an editor or someone who can really sharpen your sword? I mean, it depends. I mean, there are some

212
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:41,520
writers, some very good writers who basically dump out an incredibly rough first draft. And they just,

213
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,560
in their description, sort of vomited out, right? And some, there aren't, sentences aren't even

214
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,360
complete. There are sections like put this stuff in, you know, put the, you know, whatever, the

215
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,080
sailboat stuff in here, and then they move up, whatever. And it's, it's a very sloppy, fast,

216
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,080
sort of intuitive brain dump. And they can do that for 500 pages. And then they go back. That is not

217
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,640
me. And people like that often make really good use of an editor who can work through that and

218
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,720
kind of see how to begin to shape it. I don't do that, right? I write, I'm sort of like a road paver,

219
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,000
right? I mean, I go two miles an hour and I leave behind like pretty much finished roadway.

220
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,720
Not that editors don't weigh in at the sort of sentence level, like slight, this is slightly

221
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,320
confusing or, you know, maybe you want to say more about this because I don't quite understand what

222
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,720
you're referring to here. Other people might, you know, whatever. But I, I, there's very, I, I get

223
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,400
very little editing from my editors and it's because I'm so obsessive about writing and I go

224
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,360
over it and over it and over it. And I write very carefully. And the stuff that I write is

225
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:53,200
definitely flawed, but not that flawed. And, and I, and I have this feeling like for me,

226
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,280
the good writing is a matter of like efficiency, like being efficient with your words, like not

227
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,560
quite the minimum possible, so the, the minimum possible words, but something close to that. And

228
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,320
fat creeps into your prose very, very easily. Right. And you can really pare it down.

229
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,800
It's about efficiency and it's about rhythm. The sentences need rhythm. And then it's about saying

230
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,880
things in a way that people have never read before. I mean, no one ever needs to, again, to hear

231
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,680
someone say the rain drummed on the roof. Like if you're going to say the rain drummed on the roof,

232
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,120
then just forget about the damn rain and move on to the next interesting thing. No one ever needs

233
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,840
to read a sentence they've read before in someone else's writing. And if you really apply that

234
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,800
harshly, you will get rid of a lot of what you wrote. I mean, it's amazing how much is slightly

235
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,200
formulaic and you're repeating stuff. Mortars are always slamming into hillsides and blah, blah,

236
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,800
blah. You know, it's just like get rid of that stuff. And so rhythm, efficiency, and originality.

237
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,400
And if you do that, it's going to be pretty good writing.

238
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,480
Now, do you think journalism and storytelling are similar styles? Because you tend to do both of

239
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,960
these well, right? I mean, there's so much of your work is really telling amazing stories.

240
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,920
It's historical, it's anecdotal. And then some of it, of course, is much more what we would think

241
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,440
of as journalism, reporting on kind of what is happening and trying to provide context around it.

242
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,000
Do you think that, I mean, first of all, I don't think a lot of people do that. Some people do,

243
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,160
but that's not the normal way to do things. Does this style lend itself equally to both of those

244
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:50,480
disciplines? Well, I mean, you know, I write long-form journalism or long-form nonfiction.

245
00:22:50,480 --> 00:23:00,080
And so, first of all, there is no nonfiction category that is liberated from the rules of

246
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,720
journalism in terms of quote attribution and, you know, making stuff up or whatever. Like, you know,

247
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,040
you can't say, oh, well, it's creative nonfiction. So I can, you know, maybe slide by with a little

248
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,560
bit of creative, like, no, you can't. Like, it's either true or it's not true. And you can't blend

249
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,280
them because then suddenly everything's going to be suspect. Right? So there's some great books that

250
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,160
have, I mean, in Cold Blood, Truman Capote's absolute masterpiece. It's a masterful book,

251
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,440
right? But by his own admission, he like wove in some stuff that he did not, that was not the

252
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,360
result of his research. Like he richly imagined some scenes. No problem, right? I mean, that's,

253
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,920
I mean, it's a masterwork, but it's important to understand that that actually is not

254
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,880
nonfiction and it's not journalism. And so, but just to go on to say that there's a whole

255
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,520
food chain of journalism. So, you know, you get a Reuters or AP report, you know, that's written

256
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:00,000
in minutes or maybe an hour. It basically doesn't have a style. It doesn't have a literary style,

257
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,080
right? There's a lead paragraph and the follow-up and that, you know, whatever. I mean, there's a

258
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,640
whole formula to how to construct something that's packed with information and completely

259
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,280
charmless in a literary sense, totally charmless, but you don't want charming writing when you're

260
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,840
reading about, you know, how Harari fell to the rebels, right? I mean, whatever. You just want

261
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,520
the information. Then there's more long-form journalism where you, you can even use the first

262
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,080
person if you want. I think sparingly, but you're allowed to use the first person. You're allowed to

263
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:38,000
be a little bit more scene setting. You can use some novelistic techniques with content, which is

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,320
completely true and real, right? But the novelistic techniques might be taking a break at a sort of

265
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,400
like a compelling moment right before the rebels attack the city, right? You take a break and then

266
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,040
you do a thousand words of backstory about the history of Zimbabwe or whatever. And then you,

267
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,840
you know, resume where the action stopped. Like those are all novelistic techniques that are great

268
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,040
for getting people to read nonfiction. It's just that you're making use of factual material, not

269
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:13,680
invented material. And so I'm a long-form nonfiction writer and that extends, you know, for me,

270
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,840
a book is long-form nonfiction. It's just very long-form. So my books, some of my books you can

271
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,480
read in a couple of hours. Some of my books you can read a couple of days, but basically it's all

272
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:35,360
the same rules and creative tools of getting people to read good narrative journalism.

273
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,600
So let's fast forward. We're into the late eighties, right? So you've had your, you know, leg injury.

274
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,040
By the way, if I recall, it was an Achilles tendon injury, correct? Well, yeah. I mean,

275
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,440
I was up in a tree. It was an Elm tree in welcome, Massachusetts. It wasn't even that high.

276
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,640
And I was in a hurry. I hadn't worn my boots that day because I wasn't going to be wearing climbing

277
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:06,320
irons. And so I just had sneakers on and I was cutting something below me quickly, one-handed,

278
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,600
with a little climbing saw. And the tip of the saw hit the tree and it popped into the back of my

279
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,280
leg. And it tore open right across the Achilles tendon. It tore open my leg. So I turned the saw

280
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,080
off. It didn't hurt at all. I was like, some hit my leg. There's nothing else moving down there,

281
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,200
but the saw, I better check. I just make sure I'm not cut, right? Turn the saw off, clipped it on,

282
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,320
looked. And of course, my leg was hanging open. And so I pulled my leg up as close as I could to

283
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,920
see if the Achilles was intact or not. I was very concerned about the Achilles. Now keep in mind,

284
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,160
had it been someone else's leg, I mean, I'm not a doctor. I'm not a medic, right? I wouldn't have

285
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,320
looked inside their chainsaw wound to see if the Achilles was intact, but you're immediately in

286
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,840
shock. You know, there's this sort of psychological remove when you're hurt. And I had no problem

287
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,520
pulling the cut open and looking for my Achilles. I had no problem at all. And it seemed to be there.

288
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,240
It was about the thickness of a number two pencil and was sort of a whitish color. And I was like,

289
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,200
I don't know, that looks like the Achilles looks like he's still there. So I repelled that at the

290
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,680
bottom of the tree and my crew, you know, helped me, you know, helped me to the car and drove me to

291
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,280
the hospital. I was going to ask you, I didn't know if you'd injured it or not. And as a runner,

292
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,680
that's a big deal. Yeah, yeah, it was intact. I did rupture my Achilles in combat when I was in my

293
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,240
mid 40s. When I was in the Korogol Valley in eastern Afghanistan, we were moving up a hillside

294
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,920
under a big load and and I felt something slap into the back of my leg. And there was a lot of,

295
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,720
you know, long distance sniper activity, you know, like you don't necessarily hear the bullet that

296
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,160
hits you. I was like, oh, no, I got shot. I got shot in the back of the leg. Damn it. And

297
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,080
I pulled the pant leg up and there was no blood. I had no idea what had happened to me,

298
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,840
but it was a partial rupture of my Achilles. And I sort of lived on it for a few days.

299
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,120
And then it kind of healed back together a bit. And I was able to continue my embed,

300
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,760
which was about another month or so. I baby did a little bit, but I scraped by and I got physical

301
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,200
therapy eventually and healed it. So but that was apparently the malaria medication that they were

302
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,280
giving soldiers. Larium Mefloquin, I think is the medical name. It makes people prone to Achilles

303
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,240
tendon ruptures. Who knew? And we were all on, we were all in there. And Floroquine loans,

304
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,400
which are a class of antibiotics, Cipro Floxacin being the one that probably most people are

305
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:38,000
familiar with as a similar effect as does aging. Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about what,

306
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,000
you know, led you to that, right? So when was the moment when you realized

307
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,120
that, you know, being a journalist was one thing, but being a journalist who went into the,

308
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,160
the theater of combat was another and that was the place you wanted to go.

309
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah. So I was living in Gloucester, Massachusetts and that storm that I wrote about in the perfect

310
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,720
storm hit that town in 1991. I was still limping around from my chainsaw injury and I was living

311
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,760
with my girlfriend and I'd never lived with a woman before. And the relationship ended and,

312
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,160
you know, ended pretty painfully. And, and it's just, you know, maybe some sort of weird male

313
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,600
reflex or some react male reaction to heartbreak. I was like, all right,

314
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,680
I'll show her, I'm going to go to a war. Like it was just some bizarre, like, because there was a

315
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,680
civil war in Bosnia, right? And I was like, all right, we're broken up. I'm going to go to a war

316
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,640
zone and be learned to be a war reporter. And I was looking for a big life change. I was looking

317
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,000
for something sort of that felt meaningful and exciting. And that would challenge me to, in my

318
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,960
mind, sort of like complete the, the maturation process. I didn't still didn't quite feel like I

319
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,040
was really a man. Like I was really mature. I was like, surely an ordeal like war will put you over

320
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,640
the threshold into adulthood and into manhood. And so off I went. So every other free, I mean, like

321
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,960
80% of the other freelance male freelancers over there had all been dumped by their girlfriend.

322
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,600
Like it seemed to be a sort of common reaction for some reason. And so I started freelance war

323
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,480
reporting over there as a radio correspondent and I mean freelance. And then I wrote my book,

324
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,600
The Perfect Storm. And the day, two days after I turned it in, I took a flight to Delhi and then on

325
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,680
into a Peshawar and on into Afghanistan. It was 1996 and there was a war in Afghanistan, a civil

326
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,960
war in Afghanistan after the Soviets pulled out. And I was there as the Taliban were taking over

327
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,400
in the summer of 1996. And that was my first like official war assignment for a New York,

328
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,760
a magazine in New York city. And I, you know, it just was the most meaningful and

329
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,800
incredible work I'd ever even imagined. And so I kept doing it.

330
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,800
What did your dad think when you told him you were going to do this? Was he

331
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,960
fully supportive, partially supportive, ambivalent?

332
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,960
I, you know, my dad, he was, I think he was proud of me. I think he was also sort of worried.

333
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,080
My mom, my mom, I mean, maybe in a kind of classic way, she was like,

334
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,120
why are you doing this to me? Like she thought my war reporting was directed at her, right?

335
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,840
Like to make her upset. I'm like, mom, I'm not doing it to you. I'm just doing it. My father

336
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,160
didn't take it that way. I think he was kind of proud and worried, but also war had completely

337
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,480
shaped his, his life and his family's life in Europe. And, and I said, look, I'm, war is this,

338
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,880
it's a part of human society. It's a part of history. Like I want to understand what it,

339
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,200
what it is, what it's like, how it works, how I'm going to react in that environment. And,

340
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,680
I didn't find all of that out in Bosnia, but it was the beginning of a process.

341
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,200
Tell me more about Afghanistan. What was that? What was that like? And did you view,

342
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,720
maybe give people a bit of a reminder about who the Taliban were at the time, what the Northern

343
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,560
Alliance was, where the Mujahideen, what they ultimately became, maybe give people a little bit

344
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,560
of the refresher about what happened when the Soviets pulled out. And what was it about 1990

345
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:20,480
when they pulled out? Yeah, the, the Soviets pulled out in late 1989 after 10 years. Their,

346
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,120
their sort of proxy government collapsed after a couple of years and it sort of lapsed into

347
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,600
civil war that was brought to a stop by the Taliban takeover in, in 1996. The Taliban were a,

348
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:39,200
a rigid religiously inspired political movement. That was basically the sort of

349
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:47,280
brainchild of the ISI, the Pakistani secret service. It was their way of controlling

350
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,480
Afghanistan and turning in it, giving, giving Pakistan what they called strategic depth in

351
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,800
their fight with India. So basically if they controlled Afghanistan, they would always have

352
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,960
a fallback position in case India invaded them, which was a threat, which was a possibility,

353
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,480
invaded them. They always had a fallback position to fight from. And, but the Taliban were, you know,

354
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,960
I mean, we all know, right? They had Sharia law. It was incredibly harsh. They were stoning

355
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,000
adulterers and not, not letting women go out of the house without a male escort and all kinds of

356
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,600
ghastly policies that, you know, frankly, we see in other allies like Saudi Arabia and doesn't seem

357
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,880
to bother anyone particularly. It's ghastly wherever it is, whether it's a U S ally or not,

358
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:41,520
it's all despicable. And I, I eventually wound up in 2000 with the last quadrant of the country

359
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,000
that had not been taken over by the Taliban was being defended by Ahmad Shah Masood,

360
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,400
a legendary guerrilla fighter against the Soviets. And he had organized the Tajiks. He

361
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:00,000
was ethnic Tajiq. He'd organized the Tajiq and some other allied demographics to hold off the

362
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,040
Taliban in this one quadrant of, of Afghanistan in the Northeast. And so I was with Masood

363
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,760
in the fall of 2000 as, as he fought the Taliban. And this was like, this was big stuff. I mean,

364
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,240
these were tank battles. These were masked infantry assaults into entrenched positions

365
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,360
on ridge tops. You know, it was like very, very intense war and extremely traumatic. And to me,

366
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,680
at least, and I came back very affected by it psychologically and not even knowing I had PTSD

367
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,560
because that term was not being used yet. I just thought I was kind of going crazy,

368
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,600
but I got back to New York after those two months and I was pretty nuts. And I couldn't

369
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,880
take the subway. I couldn't be in a small crowded space. I freaked out and I skig on the law. I mean,

370
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,080
I just had reactions to things I never associated with the combat, but it was clearly a byproduct

371
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:59,840
of the, what I, what I experienced. And I got very angry. I had a short, short fuse. I cried a lot,

372
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,720
you know, all the classic symptoms. I just didn't recognize them. And at any rate,

373
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,200
Masood was killed two days before 9 11. Yeah. This is, which is, I mean, the details of his death

374
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,800
are, it's just hard to believe he kind of fell for that trick. I mean, were you surprised? It

375
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:23,200
just seems like such a, such a ploy that was so transparent in a way, but maybe that's only true

376
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,320
in hindsight, I guess. Yeah. I mean, he relied on other people to keep him safe and people can get

377
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,800
paid off and whatever. I mean, you know, I don't know the details of that, but yes, it was a,

378
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,760
it was a movie camera filled with explosives. And there were two Al Qaeda suicide bombers that

379
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,960
were posing as journalists. And they asked to interview him and they blew themselves up. One

380
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,480
actually survived the blast and tried to run away. And he was gunned down. There was another young

381
00:35:50,480 --> 00:36:01,520
man who was a translator who was in the room. Very, very brave young man who worked in a film office

382
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:09,920
that Masood set up to document his efforts against the Taliban and against Al Qaeda. And in my father,

383
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:18,560
as my father would have put it against fascism and the Taliban caught him last week in the

384
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,040
Panchur Valley north of Afghanistan, north of Kabul and executed him for his work with Masood.

385
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,280
There were four men in that office 20 years later. 20 years later, there were four men in that film

386
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,400
office working for Masood documenting the war against the Taliban. And they caught Fahim

387
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,920
Dasti and executed him just a week ago. Tragic, very, very brave, very, very brave man. So at any

388
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:54,080
rate, after he was executed, after Masood was killed, two days later, 9-11 happens, clearly

389
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:00,880
part of the same strategic thinking by Al Qaeda. And as soon as I could, I rushed back to Afghanistan

390
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,440
through Dushanbe in Tajikistan and joined the commanders I've been with the year before. And I

391
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,120
was sleeping in my clothes on a front line for a month straight until the American bombers had

392
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,400
done their work. And then the Northern Alliance, I never saw an American soldier. There were a few

393
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,400
SF guys, special forces guys out there, but it was all Northern Alliance foot soldiers. They

394
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,000
broke through the Taliban front lines on November 13th, I think it was 2001. And we followed them

395
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:34,960
in the back of a pickup truck. And we walked into Kabul the following morning, passed a pile of

396
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:44,000
dead bodies. And I walked into Kabul. And the jubilation by the populace that had been liberated

397
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,280
from the Taliban was indescribable. When people found out I was American, they would come up and

398
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,240
hug me for what our country did to liberate them from the Taliban. It was an extraordinary moment

399
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,320
for me as a person. But we were so filthy, we smelled so bad after our month sleeping in the

400
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,440
front lines that we tried to get a taxi. There's taxis and whatever in Kabul. And we tried to get

401
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,800
a taxi and the driver would not take us. He said, you guys smell too awful for my taxi. I think we

402
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,840
walked across Kabul and found a place like a hotel where we could stay in this sort of chaotic first

403
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:33,280
moments of liberation. I want to go back a little bit to kind of the precursor or really what caused

404
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:43,360
this first bout of PTSD. Because again, I'm still kind of, I've seen your documentaries. So I kind

405
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,720
of have a sense of what this is like, but I'm assuming there are some people listening to this

406
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:54,320
who haven't. But when you're reporting in a war, it's very different than if say,

407
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:03,040
you're a Wall Street reporter and your job is to cover this sector, this banking sector, or

408
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:12,240
you're covering this beat on sports. There's a distance between you and your subjects in most

409
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,000
other forms of reporting that I think can't really exist in the war if for no other reason

410
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,120
than you are literally physically with your subjects. So let's just put the danger aside

411
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,440
for a moment. The fact that you're kind of embedded with your subject matter,

412
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,680
am I missing an example? Is there another example of where that's also common in journalism?

413
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,760
Well, let me just say that you can have an emotional connection to anybody.

414
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,480
I think this is physical though, right? Like you're cohabitated with, you're dependent on,

415
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,200
let's even be more specific, right? You presumably are, they're helping you,

416
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,760
they're keeping you safe, right? Well, there's two issues. One is emotional connection,

417
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,800
which you can have with anybody, frontline nurses or cops or sanitation workers or teachers or

418
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,280
whatever. You can emotionally connect to people and be affected by their emotional reality because

419
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,640
you're starting to share it and invest in them and become empathic to them, sensitized to their

420
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:27,360
issues. And it's a very powerful experience, right? In addition, in a war, if you're anywhere near

421
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:35,520
the frontline, you're exposed to risk and you're exposed to, not that you aren't in other places,

422
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,240
but you're exposed to human suffering, right? And human suffering is incredibly traumatic to behold,

423
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,760
right? And particularly if you yourself feel removed from it. So one of the most, one of the

424
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,520
hardest things that ever happened to me psychologically was I was in Liberia during the

425
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:03,280
Civil War and a mortar round landed in a crowded field of refugees who had fled the fighting and

426
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,880
crammed into Monrovia. And I was sort of in hiding, the government thought I was a spy.

427
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,160
Liberian government accused me of being a spy and I was sort of in hiding. So I was having my own

428
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,320
terrifying thing go on, right? Because I thought they might torture or kill me if they caught me.

429
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:30,560
So I was having my own issues. But in addition, this field full of people, men, women, children,

430
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:40,640
I mean, a mortar landed right in the middle of them and killed 27 people, a lot of them children,

431
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,160
right? And they brought the bodies and piled them in front of them. And I was out when the mortar

432
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,200
hit. I was out. I mean, I hit the ground. I was very, very, very close. And I hit the ground,

433
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:59,200
right? I mean, it was a bad situation. And some time later, they piled the bodies up in front of

434
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,320
the US Embassy as a protest that America was not invading. They wanted America to invade Liberia

435
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,160
and stop the war, right? That was what the civilians wanted, right? And they piled these bodies

436
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,680
up in front of the embassy. And I had to walk past, I walked past them on my way into the embassy

437
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,280
because I was trying to get evacuated because I was in so much danger. And I stopped. And my

438
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,640
mind just went blank. And there was children, there was, you know, I mean, it's hard even now

439
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,400
for me to talk about it. And it was almost 20 years ago. And I went into shock. I didn't know

440
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:41,760
what to do. And I started counting them. And I thought, someone needs to know what this number is.

441
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:50,240
It was 27. So later, the trauma to me was that I'd had no emotional reaction to such a horror.

442
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,360
I mean, I was completely in shock and I had no, it was a completely abstract thing, right? I had to,

443
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,320
it was a psychological defense. And that psychological defense finally broke down a week

444
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,960
or two later when I finally got out to Paris and got to safety. And I was sitting in a cafe,

445
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,600
waiting for my girlfriends who was joining me in Paris. I had a couple of days to kill

446
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:19,040
I was sitting in a cafe, smoking a cigarette. And I saw some two men carrying a mattress across

447
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,320
the street and it sort of sagged in exactly the same way that a body does. And I just went into

448
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,280
a full blown panic attack. Cause I knew I was looking at a mattress. My body react, my, my,

449
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,120
the rest of my mind reacted to body, dead body. I'm in a war zone. I completely panicked.

450
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,840
And you know, I still have trouble talking about that without crying. I mean, I still have to even

451
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:47,680
now sort of choke back the sort of emotions. And that was almost 20 years ago. So human suffering.

452
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,440
And that was what happened when I came back from Afghanistan. I saw an enormous amount of human

453
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,760
suffering and of a, of a particularly bloody gruesome, visually bloody and gruesome sort.

454
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,480
And I came back altered. And I also, you know, we got shelled very, very badly by the Taliban.

455
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,960
You know, there was nothing we can do about it. We just basically got spanked by Katusha rockets

456
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,280
for an hour. I mean, it killed our horse, our pack horse got killed because the horse couldn't

457
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,360
get down like we were. We survived that, but you know, all that was enormously traumatizing. And,

458
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,360
and now the danger stuff that I've been through is easy to process. There's no problem.

459
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,880
It's the suffering. It's the dismemberment that you see, particularly with children that you see

460
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,840
that you never goes away. And, and I still have to be careful talking about it because I will get

461
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,480
choked up. And then, you know, that is a process that I can't stop once it starts.

462
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:44,720
Did you ever read the book? One, I think it's called One Bullet Away by Nate Fick, Nathan Fick.

463
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,200
No, I've heard of it. I haven't read it.

464
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,040
Yeah. It's a great book. He was a Marine. And he wrote about his, his, his tours in,

465
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,560
I believe it was mostly Iraq. I can't recall if he was also in Afghanistan.

466
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:06,640
But one of the things that I remember being very keen to as, as kind of a subtext of this was,

467
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,040
we focus a lot on mortality in, in, in combat, you know, the number of people who have died.

468
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,360
But there are lots of people who don't die who are forever scarred. And I mean, physically,

469
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,400
let's, emotional is, that's, we have a lot of attention being paid to that fortunately.

470
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,800
But, you know, I thought back to my experiences in, in, in surgical training,

471
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,880
which was at a really, really busy trauma center in Baltimore. So you're, you're really, you're,

472
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,680
you know, arguably one of the most violent cities in, in, in the United States. And lots of patients

473
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,040
died, right? So sometimes they would arrive dead. They were, you know, when the paramedics got to

474
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,720
them, they were alive. By the time we got to the hospital, they were dead. Others would arrive

475
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,040
alive, but never made it out of the trauma bay, or they would die in the operating room,

476
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,920
or they would die a few days later as a complication of too much blood loss or sepsis or something like

477
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,800
that. But there were a lot of people who didn't die who did leave the hospital, but their lives

478
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,800
would never be the same again, right? They, you know, trans pelvic gunshot wound, which is normally

479
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,440
fatal, by the way, a trans pelvic gunshot wound is almost a universally fatal injury because of

480
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,200
the vascular, the vasculature in there and how difficult it is to get that bleeding under control.

481
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,200
So sometimes the best victory you can have in that type of a gunshot wound is to sacrifice a limb,

482
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,720
you know, you'll, you'll, you'll have to ligate the femoral artery and vein,

483
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,960
which means you'll lose that leg, but you'll save the life. And you think, well,

484
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:45,680
that person's not the same. And I just remember reading Nate's book and thinking,

485
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:53,200
how many of these Marines lived? But we kind of forget their story of how injured they are going

486
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,200
forward. It's almost like that's what you're talking about, right? It's like, it's that suffering in

487
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:06,720
these other folks who then live and they're, they are to themselves and others, a reminder of this

488
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,920
trauma. And again, that's just the physical side of it. The psychological piece, again, I could be

489
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:23,280
potentially worse. I'm not sure. Yeah. You know, there's a very moving command at some military

490
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:33,600
events with older veterans. And, and the command is, you know, to stand, to stand for the, for the

491
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:39,360
flag or whatever it may be. And the command is stand as you are able, acknowledging that some

492
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,040
people would like to be able to stand in camps and shouldn't, shouldn't feel ashamed of their,

493
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:52,000
of their inability to stand, stand as you are able. Very, very dignified, moving acknowledgement of the

494
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:02,400
cost of war. Between Bosnia and when you're trying to get evacuated from the American embassy is

495
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:10,240
probably a dozen years. Were you during that period of time aware of what was PTSD in you,

496
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,720
or were you still sitting there in that cafe in Paris, unclear as to why you were having this

497
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:21,120
reaction? Oh, God, I had no idea at what, why I was having that reaction. It was exactly 10 years,

498
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:28,480
93 in Bosnia, 2003, Liberia. I'd been in a bunch of wars in between, you know, in between those,

499
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,200
but no, I had no idea. I spent 15 minutes thinking I was going to be executed by rebels in Sierra

500
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:44,240
Leone. I mean, some bad things happened, you know, and, and they always had an effect on me. And I

501
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,520
always just thought, Oh, I'm just losing it. What's wrong with me? You know, and I, the nation was not

502
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,800
talking about PTSD and I didn't know anything about it. And, you know, some of the reactions are,

503
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,560
I mean, there were no ski gondolas in Afghanistan, right? It was,

504
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:05,200
so why would I relate panicking and ski gondola to combat in Afghanistan? I wouldn't. I just thought

505
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,640
I was going nuts. And, you know, finally I was at a, I was a party and the, and the wife of a

506
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,920
older friend of mine, older woman, I was a psychiatrist. She was asking me sort of,

507
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,200
sort of curiosity, you know, is this right after we'd invaded Iraq and around, oh, three around

508
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,720
the same time. And she said, have you all this combat you've covered, you ever had any,

509
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,720
you know, psychological consequences? And I was like, no, I don't think so.

510
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,800
No, not really. I'm good. And then I was like, I mean, I did start to have panic attacks once

511
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,000
in a while, but I don't think it had anything to do with combat. I mean, they're just, you know,

512
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,040
I don't know. And she was like, you know, you'll find that that probably was connected to combat.

513
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:55,520
And, um, there's something called PTSD and, you know, keep in mind, this is early on in the Iraq

514
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,120
war, right? When we're having this conversation, she said, I think America is going to be hearing

515
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:09,440
a lot more about PTSD in the coming years, but you might want to look into it because actually,

516
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,080
I think you're having, you're suffering more consequences than you realize. She was absolutely

517
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,400
right. How did you receive that at that point in time? Oh, I was enormously relieved, right? I was

518
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,200
like, Oh, this is a normal reaction. Like the kind of freak show I can produce in a subway platform

519
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,760
in New York city, isn't just my unique and pathetic weakness and neurosis. This is actually a normal,

520
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,440
healthy reaction to trauma. Uh, and you know, what would happen is that the traumatic reaction would

521
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,240
dissipate over time. You know, it would be the strongest when I got back or within a week or two

522
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,280
of getting back and then it would dissipate and dissipate. And after, you know, it's like, you know,

523
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,160
it's like a year later, I don't care how heartbroken you are that your girlfriend broke up with you a

524
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,800
year later. You know, you're pretty good. You know what I mean? I mean, you can sort of think about it

525
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,640
and have some thoughts, but, but you know, basically it's not invading your daily experience.

526
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,480
Like it might a week later, right? And likewise with PTSD, you know, for, for, you know, I think

527
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,920
the statistic is about 80% of people a year out from the trauma, they, uh, 80% have fully recovered

528
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:21,200
and regained a normal functioning, healthy life, which doesn't mean they're not changed by it,

529
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,680
right? You can be changed by something, but not in a, a psychologically dysfunctional state. And,

530
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,520
um, you know, you're always going to, you know, the, the grieve your, your, your mom's death or

531
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,360
your, their divorce or whatever it may be. You can always, you know, you may always grieve that.

532
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:43,760
That doesn't mean that you have a psychological issue. What was the reaction of others? Um,

533
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,760
it sounds like at least you had one girlfriend during this period of time who was probably

534
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,280
witness to some of this or were you shield or were you somehow able to sort of shield

535
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,720
these anxiety attacks and panic attacks from others? Oh, I was, you know, I, I mean,

536
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,200
the panic was going on internally. I mean, I was literally white knuckling it and pouring sweat,

537
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:10,160
right? And, um, I would all, I was, I would conceal it as much as I possibly could. And I think I was

538
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:18,000
successful, um, uh, from anyone around me. And, uh, I mean, I never told anybody about it until later,

539
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,080
but not, no, not immediately afterwards or no, I, I, I, I wasn't something I wanted to share.

540
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:30,720
So the war in Iraq starts in March of 03. When are you next back in combat?

541
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:38,960
So I went, I, I refused to cover Iraq. I thought it was a mistake and a travesty and had, that it

542
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,920
had nothing to do with 9 11 and I didn't want to get killed covering a mistake. And I didn't think

543
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:52,880
I could be unbiased to my reporting. So I didn't cover Iraq. Um, but by 2005, the war in Afghanistan,

544
00:52:53,840 --> 00:53:00,320
which was an easy win initially, uh, because it was so underfunded and undermanned, um,

545
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:07,120
no one was focusing on it because of Iraq. It didn't go that well. And what was an easy win.

546
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,240
And we had the gratitude of, of the majority of, uh, you know, the strong majority of Afghan

547
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,240
citizens. We did not follow through. And so by 05 that Taliban insurgency has started to like,

548
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,960
it, this, you know, the tires have started to grip now. They're not just spinning their wheels.

549
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,480
They're actually starting to get some traction and the Americans are starting to really take some

550
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,000
casualties. And I think they were losing a soldier every three days in 2005 and they were starting

551
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,160
to get into some pretty good firefights. And, uh, I was like, damn, that's who saw that coming?

552
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,000
Right? It was so, it looked like it was such a successful, oh, one looked so successful. Um,

553
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,560
so I thought I want to know what it's like to be an American soldier in combat, you know,

554
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,920
having grown up in Vietnam, it never occurred to me that I would, that that would interest

555
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,880
me journalistically. And it never occurred to me that the U S military would allow unfettered

556
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,840
access of the sort that I might find interesting. I mean, I don't want to just go to press conferences

557
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:09,440
and have some, you know, public relations major tell me, you know, give me some spin about what's

558
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,480
going on. Like that doesn't interest me. Right. So, but it really looked like, uh, George Bush

559
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,200
should have made good on his promise to provide full access to American journalists or journalists

560
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,440
of any country on the front lines with American soldiers. I was like, all right, I'm in, I want

561
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:30,240
to see how this, what this is like. And, um, so I was in Zabo province with the second of the five,

562
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,400
oh third, the same unit I profiled later in Afghanistan, um, battle company. And, uh, you

563
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,080
know, we were in a, you know, you know, minutes after stepping out of a black Hawk getting

564
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,960
deployed, you know, delivered to a unit that was in the field doing a combat operation minutes

565
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,960
after stepping out of the black Hawk. I was in a pretty good firefight. I mean, RPG almost hit me,

566
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,000
you know, I mean, boom, all of a sudden I'm in combat with American soldiers.

567
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:01,600
And, uh, you know, I just couldn't believe the intensity of the fight and the quality of the

568
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:07,120
soldiers like these guys, it was all men in this unit. I mean, these guys were working so hard,

569
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:14,400
right? Physically. I mean, the mortar teams were carrying 160 pounds, 160, 160 pounds on,

570
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,720
you know, overnight combat patrol movements, you know, dusk to dawn with basically carrying their

571
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,800
own body weight on their back. Right. I mean, on unbelievable, they were working way harder at this

572
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,880
to repeal the rebuild this other country than anyone I knew ever worked in college. Any of my

573
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,920
buddies in college, they never worked as hard at anything, you know, and I was just, I really

574
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,840
liked those guys. And, uh, and I was like, I want more of this. Like if this unit goes back to

575
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,640
Afghanistan in two years, it was a two year cycle of deployments. If they go back to Afghanistan,

576
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,680
man, I'm going to follow them for a year and see what it's a doctor's document, one platoon in one

577
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,960
place for one year and document that with a video camera. And by writing a book, my book

578
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,240
became war, the book war and the documentary that I made with my friend and brother,

579
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,680
Tim Heatherington, uh, was called versus Trupo. What did you learn about those guys in terms of

580
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:20,480
their motivation? Um, how many of them saw this as a duty, um, a direct response to what happened

581
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:28,080
on nine 11, um, in the way that I suspect many young men saw what happened on December 7th,

582
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:36,480
1941 as their moral obligation to go and do something about it, uh, versus how many of them

583
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:47,440
would you infer were looking for a sense of purpose as the primary objective for which this

584
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,640
became a vehicle to do it? I don't know if my question makes sense, right? One is like purely

585
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,360
in response to nine 11. I hate that I have to do this. I don't want to do this, but I see no higher

586
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:04,720
calling versus I need to find the sense of purpose. I mean, none of the guys I knew join the,

587
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:12,000
join the military despite hating it. Like they, they, I mean, uh, I mean, they may have, may well

588
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,840
have joined up out of a sense of patriotic duty after nine 11. Absolutely. But I think a lot of

589
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:25,360
those people were from families that had a military history that probably had male relatives that

590
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:32,960
served in one war or another. Uh, I mean, prior, prior generations, um, a lot of them honestly were

591
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,200
young men that were just wanted to test themselves in combat. You know, I mean, you can join the

592
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,360
military and not be in a combat unit, right? The combat units do not want people that don't want

593
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,720
to be in combat units. There are enough young men that are quite psyched to experience combat. In

594
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,400
fact, very driven to experience combat worried that the war is going to be over before they get to

595
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,240
experience combat. There's enough young men like that, that, um, you can fill those frontline

596
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:07,440
combat units with entirely enthusiastic soldiers. And, um, you know, if, you know, if anything,

597
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:14,240
it's sometimes hard to get those guys to give it up, uh, to give combat up. And I think that was

598
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,240
probably true in Vietnam as well. Uh, uh, I've read letters from American civil war soldiers and

599
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,120
soldiers in world war one talking about how the war was the, some of the best days of their lives,

600
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,520
you know, veterans of these world war one and the civil war, I mean, blood baths, right? You know,

601
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,640
letters saying that was, those were some of the most meaningful days of our lives and we miss it.

602
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,760
Right. So, and the, you know, the casualty rates were horrific, you know, now the casualty rates

603
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:48,160
are a lot less. And a lot of the guys that I knew out there really, really missed that experience of

604
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:55,280
combat. And I just read in, in the Washington post that the Taliban fighters now sort of have

605
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,800
nothing to do because they won the war and that they are openly saying that they miss the fighting.

606
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,360
Like that they, they, they, they're already nostalgic for the war that they fought. And,

607
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,840
um, so, you know, you get people like that, you get men like that, um, they're out there.

608
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,560
They, maybe they joined after nine 11 because of patriotism or a history of family history of

609
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:25,600
service. Um, but I would say the majority of them were like pretty psyched to see themselves as,

610
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,400
yeah, man, I was in combat. I saw the real thing and I did okay. You know,

611
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,080
like a lot of them were like that. And how much of that do you think is

612
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,760
the desire to prove themselves in, in, in the theater of combat versus

613
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,600
the sense of connection that must come from that. I have a number of friends who were

614
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:54,480
former special forces guys. And certainly one of the things they talk about is the trust you must

615
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,320
have in your other soldiers, right? It's, it's sort of one thing if you're working in an office

616
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:05,520
building and you say to your colleague, Hey, would you mind tracking this thing down for me?

617
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,840
Cause I, you know, I need that piece of information and you're closer to it. Can you grab it for me?

618
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,280
And, and you've got to trust that they're going to pull it together for you by next day when you

619
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,800
need it. It's quite another thing when you're in combat and you ask someone to do something where,

620
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:23,200
you know, literally somebody's life is on the line, which is not to say that everything you ask

621
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,960
is of that gravity, but enough things are. I've never experienced that, right? Like I've never

622
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:35,200
had to ask somebody to do thing, to do something where my life depends on it. And nor have I been

623
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,520
asked to do something where someone else's life depends on it outside of medicine. I guess I'll

624
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:46,400
carve out, you know, trying to help a person who's been injured. So I have to imagine that that's,

625
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,880
that sense of purpose, that sense of fulfillment that comes from both leaning on somebody and

626
01:00:52,880 --> 01:01:00,240
being leaned on is, is exceptional. Do you think that ultimately that is the thing that hooks people?

627
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,960
Yeah. I mean, I think we are humans are wired to respond positively to behaviors and traits that

628
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,160
were adaptive in our evolutionary past. And clearly if people that go through danger

629
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:21,520
together are loyal to each other in facing that danger and consider that that group that's faced

630
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:28,240
and survived danger together has a special unique bond and that thing makes us us, right? That

631
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:34,880
describes human groups since the dawn of time, right? Humans lived in groups of 30, 40, 50 people

632
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:43,440
typically in the, you know, 90% of our evolutionary past and that loyalty to others who are loyal to

633
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,280
you in the face of an, you know, an attacking lion or another human group that's, you know, coming to

634
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:57,440
kill you, like that reaction is completely, that is very, very adaptive and adaptive things feel

635
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:04,160
good. The things that keep us alive and allow us to procreate and survive, they feel good. And that's

636
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,720
why we do them. And that's how evolution works. And so that group on that mutual group bonds

637
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:15,920
is completely intoxicating and you have not experienced that, but you are hardwired

638
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,280
to be receptive to it, even at the neurochemical level of dopamine and oxytocin, like you are

639
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,680
hardwired to be receptive to it and to grow to want it and to need it. And it would take you some

640
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,200
hours in a dangerous situation with some other people to pretty quickly start thinking, these

641
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,160
are my people. You know, we survived the plane crash together. I'm alive because of them. And I

642
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,800
pulled this other guy out of the water and it's going to be days till we're rescued. And this is

643
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,600
now our tribe and you were, you know, it happens in prisons and it happens in all kinds of situations.

644
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,960
Like that's what humans are. And it's an extraordinary thing. And other animals don't

645
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:01,200
quite have it in the same social way that humans do. One of the profound things about humans

646
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,240
is that humans will be willing to die for a same sex peer that they're not related to.

647
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,200
And I'm not going to talk about women because I'm not a woman and I haven't studied it.

648
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,040
So I'll restrict my conversation to men. A man will die for a same sex peer that he's not related

649
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:24,160
to, not his cousin, not his brother, just another dude who happens to be in the platoon. And that

650
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,520
arrangement where they each, they might not even like each other. I mean, as this one guy in the

651
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,360
platoon I was with said to me, you know, seven, oh eight, when I was in the Coronigal Valley,

652
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,080
Brendan O'Byrne, who's still a good friend of mine, he was like, you know, it's funny. There are guys

653
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,240
in the platoon who straight up hate each other, but we would all die for each other. Now, if you're

654
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,920
in a group that has that arrangement with each other, it's not even dependent on feelings.

655
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:53,840
That's a very secure place to be as a young man, as a human being. And there are a lot of groups

656
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:59,760
that function that way. You know, I know some guys in the FDNY, the fire department in New York City

657
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:06,080
completely functions like that. The willingness to overlook your own safety and your own concerns

658
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:13,680
for the sake of the group is the people that are in that position, you know, strangely they don't

659
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:19,600
feel like it's an onerous responsibility or obligation. They feel that it's a privilege

660
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,120
and that they're honored to be in that role, that they're special. They are special. And I interviewed

661
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:31,360
a fireman in the late 90s, a sort of storied fireman named Pat Brown. I mean, anyone in the FDNY

662
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:38,640
would know that name. And, you know, he went into the World Trade Centers on 9-11 and his last call

663
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:45,520
was from a, you know, an emergency phone at the 30th floor of one of the trade centers

664
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,600
saying, Pat Brown, we're on the 30th floor and we're going to keep moving. His casualty is coming

665
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:57,520
down and we're going to keep moving upwards. And he led his men upwards until the buildings collapsed.

666
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,600
And the ability for humans to do that for each other is a profound thing and it's what makes

667
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:08,160
human society possible. So there's two things that I want to understand a bit better, Sebastian.

668
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,880
Actually, several, but let's go back to the beginning. 10,000 years ago, you and I might

669
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:21,760
have been in a group of 30 or 40, as you said. It's really under, I understand very clearly why

670
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,440
the 30 or 40 of us would have been inseparable and even put aside personal differences because we

671
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,560
actually needed each other to survive. Like there's no one human that could have survived 10,000 years

672
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:40,320
ago in isolation, right? You couldn't have got enough food, provided enough shelter and provided

673
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:46,320
enough security from animals and other humans. So we take that off the table and we realize

674
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:52,960
there's some minimum effective group size that was necessary just to survive. And anybody who

675
01:05:52,960 --> 01:06:00,400
tried to deviate from that wasn't going to. Now let's use the example, which is, well, that can

676
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:08,560
be scaled somewhat and you look at firefighters. So I am very close to a firefighter who was a

677
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:16,960
fire chief in San Jose, was devastated in a way that I think many people wouldn't have been

678
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:26,560
during 9-11 because he understood very clearly that his brothers died. That's the language he

679
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:31,360
used. His brothers died on 9-11. And we were actually talking about this recently because

680
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:38,560
of the 20th anniversary. And he said he has no doubt that had he been there that day, he would

681
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,280
have died. Like that's not something that he thinks, oh, I wonder what I would have done. No,

682
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:51,040
he knows what he would have done. So that's a very interesting bond to me because it scales

683
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:57,120
what we just talked about at the 30 to 40 people level. His tribe is much bigger than 30 to 40

684
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:04,880
people. Now you go one step further, which is the story of Pat Brown, which is his tribe now

685
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,840
includes a whole bunch of people who were not firefighters. He wasn't going from the 30th floor

686
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:16,080
up to get firefighters out. He was going to get civilians out. And you can say, well, okay, that

687
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:21,600
was his job. But I mean, that kind of strikes me as a bullshit answer, right? I mean, I don't think

688
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,760
he was just doing it because it was his job. He was doing it because he felt some higher duty,

689
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,200
some higher calling. So now his tribe was even larger than just all the firefighters.

690
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:37,920
It was all of the people that were in danger. All of this suggests that this

691
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,960
connectedness can scale beyond a group of 30 to 40 people. Do you agree with that?

692
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,760
I do to an extent. I mean, I would say that your firemen friends, you know, we were all

693
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,200
Americans were virtually all morally emotionally wounded on 9 11. And

694
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,320
these were American firefighters that died. And you were talking to an American firefighter.

695
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:09,600
It's possible that if an equivalent story, you know, happened in Germany or Zimbabwe, or Pakistan,

696
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:14,960
he might not quite have grieved his Pakistani brothers who had died in a building collapse in

697
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:21,040
Lahore. I mean, you know what I mean? So it might have been more the American connection

698
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,240
than the occupational connection. Yeah, I mean, yeah, those are my brothers. And they're my

699
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,120
brothers partly because we share the same country and this country was attacked. And, you know, I

700
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:37,760
mean, there's layers, there's different layers of affiliation. And we definitely, you know, humans

701
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:43,920
have a kind of symbolic capacity for symbolism, where, okay, I may not know you, but you're

702
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,760
wearing the same insignia, you're wearing the same uniform, you're doing the same job I do,

703
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,640
I can relate to you. Like I got you, we may not know each other, I may not love you like a brother,

704
01:08:52,640 --> 01:09:00,880
but I respect you. And, you know, I might risk my life for you. You know, and, you know, one of the

705
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,560
things, I mean, if you're going to become a firefighter, one of the sources of pride is that

706
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,800
you take care of a vulnerable population. That's what you are, right? You're a sheepdog. I mean,

707
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:19,440
you know, that's, and so Pat Brown went up those, you know, went up those stairs with his brothers,

708
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,640
right? Because that's what they do. And they were doing it together. And that's, it wasn't even,

709
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,240
didn't even come up for review, oh, should we do this or not? Like, if you're going to review that,

710
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,000
you're not going to be in the fire department. Like just get out now. They all know that. I'm

711
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,800
sure there are people that actually, like, you know what? I just found out I'm not a firefighter

712
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,320
today. I'm actually not a firefighter. I'm going to get out of here. And the fire department doesn't

713
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:46,640
want you in there either, right? I mean, they didn't want anyone in a second platoon battle

714
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,840
company in the Korongal Valley. Like they didn't want, you know, at some level didn't want to be

715
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:55,840
there. Like they don't, nah, we don't need you. You don't need us. Like we'll put you somewhere else

716
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:02,080
where you're not a danger to yourself and others. And so you have to understand that sacrifice is

717
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:09,120
part of a way that Pat Brown probably saw himself. His, his, his, the meaning of his existence to some

718
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,600
degree came from his role as a fireman. So of course he went up the damn stairs, you know, and

719
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:20,720
that's what a fireman does. And, but so, so I, but I understand where your question is leading is like,

720
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:27,840
is it possible to feel affiliated with 300 million people? Like, can we feel affiliated as a nation?

721
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:34,080
Even if we don't know each other. And yes, because humans are capable of symbolic thought.

722
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,800
And, and we're capable of understanding intellectually, oh, we're all Americans. Like

723
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,000
I might, you, you and I might be different races. You may, maybe you don't even speak English,

724
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,200
you know, maybe whatever. You could have enormous differences between individuals,

725
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:54,080
but there's some concept when my father came to these shores and arrived in Baltimore off of

726
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:00,160
Portuguese freighter transporting quirk from Lisbon called the São Tomé. And they landed in,

727
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:07,680
in Baltimore and he stepped ashore and the immigration official welcomed him.

728
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:14,080
He looked around and he knew he was in a country like no other. It was filled with every race and

729
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:20,400
language of the world. And he quickly discovered that. And that's human's ability for abstract

730
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:26,720
thought. Of course, it's not that hard to cleave that either. As we've been seeing in the last few

731
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:32,720
years, but yeah, it's an extraordinary thing. Where do you think that was at its peak in American

732
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:40,880
history? World war two, the sense of unity, that is that sense of when were we most a tribe

733
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:51,440
in the abstract sense and at the largest scale? After 9 11, for sure. I think World War two,

734
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,120
you know, there was curfew in New York that was enforced. There was a huge sort of can and metal

735
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,720
collecting operation because the armed forces needed metal, aluminum. I can't remember what,

736
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:07,600
but you know, there was a whole drive to collect cans. I mean, there was like a huge amount of

737
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,600
certain national undertaking that everyone understood. We're in this together, you know,

738
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:19,600
buy war bonds, all that stuff. The depression was another time. I mean, I knew, I knew a man,

739
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:25,840
he's passed away, but he who was young during the during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression

740
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:35,600
out in Missouri. And he said that the school houses would be left open at night. You know,

741
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,760
these are one room school houses, right? This is the 1930s in the American West and Midwest.

742
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,600
That the school houses would be left open, unlocked, because migrant families, you know,

743
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,960
people were on the move with children and, you know, they were poor, they were destitute,

744
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,400
they were desperate. They were looking for work in the Dust Bowl and they would be, you know,

745
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:57,360
driving horse and cart across the lands and they needed places to sleep with their children. And

746
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,400
so every town left their school house open so that these migrants could enter with their children

747
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,720
and sleep in a safe, protected place. And they would leave before class started in the morning

748
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,640
and every school had a well. So they would have water for the water for the horses, you know,

749
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:18,240
and that's the kind of communalism that typifies a nation that's enduring a great hardship.

750
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,880
And they're sort of looking out for one's neighbors and looking out for people that are

751
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,440
less well off than you are. You know, the Blitz in London had plenty of that as well. People react

752
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:34,080
very, very, very, very, in very healthy ways to that kind of stress. I researched a, in my book,

753
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:40,960
Tribe, I researched an earthquake in Italy in 1916, if I remember correctly, in Avidzano,

754
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,040
the area of Avidzano. And one guy, they, you know, they had a 90 something percent mortality rate.

755
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:52,960
I mean, basically it was like a nuclear bomb had gone off in that area and 90 something percent of

756
01:13:52,960 --> 01:14:01,040
the people died within minutes. And one of the survivors wrote that the people who were left,

757
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,080
there was a complete egalitarianism among the, among the survivors. Survivors didn't matter

758
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,920
if you were a criminal or you were rich or you were poor or outcast or did not matter what you were,

759
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,800
the people that were still alive regarded each other as equals because there was a matter of

760
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:26,080
survival. And this guy said, as soon as like outside relief got there, that that egalitarianism

761
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,320
ended. And he said that the, the crisis that the earthquake had given them, briefly given them

762
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,680
what the law promises, but cannot in fact deliver, which is the equality of all people. Well,

763
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,600
if you experience that, you do not want to give it up. And that's one of the things that soldiers

764
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:50,480
experience in combat with each other in a platoon. When we think back to our ancestors, again, even

765
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:57,440
just 10,000 years ago, did they live in that state because it was effectively a crisis 24 seven?

766
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,360
Well, it wasn't necessarily a crisis, but they were subsistence level

767
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:08,400
Stone Age people that needed everyone to contribute to survive. And I'm sure the crises were regular

768
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,640
enough that it keep them sort of bonded together. But look, if you're a hunter gatherer society,

769
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,520
you know, there's no getting off the treadmill. You got, you know, you got to keep, you got to

770
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,960
keep that system going pretty much continually. Now they've done studies of even in very harsh

771
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:30,320
environments, like the Kalahari desert, the native people of that area, the kung there, for example,

772
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,800
that they worked an average of four hours a day to survive in one of the harshest environments

773
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:46,720
of the world, right? The average person in industrial society, post industrial society works,

774
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:51,520
you know, an eight hour day, a 40 hour work week, you know, so it's interesting as we've gotten more

775
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:59,120
advanced, the time requirements for survival have increased, not decreased. But at that level,

776
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,680
it does not require a full time effort to survive, but it does require a full time

777
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:09,440
cooperation, collaboration within the groups. Do we have any sense of how

778
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:18,960
hunter gatherers treated death? Or how they, how they, how they responded to loss?

779
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:26,080
I mean, I'm just going from a very kind of general knowledge right now. I haven't made a study of it.

780
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:35,200
There was very little suicide and depression in, in hunter gatherer societies. Suicide was virtually

781
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:49,760
unheard of. So the deaths that happened were either violent as a result of warfare or dangerous

782
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:58,800
animals or, you know, infant losses from disease. But if you, if, if you live through the initial

783
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,640
high risk years, a lot of people in those societies lived until into their 70s and 80s,

784
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:14,480
you know, long lifespan in Western terms, even by today's standards. And I think there's a general

785
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:20,560
feeling that the person had passed on to a realm in which inhabited by other dead people, other

786
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:28,720
dead ancestors, and that you'll be joining them soon enough. I mean, and that one of the role

787
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:35,280
jobs of the shamanism is a virtually universal human behavior in almost every human society.

788
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:41,040
One of the jobs of the shaman is to settle back and forth between that world and the world of

789
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:46,080
living, you know, with important information about how, you know, how it's going over there

790
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,840
and what we need to do, we as living people need to do to remain in a right and proper relationship

791
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,880
with the dead. Yeah, I mean, that's interesting, right? Because it suggests that

792
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:03,360
the impact of loss was so significant that we needed a way to explain it and we needed a way to,

793
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,600
to give meaning to life, which was in part saying that even when you're gone, it still matters and

794
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,160
you mattered and you've, you might be reincarnated depending on whatever the belief system was that

795
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:24,080
emerged from that. You know, I was just recently on an elk hunt. And I mean, I love hunting, but

796
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:30,640
it's really, it's never lost on me when you kill an animal that that animal lived.

797
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,160
You know, in the case of an elk, that animal was alive for eight or nine years before you killed

798
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:44,240
it. Right? And again, I won't get into all the benefits of it and why a certain number of animals,

799
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:51,520
you're benefiting the herd by removing a select number of them, etc. But I remember when I shot my

800
01:18:51,600 --> 01:19:01,600
elk, just last, you know, last week, I remember thinking, so first of all, as I watched him die,

801
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,720
all of the other elk made a circle around him as he bedded down to die. Now that blew my mind

802
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:15,520
because I hadn't seen that before. A lot of times when the arrow hits the elk,

803
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:21,440
he makes noises, they freak out, everybody scatters. But for whatever reason, on this

804
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:34,000
occasion, the arrow hit him. He wandered very, very 40 yards. He bedded down, was making noises like

805
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,600
he was dying and he was surrounded by the other elk. And eventually they went away when he died.

806
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,360
And you can't help but sort of anthropomorphize that and sort of project your own thinking like,

807
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:55,920
what were they thinking? Like this guy, he was the biggest of them and they just watched him die. Do

808
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,480
they understand what that means? And will they remember that? Will they remember that next week?

809
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:04,960
Or will that, it's a silly question because it can't be answered, but, or at least I don't think

810
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:15,360
it can be answered. Maybe it has been studied, but it certainly makes me wonder how other species

811
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:24,800
experience loss. Well, here's just a thought that's not a direct answer to that question,

812
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,400
but it's, I think it's an interesting avenue to go down. So there are a lot of psychological,

813
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,560
humans have psychological mechanisms to protect themselves from painful experiences. They go into

814
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:44,000
shock physically if they're in physical pain. In war, there's two different ways of processing the

815
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,840
fact that you're killing other human beings. At the end of the day, everyone knows that that's wrong.

816
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,680
And there's a moral burden that comes with it. And one way to do it is to convince yourself that

817
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:58,720
they're not fully human. You're not really killing humans. It's the enemy. They're less than human.

818
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:03,920
It doesn't matter. That's a very common one. And it's easy to feel that way when they're killing

819
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:10,560
your friends and you're filled with rage and grief. And you're like, okay, pick your insult.

820
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:20,720
You cockroaches, whatever, you rats. They resort to animals to refer to the enemy,

821
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:27,440
to dehumanize them. But the other thing you can do is to accord a kind of respect. You're a worthy

822
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,520
foe. And the Greeks did this with the Trojans. You're a worthy foe. Now we are going to wipe you

823
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:37,760
out, make no mistake about it, but you're a worthy enemy and we respect you. We respect how hard you

824
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,000
are fighting. You're brave. We're still going to kill you, but we have respect for you. That's

825
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,200
another way of psychologically distancing from the fact that you're killing people, right? And

826
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:52,960
they're trying to kill you. So there is a moral burden often in hunting because you're killing

827
01:21:52,960 --> 01:22:01,680
this animal. And many native peoples around the world, they live off hunting, right? I mean,

828
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:06,800
we have to kill the bison and the leopard and the bear and the elephant and what have you in order

829
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,600
to survive. So make no mistake about it. We're going to keep doing that. But one way to protect

830
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,960
yourself, protect the hunter psychologically from the sort of moral questions around that,

831
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:22,560
any moral pain around that is to say sort of like, thank you, like thank you, elk, thank you,

832
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:28,880
bison for giving us food to eat. We respect you. We honor you. You know, this, and there's a whole

833
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:40,400
sort of ritual process that incorporates the death into a context of respect, right? And so here's

834
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:46,160
what I'm going to go, just go out on a sort of crazy limb here. We all know that the miracle

835
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:50,080
of modern society, and I don't mean that ironically, it truly is a miracle. And we can

836
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:56,320
talk about it later. I'm alive because some nearly miraculous Western medicine intervened

837
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:02,800
when I was dying and saved my life, right? So on many, many levels, this society is a miracle.

838
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,680
It's transcendent. We understand the cosmos. We understand the human body. I mean, I could go on

839
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:12,400
and on, you know, and we can fly in airplanes and drive cars. I mean, it's insane, right?

840
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:20,640
How amazing it is. We also know that it costs the planet a lot, right? I mean, we are gouging

841
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,800
mountains and cutting down forests and polluting the ocean and blah, blah, blah. That's the cost

842
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,480
of our amazing society. And what's interesting about that is virtually all humans think that

843
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:37,920
nature is beautiful, right? I mean, you can take the most hardcore ultra right wing, like

844
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:44,800
anti climate change, anti Baxter, whatever, they know a tree is beautiful. And when you cut down

845
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:50,240
a tree, it's less beautiful, right? We all know that every child knows that we all know that

846
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:54,880
nature is beautiful. And the world, the planet's a wondrous place. It's our home. It's our mother

847
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:01,920
earth. We all know that. And we are basically killing the elk, killing the buffalo in order to

848
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:08,160
eat without saying thank you. And I think it might change in some ways, the whole conversation

849
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:13,440
about environmentalism, even if we didn't do anything differently, even if we kept strip mining

850
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,920
mountains, because we need to, because we might need to, I don't know, you know, even if we, even

851
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,680
if we kept cutting down forests, because we need trees, we need paper, whatever. I mean, I'm not

852
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:27,440
saying we should or shouldn't do anything of that sort. But if we just added an acknowledgement of

853
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:35,920
the harm and a sort of thank you to the earth for providing our sustenance, if we just did that,

854
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:43,120
it would reconcile this sort of like cognitive dissonance of all of us knowing that we hurt

855
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:48,400
something we love in order to exist. And liberals hurt the planet just as much as conservatives,

856
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:54,160
by the way, like the sort of liberal piety, oh, I drive a Prius, so I'm good. It's complete nonsense,

857
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:58,480
right? We all need to acknowledge it. And I'm just, I would just say, like, we might learn

858
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,920
something from native peoples about protecting ourselves emotionally and psychologically from

859
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:11,760
the necessary harm that we do by overtly stating and ritualizing that relationship with the earth.

860
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:18,000
And so the next time they flattop a mountain for coal, why not bring in a minister, a priest,

861
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,880
a shaman, or all three to say thank you to the mountain, you know, like it won't hurt. And it

862
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,600
might actually do people, the community and the coal miners and all of us that use electricity,

863
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,360
it might actually do us a lot of good. That's just my thought for the week.

864
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:38,720
No, I think it's very powerful. And I think when it comes to animals in particular, because look,

865
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:43,200
it's a very controversial topic and you can't talk about hunting without offending, you know,

866
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:51,200
half the population. But, you know, my view has been if you choose to eat meat, it's a good idea

867
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:56,480
for you to at least understand what it's like to take a life of what you're eating and to remove

868
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:01,680
the distance between you and the animal you're eating. And it will change the way you eat. Right?

869
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:09,600
I mean, you know, this will probably be the first year when I will subside entirely on wild game

870
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:15,440
that's been hunted, you know, ethically. And there's literally been a change in my palette,

871
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:22,880
right? Like I just don't like eating big, you know, stakes and things that that frankly,

872
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,960
are a little forced, right? There's really something to be said for this other thing.

873
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,040
It's not for everybody. And I don't feel like I should impose that on anybody. And that's just

874
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:37,120
sort of my little two cents on it. But I did bring my daughter on a hunt once two years ago,

875
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:42,720
and she was only 11 years old. And I remember thinking, well, this could be very traumatic for

876
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,520
her because it was a deer and a beautiful type of deer called an axis deer, I think the most

877
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:54,960
beautiful animals to look at. But when the after the animal died, fortunately, it died very quickly.

878
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,400
I wanted her to come up and kind of lay her hands on it while it was still warm and understand like

879
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:06,880
you're going to eat this tonight. But this thing gave us a gift. And we actually did we sort of

880
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,120
went through this exercise you described where we thanked the deer, because it was going to feed us

881
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:18,320
and it fed about 40 people that night. And I she still looks back at that very fondly.

882
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:27,040
Yeah, that must have been a complete, absolutely core experience of our human ancestors for,

883
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,600
you know, as I said, most of most of human evolution is that relationship with of respect

884
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:43,280
with the animals that had that that you that you fed yourself with. And I feel like it's

885
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:48,080
psychologically enormously healthy. And one of the things this society is one of the ways in which

886
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:54,960
is unhealthy is that it has de ritualized the vital processes that keep us alive. They keep us

887
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:01,200
fed, they keep us sheltered, it's de ritualized them, and allowed us to actually not acknowledge

888
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:07,520
the harm that we do. I mean, we all know in our heart, right? But and then when you can articulate

889
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,160
it, I mean, the difference between hurting someone's feelings and hurting someone's feelings and saying,

890
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:17,840
I'm so sorry, you know, that I hurt your feelings, I kind of had to do it. We were not a good couple,

891
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:24,560
we had to break up. But I, you know, I'm still I'm still hurting from the sorrow that that that

892
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:32,080
unavoidable decision that I carry in me, you know, I mean, you there's a world of difference between

893
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:36,720
dumping someone and having a conversation like that, right? And that's the conversation we need

894
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:42,160
to have with our planet, regardless of where you fall on the climate change, environmental spectrum,

895
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:48,320
you could be a hardcore, you know, like I'm driving a vehicle that gets eight miles to the gallon,

896
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:54,480
and I don't care about conservation at all, you can be that person to and still acknowledge the

897
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:58,640
harm. And it would be very good for you. Yeah, I mean, that's a great example of sort of

898
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:06,400
dialectical synthesis and holding these truths. Seemingly contradictory, but together. And I

899
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:12,080
agree completely with that. When did you have your how old were you when you had your first child?

900
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:22,640
I was 55. How did that change your appetite or tolerance for risk? Because again, I,

901
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:29,200
I've never taken what you've said to be thrill seeking, right? I don't think anybody who's read

902
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:35,680
your work would say this is a guy who's, you know, who's doing this because when he's not

903
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:41,360
base jumping, he has to be doing that other thing. But there's no way to deny that what you're doing

904
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:50,240
was very risky. What was the what was the change in your in your outlook to your own life and the

905
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:57,120
risks that you took once you became a father? Well, yeah, I mean, my life is not my own now

906
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:05,040
in the sense that if something happened to me, lifelong consequences would be borne by

907
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:10,480
my wife and my children, I have two little girls, four and a half and one and a half,

908
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:16,480
who are the center of my center of my world. Right. And, you know, I would die for them in

909
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:22,080
an instant. And my main job right now is to not die. Right. Like to keep myself alive. But, you

910
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,880
know, I stopped war reporting. I mean, so right now I'm an incredibly risk averse. Right. I mean,

911
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:32,720
I've looked both ways before I cross the street. I don't cross against the light. I, most of the

912
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:39,040
time I drive the speed, you know, whatever on every I don't like ladders. I mean, you know, on every

913
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:47,200
like in every avenue. I'm very, very cautious. I stopped war reporting in 2011.

914
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:53,120
This was right after Tim died. Yeah. When my so my colleague out at Restrepo, Opie Restrepo,

915
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:59,360
where we film Restrepo, you know, where we spent off and on spent a deployment with

916
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:05,920
Second Platoon, a battle company, 173rd Airborne. He was a brother and a colleague and a friend.

917
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,960
And we were out there together a lot and we made a film together and we went out, went to the,

918
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,520
were nominated for the Oscars together. And a few weeks after the Oscars, we were going to cover the

919
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:22,320
Arab Spring on assignment for Vanity Fair at the last minute. I couldn't go. And, and he was killed

920
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:27,680
in the city of Misrata by shrapnel that a little piece of metal that hit his femoral artery in his

921
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:36,320
groin and he bled out. And after that, I, I saw what his death did to everyone who loved him.

922
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:43,280
I mean, you know, Tim, I think, I don't, I think his death was fairly rapid and painless.

923
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:50,400
And his problems were over. But his, the people who loved him, their problems were just beginning.

924
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,800
And I watched how that worked. And I was like, I'm not going to do that to the people who love me.

925
01:31:54,800 --> 01:32:01,600
I'm, you know, I, war reporting at that point went from seeming sort of noble and selfless to

926
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:07,280
something that seemed quite selfish and self-concerned. And so I stopped. I might not have

927
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:15,200
had that reaction at 25 or 30 or 35 or 40, but I was almost 50. And so I stopped and I never looked,

928
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:20,400
I never looked back. I've never wanted to go back. I miss, I miss some of those experiences,

929
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:26,640
but I don't want to repeat them. Given that you've experienced both sides of that sacrifice,

930
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:36,160
what does it, what does it tell you about the people who can do those jobs, whether it be

931
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:48,000
soldiers, firefighters, you know, fishermen in Alaska, who also have families who are making

932
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,560
those choices and the stakes are, I think, as high as they could possibly be, because presumably

933
01:32:54,560 --> 01:33:02,080
they understand what you just said. Yeah. I, you know, I don't, I don't know how they do it.

934
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,040
A lot of soldiers don't have kids. I mean, the guys that I was with out there were mostly

935
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:16,400
19, 20, 21, almost none of them had children. So a few did. But lots of soldiers, you know,

936
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,240
lots of soldiers do have kids and, you know, particularly once you get into the national

937
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:25,200
guard and units like that, like, oh my God, and firemen, of course, you know, it's a big,

938
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:31,360
very family centric, you know, culture. I don't know how they do it. And I also don't know how,

939
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,920
with the fire department, the paramedics, I mean, you know, they have children and they're, you know,

940
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:41,520
they go to car accidents where they're, you know, they're pulling dead children out of the backseats

941
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,160
of vehicles. Like, I mean, I mean, psychologically, I don't know how they do it. I don't know how they,

942
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:50,400
I don't know how they process the trauma. I mean, I can't even read a new story about something bad

943
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,640
happening to a child. I mean, literally, I can't even read it, right? I don't know how

944
01:33:54,640 --> 01:34:02,240
they do their work, that level of trauma that those guys enjoy and women endure. Seeing that,

945
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,800
and also, you know, frontline, you know, ER doctors, I mean, all of it, I mean, really,

946
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,160
I'm just reminded of myself in Liberia, counting, you know, counting the bodies in the pile of

947
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:18,400
bodies and like, sort of wincing at the children, you know, like, the cost of that later,

948
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:25,920
two weeks, two years, 20 years later, the cost of that, I just, I worry about those people. I don't

949
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,440
understand how they survive it psychologically. When I went to medical school, I think everybody

950
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,960
who goes to medical school has a very clear, not everybody, but I think a lot of people have a very

951
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,880
clear sense of what they want to do. They're very specific. I want to become this kind of a doctor.

952
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:48,400
And so for me, that was pediatric oncology. Those were the experiences I had seen while I was an

953
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:53,360
engineering student that, you know, led to my change of heart and led me to decide I wanted to

954
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,760
go to medical school. And I remember even interviewing in medical school or for medical

955
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:05,520
schools and at one interview in particular, the person who was interviewing me who was a surgeon,

956
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,080
was an ENT surgeon, you know, said, well, you wrote your essay about this and you want to do

957
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:16,240
pediatric surgery. Pardon me, you want to do a pediatric oncology. I just want to tell you that

958
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:24,160
I think that's a horrible idea. One day you're going to have kids and you will not be able to

959
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:29,840
do this job. He said, right now that might seem like something that you can do, but one day you

960
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,600
will have kids and that will be the most difficult thing to do is to take care of dying kids.

961
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,400
Now again, that's obviously not entirely true because there are lots of people who take care of

962
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,120
kids with cancer who have children and I've seen them and I've seen them be

963
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,520
completely attached. Like they're not detached, they're not cold, they're not calloused. But

964
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:55,120
it was at the time a comment that sort of put me off a little bit, like who does he to tell me

965
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:02,240
that I can't do that? But he was entirely correct. Now that I have kids, I know

966
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:08,640
it's sure as Tuesday follows Monday, there is zero chance I could be a pediatric oncologist.

967
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:18,320
I just know that whether that's a flaw or not, without judgment, I can just say I couldn't do it.

968
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:27,280
Yeah, I totally understand that. I could totally understand that. And I have two little girls and

969
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:35,120
my sensitivity to harm to children is so completely unbounded that it makes it hard to even

970
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:43,440
read the newspaper or go through life. I mean, it sensitizes you enormously and it's the

971
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:51,280
trauma. It sounds like you had a sort of traumatic experience in your life and I'm

972
01:36:51,280 --> 01:37:00,560
sorry to hear that. Trauma also particularly sensitizes you and seeing trauma to the innocent

973
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:09,360
is something that you never, you will never fully escape the effects of that. Like that will not go

974
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:16,560
away. I mean, my opinion, like it's been 20, 25 years for some things for me and it hasn't

975
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,640
changed at all in my head. Like it's the most painful thing I can think of. Yeah, I think even

976
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,720
though I chose to go into something different, which was not specifically going to be geared

977
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:32,320
around that, you still in surgery saw lots of trauma. We were at a level one trauma center,

978
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:38,400
which meant I think we probably averaged 15 penetrating traumas a day. And that doesn't

979
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:44,720
tell you about all the blunt traumas, so all the car accidents. And so you were, death was right

980
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:50,240
always there and you would still see kids die because you still took care of pediatric trauma.

981
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:58,640
And that was and remains some of the most difficult stuff I've ever seen by far,

982
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,760
which is not to say now that well, people dying of cancer isn't horrible.

983
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:12,080
But there was something about the, at least one had a chance to make amends and it wasn't sudden,

984
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:20,320
but there was this thing about the kid dies in a car accident and the parent is had zero chance to

985
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:28,160
prepare for this. Like there wasn't one nanosecond of preparatory grieving that could go on. I always

986
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:33,280
found that to be the hardest stuff actually, even though paradoxically it wasn't always accompanied

987
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:38,880
by suffering on the part of the victim. Yeah, right. To your point actually about Tim.

988
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,400
Yeah, yeah, no, I can't even begin to imagine for the parents and for you dealing with the

989
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:50,080
parents like ghastly, absolutely ghastly. I mean, now that I knew that abstractly before I was a

990
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:55,680
parent, when I was a father, but now I really know it in my bones and my mind can't even go there.

991
01:38:56,240 --> 01:39:02,720
I remember when one boy, I might've even told the story on a podcast once, but he was

992
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:09,520
15 or 16 years old and he was being driven home from school by his older brother. They were going

993
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:15,200
through an intersection when a guy ran a red and T-boned them on the passenger side, which is where

994
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:25,120
the victim was sitting. He arrived alive, but barely. And I was the trauma chief. And so for

995
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:32,800
this type of an indication, this is a blunt trauma. And when he's unresponsive, it's basically going

996
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:37,840
to be a head injury or massive internal bleeding. He's not going to be dead because he broke his

997
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:42,720
bones or something like that. It's going to be his aorta was sheared. One of the internal vessels

998
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:50,640
was sheared or blunt head trauma. To make a very long story short, it was pretty clear he was dead

999
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:59,840
due to head injury or due to the response, the neurologic exam, but it was a vascular injury.

1000
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:04,800
And he probably should have been declared dead in five minutes, but I wouldn't do it. We kept,

1001
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,680
I just was adamant that we keep working. And, you know, 30 minutes later, I finally conceded he was

1002
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:19,680
dead and declared, declared him dead. When I went to tell his mom, she was, she screamed so loud.

1003
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,200
It's not like in the movies sometimes where people sort of weep softly. Like this was,

1004
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:33,600
this was devastating. And I remember she tore the pocket off my scrubs, literally grabbed my chest

1005
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:40,800
and tore the pocket off my scrubs. I spent hours with her. I would actually go to his funeral. It

1006
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:46,960
was one of the very few people I didn't know whose funeral I went to. And when, you know, at this

1007
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:53,360
point, I'm in a suit, right? When it came time to walk past the casket, she was there. I had, I

1008
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:58,800
didn't think for a second she would remember me. I mean, cause how could she, right? And there were

1009
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:07,120
hundreds of people walking past and she was greeting them all sensibly, right? When she got to me,

1010
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:13,840
she did the same thing. She completely collapsed, grabbed me and tore the pocket off my dress shirt.

1011
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,600
And I was really, really moved. I mean, I just couldn't believe this had happened.

1012
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:24,640
I couldn't believe she would even remember some random person, although obviously it was such a

1013
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:31,280
traumatic experience. But I kept that shirt for a very long time as kind of a reminder of something

1014
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:38,720
that on a given day can change the course of your life, like such a random freak thing and how many

1015
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:46,480
lives his siblings and it's just, it, it, um, it blew my mind. But there was, there was like a memory

1016
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:53,840
within her for this, for this interaction separated by days and obviously by endless sadness.

1017
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:02,960
That's brutal. I mean, what a, what a devastating thing. I'm sorry. That's, that's a hard thing.

1018
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:09,840
How do you think we are doing as a society and we can say that's medically or not medically,

1019
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:17,040
um, in terms of treating, uh, victims of PTSD and, and we can even just limit this to, to, to, to,

1020
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,280
to combat because I think people can have PTSD for many things that are not combat related.

1021
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:30,240
But going back to the friend who said to you in 2003, with incredible insight, we're about to

1022
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:38,800
get very, very familiar with PTSD. Well, she was right. Um, how are we doing? Well, I mean,

1023
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:46,160
not surprisingly for a society that has astronomical levels of, uh, addiction, depression,

1024
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:57,760
suicide, anxiety, compulsive disorders, uh, astronomical levels of all of those social

1025
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:05,040
ills. Not surprisingly, we're not doing too great on the PTSD front. Um, statistically,

1026
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:13,600
the wealthier, the more affluent the society, the worse, the higher the incidence of PTSD,

1027
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:20,160
right? Like if you live in an affluent society, you are statistically prone to worse and longer

1028
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:26,000
PTSD than if you live in a poor society. Okay. Um, in a poor society, there's an expectation

1029
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,840
that life is hard. So when something bad happens, it's not so much of a shock. And also in less

1030
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:40,400
affluent societies, uh, in the developing world, particularly, um, people live in more, they have

1031
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:44,560
a more communal existence because they need each other. So if you go to a, you know, a village in

1032
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:50,240
Africa or in Asia or wherever it may be, people are interdependent on one another because they

1033
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:55,200
don't have their own like little house in the suburbs in the American suburbs, the way I grew up.

1034
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:01,200
Um, and that social proximity is a, is a buffer for psychological struggles.

1035
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:08,320
And so suicide is lower in those communities. Depression rates are lower, anxiety is lower,

1036
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:12,960
even though those lives are stressful in all kinds of ways that ours aren't because we're

1037
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:20,160
affluent society. So the problem, I mean, humans evolved to survive. We're great at surviving,

1038
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:26,000
right? We evolved in a violent and unpredictable world where people had accidents or were attacked

1039
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:33,280
by animals or other human beings all the time. And life was traumatizing. And if trauma was

1040
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:38,080
psychologically incapacitating to a majority of people for any length of time, the society

1041
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,680
wouldn't exist because the group couldn't survive because there'd be no one around to function

1042
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:50,320
because everyone's traumatized. Right? So clearly as a, in terms of us, our species,

1043
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:55,120
trauma is something that humans are designed to work through fairly quickly

1044
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:03,920
because the business of survival has to be attended to. And, uh, so the, the statistics

1045
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:09,840
bear this out within, you know, the, the, for most people, the majority of trauma symptoms disappear

1046
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:19,520
within three months. Right. And about 80% of people wind up with longterm, um, longterm trauma

1047
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:26,240
reaction that doesn't diminish with time. So in my opinion, I mean, I'm not a psychologist,

1048
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:31,200
a psychiatrist, I'm not a doctor. I've looked at this as a journalist. I've had my own experience

1049
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:39,520
with PTSD, but in my opinion, the problem is in our society is that we see PTSD is something that

1050
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:45,840
needs to be treated. Right. The reason there's a longterm problem with trauma reaction, I think,

1051
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:54,400
is partly because we live in such an alienated, socially unconnected, non-communitarian society.

1052
01:45:55,120 --> 01:46:00,880
People live in incredible isolation. Um, children have their own bedrooms. I mean,

1053
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,160
this is the first time in human history that a society has been affluent enough to give children

1054
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:12,560
each their own room in a middle-class house. Right. Insane in human terms, completely insane.

1055
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,840
Right. Like not, that's, children don't, aren't supposed to be by themselves in the dangerous

1056
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:23,680
world. You know, the way people sleep, traditionally sleep in groups in human society. Um, that families

1057
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:32,560
live in their own automatic, you know, so a self-heated, self-sustaining house or apartment,

1058
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:37,680
unconnected to their neighbors who are unconnected to any sense of community, you know, community

1059
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:43,760
endeavor. It's also like completely insane. Right. It completely new in the human experience.

1060
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:49,920
And what I would, you know, what I would say is that the, I mean, with the statistics bear out,

1061
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:57,360
is that when people experience trauma communally and recover from trauma communally, it goes quite

1062
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:05,200
well. I looked at a, um, at a study that was done in a, in a very warlike tribe in East Africa.

1063
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:08,960
They were a raiding society. It was a cattle herding society. They were raiding society and

1064
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:16,640
warfare was quite, uh, normal. It still is. The warriors that were well connected socially,

1065
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:22,800
I mean, I don't mean status-wise, I mean that, that were, that were imbed, well-embedded in the

1066
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:28,640
community, uh, would come back from these very violent raids with, you know, a sort of startle

1067
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:33,360
response and some other sort of surface level trauma reactions, like they jump at loud noises

1068
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:39,680
or whatever, sometimes nightmares, you know, whatever, like, but they wouldn't get depression.

1069
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:44,960
The depression component of PTSD was not something they had to struggle with because they had a

1070
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:49,920
healthy relationship with their society. The warriors who did not, that were not socially

1071
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:55,920
connected in a healthy way, those are the ones who were prone to long-term depression. Right.

1072
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:03,200
So what I would say is that our society is not good at treating PTSD because it's psychologically

1073
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:09,440
stressful for everybody and you can, um, virtually everybody, and you can see the results of that in

1074
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:14,480
our rates of depression, suicide, addiction, anxiety, all those other things.

1075
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:22,880
Again, it comes back to this challenge of with modernity has come amazing things, right? Like,

1076
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:28,400
I don't, I would never want to go back and live 10,000 years ago, even though I acknowledge that

1077
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:34,240
they probably had a much greater sense of community and belonging and purpose because

1078
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:40,640
frankly, I like that I don't have to worry about my drinking water and I like that, you know,

1079
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:45,680
I'm never starving and I like that there's not a tribe a hundred miles away that wants to kill

1080
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:51,120
me and all these other things. But at the same time, the example you gave about children sleeping

1081
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:55,440
in the room is a, is a, is such a fascinating one because it's one I've discussed many times

1082
01:48:55,440 --> 01:49:00,640
with my wife, right? So everyone who's had kids probably can relate to the fact that at some point,

1083
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:05,280
in our experience with three kids, it always seems to be about four years of age,

1084
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:12,560
they stop wanting to sleep alone, right? So we were pretty lucky. All of our kids were, you know,

1085
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:17,440
sleeping in the crib, fine. They didn't, you know, we, we had pretty good sleepers, but boy,

1086
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:23,280
when they turned four, they were not happy about being alone in their room. And what does the

1087
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,600
textbook say? Well, you know, you go through all of the do this, do that, do this, do that,

1088
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:34,160
but none of the do this, do that is bring them in your room, right? Like that's absolutely not the,

1089
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:38,160
the, the sort of textbook thing to do is bring your four-year-old into your bed with you.

1090
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:47,120
But of course, that's exactly what would have been happening 10,000 years ago. So on some level,

1091
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:51,280
you have to think, well, gosh, we probably evolved to sleep with our children.

1092
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:56,880
Americans are the only mammal that doesn't sleep with its young. Let's just put it that way. And

1093
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,120
Americans, and I'm including, you know, the British speak the English speaking world. I

1094
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:07,440
mean, our culture is essentially derivative of, of, of, of England. And so in England,

1095
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:16,400
removing your child from your bed space started in the 1700s, and then spread throughout the

1096
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:22,320
English speaking world. But it is not the human norm. It never has been. And it still isn't. I

1097
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:27,600
mean, most of the world sleeps in a communal space. Most of the world is not affluent enough

1098
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:34,960
to give their child their own crib and their own bed and their own room. If you went camping in the

1099
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:40,160
Bob Marshall wilderness in Montana, with your family, you would not put your

1100
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:41,840
We wouldn't have five separate tents.

1101
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:47,600
We wouldn't have five, right? Yeah, exactly. Right. You would keep your four month old right next

1102
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:52,160
to you. Right? Because it's a dangerous world. And then four month old knows that. And the four year

1103
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:57,840
old knows that. And the thing about, I mean, infants get their safety from proximity to adults,

1104
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,280
period, end of sentence. And they know at one month, at four months, at three years, at four years,

1105
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:09,360
at 10 years, they know that if they're by themselves in the darkness, their life is in danger.

1106
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:14,240
Think about how profound that is, Sebastian, right? Because I think, I think someone who doesn't

1107
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:18,960
have kids might think that sounds strange, but I bet that many people listening to this who have

1108
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:25,840
kids will appreciate the almost irrational fear that a four year old can have of sleeping alone

1109
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:31,040
in the darkness. But if you think about it through the lens, you're describing it, which is,

1110
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,680
this is very evolutionarily hardwired. It shouldn't be surprising, right?

1111
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:41,120
No, it's not irrational. And it's not irrational at all. I mean, in the context of modern America,

1112
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:49,760
it is most of the time, right? But I mean, look, the big threat to humans were the large cats,

1113
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:54,160
right? I mean, in our evolution, right? And that large cats that hunted at night. And so night

1114
01:51:54,160 --> 01:52:00,160
time was a very, very dangerous time for humans. They found countless human or, you know, early

1115
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:06,960
human skulls with the sort of four prongs of the front teeth of a large cat, a large feline, you

1116
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:13,760
know, having punctured the skull, right? And so a child or even an adult that was alone in the

1117
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:18,960
darkness, their life was at risk. You cannot fight off a lion by yourself, right? And unless you

1118
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:26,640
happen to have an AK-47 next to you. And so, you know, people that are surprised at this,

1119
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:31,760
what I would say to them is, look, try going camping by yourself. Go into the woods and see

1120
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,320
how much sleep you get if you are completely alone in the Bob Marshall wilderness, right?

1121
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,200
Now go camping with a group of friends and see how well you sleep. You will sleep a lot better

1122
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:48,160
because you're in a group, right? Could the group do anything if they were attacked by a grizzly

1123
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:54,000
bear? Probably not. Like you're probably just as much at risk by yourself as in a group.

1124
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:01,920
But there's something about being alone in the darkness that even makes adults fearful and will

1125
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,160
not, and they will not get a good night's sleep. So you don't believe me, just go camping by yourself

1126
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:13,280
for a night and see how well it goes. And, you know, children who are, I think the ghastly term

1127
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:18,720
is furburized. There was a doctor named Dr. Ferber who wrote a book about how to furburize your

1128
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:24,240
children and get them to sleep in their own room. You put them quote down, put them down early, and

1129
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:29,920
then you and your wife or husband can have a nice evening on your own. He later recanted everything

1130
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:36,240
he taught in the early 1990s. There's an article in The New Yorker about it. And he said he was dead

1131
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:40,720
wrong about making children sleep by themselves. It was completely, it was counter to evolution.

1132
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:44,960
It was unhealthy for the child. It was quite nice for the adults, but not even that nice because the

1133
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:49,680
screaming of the terrorized child, you know, is hard to take as well while they're being

1134
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:55,600
furburized. So Dr. Ferber himself actually recanted all of that. It's worth tracking down. So right

1135
01:53:55,600 --> 01:54:00,640
now, most of the world, people still sleep with their children. And there's a point, you know,

1136
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:06,400
my wife and I have always slept with our children. Our eldest is four and a half. We make it clear to

1137
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,640
her, listen, if you want to, you know, we have some spare mattress in the closet. I like, listen,

1138
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:14,720
if you want to take that little mattress and sleep in the kitchen or sleep on the couch in the living

1139
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:19,200
room, you know, go for it. You don't have to sleep here. Like, you know, we have a platform,

1140
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:24,880
we have a pad on the floor in what used to be the bedroom. There's no bed there anymore. I'm like,

1141
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,320
listen, honey, you can sleep wherever you want. It doesn't matter to us, but you're always welcome

1142
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,600
in bed, you know, with the family. And that's where she prefers to sleep.

1143
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:39,920
Another thing that you do that's pretty different from the average person in America is you don't

1144
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:46,400
use a smartphone. Obviously that's a very deliberate decision. Talk to me a little bit

1145
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,960
about it and how it's probably made your life better despite the fact that you've given some

1146
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,320
things up, right? You can't email people when you're on the run. You have to be at a computer

1147
01:54:54,320 --> 01:55:02,320
to send an email. So you've made some sacrifices to do that relative to the expectations potentially

1148
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:07,200
of others around you. Because obviously 30 years ago, you didn't need to send email, let alone send

1149
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:12,240
it while you were on the run. But we now live in a world where people expect responses and things

1150
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:17,280
like that. But walk me through the calculation and the trade-off that's led you to decide,

1151
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,680
hey, I'm not carrying a smartphone and I'm happier for it.

1152
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:24,960
I was pretty simple. I mean, I didn't have to give anything up because I never had a smartphone. So

1153
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:29,040
I never, the idea of sending an email while you're walking down the street is like insane to me,

1154
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:33,680
right? I mean, I just like, that's something that happens at your desk when you're working. And when

1155
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,360
you're walking down the street, you want to be in the street, you know, A, so you don't get run over

1156
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:43,120
by a truck, B, so that you can observe this. I live in New York City, at Lower East Side Manhattan,

1157
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:48,240
like this sort of bounty of human experience, the sheer craziness and wonderment of being part of

1158
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:54,720
human society in New York City or anywhere. I mean, that's, I want that, right? When I'm walking

1159
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:59,040
down the street, that's what I want to be experiencing. And when I'm at home working at

1160
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:05,520
my desk and I got to deal with email, which is such a sort of tax on our, on our energy and our

1161
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:10,640
time, you know, I want to confine that as much as possible. It's drudgery. And I don't want to

1162
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:16,560
invading something sort of to me precious, which is the experience of being alive. I will also say

1163
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:24,240
that, you know, I wrote a book called freedom, uh, how humans maintain their autonomy in the face

1164
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:31,280
of more powerful forces, more powerful societies or pressors. Um, one of the main ways in a modern

1165
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:36,480
society that people get deprived of their freedom is through addiction. We're an enormously addicted

1166
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:41,040
society. You are addicted to drugs, they're addicted to television, addicted to social media,

1167
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:51,840
to the extent that you're addicted, you are unfree. And, um, uh, the tech giants that develop social

1168
01:56:51,840 --> 01:57:00,640
media, um, figured out there are algorithms that elicit a, an essentially addictive, compulsive

1169
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:08,080
response to social media engagement. Like they deliberately figured out the math of how to

1170
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:18,880
addict people to their iPhones, right? To social media. That addiction has relate, has resulted in,

1171
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:26,480
they've clearly correlated depression and anxiety and suicide in teenagers, particularly teenage

1172
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:33,920
girls, starting with the advent of Facebook in, I believe it was 2012, right? They, they watched the

1173
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:40,480
line shoot upwards with the use of social media. It was, it's an algorithm that has killed people,

1174
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:46,560
right? Young people, it had, they, they have blood on their hands because of this algorithm.

1175
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:52,400
And so one of the things I don't want to do is find, I know I would be just as addicted to that

1176
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:57,280
stuff as anybody else, right? I mean, I mean, I, you know, we all have an potentially addictive

1177
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:05,920
personality and I don't want to be that guy walking down the street completely submerged in, in an

1178
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:13,600
environment which is designed to addict me further and further, uh, and then monetize my addiction.

1179
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:18,800
Right. I mean, I think, you know, I like, I'll, I'll, I'll just go walk down the street on my own

1180
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,040
and I'll check my email when I get back home and all the other stuff that the iPhone offers. And

1181
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:28,320
again, it's a little minor miracle. You have all of human knowledge, you know, at your fingertips.

1182
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:32,720
I'm not sure I want all of human knowledge in my pocket. If it gets all of human knowledge at my

1183
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:37,600
desk is an amazing thing in my pocket. Maybe not. You know, do I need Google maps to get from here

1184
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,640
to there? No, I don't. Right. I know the sun rises in the East. I can put a map in my back pocket.

1185
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:48,160
Like I can figure it out. Thank you. Do I need to, you know, whatever can't, you know, get a car,

1186
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:52,560
you know, a ride, you know, you know, an Uber with my iPhone. Yeah, that would be convenient,

1187
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,880
but I can also stick, stick on my arm and get a taxi. There are workarounds for all the stuff

1188
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:03,040
that the iPhone offers you and you avoid the enormous downside of compulsive, addictive

1189
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:08,160
behavior and all the anxiety and depression that that statistically, um, gives rise to.

1190
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,400
Does your wife have a smartphone?

1191
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:17,600
She does. And I mean, obviously you respect her decision and she respects yours. Um,

1192
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:25,280
do you feel that there are some people who are just able to utilize it for the benefits and not

1193
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:29,520
succumb to the challenges? And do you, are you, are you simply taking a cautionary approach in

1194
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:33,680
your own, in your own life? Yeah. I mean, she's very deliberately and consciously,

1195
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:39,520
particularly around the girls does not, does not do that behavior, that sort of obsessive behavior.

1196
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:46,560
I mean, the weird thing about email and texting, I mean, for most of your, in most of your life,

1197
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:52,080
if you have something to do, a chore to do, shovel that pile of dirt over there,

1198
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:59,360
the more you shovel, the less work is left. The weird thing about email is that the more you do,

1199
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:05,760
the more you have to do the, the Greek myth of Sisyphus, right? The never ending task.

1200
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:12,800
That's email, right? And the harder you work at it, the more email you generate back at you

1201
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:18,240
that you then try to do as quickly as possible, which generates more. And you know, it's, it will,

1202
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:22,240
it's going to kill you. And my wife doesn't do that, right? I mean, she just, half the time she

1203
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:25,760
leaves the house and she doesn't even have her iPhone because she forgot it. Like, I mean, she's,

1204
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:30,960
she's, she uses it in the way that I think, you know, in an extremely healthy way. And she,

1205
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:36,400
she is very, very careful not to exhibit those behaviors. And, but I'll tell you what my little

1206
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:41,280
girl, I mean, my little girl has had virtually no screen time in her entire life. She doesn't have a

1207
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:47,920
tablet. Like we do not own television. She, when we take a long drive somewhere, she gets bored.

1208
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:52,960
She looks out the window, she whistles, she sings, she goes to sleep. She did, she does what we,

1209
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,680
people of our generation or my generation did when we were young is we got bored and we learned to

1210
02:00:57,680 --> 02:01:02,640
entertain ourselves with little stories in her mind or what have you. And that's how she,

1211
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:08,960
my daughter deals with it. So she has a completely screen free existence. And

1212
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:16,480
but if you give her an iPhone, the first thing she does is get, get addicted to it, right? She starts,

1213
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:20,800
I don't know how, I mean, she's four. How did she learn this? Like, this, I mean, the design is so

1214
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:27,440
intuitive that even an uninitiated three-year-old can learn it within minutes. And then the only

1215
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:33,440
thing she wants to do is play with that phone, right? So that to me is like, oh, they knew what

1216
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:39,040
they were doing. It worked. They figured it out. They hooked a three-year-old within minutes.

1217
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:43,120
If that's not evil, what is, right? So, you know, we don't even let her near that thing.

1218
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:50,320
How much of your philosophy around, you know, having your kids sleep with you, not having

1219
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:55,120
a smartphone, et cetera, how much of that do you think is influenced by your time in combat? So

1220
02:01:55,680 --> 02:02:04,800
as a thought experiment, let's go back to 1985. You ultimately decide, you know, I want to be a

1221
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:10,240
lawyer. You go to law school, you're, so you're, you're living in, you know, lower East side right

1222
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:16,240
now. You're working for a law firm. Everything else is the same about you. You've married the

1223
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:20,400
same woman. You have the same kids. Again, it's a silly thought experiment. Yeah. Do you think you

1224
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:25,760
carry a smartphone? And think of it less through the lens of, well, as a lawyer, it might be

1225
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,920
expected that I need to have my phone on me 24 seven. It's less through that lens and more

1226
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:34,640
through the philosophical lens I'm asking this question. So if I were young, I mean, I think

1227
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:39,760
it's more a cultural thing. Like if I were young, if I were 25 and came of age when all this stuff

1228
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:44,880
was normal, I, you know, I would, I mean, I would probably have one of them, right? You know, I mean,

1229
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:50,960
I think you're younger, younger than me. I'm 59, right? So what, what I didn't do was

1230
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:58,400
adopt it in midlife. And there was something about the behaviors of people with iPhones that

1231
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:02,960
I just thought, I don't want to look like that. Right. I mean, occasionally I smoke a cigarette,

1232
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:08,000
right? One of the things I don't, you know, and I see smokers standing, you know, furtively outside,

1233
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,200
you know, you know, doorways in midtown, smoking their, their, their noon cigarette. And even though

1234
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:18,480
I can enjoy a cigarette, there's something about the addictive, the visuals of that addiction.

1235
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:22,400
That's so mortifying, right? I'm like, I don't want to be that person. Right? That's how I feel

1236
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:28,400
about the iPhone. So I think it's more, I don't, it's not combat, right? I, you know, I studied

1237
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:34,000
anthropology. I see that through that human life, through that lens. I think about what are

1238
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:44,160
healthy human behaviors. I married a like-minded person, a like-minded woman. So fortunately,

1239
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:49,680
she and I see absolutely eye to eye about that stuff. I have the reinforcement of other like-minded

1240
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:57,200
people. There's a wonderful website called evolutionary parenting, www.evolutionaryparenting.com

1241
02:03:57,200 --> 02:04:03,280
that basically walks you through how to raise your child in an evolutionarily consistent way

1242
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:09,760
in modern society, like taking into account the obvious sort of context of all this. How can you

1243
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:15,440
keep, you know, within sort of normal sensible norms, how can you keep your parenting within a

1244
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:21,280
way that's sort of evolutionarily healthy and consistent? What do they say about food,

1245
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:26,320
for example? I think this would be, I mean, there's the obvious, right? Don't feed them things that,

1246
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:31,040
you know, are pure crap. But do they talk to anything else about food and eating and rituals

1247
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:36,880
and things like that? You know, they might. I mean, they're more of a behavior thing. And,

1248
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:44,560
you know, children are not out to foil your training, right? They're not out to foil your

1249
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,760
plans. Like when three-year-olds have temper tantrums, they're not being, quote, bad, right?

1250
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:54,400
It's part of a process of neurological development that they have to go through. And when you

1251
02:04:55,040 --> 02:05:01,600
pathologize normal developmental stages and normal child behavior, like crying when you

1252
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:06,560
stick them in a dark room, when you pathologize that, they're doing something that they're

1253
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:11,760
evolutionarily wired to do. They're moving through neurological stages, development stages

1254
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:15,840
in a normal and healthy way. And when you pathologize it because it makes your life

1255
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:22,000
inconvenient, you know, eventually they will learn norms that abide by

1256
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:28,800
your preferences. But that doesn't mean it's good for them. It means it's convenient for you. And

1257
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:35,520
so what this website does is talk about those norms and get you to understand those behaviors

1258
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:42,960
in sort of evolutionary terms. So the, you know, my daughter, she, you know, every time she sees a

1259
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,960
sparkly, glittery object, she wants it. You can't walk through the damn pharmacy without her saying,

1260
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:53,120
I want that. I want that. I want that. Is she an abnormally materialistic, acquisitive girl? No.

1261
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:59,120
She's exhibiting absolutely healthy hunter-gatherer norms about acquisition of appealing things.

1262
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:03,760
Right. And, and so when you, you don't want to pathologize it, you don't want to get her everything

1263
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:08,640
either, but, but you have to put it in a proper evolutionary context in order to have patients

1264
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:13,520
with it. And that's what this website does. I cannot wait to check that out actually.

1265
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:20,240
You've alluded to it briefly in our discussion and I've heard you speak about it before, but

1266
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:30,720
you recently had a very near death experience. Tell me a little bit about that.

1267
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:37,200
Yeah. You as a doctor will know what these numbers mean. So I had a question about,

1268
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:47,680
you as a doctor will know what these numbers mean. So I had, I have an anatomical sort of

1269
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:53,440
anomaly in my abdomen. My celiac artery has been compressed by my median arcuate ligament,

1270
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:58,560
which is in the wrong place. And it's completely occluded the celiac artery. So the blood was

1271
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:05,440
forced to flow throughout my entire lifetime. It was not asymptomatic in me. The blood was

1272
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:10,960
forced to flow through smaller sort of sub arteries that feed the pancreas and the duodenum

1273
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:17,280
and I guess other digestive organs. And those little arteries, those arteries are smaller

1274
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:24,960
and not designed to take the full blood flow that the celiac carries. And over the course of

1275
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:29,520
presumably many years, I hope it was a long time because I don't want this to happen again.

1276
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:37,200
One of the arteries in the pancreatic duodenal artery, one of the little arteries developed an

1277
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:43,200
aneurysm. And then for about six months, I had this really awful pain in my upper abdomen

1278
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:48,240
that came and went. And just being a stupid guy, I never went to the doctor. I'm like,

1279
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:52,720
if you can bear the pain, it's probably not going to kill you. What was the pain like?

1280
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:58,800
It would come and go. And it was a kind of searing, cramping, slightly nauseous pain. And it was

1281
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:08,720
I've been told that abdominal aneurysms can cause pain and there's a big nerve center right around

1282
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:14,720
the solar plexus. And I think maybe he was pushing on that, but it wasn't the pain of kidney stones,

1283
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:19,200
but it was way more than indigestion. I mean, I would sit down and have to wait it out when

1284
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,000
it happened. It was pretty awful. And what was the frequency of that?

1285
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:27,840
I don't know. Every couple of days, once a day, something like that, it would come and go,

1286
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:34,880
last half an hour, an hour, and then it would. And then after some months of that, I had a lot of

1287
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:40,160
other health problems. I was just important. I had sudden onset, severe adult allergies for some

1288
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:48,640
reason. No idea why. I just, I've always been a big runner and I had trouble running. I mean,

1289
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:55,440
just something was wrong with me. Right. And I couldn't figure it out. And then after some

1290
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:59,440
months of that, the pain suddenly went away and the allergies suddenly went away like overnight.

1291
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:06,160
I was like, oh great. I'm good. Right. And then within a few weeks, one afternoon,

1292
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:14,080
I had a dream, a horrible nightmare that I died. And I was in, you know, it was about six in the

1293
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:18,560
morning. I'm in bed with my family and everyone's asleep. And I had a dream that I died by some

1294
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:23,120
accident. It was an oversight and it was stupidity on my part. And I died and I was looking back at

1295
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:27,360
my family and they were grieving and I couldn't return to them because I'd crossed over. I was,

1296
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:33,760
I was like, oh, you idiot. You blew it. And I woke up just like incredibly shaken.

1297
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:39,600
And I'm not a doctor. I think that my artery had already started dissecting.

1298
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:44,880
Because the following morning I had sort of ongoing pain when I woke up in my,

1299
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:50,880
something was wrong and I still didn't go to the doctor. And that afternoon was a beautiful day

1300
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:54,960
and I was going to go running. And I was like, I'm not going to go running. I don't feel quite right.

1301
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:59,200
And within about half an hour, thank God I didn't go running. I would have died crawling around in

1302
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:05,520
the woods. Then about half an hour, I felt this surge of pain in my abdomen. I was like, Jesus,

1303
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:12,160
what is that? And flooded my entire abdomen. And I was like, damn, that is strange feeling.

1304
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:18,000
It wasn't unbearable, but it was, I'd never had that feeling before. And then within a few minutes,

1305
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:22,160
I tried to stand up and I almost fell over. My blood pressure apparently was just tanking.

1306
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:27,760
And what had happened was the artery, the aneurysm had ruptured and I was bleeding out

1307
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:32,960
into my abdomen. And of course I didn't know this. And I was in the woods with my wife and

1308
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:42,560
in a little cabin that I built. And she dragged me back out of the woods, me sort of stumbling

1309
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:48,880
and got me to the driveway and put me in the car so I could sit down. And I started to go blind.

1310
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:55,600
The sky turned electric white and that, that started to take over my entire field of vision.

1311
02:10:56,160 --> 02:11:00,880
And I was syncopic. I was in and out of consciousness and the paramedics got there.

1312
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:04,400
And by the time they got there, I was in something called a compensatory shock.

1313
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:09,120
And so I suddenly I sort of revived. I was like feeling okay. And the paramedics were like,

1314
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:12,800
you know, we're good. We think you dehydrated. It's a hot day. Just sit and drink some water.

1315
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:17,840
You'll probably feel better. And I was like, all right, that sounds good. And my wife is like,

1316
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:21,360
you know, he went blind a few minutes ago. Like you're taking him to the ER.

1317
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:25,760
So they took me to the ER and about halfway there I lost.

1318
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:26,720
And it was very far, right?

1319
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:31,440
Yeah, I took them an hour and a half. It was an hour and a half before I got to the ER.

1320
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:36,960
Right. And I lost my bowel control on the way there. And I was like, all right,

1321
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:42,640
I went blind for a while and I lost my bowels. Like that's probably not a good sign. Like

1322
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:48,400
something's wrong. And I got to the ER and the medic who I tracked down later,

1323
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:53,120
the guy in the back of the ambulance with me, he said, we got to the ER and you just tanked.

1324
02:11:53,680 --> 02:12:00,240
You sure turned white as a sheet. And my hemoglobin was one point two.

1325
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:06,640
And the ER doctors are like, you can't. I mean, they I think they never

1326
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:11,120
sort of incompatible with life. Yeah, it was. And that's where I was at. I was, I, they,

1327
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:16,000
I think I had probably lost about 90% of my blood. I mean, I don't know. I was still conscious.

1328
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,200
I was in and out of conscious. How much IV fluid had they given you in the ambulance?

1329
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,160
I just put a bag in my arm. Just a single bag?

1330
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:27,600
Yeah, a couple bags. I don't know. But I got to the ER and I was one point two. My blood pressure

1331
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:34,400
was 60 over 40. And the doctor asked permission to cut into my neck, to put a line into my neck.

1332
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:39,680
I think it would be my carotid or my jugular. I don't know. Jugular. Okay. And I said,

1333
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:44,000
I mean, in case there's an emergency, I had no idea I was dying. And I said, in case there's

1334
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,160
an emergency, he was like, this is the emergency right now. I was like, yeah, you got permission.

1335
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:55,440
So we started cutting my neck, you know, whatever they do. And and then I start then that and I,

1336
02:12:55,440 --> 02:13:00,720
and basically that was when I die. I started to die. So my, a big black pit opened up underneath

1337
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:06,800
me and I started to get pulled down into it. And I said to the doctor, you got to hurry. You're

1338
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:12,160
losing me right now. Did you say that? Or did you think that? I said that to him. I said, doc,

1339
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:16,560
you got to hurry. You're losing me right now. I can feel myself going. And then my dead father

1340
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:22,480
appeared. Now I just want to stop and say, I'm an atheist. My father was a physicist. I'm not

1341
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:28,240
religious. I'm not a supernaturalist. I'm not a mystic. I don't believe in anything. I can't

1342
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:34,960
measure and can't test. Right. And my father was the same way. And he appeared above me

1343
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:45,120
and a kind of presence. And he was, he seemed to be welcoming me. Right. And I wanted to have

1344
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:51,280
nothing to do with him. And it wasn't a conversation. It was a communication and he wasn't,

1345
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:57,920
I couldn't see him. I could feel him. He was a presence. And I was like, basically not now dad,

1346
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:00,800
like, I don't want to have anything. I love you, but I don't want to have anything to do with you

1347
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:05,680
right now. I want to, you know, I'm staying, I want to stay here. I'm nothing to do with what,

1348
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:10,720
you know, that, whatever that is. And how long earlier had your dad passed away?

1349
02:14:12,160 --> 02:14:17,360
Nine years earlier. And you were with him when he died, if I recall, I was holding his hand. Yeah.

1350
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:27,760
And so, you know, I very spotty memory after that. I remember the doctor saying to the

1351
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:35,120
whoever was pushing me, go as fast as you can without running, without actually running,

1352
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:40,240
go as fast as you can. I think was to the cath lab. And do you remember them putting the breathing

1353
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:47,760
tube in your mouth? I can't remember if I remember or not. I was in and out of consciousness. I

1354
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:57,760
remember they put me in a CAT scan, right? And they get, and they had to, they had to shave me

1355
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:06,000
they put a line in my groin, right? And I wanted to joke with them. I was like, I was, I almost

1356
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,520
said, I'm sorry, I forgot to shave down there this morning, right? I was, I was trying to make them

1357
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:16,720
laugh for some reason. I don't know, like a very wacky like sensibility. And, and they put a line

1358
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:21,120
in my groin and they put, and I think they had trouble seeing where the bleed was because I had

1359
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:27,280
so much blood. I've been bleeding into my abdomen for an hour and a half, right? And luckily, I'm

1360
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:31,200
a long distance runner. I got a good heart. I mean, the doctor said, if you weren't really top

1361
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:34,240
shape, you would have just died, you would have died. You would have gotten into cardiac arrest

1362
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:39,360
and your kidneys would have failed and it would have been over. And it took them another eight

1363
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:44,960
hours to find the leak. I mean, I was on the fluoroscope for so long that I got radiation

1364
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:49,600
burns on my back. Two weeks later, the square red patch appeared on my back because I had so much

1365
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:54,400
radiation. And I remember at one point the doctors looking at each other like, and I know this kind

1366
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:59,680
of thing is very hard to fix. And it was in the middle of the night in a small hospital on Cape

1367
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:04,400
Cod, Hyannis Hospital. And I remember the doctors looking at each other literally are like,

1368
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:09,600
what do we do? Like we can't find it. Like, what do we do? And I remember thinking, oh guys,

1369
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:16,000
tell me you don't tell me I just didn't see that exchange. And, but they, they were heroes. They

1370
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:22,720
pulled it off. They finally found it and they, they embolized it with catheter embolism. And

1371
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:28,640
they gave me 10 units of blood. I wound up getting 10 units of blood and they saved my life.

1372
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:30,800
How long were you in the ICU?

1373
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:33,040
Five days.

1374
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:36,000
Do you remember much of that?

1375
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:43,440
Oh yeah. I woke up the next morning. And I had no idea that I'd almost died. And

1376
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:51,920
the, the nurse came in and experienced nurse, you know, in their fifties or sixties, maybe even.

1377
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:56,560
And, and she said, listen, you almost died yesterday. You're, you are the luckiest guy

1378
02:16:56,560 --> 02:17:01,280
we, any of us know. Like you should have died. We can't believe you survived that. Like, and

1379
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:08,400
I was horrified. You know, I gave these two little girls and I was absolutely traumatized

1380
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:13,360
by that news. I had no idea it almost died. And I thought about it. I sat there, I was throwing up

1381
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:20,720
blood pretty regularly. I don't know how the blood got into my stomach, but it did. And, and, and,

1382
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:25,200
and, uh, she came back an hour later and said, Hey, how are you doing? And I said, I lied. I was

1383
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:29,200
like, yeah, I'm doing okay physically, but honestly, I'm struggling with what you told me.

1384
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:34,400
It's terrifying that you can almost die in your own, in front of your family, in your own driveway,

1385
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:40,320
when you're a very healthy person on a nice June day. Like, are you kidding? That can happen. Like,

1386
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:44,480
I don't have heart problems. I don't have anything. Like you can just, you can, the universe can just

1387
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:53,840
take you out. And I was like totally traumatized by that. And she said, try thinking about that

1388
02:17:54,480 --> 02:18:01,360
as a sacred experience rather than a scary experience. And then she walked out of the room

1389
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:07,040
and I've been thinking about that my whole life. Like, yeah, I was given a glimpse of the mystery,

1390
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:10,800
you know, the great mystery of death. And I was given a, I was allowed to look at it

1391
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:16,400
and allowed to survive the look at it. And I got brought back. And then I started to do some

1392
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:20,880
research. I mean, first of all, I can't tell you how traumatizing that whole thing was. Combat's

1393
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:29,360
nothing compared to that. That really messed me up. And, um, this was June of 19 or 20, June of 20.

1394
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:36,080
And, um, you know, I just got paranoid that I could, that that could happen at any moment,

1395
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:39,280
anywhere. Had I been on an airplane, I would have died. Had I been on a walk in the woods,

1396
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:42,960
I would have died. Had I been almost anywhere but where I was, I would have died. And I got,

1397
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:48,240
maybe super paranoid. It was extremely traumatic. At least combat you can leave behind and you come

1398
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:54,720
home and you're not going to, you know, and, um, I, uh, I started to look into near death experiences

1399
02:18:54,720 --> 02:19:02,720
by people. And, you know, imagine my surprise that an awful lot of people see the black pit.

1400
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:09,600
A lot of, awful lot of people have dead relatives, you know, at the thresholds to engage with them.

1401
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:14,080
And it really got me sort of interested in what the hell, you know, what is this? Like,

1402
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:20,080
are we really sure? And I know this is going to sound completely flaky, but it really aroused my

1403
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:25,120
curiosity about this consistency of experience across many different societies, many different

1404
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:33,120
kinds of people. And, and, and you were irreproducible through, um, you know, low, low blood

1405
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:39,280
oxygen, ketamine, endogenous DMT, all the things that happen in the dying brain. If you reproduce

1406
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:46,000
those things artificially, people don't have the near death experiences. Um, you have to, you seem

1407
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:51,280
to have to be kind of dying to have them. And it made me really, it really made me start to wonder,

1408
02:19:51,280 --> 02:20:00,320
wow, like maybe it isn't just nothing. Like maybe there is some other dimension that some kind of

1409
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:06,960
existence continues on that we just don't understand or even don't even have brains developed enough to

1410
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:12,640
capable of understanding it. Maybe it's possible. And I know there's been some research in quantum

1411
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:19,680
physics trying to understand a possible post-death existence in terms of quantum physics and quantum

1412
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:23,280
fluctuation and all that stuff. I mean, these are people who are a lot smarter than me. And I, you

1413
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:28,640
know, I don't know if I'd even understand it, but it did get me sort of intrigued in an empirical

1414
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:35,280
sense of like, do we actually, are we actually completely sure that there's nothing because that

1415
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:40,640
not, that's not what the experience, that is not what my experience of it was. You've obviously

1416
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:44,480
read about other people's experiences. Have you spoken with other people who have experienced this?

1417
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:51,120
Not face to face, literally spoken. I've had some, you know, I've talked about this on some podcasts

1418
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:57,200
and people have reached out, you know, via Facebook or whatever social media that I do have on my

1419
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:02,640
laptop. And, you know, with messages about, yeah, something like that happened to me and I had the

1420
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:09,520
exact same experience or a similar one, you know, so I have had some affirmation, not only

1421
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:16,720
of the mystery of it, but of the trauma of it. Have you spoken with any neuroscientists about it?

1422
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:22,320
I mean, I'm curious what sort of biological explanations could exist for this.

1423
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:27,840
Well, I've read some papers on it. I haven't spoken to neuroscientists, but I've read some papers by

1424
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:35,440
doctors and medical researchers and possibly your neuroscientists sort of trying to explain

1425
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:41,200
the phenomenon in terms of neurochemistry, right? And so there is a, you can give, ketamine is

1426
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,480
released in the dying brain. You can give someone ketamine and they'll have all kinds of visions and

1427
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:51,760
all kinds of stuff. They won't necessarily see their dead father, right? You can deprive someone

1428
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:59,200
of oxygen so that the blood levels of oxygen are very low. They don't necessarily have the

1429
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:07,040
experience of the dying person. There's something called DMT. I think it's akin to ecstasy,

1430
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:13,600
the drug ecstasy. Well, that's MDMA. Do you mean DMT or MDMA? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1431
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:21,200
Okay. Yeah. MDMA. I'm not actually, now I can't remember. You're right. I actually can't remember.

1432
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:27,200
It's one of the two, but there's an endogenous compound that is also a drug that can be,

1433
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:32,320
that is released in the dying brain. And so step in if you know which it is, now I can't remember.

1434
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:41,600
But again, it doesn't produce some of the hallmark experiences of near death. So there is an ongoing

1435
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:45,120
mystery about exactly what this is. And not, you know, it may be completely- It could be the

1436
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:51,360
situation, right? It could be that those chemicals alone are insufficient to elicit that response.

1437
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:55,200
They have to be combined with the belief that you're dying, right? Maybe that's the-

1438
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:03,120
Well, here's the thing. I had no idea I was dying. And I'm guessing a lot of dying people

1439
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:08,400
don't realize they're dying. I mean, I don't know, but I'm guessing by the time you're dying,

1440
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:14,800
your brain is so fuzzy and addled that you may not even be able to be understanding of it. I mean,

1441
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:22,240
and depending on the kind of death, of course, but I had no idea. I mean, the guy wanted to cut

1442
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:26,560
into my neck and I was like, you mean in case there's an emergency? Like why would you do that?

1443
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:31,520
Like I had no idea. So you were in the ICU for five days. You're in the hospital presumably

1444
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:37,040
for another few days. How long until you were back home? I think I came home on the seventh day.

1445
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:43,280
And what was your recovery like physically? I mean, I had a huge hematoma in my abdomen. So

1446
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:48,320
I had a huge amount of dead blood and, you know, it took months for my body to process that.

1447
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:54,160
I mean, pretty quickly I was walking and then running and, you know, my physical activity was

1448
02:23:54,160 --> 02:24:00,480
really constrained by my paranoia, my medical paranoia. You know, I mean, I was like, God,

1449
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:03,600
maybe I should rent an apartment next to the hospital. You know, I mean, not literally,

1450
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:08,560
but I sort of joked about it with my wife. Like it made, I mean, I, you know, that I survived an

1451
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:13,440
hour and a half like that was a miracle. Like I just didn't want to do anything that might make

1452
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:17,920
it hard for an, you know, an ambulance crew to get to me. So I definitely wasn't going to go running

1453
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:21,920
in the woods and all these things that are, I've been part of my life, my whole life. Like

1454
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:26,400
they were, suddenly they were terrifying to me. I became someone I didn't recognize.

1455
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:29,920
I mean, I became an incredibly for a while, an incredibly neurotic, fearful person.

1456
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:31,760
What chipped away at that?

1457
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:37,360
I'm still dealing with it, frankly, you know, and if I didn't have daughters, a family,

1458
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:43,600
I might be less worried about it, but I, you know, I don't want to go to Africa with my family and

1459
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:49,200
like expire on a transatlantic flight next to my kids, you know, like, and, you know, I'm so I

1460
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:55,760
need to make sure I, you know, I'm in the process of making sure that this kind of thing certainly

1461
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:00,320
or almost certainly can happen with any of the other small arteries. And I'm in the process of

1462
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:08,320
like nailing that down. But you know, as with combat trauma, the passage of time helps.

1463
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:14,800
But it really changed me. And I think might have changed me forever. I think my fear,

1464
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:19,200
I think I'm not sure that fear is going to entirely go away. Like there are certain loud noises. I

1465
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:22,640
just don't jump back because they sound like gunshots. I'm not sure that's ever going away.

1466
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:29,520
Have you been able to sort of incorporate the wisdom from that nurse?

1467
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:36,640
Yeah, I've been working at it. You know, I'm an anthropologist friend of mine said that's,

1468
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:41,840
you know, you had a classic shamanic journey. I mean, this shaman goes to the sort of threshold

1469
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:46,320
of death encounters the afterworld and comes back with some information. You your whole life

1470
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:50,720
has gone have gone to places of death, places where death is happening to people and might happen to

1471
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:56,640
you. And you know, war zones and you come back and you have some information for people. And

1472
02:25:56,640 --> 02:26:02,480
so maybe you can look at this journey and I hate that word journey because it's, you know, sort of

1473
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:08,880
misused sometimes. But, you know, if you, if you look at it as a kind of journalistic journey,

1474
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:15,760
what information are you coming back with that might be useful to other people and yourself and

1475
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:23,440
that I'm working on. And I'm going to write a book called pulse about what happened to me

1476
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:32,640
physically, but also what the consequences were psychologically and what the possibilities are

1477
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:38,000
metaphysically. I want to talk to a quantum physicist about quantum fluctuation and the

1478
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:42,720
enduring, you know, the possible enduring nature of the soul, you know, etc. And I just want to

1479
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:49,280
not to confirm. I mean, none of this is possible to prove, but I would like to walk through the

1480
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:56,160
possibilities to see what might be the explanation from my experience. When you think about the

1481
02:26:56,160 --> 02:27:04,320
PTSD associated with this particular event, does it manifest more with depression or more with

1482
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:12,240
anxiety? Anxiety, anxiety for sure. Was that also true of the combat PTSD?

1483
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:23,360
It was until Tim got killed. And then, and I was, it was, I was in my first marriage.

1484
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:32,240
And I've talked about this before. So it's, you know, we lost a, we lost a pregnancy.

1485
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:38,960
And we found out right when, right when Tim was killed. And the timing was weird enough that

1486
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:48,160
I, it was pretty complicated psychologically for me. And that actually, that for the first time in

1487
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:56,480
my life sent me into a, like a real depression, like a dangerous depression. And I felt removed,

1488
02:27:58,160 --> 02:28:04,400
completely removed and isolated from every person I loved, including my wife at the time. Like, I

1489
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,800
felt like I was living behind bulletproof, bulletproof plexiglass and couldn't escape.

1490
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:19,040
And it was, it was a dangerous, dangerous feeling. And, you know, I, I figured it out, but it was a,

1491
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:23,280
it was a very, very unpleasant time in my life. What do you think was the most important

1492
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:26,480
factor or factors that, that helped you emerge from that?

1493
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:33,680
Boy, that's a good question. I mean, I was talking to somebody, you know, a professional about it that

1494
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:41,760
helped. I, I was married to someone I really loved, but the marriage wasn't working. And

1495
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:46,640
eventually we both sort of like confronted that and acknowledged it. And we ended the marriage

1496
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:50,320
and that was very painful, but it felt like a healthy step. We're still friends. You know,

1497
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:55,200
we did it, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't, the marriage didn't work, but the divorce did,

1498
02:28:55,200 --> 02:29:03,520
you know what I mean? Like we, we, we, and I stopped, I, I'd started drinking a little

1499
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:08,080
more than I probably should have. I mean, I've never, you know, by no means was an alcoholic,

1500
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:14,240
but I, I had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and I, I stopped drinking. I had atrial

1501
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:18,000
fibrillation, which is an arrhythmia in my heart. And I was told, you know, I fixed that. I had a,

1502
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:23,520
an ablation that fixed it completely. But the doctor said, you know, you know, alcohol can

1503
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,760
trigger, try not drinking. And I didn't drink for a month and I felt so good. Like I, I, I

1504
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:31,360
like sort of turned the corner and all of a sudden I was starting to feel like a healthy person,

1505
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:34,640
emotionally healthy person. There's a lot of, there's a lot of different things,

1506
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:39,520
a lot of different things. How much did other people, outside of the therapist,

1507
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:44,080
how much did other people contribute to the improvement in your wellbeing? Again,

1508
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:48,640
I'm thinking about kind of the tribe, right? Who was your tribe at that point in life? You'd

1509
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:53,680
obviously lost a very important member of your tribe. If I'm doing the math correctly,

1510
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:56,960
you would go on to lose another important member of the tribe, being your father.

1511
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:05,440
So who were the important members of your, of your tribe and is it necessary that they

1512
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:12,000
understand what you've been through, right? So can people who didn't know Tim or who have not been

1513
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:21,200
in combat be a part of your healing? So I, I, I met someone else and remarried and she

1514
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:25,040
had been through some pretty tough things herself.

1515
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:31,520
Not combat, obviously, not obviously it could have been, but it wasn't.

1516
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:36,960
And there was something about her compassion and understanding

1517
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:44,960
that was enormously helpful to me. That was, that was really quite profound. And

1518
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:52,400
I mean, the problem with depression, I mean, the problem with anxiety is it doesn't make sense.

1519
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:58,960
Right? You're anxious, you know, you're anxious about something that isn't rational. So being

1520
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:02,960
told rationally, you don't have to worry about this. You're not going to get another

1521
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:07,520
arterial rupture. It never, it's not going to happen. Statistically, you're fine.

1522
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:13,520
You have to deal with the emotional, you have to, the anxiety isn't necessarily turned

1523
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:21,520
tied to reality. Well, likewise with depression, like you can be very depressed and the, the

1524
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:26,320
fraternity of other people, the love of other people might not reach you because the nature

1525
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:31,280
of depression is that you're at the bottom of the ocean. Right? I mean, you're, you're like,

1526
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:36,000
you can't reach me. I know you're talking to me. I know you love me. I see your lips moving,

1527
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:43,120
but you don't understand where I am. You can't reach me here. Right? And so I mean, that's the,

1528
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:52,160
you know, I think one of the biggest things that helps someone in that, those circumstances,

1529
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:57,520
it's feeling needed and feeling useful and being asked to contribute. Like, look, bro,

1530
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:02,480
you might be depressed, but we need you to stay in guard duty for a while, or you need to kill

1531
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:08,880
that elk. Or, you know, we need some sandbags. The river's rising. Like you, people, when people

1532
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:15,360
are needed by the group, they click into this thing that actually improves their own psychological

1533
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:21,520
state of mind. I mean, the admissions, the psych wards in London during the blitz went down,

1534
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:24,720
went down during the blitz during the bombings. Right?

1535
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:28,000
As did depression post 9 11 suicide, post 9 11.

1536
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:35,680
That's right. So the crisis in genders is a kind of call to action, which gets, allows people

1537
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:44,880
to be, to buffer themselves from their psychological troubles. And, you know, I think that the love of

1538
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:51,440
one person sometimes is quite painful to experience because you realize that that person who loves you

1539
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:59,760
can't reach you where you are. Right. And, but being needed is a different thing. And, and,

1540
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:05,840
you know, I think ultimately that's, that sense of being necessary might be the ultimate antidote

1541
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:12,160
to the experience of depression. You know, I remember really, I've always been

1542
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:21,600
very fascinated by the opioid epidemic. And so I was very attuned to how much of a problem it was,

1543
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:30,000
you know, years and years ago. And I remember really naively thinking as the pandemic took hold

1544
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:36,400
in late March, early April of 2020, I wonder if this is a crisis that will make people better.

1545
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:42,640
I wonder if this is a crisis that will improve the collective state of our emotional health

1546
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:47,760
in the way that previous crises had, you alluded to them, right? The great depression,

1547
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:53,760
world war two, 9 11. And of course the answer turned out to be no. Right. For most people,

1548
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:59,120
or at least on average, the answer was not yes, at least as it's been borne out by statistics in

1549
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:06,320
terms of the rates of accidental overdoses, which is a crisis that will improve the collective state

1550
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:13,360
of temper. It was more or less the two. And to second I was sort of guilty at the beginning

1551
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:24,080
of your

1552
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:29,360
case that things were completely destroyed due to the chemical requirements.

1553
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:33,140
And

1554
02:34:33,140 --> 02:34:40,820
it's sort of really naive to think that that could possibly have the opposite effect. Is it obvious to you now?

1555
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:52,820
Is it the isolation of the pandemic that is almost assuredly what fueled that? Or why was that not a crisis that did better?

1556
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:55,620
I think a couple of reasons. First of all,

1557
02:34:55,860 --> 02:35:04,340
what we were asked to do to protect the nation was to isolate from each other, right? Because it was a pandemic.

1558
02:35:06,740 --> 02:35:14,420
And humans in a crisis want to come together, physically come together, like within proximity,

1559
02:35:14,420 --> 02:35:19,060
physical touching of each other. That's what makes people feel safe. And again, that's why children

1560
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:24,020
feel safe when they sleep with their parents. They can touch their parents. They feel them

1561
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:27,860
and that reduces their anxiety and they sleep very deeply, right? And they will get a good

1562
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:31,620
night's sleep and so will the parents if they're not stuck in a dark room. Well likewise, when

1563
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:38,100
you're scared, if you're facing a crisis, the proximity of others, it raises oxytocin levels,

1564
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:43,140
it raises testosterone levels of men. It does all kinds of good things that allow the group

1565
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:48,420
to deal with the crisis. This was a crisis that did the opposite. It alienated people,

1566
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:56,020
it isolated people. And isolation we know very often leads to depression. And you know,

1567
02:35:56,020 --> 02:36:00,180
just ask someone who's done a weak and solitary confinement at a federal penitentiary what the

1568
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:06,820
effects of isolation are, right? I mean, that's where they'd rather be electrocuted, right?

1569
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:12,580
They'd rather have their meals taken away, anything, right? Then just please don't stick me in a hole

1570
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:17,540
by myself. It's the hardest thing for humans. And that's basically what we were asked to do. And

1571
02:36:17,540 --> 02:36:22,340
understandably it was a pandemic. But the other thing is that there was no unity of purpose. The

1572
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:29,300
political leadership was completely contradictory about what it meant to be a good American.

1573
02:36:30,100 --> 02:36:35,940
And so on the one hand, you had knowledgeable people saying being a good American means wearing

1574
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:40,180
a mask and social distancing and eventually getting your vaccine, right? And then you had

1575
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:46,820
political leadership that was like, you don't know what, no, it actually means not wearing a mask and

1576
02:36:46,820 --> 02:36:52,820
not social distancing and not getting a vaccine. And so the discordant contradictory messages

1577
02:36:53,540 --> 02:37:01,220
from the upper, upper echelons of our society, I think made people crazy, right? There was no way

1578
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:06,340
to feel like, oh, I'm saving aluminum cans. Am I going to give them to, you know, like once a week,

1579
02:37:06,340 --> 02:37:10,420
I'm going to take them down to the, you know, the scrap metal drive in my little town because the

1580
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:15,140
troops overseas need the metal. Like there was no unity of purpose there because we were being told

1581
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:22,100
completely contradictory things by the political leadership. Yeah. And I suspect, well, it's

1582
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:27,700
interesting, right? The depression, there wasn't an external enemy in the way that there was in

1583
02:37:27,700 --> 02:37:35,220
World War II or post 9 11. And yet that unity could still exist, suggesting that even an infectious

1584
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:42,180
agent, though not an enemy per se, it's hard to be angry at a virus, if handled correctly, potentially

1585
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:47,380
could have been more, at least less damaging. I don't want to say more unifying given the

1586
02:37:47,380 --> 02:37:52,980
isolation requirements at the time, but could have been less destructive, I suppose.

1587
02:37:53,860 --> 02:38:00,260
Had Donald Trump come out and said, it's your patriotic duty to wear a mask and a social

1588
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:05,300
distance. And you know what? If you get the vaccine, I know maybe you're worried about it.

1589
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:10,580
Maybe you're scared of it. If you get the vaccine, you're a damn hero to this country. You know what

1590
02:38:10,580 --> 02:38:16,420
I mean? Like most of the country would have done it. And unfortunately, I don't know what

1591
02:38:16,420 --> 02:38:22,340
his calculus was, but unfortunately he didn't choose to do that. Even though he sort of mumbled

1592
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:25,940
at one point that you should wear a mask and he got himself a vaccine, right? And I'm sure the

1593
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:30,900
whole White House staff did, did all Fox news and all of CNN, you know, like everybody got the

1594
02:38:30,900 --> 02:38:40,820
vaccine. But the split messaging from that side of the American political environment was

1595
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:48,980
enormously confusing. And I mean, I happen to be a Democrat. I enormously respect elements of the

1596
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:55,460
conservative political ideal. I get it. I don't share it, but I get it. I respect it. That kind

1597
02:38:56,260 --> 02:39:03,060
of thing was really incredible. I found incredibly selfish and unbelievably anti-American and

1598
02:39:03,060 --> 02:39:06,420
unpatriotic for the Trump administration to engage in that stuff.

1599
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:11,780
Not to make this a political question, although it sounds like it coming on the heels of that,

1600
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:19,220
we're literally on the heels of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. I just mentioned I came back

1601
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:23,620
from a hunt and a number of the guys I hunt with are former special forces guys. And

1602
02:39:24,580 --> 02:39:29,140
a lot of the time around the camp was kind of talking about their experiences in Afghanistan

1603
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:36,180
and their views on the US withdrawal. I've received a number of questions from people

1604
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:39,620
on social media who knew I was going to be interviewing you, wanting your thoughts on

1605
02:39:41,300 --> 02:39:46,980
the manner of the withdrawal and whether it was necessary at all in the first place. So for

1606
02:39:46,980 --> 02:39:51,300
example, a lot of the seals I spoke with were adamant that this was not something that should

1607
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:56,900
have happened, right? That this was no longer actually a war. It was really more of a peacekeeping

1608
02:39:56,900 --> 02:40:04,100
operation and 5,000 troops could have stayed there indefinitely and kept the Taliban at bay.

1609
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:08,660
And still would have been a fraction of the number of troops that we have in Germany,

1610
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:14,900
for example, or South Korea or any number of the geographies of our allies.

1611
02:40:15,460 --> 02:40:17,940
What are your thoughts on that?

1612
02:40:19,060 --> 02:40:27,300
I would agree with your friends who said that. It was, I mean, there's 40,000 cops in New York City,

1613
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:35,140
right? I think when we finally withdrew the last troops, it was down to a couple thousand, 2,500?

1614
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:41,060
Yeah, 2,500 US and then including NATO, you can round up a bit and maybe call it 5,000,

1615
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:47,620
I think is what I read. So their ability to carry out targeted strikes, to carry out airstrikes,

1616
02:40:50,020 --> 02:40:55,940
just the sort of safety trip wire of American forces in Afghanistan would have essentially

1617
02:40:55,940 --> 02:41:01,780
guaranteed that the Taliban could not overrun the rest of the country. And I think the cost,

1618
02:41:01,780 --> 02:41:08,740
you know, at minimal cost in lives and treasure, if any, I mean, you know, the Taliban had not

1619
02:41:08,740 --> 02:41:14,900
attacked American forces since February of 2020. Right. Not a single American casualty since.

1620
02:41:15,460 --> 02:41:24,820
Right. Now, maybe that's because they knew that the Trump administration had negotiated a withdrawal

1621
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:29,060
and they knew we don't want to mess this up or just sit tight. So they, I mean, that's possible.

1622
02:41:29,060 --> 02:41:33,460
I don't know. Maybe if we decided to stay, it would have changed. But I think we could have

1623
02:41:33,460 --> 02:41:40,260
maintained troops there at minimal costs to this nation and at enormous benefit to the,

1624
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:46,820
to the Afghan people. Our big error there, in my opinion, I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair about

1625
02:41:46,820 --> 02:41:52,340
this recently, a few weeks ago. The reason the Taliban were allowed in by the Afghan

1626
02:41:52,340 --> 02:41:56,180
populace was that they promised to clean up corruption and they pretty much did.

1627
02:41:57,860 --> 02:42:02,100
You know, abusive, you know, abuse at the police checkpoints where you have to bribe the policemen

1628
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:06,980
to get through with your family. Every time you file a, you know, a piece of paper with the

1629
02:42:06,980 --> 02:42:13,380
government, you got to bribe the clerk. That's, you know, whatever that kind of awful endemic

1630
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:19,380
corruption that makes the lives of ordinary Afghans, ordinary people absolutely miserable

1631
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:26,500
and enriches at the top of the food chain makes these warlords and, and, and government ministers

1632
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:35,860
like obscenely wealthy. The Taliban cleaned that up. And our big mistake was that we stood up a

1633
02:42:35,860 --> 02:42:42,500
government in Afghanistan that was incredibly corrupt. We never insisted on any kind of

1634
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:48,100
accountability for the money we pumped in there. We pumped money in that we knew was going to these

1635
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:52,980
warlords, just enriching them to govern or corrupt governors and all that. It was an enormously

1636
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:59,860
abusive system and we didn't care. And we gave them the kind of government that Afghans don't

1637
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:04,420
want. And then Afghan soldiers, understandably, are not willing to die for it. We did it to

1638
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:09,220
ourselves. We didn't need to do that. We could have insisted on some accountability. But we

1639
02:43:09,220 --> 02:43:13,460
didn't do it. And it wasn't the military. It was the state department that was not interested in

1640
02:43:13,460 --> 02:43:19,140
pursuing. The military would have done whatever they were ordered. And if the orders came down,

1641
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:24,580
look, you got to track every penny and make sure it's not getting abused. The military would have

1642
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:31,460
done that as much as much as they were capable of. So, you know, I think it's tragic that that

1643
02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:39,140
happens. And I think in the end, in the end, if we weren't going to insist on a decent government,

1644
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:46,820
what's the point of staying forever anyway? Like, you can't ask anyone to die for a corrupt system.

1645
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:52,580
And that's what we would have been asking American soldiers to do, which begs the question,

1646
02:43:53,380 --> 02:43:59,380
why did we allow a corrupt system to blossom under our watch when we had

1647
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:06,980
held all the Trump cards and could have forced that government to actually act ethically?

1648
02:44:06,980 --> 02:44:07,940
Why do you think we didn't?

1649
02:44:08,820 --> 02:44:12,420
I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I brought it up with John Kerry in

1650
02:44:13,060 --> 02:44:19,460
2000, 2010. He asked for a meeting with me and the war wasn't going well. And I was like,

1651
02:44:19,460 --> 02:44:23,940
the war is never going to go well until you address the corruption issue. Because Afghans

1652
02:44:23,940 --> 02:44:27,060
are never going to fight for this government you've given them. And he was like, well,

1653
02:44:27,060 --> 02:44:30,340
we can't do that. You know, like we have no leverage here. I was like, what are you talking

1654
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:35,700
about? Threatened to leave Afghanistan. Like the last time the Taliban took over,

1655
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:41,220
they hung the president, Najibullah, from a street lamp for corruption, right? Every government,

1656
02:44:41,220 --> 02:44:45,940
every corrupt government minister knows that if we pull out, they're all hanging from street lamps,

1657
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:51,220
right? You have a huge amount of leverage and they just, they wouldn't do it. There's too much of a hassle.

1658
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:58,260
I can't believe we haven't even talked about your last book. I feel like we need to

1659
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:02,260
spend a few minutes on it because I find it just fascinating. So,

1660
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:10,420
yet I hate doing kind of forced rushed quick stuff. So we'll take as much time as you want to take.

1661
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:12,820
Tell me when you took this journey.

1662
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:20,100
So I walked along the railroad lines from Washington DC to Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.

1663
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:25,620
We were basically, we called it high speed vagrancy. We were, you know, railroad lines are

1664
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:31,460
this kind of swath of no man's land that goes right through America, right? Right through the

1665
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:36,100
ghettos and the suburbs and the farms and the industries and the junkyards and everything.

1666
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:40,980
And it's no man's land and you can do whatever you want. And as long as the cops don't

1667
02:45:41,060 --> 02:45:47,140
catch you. And so we had this interesting 400 mile game of hide and seek with the cops and we were

1668
02:45:47,140 --> 02:45:54,740
sleeping under bridges and abandoned buildings and getting our water out of creeks. And most nights,

1669
02:45:54,740 --> 02:46:00,900
as I say in my book, most nights we were the only people who knew where we were. And there's many

1670
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:07,780
definitions of freedom, but surely that's one of them. And so that was, you know, 10, eight years

1671
02:46:07,780 --> 02:46:16,660
ago that I did that trip with the three other guys that had been in a lot of combat. And then

1672
02:46:16,660 --> 02:46:20,260
later, you know, a few years ago, I decided I wanted to write a book about freedom. And for me,

1673
02:46:20,260 --> 02:46:26,740
the word freedom, the thing I wanted to understand about it is that we're the only species where a

1674
02:46:26,740 --> 02:46:32,820
smaller individual or a smaller group can outfight a larger individual or a larger group. And when

1675
02:46:32,820 --> 02:46:41,460
you talk about freedom, basically it means an underdog, an underdog group maintaining their

1676
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:47,140
autonomy in the face of a greater power. How does that work? I mean, the Montenegrins in the early

1677
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:54,180
1600s were outnumbered 12 to one when the Ottoman empire invaded their mountain domain,

1678
02:46:54,180 --> 02:47:01,860
outnumbered 12 to one. And every time the Ottomans came in, the Montenegrins destroyed them, right?

1679
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:10,100
There's no mammal where that could be true of, only humans. And so I organized my thoughts

1680
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:15,460
into three sections in my book, run, fight, and think. And those are basically the three ways

1681
02:47:15,460 --> 02:47:20,740
that humans maintain their autonomy. They outrun the repressors if they can't, like the Apache did.

1682
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:27,780
The Apache remained autonomous for centuries while their sedentary, wealthier Pueblo neighbors

1683
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:34,180
got rolled by the Spanish immediately. The Apache remained free, some elements of them, until 1886.

1684
02:47:34,180 --> 02:47:40,580
That's almost within my grandmother's lifetime. They did that by being mobile. But if you can't

1685
02:47:40,580 --> 02:47:46,340
outrun your repressor, you're going to have to outfight them. And the ability of small human

1686
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:52,900
groups to defeat on the battlefield, much more powerful adversaries like the Taliban defeated

1687
02:47:52,900 --> 02:47:59,060
the United States and the Russians before them, before us, and the English before that,

1688
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:09,140
is unique to the human species. And I looked at MMA and some of the individual martial arts to look

1689
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:14,420
at the dynamics of combat to understand how smaller individuals can also defeat larger ones.

1690
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:19,140
You know, one of the reasons that happens is that big muscles require a lot of oxygen.

1691
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:26,020
And if you throw 20 punches in a row and you're a big guy and you don't connect, you're out of

1692
02:48:26,020 --> 02:48:31,700
breath at the end of that. And small muscles, small frames use less oxygen and are more reactive and

1693
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:36,660
more efficient. And so if you can, if you're as a smaller fighter, if you can slip 20 punches,

1694
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:44,580
you're not in oxygen debt, the big guy is, right? And that's essentially what the Taliban did with

1695
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:50,980
the US on a sort of macro scale. Massive armies go through enormous amount of resources that

1696
02:48:50,980 --> 02:48:56,900
insurgencies don't. And after 20 years, we basically ran out of resources and the will to spend them.

1697
02:48:57,700 --> 02:49:04,100
But the final chapter is called Think. And it's about how you maintain your autonomy within your

1698
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:10,580
society. So the first thing you have to do is repel the enemy, outrun or outfight the enemy.

1699
02:49:11,220 --> 02:49:16,500
But the problem in human history is that a community, a society that's well enough

1700
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:23,060
organized to outfight an enemy, is well enough organized to oppress their own people.

1701
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:30,820
So fascist dictators throughout history, totalitarian states, they are very militaristic

1702
02:49:30,820 --> 02:49:37,140
societies that are well armed to repel invaders, but they also use that military organization

1703
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:47,060
to oppress their own society and control it. And so I look at how societies can maintain their

1704
02:49:47,060 --> 02:49:54,980
freedom from within, from an oppressor that is of their own people, an oppressive leader. And

1705
02:49:54,980 --> 02:50:04,180
I looked at the labor movement in America around 100 years ago. And basically the brilliance of

1706
02:50:04,660 --> 02:50:11,700
the human species is that we can outthink more powerful entities. And the labor movement was able

1707
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:20,980
to eventually get their way in the face of the National Guard with fixed bayonets and the entire

1708
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:27,300
U.S. government. They eventually got their way in terms of fair pay and fair work hours, fair work

1709
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:33,140
conditions. And the tipping point often is having, well, first of all, you need selfless leaders.

1710
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:38,820
You need leaders, if you're going to overthrow the British in Dublin, in Ireland in 1916,

1711
02:50:38,820 --> 02:50:47,140
if you're going to confront the U.S. government as a labor union, as a labor uprising, you're going

1712
02:50:47,140 --> 02:50:52,980
to need leaders who are willing to die for the cause. They cannot tell everyone else to rush the

1713
02:50:52,980 --> 02:50:56,660
machine guns while they stay hiding behind the sandbags. If you don't have leaders that are

1714
02:50:56,660 --> 02:51:03,380
willing to die, you will, as an underdog group, you will not win. But likewise, you need women.

1715
02:51:04,980 --> 02:51:10,260
Social movements like that, political movements, insurgencies that don't incorporate women into

1716
02:51:12,260 --> 02:51:18,100
their power structure and into their strategy and their tactics will probably not succeed.

1717
02:51:18,100 --> 02:51:22,340
And so I looked at the, again, at the mill strikes in America and

1718
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:31,780
the turning point came when the strikers in Lawrence, Massachusetts started putting women

1719
02:51:31,780 --> 02:51:37,700
on the front lines to confront the National Guard soldiers with fixed bayonets and the

1720
02:51:37,700 --> 02:51:44,420
soldiers didn't know what to do. They were not willing to bayonet women. And they had mothers,

1721
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:49,140
they had sisters, you know, they had wives, they weren't willing to do it. And whereas killing men

1722
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:55,940
is morally much less of a problem, even for totalitarian regimes and certainly for democracies.

1723
02:51:55,940 --> 02:52:02,820
And so when you put women into the equation, the police don't quite know what to do, right? And as

1724
02:52:02,820 --> 02:52:11,620
one frustrated policeman said at the time, he said one cop can handle 10 men, but it takes 10 cops

1725
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:18,980
to handle one woman. And that was the beginning of the end for the resistance to these crucial

1726
02:52:18,980 --> 02:52:26,340
changes that came to the textile industry in 1912, 1914. Did the Taliban ever use women? Obviously,

1727
02:52:26,340 --> 02:52:33,620
they're from a Sharia law standpoint, not exactly sensitive to women, but did they ever use women

1728
02:52:33,620 --> 02:52:40,100
in the true sense of the word use for their gains? No. And here's the thing is that on the battlefield,

1729
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:45,140
particularly at the distances that are typical of modern combat, I mean, you know, automatic

1730
02:52:45,140 --> 02:52:51,460
weapons easily fire two, three, 400 meters. You don't see the faces of the people you're fighting.

1731
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:57,060
You certainly don't know what sex they are. You don't, the women's capabilities really come to the

1732
02:52:57,060 --> 02:53:03,460
fore in the kinds of insurgencies that they had, for example, for the Battle of Algiers when the

1733
02:53:03,460 --> 02:53:09,540
French were occupying Algiers and Morocco in the 1950s and 1960s. So, or the mill strikes in

1734
02:53:09,540 --> 02:53:15,700
Massachusetts, women have lateral networks, right? They're not good at top down hierarchies. Men are

1735
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:19,540
good at top down hierarchies. And the top guy says, all right, now we're going to charge the machine

1736
02:53:19,540 --> 02:53:26,500
guns and men will do it, right? And women's, their forte is not that so much as lateral networks,

1737
02:53:27,460 --> 02:53:32,260
lateral egalitarian networks. They're unranked, but they're lateral. And it's very hard for

1738
02:53:32,740 --> 02:53:38,900
information, the intelligence agencies to penetrate those networks. And so basically,

1739
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:45,460
an insurgency depends on the society from which it springs to fight, right? So the Taliban are

1740
02:53:45,460 --> 02:53:51,940
exclusively male fighters, but if they are not part of a society that incorporates women and women are

1741
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:57,220
absolutely crucial to any functioning society, if you don't incorporate that, it's not going to go

1742
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:01,540
very far. And, you know, the Easter Rising in Ireland is another excellent example of that.

1743
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:08,660
If you literally have women on the front lines, it doesn't matter so much in open combat, because

1744
02:54:08,660 --> 02:54:15,060
you often don't, you know, it's a lot of it's spray and pray tactics anyway, you're just unloading a

1745
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:21,060
belted machine gun. When you're when you're operating in a situation like the mill strikes

1746
02:54:21,060 --> 02:54:25,940
in Lawrence, these are society face to face with itself. And there is some public accountability

1747
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:31,220
to murdering women with bayonets. Given now that the Taliban will likely be carrying out their

1748
02:54:31,220 --> 02:54:39,380
actions and, you know, not at 400 meters, what do you think is going to be the natural history of

1749
02:54:39,380 --> 02:54:44,740
how things go in Afghanistan? Well, you know, it takes a very different temperament, a very

1750
02:54:44,740 --> 02:54:53,940
different mindset to be a successful insurgent insurgency than to run a country, run a government,

1751
02:54:53,940 --> 02:54:58,420
right? Completely different mindsets. And, you know, I think I mentioned, I heard that the Taliban

1752
02:54:58,420 --> 02:55:04,100
fighters are now bored, right? I mean, they miss the war, right? So the Taliban are brilliant

1753
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:09,460
insurgency, brilliant strategic thinkers. They out fought the most powerful military ever in human

1754
02:55:09,460 --> 02:55:15,860
history. I'd fought them. They outlasted them. They outlasted our will to fight, right? Now they have

1755
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:21,940
to run Afghanistan. It's twice the population it was in 1996 when I saw them take power back then.

1756
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:28,980
The cities have been modernized. A generation of Afghans have received education. Afghan girls

1757
02:55:28,980 --> 02:55:36,260
have received education. That's an unwieldy, they're going to find Afghanistan to stand to be

1758
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:43,940
an unwieldy mess that is very, very hard to run and run according to Sharia law. And so I don't

1759
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:48,580
know what the future holds, but I imagine that there's going to be some fracturing within the

1760
02:55:48,580 --> 02:55:56,180
Taliban, really hardcore, ultra sort of like conservative elements falling out with more

1761
02:55:56,180 --> 02:56:00,260
moderate elements that want engagement with the West. I imagine that kind of fracturing will happen.

1762
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:08,260
The Tajik resistance is organizing itself in Masood's old territory in Barakshan,

1763
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:15,300
in the Northeast quadrant of the country. If they don't abide by some basic international

1764
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:20,180
human rights norms, they're going to have a very, very hard time accessing international

1765
02:56:20,740 --> 02:56:27,380
donations, international monetary systems, international relief efforts, and recognition

1766
02:56:27,380 --> 02:56:30,420
by foreign governments. I mean, do you really think that's true? I mean, that might be true

1767
02:56:30,420 --> 02:56:35,380
of Western governments. Do you think China will care especially? I mean, some of them might not,

1768
02:56:35,380 --> 02:56:41,860
but the West is important. I mean, the original Taliban was recognized by the UAE, Pakistan,

1769
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:48,020
and one other country, I can't remember, Saudi maybe, I can't remember. So, you know, there's

1770
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:54,100
$8 billion of Afghan money is sitting in New York banks and I think will not be released without

1771
02:56:56,100 --> 02:57:03,860
some kind of legitimacy to the Afghan government. The Taliban have a world of hurt ahead of them.

1772
02:57:03,860 --> 02:57:07,780
You know, they might make it work, but it's not going to be the simple prospect

1773
02:57:07,780 --> 02:57:14,020
that it was in 1996 when all these cities were rubble and the population was half this size

1774
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:19,060
and no one had cell phones and whatever else. They're going to have a tough pill to climb.

1775
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:24,820
How long did it take you to go on your journey, your walk?

1776
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:33,300
We walked off and on for a year and then I kept doing it a little bit after that,

1777
02:57:34,100 --> 02:57:42,260
from time to time with one or two buddies. So, we called it the last patrol and I would still love

1778
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:49,060
to get out there. Was it HBO? Where does that documentary appear? Yeah, I brought a videographer

1779
02:57:49,060 --> 02:57:55,780
who quickly became part of the group and, you know, the last patrol was aired on HBO in 2015,

1780
02:57:55,780 --> 02:58:00,420
I think, but after we stopped shooting, some of us kept going back out there. I really liked it

1781
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:06,980
out there on the railroad lines. When did you know you were done? I was headed for a place

1782
02:58:06,980 --> 02:58:14,500
called Jumuville Glen, where the French and Indian wars basically started. George Washington in 1754

1783
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:19,940
led an expedition, a small expedition against a French force, reconnaissance force, and his sort

1784
02:58:19,940 --> 02:58:30,500
of native tracker and scout, a sonnet named Tenegrison, known as the half king. He precipitated

1785
02:58:30,500 --> 02:58:35,700
a massacre of some of the French soldiers who surrendered to Washington and that triggered

1786
02:58:35,700 --> 02:58:39,700
a reaction by the Brits, which went into the French and Indian war, which eventually

1787
02:58:41,300 --> 02:58:45,940
sort of set the terms for the Revolutionary War. Without the British winning the French and Indian

1788
02:58:45,940 --> 02:58:49,620
war, the Seven Years War, we might not have, America might not have dared throw off British

1789
02:58:49,620 --> 02:58:56,020
rule with France right on their, right on their, on their border. So it's an iconic place that very

1790
02:58:56,020 --> 02:59:00,260
few people have heard of and it's right outside of Connell'sville, Pennsylvania, western Pennsylvania.

1791
02:59:00,260 --> 02:59:05,460
And I wanted to end there. I wanted to sneak into Connell's, into Jumuville Glen. It's in the woods,

1792
02:59:05,460 --> 02:59:11,380
deep in the woods. So I wanted to sleep in, sneak, sleep in there, sneak in there and sleep there,

1793
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:15,060
thinking that the last people that slept there under this little cliff,

1794
02:59:16,100 --> 02:59:23,140
the last people that slept there might have been the French forces under Jumuville in 1754. And I

1795
02:59:23,140 --> 02:59:28,340
wanted to get out of there before the, you know, park, you know, it's a national historical site

1796
02:59:28,340 --> 02:59:32,740
and before the park guards showed up, you know, I sneak out of there before dawn. I like wanted to

1797
02:59:32,740 --> 02:59:37,700
do that. And we got to Connell'sville. It was a very hot day and I sort of shredded my feet. It

1798
02:59:37,780 --> 02:59:41,940
was a hundred degrees during the day. And when it's that hot, we're carrying a lot of weight.

1799
02:59:41,940 --> 02:59:46,260
We're moving 10, 20 miles a day. We're carrying 60, 70 pounds on our backs

1800
02:59:47,780 --> 02:59:50,900
and we're sweating an awful lot. And, and basically your, your

1801
02:59:51,540 --> 02:59:57,460
bottoms of your feet kind of turned to oatmeal basically. And, and, and, you know, I was bleating,

1802
02:59:57,460 --> 03:00:00,980
my feet were bleeding. I was in enormous amount of pain and we got to Connell'sville. Connell'sville

1803
03:00:00,980 --> 03:00:07,620
is very, very poor. And as one lady said, so poor that when it gets hot, they don't even have pools

1804
03:00:07,620 --> 03:00:12,500
in their backyard. They just, they just swim in the river that runs through the middle of the city.

1805
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:17,540
And it's an old industrial town. And indeed there, they, there was Connell'sville, you know, taking

1806
03:00:17,540 --> 03:00:22,580
the, you know, swimming, swimming at the end of the day during the scorcher of a summer day,

1807
03:00:24,020 --> 03:00:29,940
taking the heat off. And we got there, we stumbled limped to the, the sort of rock

1808
03:00:29,940 --> 03:00:36,660
cobble of the beach along the Yocogheny river and took off our boots and our shirt and staggered

1809
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:43,060
into the water. And I came back and I sat down and the dog was exhausted and the men were exhausted

1810
03:00:43,060 --> 03:00:48,020
and I could barely walk. We had another, we were going to sleep somewhere in downtown Connell'sville.

1811
03:00:48,020 --> 03:00:51,620
We're going to try to hide from the police somewhere and sleep along the river and then

1812
03:00:51,620 --> 03:00:57,300
keep moving in the morning. And we had 15 miles ago to get the Jumoville Glen. And I looked around

1813
03:00:57,300 --> 03:01:02,740
at the guys and, you know, I was in the middle of getting divorced and I was like, I was like,

1814
03:01:02,740 --> 03:01:08,020
you know what? The trip just ended. We don't need to go to Jumoville. It's over. We're done. We got

1815
03:01:08,020 --> 03:01:11,540
what we needed out of this. It's time to go home and face our, where all of us go home and face our

1816
03:01:11,540 --> 03:01:18,340
lives. And which is what we did. So I recognized the ending when it came to me. I didn't know. I

1817
03:01:18,340 --> 03:01:23,060
didn't even, I didn't wake up in the morning thinking that I knew it in the moment. And I think

1818
03:01:23,060 --> 03:01:31,780
one of the great things to work on is to know in the moment when things are over. Trips, relationships,

1819
03:01:33,460 --> 03:01:37,780
anything. You got to know it's when it's over, you got to know it's over. And if you don't,

1820
03:01:37,780 --> 03:01:44,740
God help you. I mean, I hate asking a glib question because I agree with that wholeheartedly,

1821
03:01:44,740 --> 03:01:50,820
right? I mean, knowing when to quit is an amazing gift. What are some of the signs?

1822
03:01:52,340 --> 03:01:56,260
How do you know when it's time? Because it's, it's not always obvious in the moment.

1823
03:01:57,300 --> 03:02:01,380
No, it's not. You got to feel it. It's got to be a feeling. Your instincts,

1824
03:02:01,380 --> 03:02:04,180
your feelings don't lie. You know? And if you just suddenly

1825
03:02:05,300 --> 03:02:10,740
get the feeling that you're doing something because you think you're supposed to stay,

1826
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:14,980
you know, you're supposed to stay married. You're supposed to go walk all the way to

1827
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:19,700
Jumal, Jumal Vail Glenn on bleeding feet. Like if you think you're supposed to,

1828
03:02:19,700 --> 03:02:25,860
because it's embarrassing not to, that's not the right reason. And I don't know how to

1829
03:02:25,860 --> 03:02:30,420
articulate it more than that. Like you got to, you got to feel it. Like sometimes you get an

1830
03:02:30,420 --> 03:02:34,740
instinctive sense not to trust somebody. That's a feeling. It's not knowledge. It's feeling.

1831
03:02:35,300 --> 03:02:42,980
And those instincts serve us very, very well. And you got to pay attention to them. And I felt it.

1832
03:02:42,980 --> 03:02:47,540
I was like, okay, why exactly are you going to Jumal Vail Glenn? Oh, because you thought that

1833
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:51,700
would be a cool ending for your project, your little project, you know, like, oh, the symbolism

1834
03:02:51,700 --> 03:02:56,100
of it. Like you don't do things for symbolism. You don't do things because they're a good ending.

1835
03:02:56,980 --> 03:03:02,100
You got to feel what you need and what's right and what's good. And I felt that come right up

1836
03:03:02,100 --> 03:03:07,700
to the ground into me. I was like, look at the dog, look at the men. We're all broken. Like you

1837
03:03:07,700 --> 03:03:12,260
don't, yeah, can we do it physically? Yeah, we can do anything. We'll crawl there if we have to.

1838
03:03:12,260 --> 03:03:16,180
We could do it. I was with some tough guys, you know, like, yeah, we could do it.

1839
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:25,300
But why? Why are we doing it? If you can't answer that question, very readily with conviction and

1840
03:03:25,940 --> 03:03:31,460
and with some feeling in your chest, if you can't answer it, you don't have you don't don't do it.

1841
03:03:31,460 --> 03:03:40,500
Did the guys put up an argument? No, everyone was thrilled. We knew we all knew.

1842
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:43,940
Do you think that they simultaneously knew or do you think that they had come to that

1843
03:03:43,940 --> 03:03:50,740
conclusion earlier and didn't want to speak up? I think I somehow convinced them that I

1844
03:03:51,540 --> 03:03:54,180
knew what I was doing and they kind of trusted my decisions.

1845
03:03:55,060 --> 03:04:01,380
And, you know, I might have just had a rebellion on my hands. I don't know. But yeah, they trusted

1846
03:04:01,380 --> 03:04:07,140
me. We were I mean, you know, we'd walked. I mean, we got shot at and fell in Pennsylvania. So we

1847
03:04:07,140 --> 03:04:12,580
started shooting at us just because they didn't like the looks of us. You know, we were hungry.

1848
03:04:12,580 --> 03:04:17,940
We were cold. We walked through the winter. How did you guys feed yourself? We'd walk into town

1849
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:22,100
and buy some food and keep walking out the other side and go back out onto the lines. And, you

1850
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:26,740
know, we smoked a little tobacco out there. And, you know, we had stuff we needed from town. We'd

1851
03:04:26,740 --> 03:04:31,380
stop. We'd go in. We looked like hell. We looked homeless, basically. We looked like sort of high

1852
03:04:31,380 --> 03:04:35,140
speed homeless. Right. And then we keep going. And so a lot of stuff, you know, the cops were

1853
03:04:35,140 --> 03:04:39,460
looking at for us with a helicopter, like all kinds of weird crazy stuff happened. And we were

1854
03:04:39,460 --> 03:04:45,780
a unit. Right. I mean, we were brothers. Like we really we we were connected. And so when that

1855
03:04:45,780 --> 03:04:50,980
moment came by the Yocogane River, I think we all felt it. And it was the obvious, the obvious

1856
03:04:50,980 --> 03:04:57,860
thing to do. You think back over the last 250 years of American civilization, nearly 250 years,

1857
03:04:57,860 --> 03:05:09,620
I guess. As a society, when during that arc were we most free? Depends how you define freedom.

1858
03:05:09,620 --> 03:05:14,260
You know, I'll let you define it because I feel you're you're in a better position to do so than

1859
03:05:14,340 --> 03:05:24,660
I am. Politically, we're the most free now. Okay. Obviously, the initial democratic

1860
03:05:26,820 --> 03:05:35,460
endeavor with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights forgot to include black people. Right.

1861
03:05:36,260 --> 03:05:40,260
Outrageous transgression. That's not a free. That's not a free society.

1862
03:05:40,900 --> 03:05:45,540
Politically, you know, by the time you get to the civil rights movement, suffrage, and then

1863
03:05:45,540 --> 03:05:50,660
civil rights movement, the labor movement, by the time you start getting into the 1970s, 1980s,

1864
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:57,140
you're starting to get something, at least approaching some political, political freedom.

1865
03:05:57,940 --> 03:06:06,580
Economic freedom is a different matter. And if you have a society where the income gap is too wide

1866
03:06:06,580 --> 03:06:16,740
between rich and poor, it's hard to argue it's a completely free society. People can be held in

1867
03:06:16,740 --> 03:06:22,740
sort of a voluntary bondage of having to work three jobs because, you know, we all know that

1868
03:06:22,740 --> 03:06:30,180
story, right? I mean, like, that's not a free society. But then following on from that, if you

1869
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:38,740
can't freely make choices that are good for you, you're not free. And if you are addicted to

1870
03:06:38,740 --> 03:06:44,340
something, right, you're not entirely free. And we live in a massively addicted society,

1871
03:06:45,220 --> 03:06:50,980
addicted to substances, addicted to visual stimuli from television or iPhones.

1872
03:06:52,900 --> 03:06:56,660
Those are not, we are not free people in that sense. And, and

1873
03:06:56,660 --> 03:07:07,940
I don't know which is worse, right? Which is worse, the inability to vote, or the inability

1874
03:07:07,940 --> 03:07:13,620
to look up from your iPhone, which is a greater form of oppression? Which corrodes your human

1875
03:07:13,620 --> 03:07:21,220
dignity more? I don't know. It's an open question. What I will say is that I had the good fortune to

1876
03:07:21,220 --> 03:07:27,300
interview a man who had spent some decades in prison for doing an extremely bad thing

1877
03:07:31,860 --> 03:07:41,220
from a very brutal, diminished situation in his family and his society. And it had the predictable

1878
03:07:41,220 --> 03:07:46,340
results of violence and crime. And he killed somebody and he went and he paid the price for

1879
03:07:46,340 --> 03:07:54,420
it. And he spent almost 30 years in prison educating himself. He found God. I'm an atheist,

1880
03:07:54,420 --> 03:07:59,860
but I completely respect someone who finds God. And he straightened himself out and he was let out

1881
03:07:59,860 --> 03:08:04,500
on good behavior. And I was able to interview this man a week after, a couple of weeks after

1882
03:08:04,500 --> 03:08:11,220
he was let out of prison after 25, some whatever years. And at the end of the interview, I said,

1883
03:08:12,180 --> 03:08:17,940
I feel silly asking this, but is it possible to be more free in prison than outside of prison?

1884
03:08:17,940 --> 03:08:22,580
And he looked at me like I was crazy. He said, yeah, of course it is. Are you kidding?

1885
03:08:24,660 --> 03:08:26,580
He said, you can't be a drug addict in prison.

1886
03:08:30,340 --> 03:08:35,300
You can't be addicted to your, you don't have an iPhone. You can't be all distracted. Look at

1887
03:08:35,300 --> 03:08:42,020
people walking around. They're not, they're not free. They're all chained to something. Right?

1888
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:47,540
He said, if you're in prison, you got nothing but time. And eventually, eventually you're going to

1889
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:52,980
have an honest conversation with yourself about who you really are and what you're doing in there.

1890
03:08:53,940 --> 03:08:58,260
And when you have that conversation with yourself, you're a free man, no matter where you are.

1891
03:08:59,140 --> 03:09:02,740
And there's a lot of people on the outside. And by that he means outside of prison. There's a lot

1892
03:09:02,820 --> 03:09:07,220
of people on the outside who never get around to having that conversation with themselves.

1893
03:09:08,340 --> 03:09:15,380
So I don't think you can pin down an era. I would say our freedom right now is,

1894
03:09:16,420 --> 03:09:25,860
in a historical context, is breathtaking in its depth, but with some very, very serious,

1895
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:32,420
worrisome caveats, some very worrisome footnotes to that. Among them, economic inequality.

1896
03:09:32,740 --> 03:09:35,140
That's going to bring us down.

1897
03:09:36,980 --> 03:09:44,180
Boy, the point of view of that guy, having just got out of prison is staggering. And I think that

1898
03:09:45,940 --> 03:09:54,020
the insight is profound. If you can't look at yourself, if you can't examine who you are,

1899
03:09:54,820 --> 03:10:02,900
if you're too distracted by the trappings of fill in the blank, how free are you?

1900
03:10:05,860 --> 03:10:11,540
Where do you come out on the guy you came across when you were doing the patrol,

1901
03:10:12,340 --> 03:10:18,580
who basically had, if I recall, a shovel tied around his belt and a few other possessions.

1902
03:10:19,540 --> 03:10:24,020
Basically everything he owned was with him. And you asked the question,

1903
03:10:24,020 --> 03:10:26,900
is he the freest guy you've seen or the least free?

1904
03:10:27,780 --> 03:10:34,260
Yeah. I don't know. I don't have an answer for that. Material possessions give you a kind of

1905
03:10:34,260 --> 03:10:42,180
freedom in the sense that you're not living a survival level marginal existence, but they

1906
03:10:42,260 --> 03:10:49,140
require work. And do you want to have a freedom of maneuver? Do you want to be all the mobile?

1907
03:10:50,580 --> 03:10:55,540
Do you want to have temporal freedom where your time is your own? Do you want to have economic

1908
03:10:55,540 --> 03:11:00,980
freedom where you have a whole ton of money and you can make choices? I'm going to stay at that

1909
03:11:00,980 --> 03:11:10,260
hotel. I'm going to go to do this. I'm going to do that. There is no form of freedom where you have

1910
03:11:10,260 --> 03:11:15,940
it all. And so that guy, we didn't talk to him. I just caught a glimpse of him. But he had all

1911
03:11:15,940 --> 03:11:20,580
of his possessions tied to the blade of a shovel, a snow shovel, and the snow shovel, the handle was

1912
03:11:20,580 --> 03:11:26,020
tied to the back of his pants. And he was walking along, sledding all of his belongings behind him.

1913
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:31,380
And he clearly didn't have a job to go do in the morning and clearly was living out of dumpsters

1914
03:11:31,380 --> 03:11:36,180
and whatever else. So yeah, is he free? Is he the ultimate free person or the ultimate oppressed

1915
03:11:36,180 --> 03:11:41,460
person? I don't know. I mean, I don't offer answers, but some of the questions are interesting.

1916
03:11:42,180 --> 03:11:48,500
And I will say, and I might sort of end on this because I have to get going to pick up my kids, but

1917
03:11:51,940 --> 03:11:58,180
sedentary society started about 10,000 years ago when humans started to cultivate wild grains

1918
03:11:58,180 --> 03:12:06,020
in Mesopotamia. And what that allowed for an accumulation of wealth, and it allowed for

1919
03:12:06,020 --> 03:12:12,420
social hierarchies, right? The development of class, leaders and led, rulers and serfs, right?

1920
03:12:12,980 --> 03:12:18,260
The advantage of that system is that you could feed a 40,000 man army and defend yourselves and

1921
03:12:18,260 --> 03:12:24,820
your riches very, very easily, right? Nothing's going to overrun the city of Ur, right? I mean,

1922
03:12:24,820 --> 03:12:32,500
huge massive walls, massive army. The disadvantage is that most people spent most of their day

1923
03:12:32,500 --> 03:12:38,420
working and working for the Pharaoh, right? I mean, metaphorically speaking, you know,

1924
03:12:38,420 --> 03:12:43,140
working for their ruler. And so the nomads of that era

1925
03:12:45,780 --> 03:12:52,820
were materially poor like the Apache were, but their time was their own. They were completely

1926
03:12:52,820 --> 03:12:59,460
mobile and it was an egalitarian society. It's hard to oppress people that can put everything

1927
03:12:59,460 --> 03:13:04,020
they own in the bag of a horse and leave in the middle of the night, right? Hard to do.

1928
03:13:04,020 --> 03:13:11,460
So nomadic peoples have typically been materially poor and very, very autonomous and very egalitarian,

1929
03:13:12,420 --> 03:13:21,460
right? And I will say that for a lot of human history, wealthy sedentary people have romanticized

1930
03:13:22,980 --> 03:13:29,540
mobile nomadic peoples, have romanticized those lives precisely because it looks and is so free.

1931
03:13:30,180 --> 03:13:37,220
Even in this society, we romanticize outlaws and motorcycle gangs and all those groups that we

1932
03:13:37,220 --> 03:13:42,260
would never, most of us never want to be part of, but it's enormously romanticized because they're

1933
03:13:42,260 --> 03:13:47,780
mobile and they're fairly egalitarian. And that's exactly what nomads were for 10,000 years and

1934
03:13:47,780 --> 03:13:54,420
still are. And there's a very revealing quote from a group, a song from a group of nomads

1935
03:13:56,500 --> 03:14:03,300
called the Yomut in Northern Iran, the vast grand grasslands around the Caspian Sea.

1936
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:10,900
And the Yomut were a tribal, mobile pastoral nomadic society, very warlike.

1937
03:14:11,860 --> 03:14:16,580
And they said of their sedentary, wealthy sedentary neighbors, they said,

1938
03:14:18,820 --> 03:14:24,420
I am Yomut. I do not have a mill with willow trees. In other words, I'm not a farmer.

1939
03:14:25,300 --> 03:14:31,060
I do not have a mill with willow trees. I have a horse and court. A court is a kind of whip.

1940
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:35,620
I have a horse and court. I will kill you and go.

1941
03:14:36,100 --> 03:14:43,860
Ultimate arrogance and pride of a nomadic, a warlike nomadic person. And so what I would say

1942
03:14:43,860 --> 03:14:51,220
is that the enormous wealth and sedentary nature of Western society has enabled us to do astounding

1943
03:14:51,220 --> 03:14:57,460
things, scientifically, technologically. It's allowed for the rise of democracy, rule of law,

1944
03:14:57,460 --> 03:15:01,860
and the medicine that saved my life. Like the list is endless.

1945
03:15:02,420 --> 03:15:09,300
But we're not the Yomuts, right? There is something inherent, something important to

1946
03:15:09,300 --> 03:15:16,740
human dignity that takes place in a society that is mobile and entirely governing of its own

1947
03:15:16,740 --> 03:15:22,740
circumstances and more or less egalitarian. There is something essential to human dignity that happens

1948
03:15:22,740 --> 03:15:29,940
in those societies that has trouble happening in this wealthy, wealthy, amazing industrial society

1949
03:15:30,020 --> 03:15:36,020
that we live in. And we're not going to go back to being nomads, but it might help just to take note,

1950
03:15:37,220 --> 03:15:43,220
take note of those qualities and maybe instill some of them where we can into our own society.

1951
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:48,980
