00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,480
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,840
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,520
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,440
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,920
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,840
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,120
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,320
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,920
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,880
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,720
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce,

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,920
My guest this week is my very close and dear friend from medical school, Dr. Zal Krieger. Zal

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,840
is a board certified plastic surgeon and a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. He

48
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,800
went to med school with me at Stanford and then did his training in general surgery and plastic

49
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,320
surgery at Northwestern in Chicago. He grew up in Israel. Actually, was born in Canada, I think.

50
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,400
I grew up in Israel high school back here in California, then went off to the special forces

51
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,760
in Israel for three years before coming back for college and medical school. He specializes in

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,600
facial rejuvenation with fat grafting and deep plane facelifts, abdominoplasty, breast enhancements,

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,760
all sorts of complicated plastics and reconstructive surgeries. I wanted to talk with Zal at length

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,880
because over the past, I don't know, a couple of years, he'd send me stories or things like that

55
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,680
about mishaps in plastic surgery. I was shocked by them actually. I guess I'm oblivious to this

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,480
world. I asked him, I said, look, why don't we just do a podcast together where we can go into

57
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,760
some real detail on some of the common misconceptions about plastic surgery and above all else,

58
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,280
provide listeners with a tool or set of tools really to help select the right plastic surgeons

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,560
and to understand what the real risks are of a number of these procedures. I will say this,

60
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,720
I learned a lot during this episode and you'll hear it in my voice. There are at least

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,040
three instances where he rattles off a statistic and I just can't believe it and I actually have

62
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,400
to ask him to clarify it. So we start by talking about the differences between a board certified

63
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,760
plastic surgeon and basically anybody who can do plastic surgery, which turns out to be anyone who

64
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,360
has a medical license. We talk about how you would pick a surgeon and what are the common

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,640
misunderstandings and pitfalls that get a lot of people into trouble. But really we focus very much

66
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,200
on breast augmentation, liposuction, the Brazilian butt lift, which I didn't realize prior to this

67
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,040
procedure is not only as prevalent as it is, but perhaps more disconcerting than that is arguably

68
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,600
one of the most dangerous plastic surgery procedures a person can have. I think by the

69
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,680
end of this episode, you'll have a really clear understanding of what these risks are and how you

70
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,640
could go about thinking about it. The other thing we're doing in the show notes to this is we're

71
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,560
going to create a really cool checklist that you could download and print out because throughout

72
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,040
each of the discussions on, for example, a specific type of procedure, Zoll would rattle off a number

73
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,560
of ideas and facts that I think are just worth having in your back pocket. And then of course,

74
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,040
the section on how you really, what questions should you be asking a plastic surgeon? I think

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,240
that's also, if nothing else, if you take nothing out of this, simply knowing that is valuable and

76
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,920
frankly, it applies to all of medicine, especially procedural medicine, so surgical, dermatologic,

77
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,520
et cetera. Lastly, we close with the discussion about fillers, which again, I would have thought

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,000
that there is no possible way that a filler could actually pose harm to people, but it turns out,

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,120
sure enough, there is a way you could be harmed by fillers, which again, all comes back to making

80
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,720
sure that if you're going to have these procedures, you have them done by people who really know what

81
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,760
they're doing and have spent years and years training in the anatomy of this space. So without

82
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,720
further delay, here's my interview with Dr. Zoll Krieger. All right, Zollie, thank you for coming to

83
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,400
Malibu, man. Thank you. It's my pleasure. What a beautiful place. Yeah. I was thinking about this

84
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,560
this morning because I woke up to the sound of these waves kind of crashing, which is a beautiful

85
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,640
sound, but then I was like, oh, that's going to make for a difficult podcast because we're going

86
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,400
to, the microphones will pick this up. So anyway, I'll apologize in advance to all the listeners.

87
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,280
Hopefully the sound of the waves hitting 10 feet from us is not too disturbing. I also heard a

88
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,000
rooster crowing outside. I have a neighbor, he's an ER doctor. He lives right behind me

89
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,480
and he has essentially a farm in his backyard. He has goats and sheep and chickens and he just

90
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,280
got a rooster. So every morning at 5 a.m. rooster starts crowing. We have a rooster across the street

91
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,400
from us. We have chickens, but the rooster across the street and everybody that stays with us says,

92
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,360
oh, does that rooster drive you nuts? Not only does it not drive me nuts, I love it. I love hearing

93
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,120
that rooster at 5 a.m. I'm not sure why. It's good if you wake up at 5 a.m., but if you wake up at 6

94
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,880
a.m., it's not so good. That might be the point. We have our own little rooster in the house that

95
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,000
wakes up at 5 a.m. So yeah, the two go hand in hand. Well, I guess I should sort of introduce

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,280
you a little bit to people today because some of the listeners will have already met Paul Conte

97
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,040
through one of the earlier podcasts. And so this is sort of the process of me just introducing all

98
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,760
of my med school friends to listeners. So in that band of knuckleheads that we were in medical school,

99
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,560
it's possible you were the ringleader of the knuckleheads. I mean, I think that's anyone who's

100
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,640
listening who went to medical school with us will probably say you were the ringleader of that

101
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:14,840
gaggle. And like Paul, you and Paul were the only two who on day one really asserted what you were

102
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,880
going to do. Most of us were leaning one way or the other. We might do this, we might do that,

103
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,880
but Paul on day one knew he was going to be a psychiatrist and you on day one knew you were

104
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,000
going to be a plastic surgeon. And I remember thinking about both of you guys. I was like,

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,600
wow, how can they be so sure? Did you remember this? I do remember, yeah. I actually think it's

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,040
a great way to go through medical school knowing from the beginning what you're going to do. It

107
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,040
helps you focus your attention and your plans as far as research and what you're going to spend

108
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,480
more time learning like anatomy as opposed to other subjects that you know you'll never touch

109
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,080
again like genetics, for example. But yeah, I did start medical school pretty much knowing what I

110
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,920
wanted to do. I was influenced a little bit by my father who began his training. He's a physician

111
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,640
in plastic surgery and then some exposure to some other plastic surgeons that made me extremely

112
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,240
interested in the field. It was actually the part of plastic surgery called microsurgery that got

113
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,880
me most interested. Essentially, microsurgery is using a microscope to connect tiny fine structures

114
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,040
like blood vessels and nerves. And I was very attracted to the idea of doing this delicate

115
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,000
surgery. Other specialties like neurosurgery and ophthalmology do microsurgery as well,

116
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
but it's a pretty large part of reconstructive plastic surgery. So that's what got me interested

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,560
into it. And since then my practice has evolved. I still do microsurgery, but I now do many other

118
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,160
things as well. I feel like before medical school, was it the two years prior or was it between high

119
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,960
school and college? When were you in the army? After I finished high school in the United States,

120
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,640
I went and volunteered to the Israeli army and I spent three years in the Israeli army. And then

121
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,920
I came back after that and went to university here and then medical school. Got it. Yeah.

122
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm going to do my best to refrain from telling any of the stories of orientation week when we

123
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:19,160
all got into so much trouble. But the army ringleader, both you and Jason and then Shaehab,

124
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,880
the whole thing was quite a scene. We go through med school, we finish it, explain to people what

125
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,320
I think if you're a person listening to this, it's not entirely clear what it means to be

126
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,200
a plastic surgeon versus someone who does plastic surgery. Lots of people can do plastic surgery,

127
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,080
but there's a very specific type of training and there are generally two paths, correct? There are

128
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,600
the sort of combined paths and then there's the sort of due general surgery first. So how does one

129
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,520
pick how they're going to become a plastic surgeon? Well, in the beginning when plastic surgery began

130
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,360
as a field, it was one of the surgical subspecialties. So like vascular surgery or heart

131
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,280
surgery or cancer surgery, people first did a general surgery residency and then went and did

132
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,880
a fellowship in plastic surgery. Since that time, it's pretty much become its own residency.

133
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,720
So anywhere from six to seven years of training focused on plastic surgery with the first few

134
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,160
years, having an emphasis on general surgery, sort of learning the basics of operating and then

135
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,400
focusing more on plastic surgery, you brought up a good point about there are many people who do

136
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:32,360
plastic surgery who are not plastic surgeons. The numbers are probably 90 to 95% of all plastic

137
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,880
surgery done in the United States is not done by board certified plastic surgeons. So only a small

138
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,320
minority is actually done by plastic surgeons, which is mind boggling to me to think of how

139
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,680
complicated some of the things we do are and to know that there are other specialists who are

140
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,640
doing this without really having any formal training in it. Most people don't know, but

141
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:01,400
in terms of the laws in America, any physician once they receive their MD degree can perform

142
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:08,200
any procedure they want without any legal repercussions. So a family practice doctor

143
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,680
who gets his MD degree, he's one month out from medical school can decide to do heart surgery,

144
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,280
can decide to do brain surgery, he can put a catheter up someone's leg. Now he's going to

145
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,120
be limited by a hospital that won't give him privileges to do it at. And so he's stuck doing

146
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,840
things in his office. Or if he builds a small operating room, he can try and do whatever he

147
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,800
does in the operating room. But legally, he's allowed to do whatever he wants. And so you have

148
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,240
many physicians, and even non physicians all over the United States doing plastic surgery,

149
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,600
primarily cosmetic surgery. And there are and they're not breaking any laws doing this,

150
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,960
they're obviously not doing it in a hospital, because hospitals are good at self policing and

151
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:58,360
regulating and making sure that only people who are board certified in that, and with training in

152
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,080
that specific procedure can do it. So again, back to the training in plastic surgery, it's a six or

153
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,000
seven year program, where you focus mostly on plastic surgery, primarily reconstructive

154
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,840
surgery, you're operating on the whole body, you're learning all the principles of plastic surgery.

155
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,040
That's what I did after medical school. I did not know that it was that stark a contrast of the

156
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,520
number of procedures being done or the relative proportion being done by non trained plastic

157
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,000
surgeons. I certainly realized that there were many non plastic surgeons doing it. I wouldn't

158
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,400
have guessed that I would have guessed 5050 or something. No, the numbers are really high. And

159
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,400
it's it's all about the money. I mean, this is all cash pay. None of it is done through insurance.

160
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,360
And it's a way for other specialists to augment their income. So we see even in my community here

161
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,200
in the greater Los Angeles area, hundreds and hundreds of physicians of all walks, gynecologists,

162
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,800
ER doctors, general surgeons, family practice doctors, internal medicine, who have no training,

163
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,160
no knowledge whatsoever, just decide, I'm going to start doing Botox, I'm going to do fillers,

164
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,600
then they purchase a laser, then they do liposuction first office base, then they're

165
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,120
doing breast augmentation and other surgical procedures. It's getting more and more common.

166
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,480
That I would have never guessed, I could sort of imagine

167
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,560
screwing around with Botox, although even just a little bit I've learned in talking to people who

168
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,920
are really good at this, the difference between knowing what you're doing and not knowing what

169
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:38,040
you're doing with Botox is enormous. And furthermore, eventually, if you have enough bad Botox,

170
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,760
I mean, you only need to watch reality TV for one day to see what that looks like. So the results of

171
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,080
this can actually be irreversible. I mean, you can you can get enough bad procedures done where

172
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,200
even a good person coming along isn't going to salvage it.

173
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,640
Absolutely. The classic example for this is a lot of these new liposuction type devices that use

174
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,160
a laser or other type of energy to heat up the tissue. And a lot of this is done as an

175
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,400
office based procedure. And so we see multiple physicians out there of various specialties who

176
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,720
buy these machines, they have reps that come to their office and really convince them that it's

177
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,320
the best thing out there since sliced bread and they start using these devices and they can cause

178
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,040
really unrepairable damage, primarily liposuction, the abdomen and, you know, the thighs and just

179
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,720
burning the skin and creating all sorts of contour irregularities that are just almost impossible

180
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,400
to fix our term in plastic surgery is we call them liposuction cripples.

181
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,920
They basically have essentially unfixable problems.

182
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,080
Yeah, there was a famous example of this. I remember I can't remember her name,

183
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,520
but she was a famous actress. Tara Reed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,400
Was she treated by someone who was? I don't know who treated her, but she did have one of those

185
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,360
types of liposuction done on her abdomen. And that left her with these burns of the

186
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,880
undersurface of the tissue and divots. And when you see someone like that, it looks very strange.

187
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,600
You know, it doesn't, it's not the appearance of someone who's lost weight or been pregnant.

188
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,360
It's the strange contour abnormalities, divots areas where it looks like someone just scooped

189
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,280
out pieces of fat. There's a lot of people like this walking around who didn't do their homework

190
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,560
and they're suffering the consequences. So the regulatory environment doesn't place a restriction

191
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,960
on this, which means then it's up to patients to sort of be able to figure this out. But that's

192
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:39,320
pretty hard, right? Because outside of, I mean, the most zeroth order question would be asking,

193
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:46,040
did you train in the specialty to do X, Y, and Z? But beyond that, is it just a rule in your mind

194
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,880
that only a plastic surgeon should do something? Because clearly there are plastic surgeons who

195
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,880
are probably not very good. And presumably there are people who are not plastic surgeons, but who

196
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,880
can train very well to do certain limited things, right?

197
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,960
It's a good question. And I think that there are definitely things that other specialties

198
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,120
are trained to do and can do. For example, ophthalmologists have a subspecialty called

199
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,640
oculoplastic surgery, where they learn a lot of eye surgery. And I would be totally comfortable.

200
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,480
I refer patients with complex issues to oculoplastic surgeons to do eyelid surgery.

201
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,520
Then the question becomes, well, what if they want to do a facelift?

202
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,680
Some of them might be able to do that. They have the training, they have the knowledge and the

203
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,680
comfort, they know the anatomy. You have field, a subspecialty of ENT, your nose and throat,

204
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,600
which is facial plastic surgery. They are well trained in that to do rhinoplasty, facelifts,

205
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,800
any of the facial procedures. Should those people be doing breast augmentation? Probably not.

206
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,400
They have absolutely no training on any part of the body below the neck. So I do think there are

207
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,840
examples where you can go to someone who is not a board certified plastic surgeon for certain

208
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,080
procedures. However, I think it's important to do good research. And, you know, it's tough,

209
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,440
you have to know the right questions. It's interesting that I probably only get asked

210
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,800
about once a year by a patient, are you board certified in plastic surgery? People don't ask

211
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,720
that. People are much more focused on what kind of person you are. Do you seem nice? Are you

212
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,200
confident? Do you seem caring? Empathetic? Do they have a connection with you? They care a lot about

213
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,360
price. It's so amazing to me. I have a nurse who's worked for me for five years and she had some bad

214
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,000
plastic surgery by someone else and wanted me to fix it. And I told her I'd be happy to fix it. I

215
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,320
gave her the price. I gave her a heavily discounted price. Obviously she's my nurse. And she went to

216
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,520
some other guy who essentially was one of the guys who botched her first surgery. And he told

217
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,640
her he would do it for much less cost. He's not well trained and he's not that good a surgeon. And

218
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,680
she ended up having surgery with him just a few days ago, all based on the price. Even though his

219
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,560
plan and my plan were completely different. She's seen me work. She knows that I'm a safe, good

220
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:12,120
surgeon. She trusts me and she decided just based on price to go with someone else. So when you see

221
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,000
an example like that, here's someone who is in the field. They're constantly surrounded by it yet

222
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,280
they're going to allow something like money, be their determining factor on where to go.

223
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,680
You have to imagine that for the average person out there who has very little knowledge,

224
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,040
it's difficult for them to make the decision. I mean, people think that plastic surgery is like

225
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,000
buying a luxury item like a Mercedes or Rolex watch where it doesn't matter if you go to the

226
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,920
guy at the mall or if you order it online. A watch is a watch, a car is a car. It's not like that at

227
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,760
all. It should be approached no differently than as I've heard you talk on your podcast with other

228
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,760
physicians about picking the right surgeon for a heart surgery or brain surgery, picking the right

229
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,520
doctor to treat any type of medical problem. You have to do your research and make sure you're

230
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,040
getting the right person. So besides asking if a person is trained in plastic surgery,

231
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:10,840
boarded in plastic surgery, has had any lawsuits against them or files claimed, what other questions

232
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,680
can people be asking? So if you had a friend or a relative in another part of the country and they

233
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,160
weren't going to come out and see you, but they were going to go and scour the DC area, what would

234
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,080
be the checklist you'd give them to narrow down their search? Some of the important questions are,

235
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,640
how long have you been doing this procedure? How did you learn how to do this procedure?

236
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,160
I mean, there's a big difference between saying I've been doing this from the start of my residency.

237
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,640
I did a six year or seven year residency learning this we did at hundreds of times.

238
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,680
And then I've done it hundreds of times on my own since then. That's a big difference than

239
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,240
someone saying, well, I didn't really learn this in my training, but I took a weekend course

240
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,720
on how to do this. I would ask the person where they trained and what field they trained in.

241
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,320
I think that's important. There's no doubt that you can be a great surgeon and train

242
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,760
at a lesser known facility as with someone who is a great teacher and has taught you well,

243
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,640
and you're a great student, you don't have to be at the top program to become a good surgeon.

244
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,560
But all these things add up. I would definitely ask for referral from patients who've gone through

245
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,520
the procedure to talk about it. I would ask for pictures, good plastic surgeons have a lot of

246
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,400
before and after pictures of their work. That's a luxury we have that other surgeons don't really

247
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,520
have. They can just say numbers, you know, my success rate at this operation is this,

248
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,040
but in plastic surgery, we have photographs to show that. And, you know, a good question to ask

249
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,840
is what if something bad happens to me? What's the plan? Where do you have hospital privileges?

250
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,600
Do you have hospital privileges for this procedure? You know, the majority of plastic surgery in the

251
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,920
United States is done in small surgery centers, either owned by the plastic surgeon or owned by

252
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,200
some other physician where they go and work at. And they're not equipped to take care of real

253
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,480
serious problems. And so you need to know what happens if there's a problem. Do you have

254
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,760
privileges to take care of someone who has bleeding after a tummy tuck? There's a gynecologist who

255
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,560
does the full array of plastic surgery in my community. He has a lot of complications. If

256
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,440
somebody said to him, are you board certified? His answer is yes, of course I'm board certified.

257
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,480
Now he's not saying I'm board certified in gynecology. He is genuinely board certified,

258
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,480
just not in plastic surgery. If you asked him, do you have hospital privileges? Of course,

259
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:38,120
he has hospital privileges, but he has privileges in gynecology, not in plastic surgery. So if he

260
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,120
has a patient who has bleeding after a tummy tuck, he can admit them to the hospital, but he can't

261
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,520
take care of them because he doesn't have privileges for that problem. The reason why the

262
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,480
hospital privileges is such a good question is we as physicians police the doctors who come and work

263
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:03,560
at the hospital. So nothing kind of slips through the cracks. We check the training and the expertise

264
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,480
and the knowledge and the malpractice history of every physician that gets on staff. So I'm on a

265
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:16,280
credentialing committee at my local hospital. So we look at all this and you only grant privileges

266
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,680
to the physicians that are safe and worthy of those privileges and then only for the procedures

267
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,680
that they are adequately trained on. I think on that same thread, another question that probably

268
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,520
is helpful is having them describe how they take care of complications. One of the things that

269
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,760
happened when we were in medical school that you probably recall is certain states, I think New

270
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,720
York was leading the charge, decided to begin looking at cardiac surgeons and listing their

271
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,440
mortality rate. And on the surface, that seemed like a pretty good idea, right? Which was, well,

272
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,600
if you need heart surgery, you want to be able to look at the menu and see all of the heart surgeons

273
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,640
in the state and know what their complication rates are. And so if you take 30-day mortality,

274
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,520
which means how many patients that you operate on die within 30 days of the procedure, which

275
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,240
usually means something related to the procedure. It's rare that someone has an operation and then

276
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,320
27 days later they get cancer or some die. So it turned out that was a pretty lousy proxy because

277
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,920
what you were doing was you had surgeons that would cherry pick the simplest cases and the

278
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,880
least sick patients. And in some ways, if you're having heart surgery, you actually want the person

279
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,760
who has practiced operating on the toughest cases. What I think patients who were savvy figured out

280
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,280
was, I don't just want to pick the person with the lowest complication rate, I want to understand how

281
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,120
they manage complications. And this gets to your point, which is there's a very big difference

282
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,760
between the ICU, when you're talking about heart surgery, that is, the ICU in sort of a podunk

283
00:25:52,760 --> 00:26:00,440
hospital that rarely sees complications versus the ICU at a major tertiary center where day and night

284
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,760
it's very complicated, very sick patients, and you've got an entire team that can do it. So

285
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,880
is there a way to sort of come up with an analogy in plastic surgery, which is

286
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:17,560
how often do you see complication X and what is your protocol or path to deal with that?

287
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,400
That's a really important question. And for us, our complications, we divide them into two parts,

288
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,520
the early acute complications, which happen immediately after surgery, these are primarily

289
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,160
bleeding infection, fluid accumulation called a seroma, which we would usually see in, for example,

290
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,920
a tummy tuck, and then the late complications. And the late complications are primarily aesthetic.

291
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,360
So essentially, you just aren't happy with the result, you don't like how it looks.

292
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:52,360
So you want to ask the plastic surgeon what their incidence is of each type of complication, you know,

293
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,160
how often do you have to take someone back to the operating room for bleeding? How often do you

294
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,840
people get infection after this surgery? And then if that happens, how do you manage it? It's a key

295
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,840
point because someone like myself, I have my own operating room fully accredited operating

296
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,440
facility. So any complication that requires a return to the operating room, like bleeding,

297
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,280
for example, I have a facility to take care of this, somebody who doesn't have a facility where

298
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,680
they work at, and they do everything in their office, if they have a complication that requires

299
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,520
a trip back to the operating room, they're stuck, and the patient is financially stuck, I can do it

300
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,640
at no charge for the patient. And that's sort of included in their cost. Wait a second, I didn't,

301
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,440
I never even thought of that for a moment. So if a patient comes to you, and they're getting a tummy

302
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:47,000
tuck, and the figure it costs x dollars, and they go home, and then they call you that night and say,

303
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,480
there's a lot of swelling here, you have them come back in, you look and you realize there's a blood

304
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,400
vessel that's still, you know, bleeding, you operate on them in your suite, an anesthesiologist

305
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,720
comes back in, they're back under anesthesia, they're doing a whole thing, that's bundled within

306
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,320
the cost, which makes sense to me, right? That should be. But are you saying that if a patient

307
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,440
has a procedure with someone who doesn't have their own accredited OR, and the complication

308
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:21,560
has to go into a hospital, the patient is on the hook for that cost? Absolutely, 100%. And that,

309
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,320
that's a big source. Do they end up suing the physician after the fact? Absolutely, that's a

310
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,840
big cause of lawsuits, money, obviously, and a big part of that is when there's a complication,

311
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,280
and then the patient is responsible for that. So there would be a circumstance, for example,

312
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,080
if I have a patient and they have to go to the emergency room, they're going to have to bear

313
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,640
some of the burden of that cost, I'm not going to cover the cost of their trip to the emergency

314
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:53,720
room. But most complications, after surgery, I can take care of in my clinic. So that's a key

315
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,600
thing to work out ahead of time with a surgeon. What, how are these complications managed,

316
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,160
both in terms of the actual management, but then from a cost standpoint, how are they managed?

317
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,600
And, and that's something you have to work out. And then for the long term issue, you know, what

318
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,120
if there's a problem with the scar? What if there's a little extra skin on one side? What if it's a

319
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,680
little uneven where they had the liposuction, whatever the issue is, one implant is higher

320
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,640
than the other? How do we address that? I'm not happy. And that's something you have to work out

321
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,760
and I think that's less of an issue of the training of the plastic surgeon and more the

322
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:35,400
individual's integrity and sense of, you know, what is morally correct and fair to do with the

323
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,000
patient. And it varies, you know, there's no right answer for some problems, I fix it at no charge,

324
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,640
I say, this is clearly, you know, I'm a big, strong believer in admitting when you're wrong,

325
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,240
I think patients want that. And that's, in my mind, a sign of a good surgeon with humility.

326
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,880
If I did something wrong, I will say to the patient, I made a mistake here. This did not

327
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,760
turn out well. For example, one of your implants is higher than the other implant, and that needs

328
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,680
to be corrected. And I'm going to correct that at no charge. If it's an issue where nothing was done

329
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,640
wrong, but the patient is just unhappy with the result, the implants are too small, I want larger

330
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,720
implants, then in that circumstance, I might do it at no charge in terms of my fee, but I'll make

331
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,080
them pay for the new implants and the cost of the operating room and anesthesia. So it, I think it

332
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,600
depends, it's on a case by case basis, but these are all really key things to hash out ahead of time

333
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,320
with the surgeon. It's an interesting point you raise. I remember in medical, not medical, so I'm

334
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,520
sorry, in residency. And I think I've even discussed this on previous podcasts. There was this real

335
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:46,280
sense that if complications took place, you weren't really permitted to speak with the family after

336
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,880
and things like that. And I always found that interesting because I think the research was

337
00:30:49,880 --> 00:31:00,760
pretty clear that patients didn't sue necessarily in proportion to the error. They sued in proportion

338
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:07,160
to the lack of communication and the friction with the treating team. So a team that, you know,

339
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,360
a physician that was very arrogant and non-communicative after a complication is much

340
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,480
more likely to be sued than sort of admitting that you've made a mistake, which is very

341
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,040
counterintuitive in our culture, right? To be able to say, I made a mistake here and let's figure out

342
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,480
how to fix it. And it turns out that's less likely to elicit a lawsuit. Yeah, absolutely. I've found

343
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,840
that in my own practice and observing other doctors as well. I think that people in general,

344
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,720
they just want honesty. They want honesty from everyone around them and they want honesty from

345
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,920
their doctors. And you just have to be honest. If something happens, if there's a complication,

346
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,360
you have to be honest about it. You have to talk about it. You can't run and hide from it. I mean,

347
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,520
I've heard other people you've talked to on the podcast, like Eric Shayab talked about this,

348
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,880
you have to embrace your complications and not run from them. And people appreciate that. And you're

349
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:04,280
absolutely right. They don't go after doctors in a court of law or in any other way, just because

350
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:10,600
of a bad result. It's more how they feel, how they feel they're treated, how it's dealt with.

351
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,320
I think that the financial aspect of it is a major part of distress and unhappiness on the

352
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,560
part of the patient. And so it's really key as the doctor to make sure you do what's fair

353
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,840
and you stand by your work. I mean, sometimes it's worth it to eat some money and not make a

354
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:35,080
profit on a case if it means that you're doing the right thing for the patient. In business in

355
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,080
general, I mean, we see this in all areas of business. You just have to be smart about it.

356
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:49,480
You finished your residency in 2007? 2008. So do you remember the first time you were in,

357
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,920
because it's a pretty scary thing, I'm guessing, when you go from doing that last case as a fellow,

358
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,920
where, yeah, you're actually doing the entire case, but there's an attending surgeon nearby,

359
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,960
to now you're the surgeon of record, that first case when you are on your own. Do you remember

360
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:16,680
the first complication you had where it was 100% you? I think it's hard to sort of ever say, well,

361
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:24,440
a complication is 100% on the part of the surgeon. But I do remember early on in a microsurgery case,

362
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,760
very soon after completing training, where inadvertently cutting a blood vessel that you

363
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,680
were trying to preserve and then spending a couple hours under a microscope trying to repair a blood

364
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:43,000
vessel the size of a toothpick. When you're doing microsurgery, you're working with structures that

365
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,840
are very small and very delicate. And you have this device called an electrocottery or BOVI

366
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,480
that emits heat and is used to coagulate blood vessels. And if it gets too close to one of these

367
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,080
blood vessels, you can damage it. And so some of the surgeries we do, specifically like breast

368
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,760
reconstruction after cancer, we're relying on one tiny little blood vessel to keep the tissue alive.

369
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,960
The blood vessel is essentially one to two millimeters in diameter. And if you get too close

370
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,480
to it with a cottery, you can damage it. And so I remember doing that on one case and then having

371
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,960
to repair that blood vessel. It's extremely tough. It's humbling because you have no one to turn

372
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,400
around to. Like you said, there's no attending physician who can bail you out. I'm very fortunate

373
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,520
in my practice because my partner is my brother. He's also a plastic surgeon. We trained

374
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,240
in separate programs at the same time. You know him well. And he's the better looking of the two,

375
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:44,040
right? He's a year younger, but everybody thinks he's older. I actually had a patient who asked me,

376
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,680
is your father going to help on the surgery? I took out my phone and I said, could you say

377
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:55,160
that again? So I could record that. So I tease him about that. But he's a year younger, but we

378
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,160
trained at the same time and we do a lot of our surgeries together. So it's a big difference when

379
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,720
you're by yourself versus having someone else to kind of work it out. And at this point now,

380
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,440
we've been in practice 11 years together and I think we've started to really figure it out,

381
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,920
but we still do a lot of surgery together because there is no doubt. I mean, there's a reason why

382
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,720
two pilots fly the plane. Each one knows how to do it alone, but when there's another person

383
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,760
double checking everything you do and offering a slightly different view and opinion, it makes a

384
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,560
world of difference. That is pretty unique. I know a lot of really good plastic surgeons, but many of

385
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,040
them do, they don't have that luxury. I know because I've been to your surgery center and I've

386
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,880
seen you and Gil there and I've just seen you even discussing the most mundane case. And I remember

387
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,160
once you guys were discussing a case that I couldn't believe you would tag team because I

388
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,840
could see if you were tag teaming like a flap, like one of these really complicated cases where

389
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,320
you're going to be under a microscope for hours and the stakes are really high. But I remember the

390
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,640
case that you guys were discussing was like a breast augmentation and a hernia repair or something

391
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,040
like that, which again, I think most plastic surgeons would bang out many of those in a day

392
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,240
and think nothing of it. But it was very, I really do, I'm glad you brought this up because I remember

393
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,640
being struck by how lucky it was for the patients that you could be doing that, which is wow, every

394
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,000
case is what we call a two attending case. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you just think of any

395
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,600
complicated process that has so many variables and so much thought has to go into it, it's clear

396
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,640
one person can do that by themselves and is perfectly capable and trained to do that. But

397
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,000
when you have another person, everything you look at in life, there's various perspectives and

398
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,440
someone who's standing right next to you is going to see something just a little bit different.

399
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,000
What's great about in our practice is that some of his strengths are my weaknesses and vice versa. So

400
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:00,680
as an example, I'm a much faster surgeon than than he is. And I'm probably also a less patient

401
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,880
surgeon than he is because I'm faster. So I want to get through the surgery and get on and move on.

402
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:12,600
And I believe a lot that in speed actually comes efficiency and safety. And so I don't believe

403
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,280
that when you're going faster, you get sloppy, I think in many ways, the faster you go. And we know

404
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,640
this from many studies, the less complication rate you have. So there's a lot of advantages to being

405
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,880
with a fast surgeon. However, he's a very slow methodical surgeon. So as we reach the end of

406
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,840
the case where it's easy to kind of think, well, we're near the end, let's just speed up, there's

407
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,360
not much to do, he'll still be putting in the same amount of thought as he was at the beginning

408
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:46,360
of the case. And he'll force me to slow down and won't allow any corners to be cut or anything to

409
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:53,400
be done less than perfect. And so I really appreciate that about him. On the same account,

410
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,920
you know, the fact that I'm faster and more decisive, I think helps him because when he

411
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,800
is managing the case, and he's the primary surgeon on the case, then being able to sort of decisively

412
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,840
say, I think this is what we need to do, let's move forward is really important because in surgery,

413
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,040
you always want to be moving forward. I mean, as you know, you can, you can go huff on a tangent,

414
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,760
and two and a half hours later, you haven't made much progress. And for the patients,

415
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,680
the longer they're under anesthesia, the longer they're on the table, the higher the complication

416
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,520
rate. And so you want to be efficient, especially with larger surgeries, you know, we do surgeries,

417
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,120
we do microsurgical reconstructions together that can take us 12 hours or eight hours,

418
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:42,440
the same operation. And it's sometimes we're just in shock, like, how did that just take 12 hours?

419
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,640
You know, last week, we did this in eight hours. And it's that's a big difference, both in terms

420
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,880
of the the toll it takes on us, physically, and also the risks for the patient being under 50%

421
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,120
longer. Yeah, you know, the risk of anesthesia, a lot of people don't appreciate that. And I remember

422
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,640
having great senior residents in residency that really made that point, which is, look, it's,

423
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,480
you know, you're, you're in here to work as quickly as you can safely. For that reason, simply less

424
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,520
exposure to anesthesia is better. Let's talk about a couple of operations, maybe in a bit more detail,

425
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,160
as ways for people to understand how to go through the process, and maybe even just be

426
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,200
better equipped to know what the complications are. I'll give you an example. Let's start with

427
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:32,440
breast augmentation. Let's separate this from breast reconstruction, following, say, mastectomy.

428
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:41,560
One I know had a breast augmentation. And I don't know, several months later, she told me she had

429
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,800
developed this complication where they were, there was like some contracture around it. And it was

430
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,960
the the implant was sitting very, very high. What's the name of that? It's called capsular

431
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,640
contraction. Capsular contraction, which I'd never heard of. But of course, why would I have

432
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,360
heard of this? I don't know anything about plastic surgery. And I was like, huh, that's really odd.

433
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,480
Did you know this was a potential complication? And she said no. And I said, this wasn't discussed

434
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,920
in the consent for the procedure. And she said no. And I said, well, what does the surgeon propose

435
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,640
to do now? And she said, just to repeat the procedure and the, you know, the probability

436
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,240
of it happening twice is pretty low. And I said, okay, I mean, I guess so. And the surgeon, I think,

437
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,880
had taken the approach that you described, which was, you know, he was on the hook for this 100%.

438
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,760
So, so I don't actually think this is a criticism of the surgeon at all. So he repeated the procedure.

439
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:35,960
And sure enough, it happened a second time. And at this point, I was like, wait a minute,

440
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,040
I think you need to get another opinion before you go back and start fixing this. So,

441
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,280
and I remember actually talking with you about this. But let's just start with that as an example,

442
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,720
what what is this? What's the frequency with which it occurs? Why does it occur?

443
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:55,000
How should it be managed? So, capsular contracture is the most serious complication,

444
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,480
long-term complication from breast augmentation. And the incidence is anywhere from 2 to 8%.

445
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,640
And like with a lot of- That's a pretty broad range.

446
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,240
Yeah, it's a broad range. And it varies based on the surgeon. It varies based on the implant type.

447
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:17,320
Some implants have a lower complication rate. Some types of breast augmentation have a lower

448
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,960
complication rate. For example, there are saline implants and silicone implants. Traditionally,

449
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,200
saline have a lower complication rate. Closer to 2%, the silicone have a higher complication rate.

450
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,360
The implants can go under the muscle or on top of the muscle. Implants put in under the muscle tend

451
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:40,840
to have a lower capsular contracture rate because the muscle provides some sort of protection from

452
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,920
it. Implants on top of the muscle have a higher capsular contracture rate. It's really the thing

453
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,440
we're trying to avoid the most in plastic surgery. And some surgeons have a higher rate.

454
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,880
Essentially what it is, it's the formation of scar tissue. Anytime you put a foreign body inside of

455
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:05,080
a human being, whether it's in their knee or implant in the breast, the body forms a reaction

456
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:11,080
around it to wall it off. And that's scar tissue. And that's called a capsule. Normally, it's supposed

457
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:18,920
to be soft and pliable like a balloon. But if the body forms an abnormal capsule, it becomes hard

458
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,640
and it contracts or squeezes down on the implant and causes pain and distortion. And this typically

459
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:31,800
displaces the implant up higher. So the side that's contracted, the breast is very hard. It

460
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,520
looks strange. The implant sitting higher. It even looks smaller because it's being squeezed by this

461
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,920
scar tissue. And it can develop within months after surgery. It can take years. We still don't

462
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:50,200
know exactly why it happens. We think bacteria are the culprit. Meaning bacteria are leading to

463
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:57,400
an aggravated response. Correct. And it's strange because they're women who go many years without a

464
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,520
problem. Their breast is soft and their breasts are symmetrical and everything is normal. And then

465
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,240
suddenly they develop capsular contracture. We think the bacteria are coming from somewhere else.

466
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,200
For example, they have a sinus infection and then a few months later they get capsular contracture

467
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,120
or they had mastitis and then they get capsular contracture. You see a higher incidence of it in

468
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:25,160
women who go on to breastfeed after? Yes. Not significantly, but there definitely is. And

469
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,880
especially if they have, if they develop some type of breast infection after having implants,

470
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,040
we see the majority of capsular contracture cases happen early within six months of surgery.

471
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,120
And that's probably due to bacteria that get in there at the time of surgery.

472
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,040
It's an interesting point, isn't it? I remember first realizing this during a rotation of orthopedic

473
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,280
surgery, which was just how high the stakes are when you're putting a foreign body and especially

474
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,880
in orthopedics into a joint space. Absolutely. Because it's funny, people think, well, surgery

475
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,600
is all done very sterile. I don't think there's a procedure that's done under more sterile

476
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,720
conditions than joint replacements. Correct. Because that's where they're wearing the

477
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,880
spacesuits, which I think were the funniest things in the world to just take it to that level. So

478
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,920
again, it speaks to the nature of how privileged is the site and are you actually leaving something

479
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:22,200
foreign inside? Exactly. And complications that occur early on, such as bleeding or build up of

480
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:28,680
fluid is an excellent medium for bacteria to grow in. So if you have a woman who has a small

481
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,360
hematoma, a small amount of bleeding on one breast, that woman has a significantly higher risk of

482
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,800
developing capsular contracture. And the reason is probably that blood that's bathing the implant

483
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:46,840
is a great medium for bacteria to grow in. So there's a lot of strategies that are recommended

484
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,720
and that we take to minimize the risk of this happening. But yet it still happens in a certain

485
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,200
percentage. Back to your patient, actually the data shows that if you get it one time,

486
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,120
the chance of getting it a second time is higher. Yeah. In the end, I believe what happened with

487
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:10,600
her was the third procedure she went to someone different. I don't actually recall what they did

488
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:17,480
different. If they, I don't know. Anyway, the fortunate thing is at least a year or so later,

489
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,760
she's totally fine with the third operation. But I remember thinking, God, if this happens a third

490
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,000
time, I don't think you have a choice, but to just remove the implants and be done with it.

491
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,840
Absolutely. I mean, that's usually the best treatment. A lot of women are not willing to

492
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,080
do that. So they're just going to keep looking for additional options.

493
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,480
Okay. So would you say that's the largest long-term complication of a breast implant?

494
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:45,080
So that is the most common long-term complication. There are some situations where the implants can

495
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:51,880
rupture. The saline implants notoriously leak or rupture because they have a little filling port

496
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,120
that saline can leak out of that usually starts around 10 to 15 years after. The new silicone

497
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,800
implants are made extremely well and they rarely rupture, but it can happen when they go back and

498
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,560
analyze those implants. Most of those implants were damaged at the time of insertion by the surgeon

499
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:16,200
and that weakened the implant and let it to go on and rupture. But rupture is probably less of an

500
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,400
issue than the capsular contracture. One of the things that I wanted to talk about, which is

501
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:28,840
a rare complication, but we're seeing it more and more and it's scary, is called ALCL and that

502
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:34,920
stands for Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. And this is a type of rare cancer that we're seeing

503
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,840
in women who have breast augmentation. Interestingly, it only happens in implants

504
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:48,280
that are textured. So implants can be either smooth on their surface or rough textured on their surface.

505
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,040
There's a number of reasons why they develop these rough textured implants, but for some reason

506
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:00,440
the texturing triggers this autoimmune type response where they not only develop capsular

507
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,960
contracture around the implant, but the body sort of goes haywire and develops this lymphoma.

508
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,520
It's similar to a cutaneous lymphoma, which is a lymphoma of the skin, so it's not as high risk

509
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:22,600
for metastasis and invasion as a typical lymphoma can be. But it's a type of lymphoma and it occurs

510
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:29,800
in the capsule that surrounds the implant. It can invade into the breast. And when we started to see

511
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:37,080
these cases, the first one was sometime around 10 years ago they found we since that time have

512
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,600
seen hundreds of cases worldwide. Initially we were telling women the incidence was maybe one in

513
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,920
300,000. Now they know that with certain implants it's actually one in 3,000. And to be clear, there

514
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,960
are no cases of this in non-textured implants? Correct. All the cases have been only in textured

515
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:00,920
implants, none in smooth implants. So presumably the FDA has to weigh the risk of that because

516
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,760
these textured implants are still permitted in use? They're still permitted. They still account for a

517
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:15,720
large number of implants being used. The FDA just met a couple weeks ago in April 2019 to review all

518
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:22,040
this and they decided to let them stay on the market. The European FDA actually pulled the

519
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,640
number of the textured implants off the European market. So it only allowed smooth implants to

520
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:34,840
continue and just said there's no point. And I think if you had no other option, you could

521
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,120
argue we should keep these implants on. But the smooth implants can do essentially almost anything.

522
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,640
What's the advantage of the textured one? The advantage of the textured one is not clear. In

523
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,080
my opinion there is no advantage. But initially they found a lower rate of capsular contracture

524
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,960
with the textured implants. Now you have to be really careful. I think of any physician I've

525
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:04,360
ever known, you're one of the best at understanding that data can be very misunderstood and misread.

526
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,840
And one of the issues we have in my field in particular is that a lot of the studies done

527
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,800
on implants are done by plastic surgeons who are on the payroll of the implant companies.

528
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,040
And so the implant companies are paying hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars to

529
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,800
plastic surgeons to do studies. And these plastic surgeons have a significant financial

530
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,680
interest in the result of the studies. And you really have to question whenever the researcher

531
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,200
has such a big financial stake in a certain finding. And because textured implants are more

532
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:43,480
expensive and a lot of these plastic surgeons were essentially making money on the implants,

533
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,240
they wanted a finding that showed that textured implants were better.

534
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,480
And I've reviewed the data. I do not believe there's still a big discussion and ongoing

535
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,680
controversy in the field of plastic surgery that whether or not textured implants do have

536
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,200
any benefits, do have a lower rate of capsular contracture. There was an interesting study done

537
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,960
not by a plastic surgeon but by infectious disease doctors and pathologists where they took a bucket

538
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,280
of dirty bacteria-laden water. And they put a smooth implant in it and then they put a textured

539
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:23,000
implant in it. And the bacteria are 70 times more able to stick to the textured implant than to the

540
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
smooth implant. A smooth implant, if you pour water on it, it just rolls right off. It's smooth. If you

541
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,520
look at it under a microscope, it just looks like a desert flat. The textured implant looks like the

542
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:40,760
Grand Canyon, all these rocks and crevices. So bacteria can stick much more readily onto it.

543
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:47,080
And that's been proven and replicated. If you then go a step further and analyze the capsules,

544
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:55,320
both in cases of this ALCL lymphoma and in cases of capsular contracture, the capsules are full of

545
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:01,400
bacteria. And so you say, okay, well, we think bacteria cause capsular contracture. We know that

546
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,800
they stick to textured implants much better. How could you tell me that textured implants

547
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:10,520
have a lower rate of capsular contraction? The answer is they probably don't.

548
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:18,200
And what's the difference in the cost of equally sized implants that are textured versus smooth?

549
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,800
It's probably about 20 to 25%.

550
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,800
And you alluded to this a second ago, but again, I didn't even realize this is how naive I am.

551
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,600
Of course, a surgeon gets a surgeon's fee, but I didn't realize that a surgeon makes

552
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,880
that part of their compensation is based on a percentage of the cost of the implant.

553
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,400
So, you know, most surgeons will mark up the cost of the implant. So if the implant is more

554
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,640
expensive, they're going to make more profit. But I think for a lot of these plastic surgeons who

555
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,640
were doing the research in the implant companies, they were getting money from the implant companies.

556
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:57,560
I was recently at a plastic surgery meeting, one of the highlights of any meeting I've ever been to,

557
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:03,160
they had a panel of experts talking about textured versus smooth implants. And they had

558
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,600
all these world famous plastic surgeons talking about the benefits of the textured implants and

559
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:14,200
why they have better results. And then on the smooth implant side, this woman came up, she's

560
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:20,120
a major leader in the field of plastic surgeon, she's a Canadian plastic surgeon. And she's never

561
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:26,360
taken a dime from any company, any implant company or anything else. She's authored textbooks, she's

562
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,560
absolutely brilliant. I've had a chance to meet her in C.R.U.P. and Elizabeth Hall Finley. And

563
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:37,880
she's one of the premier leaders in the field of breast surgery. She lives in Banff, Canada. And

564
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,240
she was up there on the panel. And she basically got up and she put up one slide. And it was a slide

565
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:50,360
from a website called the Sunshine Act, which essentially shows how much money every doctor

566
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:56,040
in America has been paid, all the way from $10 up to millions of dollars from industry.

567
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,680
And she had the names of the doctors and the amounts of money. And she had the names of the

568
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:09,400
doctors on the panel, going from $3 million at the top to like $150,000 on the low end.

569
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:16,360
And she just put up the slide and then she just walked off. That was her presentation.

570
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,520
And I was dying. I was loving it because I've very for a long time believed that

571
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:29,160
as honest as you want to be as a doctor, when there is money involved, when you have a vested

572
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,280
interest in the result of a study showing something and you will lose money if something

573
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,640
else comes out of it, you can't trust yourself. I mean, there's just such inherent bias in that.

574
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:46,120
Yeah, I agree with that completely. And it's really, it's so frustrating to be that critical

575
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:52,600
and to realize that you can't even trust yourself. And that's a hard leap to take,

576
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,120
but you really are correct. I think the only way to protect against that is to

577
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,480
take yourself out of a position where there's a conflict.

578
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:06,200
Specifically with the textured implants, what I believe led to a lot of the data,

579
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,120
and this is understanding the difference between correlation and causation,

580
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:16,920
which I've heard you talk about a lot before, is that there is a newer type of implant and they

581
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,880
call it the gummy bear implant, and it's a teardrop shaped anatomic implant. So most of

582
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:27,800
the implants we use around, but these newer implants are teardrop shaped. They were designed,

583
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,320
they came out in the year 2000 in Europe and the FDA approved them around the year 2010

584
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,680
in the United States. So for the first 10 years of their development, they were only on clinical

585
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,400
trials in the US, but they were being used regularly on hundreds of thousands of women

586
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:50,760
in Europe. 100% of these teardrop shaped implants are textured. And the reason for that is that

587
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,280
because you have to hold it in place, you have to hold it in place. If it rotates,

588
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,440
it will be, it will look odd and it needs surgery to fix it as opposed to a round implant that you

589
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:06,120
you can allow it to freely rotate. Let me ask a dumb question. Couldn't they make them smooth,

590
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,720
but put little tethers on the side that you could suture into place?

591
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,480
Yes, they could. And they tried that. And we have that with other types of devices that we use. And

592
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:21,320
that was an option. And I think that's something that could come in the future. Absolutely. And

593
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:27,560
some surgeons experimented with putting tabs on the back, but these teardrop shaped implants,

594
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,240
the reason they developed them is they said, well, the breast is not round. The breast looks

595
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,440
more like a teardrop. So let's make an implant that matches the breast. It'll be more natural.

596
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:43,160
So they started to use these in Europe. These implants require a larger incision to place.

597
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:50,040
And so European women in general have smaller breasts and smaller areola sizes than women in

598
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,640
the United States. Wait, why is that? Genetically, you know, you take like countries like Northern

599
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:01,880
Europe, like Norway and Sweden, these countries, the women tend to have smaller areola than a lot

600
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,920
of the women here where our population has black and Hispanic women, which are going to have larger

601
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:14,920
areola size. So the fact that you need a larger incision necessitated switching from a very common

602
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,040
incision for placing the implant, which is through the nipple to making an incision underneath the

603
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:25,480
fold of the breast. So by switching to this incision and putting in all these textured

604
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,840
implants through this incision under the fold of the breast, the surgeons are bypassing a lot of

605
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:38,520
the normal bacteria that exist within the breast. And so they're probably introducing fewer bacteria

606
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:44,440
into the pocket around the implant. So I believe, and there's now data to support this, that

607
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:50,280
the lower rate of capsular contracture with textured implants is due to the incision

608
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:58,280
being made in a safer place that has less exposure to bacteria and not because of anything inherent

609
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,960
about the implant. So when they looked at the data of these women in Europe and said, wow,

610
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,600
these women have a lower rate of capsular contracture with these new implants, it must be

611
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,360
that these new implants have a lower rate, there's something about the implant, but they're ignoring

612
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:19,400
this secondary issue, which is, well, they were all put in through this incision. And in my own

613
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:25,080
practice, I followed data on thousands of women. And we found that we definitely have a lower rate

614
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:30,920
of capsular contracture when we go through an incision made underneath the fold of the breast,

615
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,880
as opposed to the nipple. The trials in the US, because you said that there was about a decade

616
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,800
when these were being used in Europe, but there were trials going on in the US, did the trials in

617
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,640
the US randomize to, because you basically have a, you have many options, but at the very least,

618
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,960
you'd have a two by two, which is textured, non textured, and then the two incisions. And

619
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,640
if you did enough of those under random conditions, you would pretty easily be able to tease out if

620
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,760
there's a difference. Yeah, that study was never done. One thing that was done that was very

621
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,720
interesting was a study where the reason why they developed these teardrop shaped implants,

622
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,680
they thought they would look more natural. And so they did an interesting study where they showed

623
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,800
at a meeting, a plastic surgery meeting, they showed the plastic surgeons in the audience,

624
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:24,520
a hundred pictures of women who've had breast augmentation. And they told them 50 of them were

625
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,400
with teardrop shaped implants and 50 were with round implants. And they wanted to see if they

626
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,600
could tell. And the plastic surgeons were only right 50% of the time. So it's in fact,

627
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:40,760
kidding me? Yeah. So it's in fact, so here we are the experts where, and I've found this many times

628
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,320
I've shown my brother a picture of results and I said, you like this? You think this is great? Wow,

629
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:50,360
it looks so natural. What implant do you think we use? That's got to be a teardrop shaped implant.

630
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,160
Nope, it's a round implant. And so, you know, there's many other factors that lead. Wait a

631
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,960
minute. That is the most stunning thing you have said so far in this discussion. And you've already

632
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,200
completely surprised me several times. It's hilarious because once that study came out,

633
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,400
and that was replicated, suddenly we realized, and this study was done several years ago. And

634
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,800
so I've mostly abandoned the teardrop shaped implants because the benefit we thought they had,

635
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,000
which is they give a more natural result is complete BS. It's not true at all. And this

636
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,520
has been proven. And secondarily, they have disadvantages. Number one, they're textured.

637
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:33,480
So they have this risk of this lymphoma. They're more expensive. They can rotate and they're harder

638
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:39,400
and firmer to maintain their teardrop shape. And so they feel less natural when you touch them.

639
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:45,880
So with only one supposed advantage and all these disadvantages, I've essentially stopped using them.

640
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,480
And I think that's where things are headed. They were very popular when they came out in 2010. And

641
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,320
the numbers are decreasing. I know that there's at this moment in time, you've got, there's going

642
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:02,680
to be women listening to this who are in the process of considering this. And so this forward

643
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:08,520
looking input is helpful, but invariably there will be a woman listening to this who already has

644
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:13,640
an implant that is teardrop shaped and that is textured. Is there anything that that woman needs

645
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,440
to do to be, does that one need to be concerned or if she's doing okay, she's probably one of the

646
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,680
lucky ones. I mean, statistically speaking, most women are going to do fine with these implants.

647
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,320
And hopefully the complications when they happen are in the past, but is there some sort of

648
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,520
surveillance or ongoing concern or consideration for women who have had said implants?

649
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,520
I think that these women should see their plastic surgeon at least once a year and maybe even every

650
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,160
six months. I don't think they need to run and replace the implants if there's not a problem.

651
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:49,560
Most of the cases in these patients who have this develop this lymphoma and again, the incidence is

652
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:55,960
between one in 3000 and one in maybe 10,000. We don't know the exact number because not all plastic

653
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,800
surgeons report the findings. Are they not required to? No, there's no law requiring it.

654
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:08,680
There's a database where they beg and plead that we do this, but again, the access to that is mostly

655
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:13,800
coming from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which is only targeting board certified plastic

656
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:19,320
surgeons. Like I told you before, you have all these other non-plastic surgeons doing breast

657
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:25,560
augmentation. When it comes to breast aug, what percent do you think are not being done by board

658
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:32,040
certified plasticians? In that procedure, only about 15%. So most of them are being done by board

659
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:38,040
certified plastic surgeons. But there are still cases where these other groups are not reporting

660
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,480
any patients where they find this and they don't even know about it and know how to test for it and

661
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:49,720
do the proper studies if they suspect it. But they have to see their surgeon once a year.

662
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:55,240
There usually are going to be other signs like significant swelling of the breast involved,

663
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:59,720
hardening of the breast so that the women tend to get capsular contracture first. So as long as

664
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,840
there's no problem, I think these women are fine and safe and they don't need to freak out and rush

665
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:10,760
to change out those implants. But they should watch them. They might want to consider getting an MRI

666
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:16,520
every few years just to check on things. They should be doing monthly self-exams to feel for

667
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:22,040
any masses. So sort of just the regular stuff a woman should do with her breast in general.

668
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,640
But again, the incidence is low, but it's something you have to be aware of if you have

669
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:33,160
or considering getting a textured implant. So we've basically said, let's put aside textured

670
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:39,640
implants. Let's put aside teardrop shaped implants. That means we're focusing on round smooth implants.

671
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:46,920
Do you have a point of view prospectively on silicone versus saline?

672
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,760
The saline implants were developed in the 90s when silicone implants came off the market.

673
01:02:52,760 --> 01:03:00,200
Which is like one of the greatest screw-ups in the history of medical regulation against a tech.

674
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:07,160
Right. It was an example of how a single newscaster on ABC, Connie Chung, could bring women on the

675
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:13,400
show crying, blaming their problems. I mean, we've seen this with vaccinations where one person said

676
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,880
they cause autism and next thing you know, you have thousands of children not getting vaccinated

677
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:23,000
because of this fear and then it's disproven, but it takes a while. There's a great quote,

678
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,600
and I'm going to bastardize it, but the gist of it is a lie can travel around the world faster

679
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:34,920
than it takes the truth to put its shoes on. That's very true. So the silicone implants came

680
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:41,000
off the market. They were a bad product, the old silicone implants. The silicone was liquid.

681
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:48,040
If you poked a hole in the implant, it would drip out like honey. Then the new implant companies,

682
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:53,400
Mentor and Allergan are the two main companies. They started making new silicone implants, which

683
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,920
essentially became widely FDA approved in around the year 2000. And so for almost 20 years now,

684
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,160
we've had these newer generation silicone implants and they're quite good. I mean,

685
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:10,360
they look and feel more natural. They're softer. You know, a saline implant is a shell of silicone

686
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:15,240
filled with saltwater instead of silicone on the inside. And so the outside is still silicone,

687
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,680
but they don't look as natural. They don't feel as natural. They're essentially like a water balloon.

688
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,680
They have a higher incidence of rippling and they don't last as long. They start to

689
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,840
leak after 10 to 15 years, although there are definitely women that can go longer.

690
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:34,120
They're a little bit cheaper than the silicone implants. So I still recommend and primarily use

691
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:39,720
silicone implants. I think the women who have saline implants and go to replace them,

692
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,480
they're a good candidate to stick with saline because if they have it and they like it and

693
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,480
they're happy with, there's nothing wrong with continuing to use it.

694
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:53,720
Okay. So now we've said again, going forward, your preference would be smooth, round silicone.

695
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,480
Two more points just to get your point of view on one is location of incision and above or below

696
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,720
the muscle. You've sort of talked a little bit about these, but again, what's your view

697
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,440
prospectively?

698
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,200
As I said earlier, I pretty much now do almost all my implants through an incision underneath

699
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,080
the fold of the breast. It's a hidden incision. There are patients where it's going to be more

700
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,480
visible, but again, we're trying to avoid capsular contracture. That's the worst complication. And if

701
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:25,000
we believe that bacteria are involved with that, then we want to avoid that. And so an incision

702
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,320
through the armpit or through the nipple, you're making an incision in a location where there are

703
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:35,560
more bacteria and you're cutting through nerves, both in the armpit and in the nipple. And studies

704
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:41,800
show that there is a higher rate of pain and numbness and issues associated with going through

705
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:47,480
those two sites. So I tried to dissuade patients from using anything other than an incision under

706
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:53,960
the fold. Do you let the patients decide ultimately? I let the patients decide, but I present a strong

707
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,920
argument based on my own experience and the data that's out there. And I think most people,

708
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:05,880
they're willing to listen and do the right thing. I also put most of the implants in under the muscle

709
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:11,160
or behind the muscle as opposed to on top of it. And there's a lot of data that supports the

710
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,440
benefits of that. And I think for most women, it just, they like the fact that it looks and feels

711
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:22,440
more natural to have the upper part of the implant covered by the muscle. It's better for mammograms.

712
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,320
It's better, God forbid, if you develop breast cancer, it has a lower rate of capsular

713
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,880
contracture. It helps support the weight of the implant as opposed to the implant just stretching

714
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,520
out the breast when it's sitting on top of the muscle. So there's many advantages and that's

715
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,960
what I do. And a lot of plastic surgeons do that as well. What percentage of the breast

716
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:49,960
surgery you do is augmentation for cosmetic reason without cancer versus reconstruction

717
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:57,720
and or augmentation following cancer surgery? Probably 75% is cosmetic and 25% at this point

718
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:04,200
is reconstructive. In that situation, the latter, meaning the reconstructive, what are your options?

719
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,560
Because you can also use tissue flaps and it gets much more elaborate in that situation, doesn't it?

720
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:14,600
Right. I mean, there's various options. You can use a woman's own tissue in the form of a flap

721
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:19,400
where traditionally we take the tissue from the abdomen and make a new breast out of it.

722
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:26,760
You can use fat and essentially just inject the fat in a series of treatments where you graft the

723
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:33,560
fat into the site where the breast was. We use implants and that is one situation where we might

724
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:39,080
still consider to use a teardrop shaped implant because I think in a reconstructive patient,

725
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,160
they're one of the few situations where there still is some benefit. And that's actually the

726
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:49,240
only situation where I'm using the teardrop shaped implants is for breast cancer reconstruction.

727
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,720
Those women have a lot of monitoring and everyone's on top of them because they've

728
01:07:53,720 --> 01:08:00,120
had breast cancer. So my concern with them is less about developing some type of lymphoma.

729
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:07,320
I also think that because they've had a mastectomy, their body's ability to mount this auto-immune

730
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:13,160
type response is lower because their lymphatics have mostly been cut. And so I'm a little bit

731
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:18,680
less concerned, but of course we still watch those women closely. When we meet with women who have

732
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,320
breast cancer and who are going to undergo breast reconstruction, we talk to them about the options,

733
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:29,720
what their goals are. A lot of it has to do with what type of recovery they want. The flap or

734
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,440
autologous tissue based procedures where we use a woman's own tissue have a much bigger recovery

735
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,920
as opposed to just putting in implants. And a lot of women aren't willing to undergo that.

736
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:44,280
What is the advantage of the autologous? Does it look better when you have a flap? Does it look

737
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:49,640
more natural? It does look more natural. And the main advantage is you never have to deal with an

738
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,360
implant and the complications associated with the implant for the rest of your life. You know, you

739
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,800
can't reject your own tissue. It's soft, it's natural. And it's especially good for a woman

740
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:06,280
who's only doing one side where she has a natural breast, especially if it's more of a flat hanging

741
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:12,200
breast on the other side, it's hard to match that with an implant. If a woman's doing both sides,

742
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:17,240
we'll usually lean more towards implants. But again, it's really on a case by case thing.

743
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:23,400
And how often do women in that situation require tissue expanders? And is it often a multi-stage

744
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:29,240
procedure or what's the sequence of events from the mastectomy to the reconstruction?

745
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:35,080
One of the things that's changed a lot in the field of breast cancer, you know, when you go back to the

746
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:41,480
beginning of the mastectomy, one of the great mentors and great surgeons, Halstead, who I think

747
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:46,440
was from your alma mater, he initially thought that you had to cut everything out for breast cancer.

748
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:54,680
And he would remove all the skin, all the breast and the muscle. And where we've come to today is

749
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:00,040
to a nipple sparing mastectomy, where essentially a lot of women are candidates for removing the

750
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:05,800
breast, but keeping all of the skin, including the nipple behind. In that case, you can go directly

751
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:11,240
to an implant reconstruction because you're not trying to manufacture new skin. In the case of

752
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:16,280
women who have to have their nipple removed, so you're moving, removing a portion of the skin,

753
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:22,040
you need to now restore skin that's been removed in the mastectomy. And that's where a tissue

754
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:27,560
expander comes in, where we stretch out the skin. And that's a multi-step process that takes a few

755
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:32,920
months until we put in a final implant. Wow. You know, I was talking with somebody about this

756
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:40,360
recently, and they made a point about there's no analogous cancer, I guess, that is where you're

757
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:47,880
dealing simultaneously with the cancer risk, you know, you have to remove these cells, but also

758
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,840
sort of the threat to your psyche and the threat to your image. And even if you look at something

759
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:58,600
like testicular cancer or prostate cancer, it's not quite as visible in terms of the change that

760
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,760
you're going through. I mean, obviously there's functional deficits that occur, but do you find

761
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,360
yourself dealing with the psychology of that? I mean, dealing with a patient who's sort of shell

762
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:14,920
shocked and going through this simultaneous loss, right? Like the loss of this tissue and the cancer

763
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:21,640
risk, but then the loss of part of my femininity. Yeah, absolutely. I remember when I was starting

764
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:27,240
out in practice, I somehow, I don't remember the circumstance, but there was a woman who was part

765
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,960
of my team, whether it was a nurse or a PA was in the room with me with a breast cancer patient.

766
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,400
And the patient started to cry when we started to talk about her diagnosis and the treatment.

767
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,760
And I sort of sat there, you know, a little uncomfortable, not sure what to do. And she was

768
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:48,040
crying and the woman who was in the room with me, the nurse, if it was, she grabbed a tissue

769
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:52,840
and gave it to the patient and then hugged her. And that episode really stuck in my mind because

770
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:59,000
it made me feel inadequate at the time. And I didn't know if it was because I was a man or

771
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:05,640
because I didn't have breasts and hadn't undergone breast cancer, or I didn't have a family member

772
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,800
who'd had breast cancer. I wasn't sure what the reason was. I hadn't received the adequate

773
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:16,440
sensitivity training, but I just felt inadequate to deal with it. And I think since that time,

774
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:24,120
I've become better at developing the empathy and the understanding for what these women are going

775
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:29,800
through. A lot of it has come through getting to know the husbands and the children and the parents,

776
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,920
where, you know, I talk to them and spend time with them and kind of get a better feel as the

777
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:40,200
man what they're going through. It's a very complicated process. And a lot of good hospitals

778
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:45,240
have social workers and psychologists that help the women. We're seeing more and more breast

779
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,680
cancer in younger women these days. So it's a very devastating thing. I mean, for a lot of women,

780
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:56,840
they associate their femininity to a large degree with their breasts and losing that has a profound

781
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:03,400
impact on them. That was a pretty awesome summary, at least to me, of I think I learned more about

782
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,800
breast reconstruction in the last few minutes than I've ever known. Let's turn our attention

783
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,760
to another operation. What would be sort of another very common operation that shows up

784
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:20,520
liposuction or your pick? Yeah, I think tummy tuck is one of the top five procedures along

785
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:26,120
with breast augmentation and rhinoplasty, facelift, liposuction. Okay. So tummy tuck,

786
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:32,120
let's define that for people. What's a tummy tuck? The tummy tuck is essentially a procedure that

787
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:37,800
involves removal of all the excess skin in the abdomen below the belly button in the central

788
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:44,520
abdomen. It also typically involves tightening of the muscles that get stretched out as a result of

789
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:52,360
pregnancy. 95% of tummy tucks are done on postpartum women who've had children and their bodies have

790
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:56,920
changed to a large degree after childbirth. This is probably as good a time as any to

791
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:03,640
define the difference between a diastasis and a hernia since the two sort of happen

792
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,600
under these circumstances as well. And I assume that if either of those are present,

793
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:15,160
this is the time to fix them. Absolutely. A large number, I would say maybe even as high as 20% of

794
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:20,760
women after pregnancy develop a hernia in the belly button. The belly button was the site of

795
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,960
your umbilical cord when you were in utero. And so there was always an opening there and its scars

796
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:32,120
closed when you're born, but it's an inherent spot of weakness. So the act of pregnancy where

797
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:37,160
the abdominal wall is stretching and the pressure inside is building up as the uterus grows can pop

798
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:43,400
that open. And a lot of women develop hernias. So essentially a little tiny hole where the belly

799
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:48,600
button was and the fat on the inside pooches through that hole into the belly button. So it

800
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:54,600
gives you an outie, if you will, which is essentially a hernia. A diastasis is different.

801
01:14:54,600 --> 01:15:00,120
It's a separation of the rectus muscles. So the six pack muscles move aside and then there's a

802
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:06,840
gap in between. In many ways, it's similar to a hernia in that you have a weakened central area

803
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,080
where stuff is pushing out against. And I've had patients with severe diastasis where you can

804
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:17,320
literally see their intestines through their skin. It looks like a worm moving around inside. And

805
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:22,360
that's because the tissue is so thinned out in between the muscles. Both of these would be

806
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:29,880
addressed at the time of a tummy tuck. Now the diastasis doesn't have the risks that an untreated

807
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:35,320
hernia have. I mean, that's the other thing that patients should understand is an untreated hernia

808
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:42,360
can be catastrophic. Yeah, absolutely. Because with an untreated hernia, if something pushes

809
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:47,720
through that hole and gets stuck, we term it an incarcerated hernia, that tissue can

810
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:51,880
necrose or die away. And if it's part of the intestine, that can become life threatening.

811
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,560
We know a little bit better now that if a hernia is asymptomatic, so a woman has no symptoms from

812
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:03,080
it at all. Same is true with a man, you can just sit and wait on that you don't have to treat it.

813
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:08,920
Once it starts to cause pain, or any other symptoms, it should be treated. Let's just

814
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:15,400
take a sort of a typical example of a patient. So a woman who's had two children, she's late 30s,

815
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:20,440
early 40s, doesn't want to have kids anymore. Is that important that this is only done after

816
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,720
she's done having children, I assume? Yeah, I mean, if you do it on someone and they end up getting

817
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:31,160
pregnant afterwards, they can kind of wreck the beautiful result that you do. You can still get

818
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:36,120
pregnant, you stretch everything out. A tummy tuck can be done a second time if necessary,

819
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,880
but ideally, and I tell patients wait until you're done with children.

820
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,720
So let's say just for the sake of example, she has pick one, a hernia or a diastasis. Is one

821
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,360
easier or more difficult to repair in the context of the tummy tuck, assuming they're both of modest

822
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:56,440
size, not enormous? I think the diastasis is a little bit easier because you're not dealing with

823
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:02,120
concerns of damaging the bowel or the hernia coming back. The diastasis is generally not

824
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:06,680
going to come back. You're bringing the muscles together. And that's some more common scenario of

825
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:12,680
the women who have the diastasis, where they're instead of having a flat abdomen, it's sort of

826
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:19,160
protuberant and convex outward. And especially, you know, classically after a large meal, these

827
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:25,960
women, their belly is sticking out. And I joke that the absolute indication for a tummy tuck is if

828
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,520
one of your children asks you if you're having another baby after a large meal.

829
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,440
We'll call that the Krieger test. By the way, on that note, I want to just tell the listeners,

830
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:41,320
you should never ask a woman if she's pregnant. I have a lot of patients who people say,

831
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:46,360
when are you do? Have you had the baby yet? There's a lot of thin women who have very

832
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,120
low body fat and a huge diastasis and they look like they're six months pregnant.

833
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,800
Never ask a woman if she's pregnant. Yeah, there's a great comedian. I think it's Brian Regan,

834
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:02,600
who's got a whole bit on this. And I think the takeaway from his bit was the only time

835
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:08,360
it is socially acceptable to ask a woman if she is pregnant is if the head is coming out and you

836
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,440
can see- The baby's crowning. Right. If the baby's crowning, you actually see the head coming out.

837
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:17,000
At that moment, you are permitted to say, oh, Susie, are you pregnant? You know,

838
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,360
but anything before that, no, you just, you just shut that down. So does it matter,

839
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:28,680
Zoll, one way or the other, if women have had vaginal deliveries versus C-sections, which also,

840
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:34,040
of course, introduced that fan and seal incision, been like it's sort of a very,

841
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:38,680
very low abdominal incision, because that's cutting through muscle.

842
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:43,880
We can still do a tummy tuck in either way. Are they more susceptible one way or the other?

843
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,040
No, I don't think they're more susceptible. I think it has to do with genetics and the size

844
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:54,040
of the baby and the weight at which one gained weight during the pregnancy. But I think that with

845
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:59,240
the C-section patients, we have the option to correct a lot of the issues from the C-section,

846
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:04,280
like scar tissue and indented tethered scars that bother a lot of patients or

847
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,760
skin that hangs over the scar. So there's that additional benefit.

848
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,080
So you'll go through the C-section incision.

849
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,120
I'll actually go below it and cut it out completely.

850
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:20,760
Because I want to make my own new incision. I think that in general, the vaginal delivery

851
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:26,680
patients, and I don't know if it's from the act of pushing during labor or whatnot, maybe it's

852
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,280
just the factors that coalesce to lead to them having a vaginal delivery, as opposed to...

853
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:35,240
Yeah, it might be that a woman who can have a vaginal delivery has more elastic skin. She is

854
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,960
more able to stretch. And while that permits her to have the vaginal delivery, it also makes her

855
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,000
more susceptible to the stretching of the fascia.

856
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:49,720
Right. And so we tend to see a little bit more of a diastasis there. But the rate of C-sections

857
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:54,120
has increased so dramatically in the U.S. I mean, I don't know the numbers, but it's probably

858
01:19:54,120 --> 01:20:00,200
approaching 40 to 50 percent now. It's so common now to see women coming in who've had C-sections

859
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:07,800
and are coming in for tummy tucks. So what is the actual procedure? So you're making the incision,

860
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:13,240
and obviously there's a lot of skin removal. How are you going from this incision, just basically

861
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:18,680
at the pubic line, all the way up to above the belly button to fix the diastasis?

862
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:25,720
We're essentially lifting up all of the skin off the abdominal wall all the way up to the xiphoid,

863
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:31,800
so right up to the breast bone. And we're exposing the entire abdominal wall. It's basically like

864
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,720
an anatomy textbook. You're staring at the whole abdominal wall with the skin lifted up. And then

865
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,920
we do the muscle tightening or the hernia repair.

866
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,560
And the muscle tightening, you are literally bringing sutures together to pull the rectus

867
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:50,680
muscles back such that you're, you know, when people look at a six-pack, what they realize is

868
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:56,760
the reason it's not a three-pack is there's a fascia piece that goes down the middle that

869
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:01,800
separates the left and the right side. And that maybe ought to be what, an inch apart?

870
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,280
Even if that may be less, half an inch to an inch.

871
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:09,640
Got it. So a woman with a diastasis will show up and that will be inches apart.

872
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,920
Correct. And not only are the muscles apart, the fascia has been stretched out. So

873
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:20,520
the muscles instead of being flat are actually protuberant. So you kind of get this sort of like

874
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,400
mini beer belly, if you will. And so we're tightening the fascia, which is the outer layer

875
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:31,320
of the muscle and bringing it together so that the abdominal wall then becomes flat and tight.

876
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:36,360
What percentage of the time are you doing this on a man? Because certainly a man who's lost a

877
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,320
lot of weight could be in the same situation. Correct?

878
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:44,680
Yeah. They're definitely a minority. Five to 10% of patients are men with this operation.

879
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,680
And almost all of them are massive weight loss patients who've lost a lot of weight.

880
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:53,080
They usually don't have a diastasis, so they don't need the muscle tightening.

881
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,680
And it's all about just the skin removal in those cases.

882
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,320
What are the biggest risks to this procedure?

883
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,680
Biggest risk is fluid accumulation called the seroma after the surgery. You know,

884
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,560
you've created such an enormous amount of space where you've lifted up the skin

885
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:15,880
that you could put easily a liter of fluid to fill in that area. And so we use drains to drain

886
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:21,640
the fluid out. And the risk is if you don't have enough drains or they're not in the right spot,

887
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:28,040
and then after the drain comes out, the fluid can accumulate. And the incidence is about 10% to 15%.

888
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,720
And if a woman develops that complication, does it require drainage or does it go away on its own?

889
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:38,440
It usually requires drainage. And in rare cases, it'll go away on its own.

890
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,960
And do you, as the plastic surgeon, do the drainage or does an interventional radiologist do it?

891
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,360
We do everything. I mean, in my practice, we manage all the complications. Occasionally,

892
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:52,840
we'll send someone to an interventional radiologist. If, for example, the fluid is in one

893
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:57,400
small specific spot and you need an ultrasound to see where it is, and we need them to put in a

894
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:03,320
special type of drain, but 95% of the time we're managing it ourselves in the clinic.

895
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,040
So even if a woman develops a seroma, do they typically resolve with the appropriate

896
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:12,840
follow-up drainage? Yeah, they usually do. Okay. Is it a big risk of bleeding or are you

897
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,520
pretty much staying away from major blood vessels? Bleeding is a small risk. And I think the cases

898
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:24,200
where it happens are the patients with larger blood vessels, massive weight loss patients have

899
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:29,800
very large blood vessels. And so it's understanding when you need to tie off a blood vessel as

900
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:35,160
opposed to just cauterizing it and really being meticulous and careful. And again, that goes back

901
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:41,240
in my practice to having the two surgeons. Every single thing is double checked. It's easy to miss

902
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:47,720
something when you're by yourself. And uncontrolled blood pressure, so patients who have high blood

903
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:53,480
pressure after surgery, that is an increased risk for bleeding, specifically on procedures on the

904
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:59,000
face. And what about long-term complications? What are the cosmetic issues that come up after

905
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,480
women have had this? The main thing people complain about is the scars. They're unhappy

906
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:09,400
with the appearance of the scar. A lot of patients gain weight or things stretch out and they end up

907
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:14,600
with loose skin after the surgery. So it's nice and tight for the first year, but then it loosens up

908
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:20,200
and they're unhappy with that. Occasionally patients, deep fascia stretches out and so they

909
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:25,640
have a little bit of a recurrent diastasis and they're unhappy with that. But most of the patients

910
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:30,840
are pretty pleased. When you combine liposuction with the tummy tuck, you raise the stakes.

911
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:37,160
It increases the complication rate a little bit and liposuction patients in general, I mean it's

912
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:43,240
a whole other discussion, but there's a lot of unhappiness and dissatisfaction when it comes to

913
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:49,240
liposuction. Can you predict in advance if a woman, assuming she hasn't already had a scar,

914
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:53,800
she's never had a surgical procedure, I guess this is true for men as well, but since we're talking

915
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,880
about a pretty big incision here in the tummy tuck, can you predict who's going to get a

916
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:04,360
hypertrophic scar or a keloid? I mean I know keloids tend to be more common in African-American than

917
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:11,080
white or Hispanic, but even absent a keloid, just people have very different scar morphology and

918
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:17,240
given the size of the scar here, that would seem to play a role in the long-term cosmesis, right?

919
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:23,720
Yeah for sure and it's tough. I mean in general you really can't predict unless someone already

920
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:30,200
has evidence of bad scarring what's going to happen. It's definitely a genetic thing. Asians

921
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:36,040
and dark-skinned patients have a higher risk of keloiding. Their skin is thicker and it's more

922
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:41,320
sebaceous and it tends to scar worse, so we're always concerned more about that with our darker

923
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:47,560
skin patients, but even in fair-skinned patients we'll sometimes see bad scarring. Patients who

924
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,760
have infections or any delay in the healing are at higher risk for developing keloids, but

925
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:59,800
the tension on a scar is a big contributor to how the scar is going to turn out. So areas of very

926
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,920
high tension like a tummy tuck where the two edges are pulling apart as opposed to an incision

927
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,600
where it's just an axis incision like cutting over a hip to get down to the joint, the high

928
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:17,160
tension scars tend to be much worse. So in patients who were closing it under a lot of tension where

929
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,400
we've cut out a lot of skin and we're kind of going for the home run to make it as tight and

930
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:28,200
flat as possible. We'll do things to minimize the tension, but that tension is a big risk for the

931
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:33,640
poor scarring. The proof in this is that the area of highest tension is in the very center of the

932
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:39,480
scar and that usually is the area that scars poorly, whereas as you go out towards the side of the scar

933
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:45,800
towards the hip bone, the scar becomes more faint and less noticeable because there's less tension

934
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:52,360
there. So you just sort of alluded to liposuction, so let's go there next. This is one of those

935
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:58,040
procedures where I'm guessing what percentage of them being done are not being done by board

936
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:05,800
certified plastic surgeons. This is something where we probably see a large, large number. I mean if

937
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:12,760
I had to guess, probably talking about 80 to 90 percent of the procedures are being done by

938
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:20,840
non-plastic surgeons in an office-based setting. There are anywhere from 20 to 30 devices out there

939
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:27,960
that perform different types of liposuction and a lot of this is done in an office-based setting.

940
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:34,600
And so doctors, non-plastic surgeons are purchasing these devices and offering this to patients.

941
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:44,280
And there are non-invasive devices. A popular one is called Cool Sculpting, which I don't do. I'm not

942
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:51,080
a big believer in. You kind of wave a magic wand over the person. It freezes the fat. I mean I always

943
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:58,280
said if freezing the fat works, why are the Eskimos so fat? Maybe they're not cold enough.

944
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:05,000
Yeah and then you have devices that heat it up. So it's like wait, do you want to freeze it or heat

945
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,960
it up? I'm not a believer in a lot of these technologies. They have a lot of risks associated

946
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:16,280
with them, a lot of risks of burns, contour irregularities. Most board certified plastic

947
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:21,960
surgeons do what's called just traditional liposuction where it's essentially the movement

948
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:27,080
of a cannula that causes the fat to break down and then you just suck it out. You're not using

949
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:33,640
additional laser or radio frequency or ultrasound forms of energy to remove the fat.

950
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,120
What does it look like? I mean I think we're talking about subcutaneous fat here. We're not

951
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:42,760
talking about removing visceral fat or things that are below fascia. So everything is above this very

952
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:48,440
thick connective tissue. But when you put a cannula, I guess maybe we should just explain some

953
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,120
of these terms we're using. So a cannula is what? How would you explain that to somebody?

954
01:28:52,120 --> 01:29:00,280
The cannula is a hollow long metal or plastic device that is inserted underneath the skin

955
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:06,440
into the fat and that's what breaks the fat down and sucks it out. Why is it that if you took a

956
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:11,640
person who has lots of subcutaneous fat and you put a five millimeter incision in them and you

957
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:17,160
stick a five millimeter cannula and you just hook it up to a vacuum, why doesn't it just uniformly

958
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:24,120
suck out all the fat? The fat is actually connected pretty well to the overlying skin.

959
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:29,800
There's connective tissue and different parts of the body. It's connected to various degrees. For

960
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:36,680
example, the fat on the soles of the feet and the palms is extremely strong and tough fat.

961
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:41,880
The fat in the buttocks where we sit is also very rigid in fat. It's difficult to be extremely hard

962
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:47,960
to liposuction that so just creating suction won't suck it out. It's stuck there. You have to

963
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:55,800
actually break it apart and that's how it's done with a form of energy or just the mechanical

964
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:02,040
energy generated by the movement of the cannula that breaks the fat apart. Who first did this

965
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,960
procedure? I mean how long has this procedure been around? It's been around a long time,

966
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:11,160
probably 50 years and it was invented by a dermatologist. So it's difficult as a plastic

967
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,400
surgeon to judge dermatologists who do liposuction because they actually invented it.

968
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:21,320
So I think dermatologists who have adequate additional training, they're not usually doing

969
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:27,480
this in their regular residency, could probably do some areas of liposuction. But again, I think

970
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:32,520
that you have to distinguish between specialties where you spent a lot of time in the operating

971
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:38,680
room as opposed to specialties that didn't. Like we talked about, I was in the military.

972
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:44,440
I spent a little bit of time in the ocean and diving and so yeah, I can go in but that's not

973
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:49,640
my area of expertise like someone who's a Navy SEAL where they're so comfortable in the ocean.

974
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,960
I mean the same thing is true in the operating room. You're either a surgeon or you're not a

975
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:59,800
surgeon. If you're a surgeon, you've spent literally years of time in the operating room and your

976
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:05,400
comfort level with dealing with everything is very different. A surgeon once said to me,

977
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:10,840
a good surgeon knows how to take care of any complication they create and the complications

978
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:17,640
from liposuction are astounding. I mean, there are multiple cases of patients puncturing lungs

979
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:24,280
and puncturing liver and intestine. Well, I mean, you'll have to explain to me how that happens

980
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:32,520
outside of the most egregious malpractice. I mean, this is all happening outside of fascia. So how

981
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:37,480
is it that the patient is so big that the surgeon, I mean, I'm trying to be sensitive to the surgeon

982
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:42,920
making the mistake as well, but to give someone a pneumothorax or to puncture their liver,

983
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,360
you have to take that cannula and instead of moving outside of the plane where the fat is,

984
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:53,320
you have to turn the cannula inward, right? Right. So, you know, the most common area of

985
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:59,240
liposuction is the abdomen. So if someone is liposuctioning the upper abdomen, you obviously

986
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:03,640
have to understand the anatomy. You have a rib cage there, so you have to stay above the ribs.

987
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,200
But if you're not paying attention, you're not feeling and aware with what you're doing,

988
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:12,840
it'd be pretty easy to slip underneath the rib. Well, if you go underneath the rib,

989
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:18,520
the next thing you encounter there is the rectus muscle and then the diaphragm. And so

990
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:25,240
these thin cannulas are actually riskier, a one to two millimeter cannula. It's easy to just push

991
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:32,600
right through the abdominal wall and into the next layer. Why not use a blunt cannula instead of

992
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:38,520
a sharp? They are blunt, but it's still, there've been multiple, multiple cases of this happening.

993
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,840
And does anyone ever do this with an, like, because if you're doing liposuction on someone

994
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:47,880
who's subcutaneous fat, but they're not incredibly big, presumably the risk of this is lower?

995
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:53,080
Is this more? You would think so, but we still see it in thin patients.

996
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,320
So ultrasound guidance wouldn't help when you're in those areas?

997
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:02,840
It probably would. It's sort of impractical because then you have to introduce an ultrasound

998
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:08,040
starily and then you need either the person doing the liposuction knows how to use the ultrasound or

999
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:13,560
they have to bring in someone else. So that is not typically done. I think it would increase the

1000
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:19,080
safety, but you know, a well-trained surgeon who knows the anatomy and knows what they're doing,

1001
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:23,080
they have to get pretty lost to end up in the lung or the liver.

1002
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,080
What's the typical path they're taking to the lungs? Is it inferior through the diaphragm as well?

1003
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:32,280
Yeah, it's through the diaphragm or when they're liposuctioning the side of the bra line,

1004
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:36,760
which is a common area during a breast reduction or another procedure, women want to get rid of

1005
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:42,760
that bra fat. And so you have to stay outside of the rib cage. So if you're, the angle of the

1006
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:49,000
cannula is wrong, you could easily puncture in and end up in the lung. And liposuction is a

1007
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,400
dangerous procedure if not done properly. And we see incredible complications and death rates from

1008
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:02,040
it, electrolyte problems from fluid shifts, you know, there's tremendous fluid shifts that happen

1009
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:09,080
after liposuction, volume overload, pulmonary edema, fluid in the lungs, essentially. And we

1010
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:13,880
see these and it's really an issue of where are you doing the liposuction in the office or in the

1011
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:19,080
operating room? Are you monitoring the patients during and after the procedure? Another major risk

1012
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:25,240
with liposuction is lidocaine toxicity. So overdosing the people with lidocaine, because

1013
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:30,520
you're obviously having to numb up the area before you liposuction it. So how do you numb them up? You

1014
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:37,240
numb up where you make the incision, you then introduce fluid full of lidocaine into the area.

1015
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:41,720
It also has epinephrine in it. So it causes constriction of the blood vessels to decrease

1016
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:46,840
the bleeding. And does any of that make its way into the patient's actual bloodstream so that

1017
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:52,440
their heart rate goes faster, which the epinephrine would do? Interestingly, it takes about eight to

1018
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:59,400
12 hours as a delay after the liposuction for it to see peak levels of these substances in the

1019
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:04,680
bloodstream. And so you're done with a procedure after a couple of hours, patient recovers for

1020
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:09,400
another hour, they're home. So these levels are occurring at home. And that's when you have to

1021
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,440
really understand what you're doing, what volumes you're putting into the patient,

1022
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:20,600
making these calculations. And a lot of the people doing this in the office are not thinking about

1023
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,920
it. And that's where they run into trouble. I mean, you get more nervous doing liposuction,

1024
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:29,160
I'm guessing than either of the two procedures we've discussed beforehand. I mean, I think I'm

1025
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:34,200
at the point where I'm pretty comfortable, but I'm very conservative with what I do. I

1026
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:39,160
try to avoid very large volume liposuction. That's where it becomes risky where you're

1027
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:44,920
trying to suck up more than, you know, about 10 pounds of fat at a time. That's what we would

1028
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:49,880
consider five liters, which is, you know, slightly over 10 pounds is what's considered large volume

1029
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:55,240
liposuction. And that's where the risks really go way up. What are some people doing out there in

1030
01:35:55,240 --> 01:36:01,560
the community? I mean, they're doing everything 20 pounds, 30 pounds of liposuction, eight hours of

1031
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:07,400
liposuction all day long. I mean, just, it's the wild West. Like I said, anyone can do anything and

1032
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:16,760
there's no laws or regulations governing what's done. It's buyer beware. Yeah. And what is the

1033
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:23,720
typical cost? How does liposuction get priced? Most people price it by the area. So it might run

1034
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:29,240
anywhere from a thousand dollars if you're just doing one limited area in an office based procedure,

1035
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:36,600
you know, up to seven to $8,000 depending on going into multiple areas over several hours.

1036
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:42,680
And what's the range in price that you see between sort of highly trained, you know,

1037
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:48,280
dermatologist or plastic surgeon versus the, you know, people who are doing this with less training?

1038
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,680
I think in general, the people with less training who are not board certified plastic surgeons are

1039
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:58,040
usually charging much less, especially if they're doing things in the office and, you know, you can

1040
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:04,200
see a two to three fold price difference, you know, something that a family practice doctor or we

1041
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:10,280
have a female gynecologist in my community who does a lot of office based liposuction. And she's

1042
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:15,720
charging a third of what I might charge for the same procedure, doing it in the operating room with

1043
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:21,000
anesthesia. And then there's regional differences, you know, so even though you guys might actually

1044
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:26,520
make the same amount per procedure, you have to spread your cost out much more because if you're,

1045
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:29,800
if you have an anesthesiologist, they're new in the operating room, your costs have increased

1046
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:36,680
dramatically. Correct. Okay, let's go on to butt lifts. This is the dangerous one, right?

1047
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:42,040
Yeah, this is the real dangerous one. This is extremely popular these days and getting more and

1048
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:49,080
more popular social media, you know, Kim Kardashian is probably accounted for a billion dollars spent

1049
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:56,280
in the US on this procedure. It's very popular in Central and South America. There's definitely a

1050
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:03,480
ethnic and racial preference for this procedure. There's a great I went to a great meeting in

1051
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:10,760
Miami. Miami is like the New York City for Central and South American doctors. So they love to come

1052
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:17,240
to Miami for the nightlife and the restaurants and they just love it there. This meeting had

1053
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:23,080
1000s of plastic surgeons, 80% are from Brazil and Argentina and Mexico and Central America.

1054
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,840
And so they showed four butt pictures on the screen to the plastic surgeons and you know,

1055
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,880
everyone in the audience has a little button thing that they can choose and they say, okay,

1056
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:40,120
we want you to rank your favorite what you think is the ideal buttocks. And so people pick and

1057
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:46,120
then they show the result. And of course, the big huge giant round butt is the most popular. And

1058
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:51,080
then they said, we want you to click your country of origin where you're from. And there's just a

1059
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:56,200
beautiful correlation between the Brazilian and the South American plastic surgeons and the

1060
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:01,880
preference for this type of butt. So a lot of it depends on the aesthetic of the surgeon. In

1061
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:08,360
California, we do a lot less of this because my ideal and a woman in California's ideal body is

1062
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:15,240
maybe more of the athletic toned sort of body type as opposed to in Miami where everybody wants to

1063
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:21,400
have this rounded, you know, large protuberant buttocks. But it's very popular. I mean, we still

1064
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:28,600
see a lot of patients asking for this. How many of these do you do a year? I probably do 20 to 30 a

1065
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:35,080
year. And your peers in Miami would do how many? They might do four to five a day. This is like

1066
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:39,640
there's some I know one guy where he's literally doing seven to eight a day of these procedures.

1067
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:46,680
Like it's like a factory. This is one of the most dangerous procedures in all of plastic surgery. And

1068
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:52,840
we actually have had meetings in our societies and almost to the point where they want to put a

1069
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:59,720
moratorium and just stop doing these procedures. The issue is what the Brazilian butt lift is is

1070
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:05,160
injecting fat into the butt to enlarge it. That fat is liposuction from one part of the body and

1071
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:10,600
then inject it into the butt. So there's no mechanical lift that's going on. The lift is

1072
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:17,560
accompanied by it. I didn't even know that. It's like inflating a balloon. All this time.

1073
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:23,480
Yeah, it's just filling it up with fat as much as you can get in there. The issue is inadvertently

1074
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:30,040
injecting fat into the veins in the butt. And then the fat gets transported to the lungs and causes

1075
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:36,840
a fat embolus, which has a high risk of fatality. And so there have been multiple deaths, most of

1076
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:43,320
them in Florida, but multiple deaths in in South America, even in California, we've had deaths from

1077
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:51,000
this procedure. When they autopsy these patients, they uniformly find their lungs full of fat that

1078
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:57,240
was basically transported from the veins in the butt where the fat was accidentally injected. And

1079
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:03,320
so there's a lot of recommendations about how to avoid this and, you know, using smaller volumes,

1080
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:08,600
injecting it more superficially. But it's still very popular. I mean, despite the risks, women

1081
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:14,520
still want this. What are the stated risks of a fat embolus from this procedure? In other words,

1082
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:19,560
if you walk into a responsible doctor's office or someone walks into your office and says,

1083
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:24,520
what's my risk of this? What percent would you quote? It would probably be one in a thousand would

1084
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:30,840
be the risk, maybe, maybe even higher. And I guess this is a great fatal fat embolism. There's

1085
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:35,880
probably cases where it's happening and it's not fatal, like a regular pulmonary embolism. And

1086
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:39,560
we don't catch it. You know, it's interesting. This is a great discussion about the asymmetry

1087
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:44,120
of risk because you might listen to this and think, well, one in a thousand is not that bad.

1088
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:48,280
But I was telling you earlier today, I mean, I had to keep my phone on during this interview

1089
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:54,040
because I have a patient who I sent into the emergency room to rule out a pulmonary embolism.

1090
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:59,080
And we're talking about this this morning and the patient was saying, well, you know,

1091
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:06,280
I've got this pain in my calf and I've been flying a lot and, you know, was sort of thinking,

1092
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:10,360
I wonder if I do feel a little short of breath. You know, it's hard to say. So look, listening

1093
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,440
to the patient's story, I think the probability that they have a pulmonary embolism is actually

1094
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:21,320
quite low, but it's not zero. And I said, just to make the math easy, let's assume there's a

1095
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:25,720
one percent chance you have a pulmonary embolism or a point one percent chance you have pulmonary

1096
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:30,680
embolism. You have to consider the cost of doing something versus the cost of doing nothing and

1097
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:38,760
then the cost of being wrong in both of those situations. So the cost of being wrong if you

1098
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:45,320
don't go in to the ER, you just stay where you are, you don't go anywhere, meaning wrong, meaning you

1099
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:50,200
have a pulmonary embolism, but you don't do anything about it. That cost is infinitely greater,

1100
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:57,160
though far less likely, than the cost of you going into the ER, not having a pulmonary embolism.

1101
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:02,040
So there's a cost to that. Cost you time, cost money, it's a pain in the ass. No pun intended,

1102
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:07,160
in this case not referring to a butt lift, but that's a finite cost, whereas the other one

1103
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:12,040
becomes an infinite cost. So it's so funny, I went out for a run this morning. This is actually what

1104
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:16,760
I was thinking about, not this example, but I was thinking about, I wish somebody would build a

1105
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:24,280
really good risk model for patients to help them understand the asymmetry of risk, because if you

1106
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:29,400
say, look, there's a 5% chance of you getting a seroma, or there's a 0.1% chance of you getting

1107
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:37,240
a fat embolism, I'm not sure everybody appreciates the difference. The 5% seroma has a much lower

1108
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:43,400
consequence to it. So that might be a tool to help patients understand this, because the other thing

1109
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:49,560
with a fat embolism, not only is it devastating, but you don't get much of a warning necessarily

1110
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,520
from when the complication is taking place. And it's almost impossible to treat when it happens.

1111
01:43:54,520 --> 01:44:00,440
Yeah, that's another great example. So you mentioned a guy who's doing six of these a day,

1112
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:05,800
seven of these a day. I mean, presumably he's not getting many complications, right? Or he wouldn't

1113
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:11,720
be able to do that, right? No, he is. I mean, it's shocking to me how tolerant people are of

1114
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:18,840
complications. I mean, when you look, there is a recent exposé done by USA Today about these Miami

1115
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:25,640
plastic surgery clinics where they've had tremendous number of deaths and complications.

1116
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:32,280
And people just keep going back because they are so price conscious. I mean,

1117
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:37,800
these places will do it for cheaper than anywhere else will. And they...

1118
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,040
So you get fries and a drink with the procedure.

1119
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:41,720
And it's like a happy meal.

1120
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:49,000
Yeah. And the patients don't care. And people have this idea that if you're a doctor, you're safe,

1121
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,320
and you know what you're doing, and you're going to do the right thing. If there's a clinic and it

1122
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:59,720
looks semi-clean, that they don't need to worry. And the problem is the laws are not out there to

1123
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:05,800
100% protect the patients. They're actually in the process now of amending a lot of the laws in

1124
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:13,320
Florida, which has just been way too liberal in terms of what they allow to happen. I mean,

1125
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:20,200
everything is driven by money. You get these lobby groups. A good example would be optometrists

1126
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:25,960
do not have training to do surgical procedures, but they might lobby to allow them to do

1127
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:32,040
blepharoplasty, so eyelid surgery. And they're paying money to politicians, and then laws are

1128
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:36,200
getting passed that allow them to do this. That's not in the interest of the patients.

1129
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:41,720
Patients do not need more doctors who know how to or are able legally to perform eyelids.

1130
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,840
Did you say optometrists?

1131
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:43,320
Optometrists.

1132
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,040
Not optomologists.

1133
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:50,360
No, optometrists. Or dentists who want to do facelifts. So they're lobbying state legislators

1134
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:56,120
to allow them to do facelifts. I would argue that a dentist does not have training to do a facelift.

1135
01:45:56,120 --> 01:46:01,080
They're used to working through the mouth. Now you're talking about working very far away from

1136
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:05,720
the mouth using principles and techniques that they have no training in. They just want the money.

1137
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:09,560
So they're doing this for the money, not for the benefit of the patient. It's not like

1138
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,360
patients are suffering because there's not enough good facelift surgeons out there. That's just not

1139
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:22,920
true. So finances drives a lot of this and not necessarily patient safety. The groups that try

1140
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:29,720
and protect patient safety don't have the money and the backing to pressure the legislators to

1141
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:34,920
do everything that is in the best interest of the patients. I suppose the argument that these

1142
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,600
groups would put forth is, look, in the end the patients get to choose. It's a free world.

1143
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:43,240
That's right. We're just trying to create a bigger market and an efficient market should sort this out.

1144
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:50,920
But it doesn't because there's not transparency and there's not adequate oversight. Like when

1145
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:57,960
you look at the situation in Florida, you have surgery centers that are doing only plastic

1146
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:05,400
surgery being owned by businessmen with long laundry list of convictions and crime.

1147
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:10,520
They're not doctors at all. In some states, only doctors can be involved where they're literally

1148
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:15,000
not just owning the surgery center. They're involved in the day-to-day running and making

1149
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,960
sure that the doctors working at the facility are well trained. In Florida, there's no rules about

1150
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:26,600
the doctors who are working at these facilities. You have doctors who've lost their license and

1151
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,080
licenses are suspended. They don't care. These guys are just doing it for the money.

1152
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:38,920
It's really buyer beware. All of the burden falls on the patients to do their homework and do their

1153
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:45,720
research. For a lot of uneducated, less sophisticated patients, they don't know what to ask. They don't

1154
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:51,960
know what to look for. They're the ones who are suffering a lot of minority patients. They're the

1155
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:57,560
ones who are suffering the brunt of these complications. In Miami, there's a huge

1156
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:04,120
advertising blitz on Hispanic radio stations and billboards in the inner city where they're

1157
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:10,120
specifically targeting less sophisticated groups that they feel aren't going to do the same amount

1158
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:16,040
of homework and research. This sounds eerily reminiscent of the subprime crisis. Yeah,

1159
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:22,040
absolutely. Yeah. Going back to the procedure for a moment, so you'll do your 20 or 30 of these

1160
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:26,680
a year. Does this get you nervous to do this procedure? I mean, what steps would you take to

1161
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:34,760
reduce the risk of inadvertently cannulating a vein? I think that for me, the thought process is

1162
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:41,320
no different than with any surgical procedure. You having trained in surgery know this. Understanding

1163
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:48,600
anatomy is just the absolute key to doing good surgery. If you know where things are, you know

1164
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:55,000
how to avoid them and how to stay out of trouble. It's all about understanding anatomy. Simple

1165
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:01,800
things like how you bend the surgical table with the patient laying prone on their stomach is going

1166
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:09,880
to affect the position of the blood vessels relative to the surface anatomy. If you have the

1167
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:15,640
patient laying flat as opposed to bending the bed 30 degrees where it's in sort of a beach chair

1168
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:23,000
type position, that's going to change the position of the anatomy. Understanding anatomy is really

1169
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:29,800
the key, which goes back to my point about why if you didn't train and learn the anatomy, it's so

1170
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:36,680
difficult to do safe surgery. Yeah, it's actually scary for me to think about it. You only need to

1171
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:43,000
see so many things go really wrong in an operating room to be reminded of how even when you know

1172
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
what's going on, things can turn in an instant. Then to imagine if you're flying a little blind

1173
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,480
and you don't actually know where the vascular beds are. I never really thought about that. I

1174
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:59,960
guess I don't think I really appreciated what a Brazilian butt lift was. My field is very

1175
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:06,200
challenging and different than other areas. When you get on an airplane, for example,

1176
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:11,800
you don't think twice about you assume that that plane has been checked over. You assume that it's

1177
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:17,240
received all the maintenance. You assume that the pilots are competent, that they aren't drunk,

1178
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:22,600
that they slept enough. You assume that the runway's been checked. There's no debris on it.

1179
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:27,880
You make all these assumptions and you fly and you feel safe. Most of these assumptions are true.

1180
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:33,800
When you go into a hospital, you make the same assumptions. You assume that the doctor taking

1181
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:38,920
care of you is knowledgeable and trained. You assume that the bed that they put you in has been

1182
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:43,640
cleaned. You assume that people have washed their hands before they touch you. You assume that the

1183
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:48,200
nurse is giving you the correct medication and she's checked it. You make a lot of assumptions

1184
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:55,160
and it should be that way. There should be a system set up. But what is so unique and scary

1185
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:02,760
about the field of plastic surgery is it really exists outside of these same degrees of regulation.

1186
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:09,400
Because you have people who on their own just woke up one day and decided, I'm just gonna

1187
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:15,480
start my own airline company and I'm just gonna hire some Yahoo pilot and I don't need to check

1188
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:19,720
the runway and I don't need to do maintenance because that costs a lot of money. And they just

1189
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:25,000
do their own thing and you get on that airplane and you go to that surgery center and you are

1190
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:31,080
without your knowledge taking a lot of risk. When a non-plastic surgeon is doing something in their

1191
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:37,160
office or in their little surgery center, it's not being regulated and checked like an accredited

1192
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:42,360
surgery center is as a board certified plastic surgeon. I am only allowed to do procedures at

1193
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:48,440
accredited surgery centers that have been checked over and accredited by the government or by a

1194
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:54,600
state agency. That's not true for a lot of office-based surgery centers. It seems like it's really a

1195
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:59,640
confluence of two issues. So let's use another example you gave. So going back to the beginning,

1196
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:04,920
and by the way, I think you have to have a license to do this. You have to have a medical license

1197
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:07,720
which you can get after one year of training. Just a medical license. That's right. So I don't

1198
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,920
think technically you couldn't do this the day after finishing medical school, but you could do

1199
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:17,800
this the day after finishing an internship. So why is this problem not occurring in cardiac surgery

1200
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:23,240
or why is this problem not occurring in orthopedic surgery, at least with respect to joint replacements?

1201
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:31,160
My guess is twofold. One, nobody wakes up and says, I really want to have a coronary artery bypass

1202
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:37,080
today. Today is the day I, you know what, I'm not happy with my aortic valve. I got to get this

1203
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:43,800
thing switched out. In other words, patient demand isn't really driving cardiac surgery. It's being

1204
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:49,400
really driven by the pathology. The cardiologist is sending you to the cardiac surgeon and you're

1205
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:55,960
sort of going because you trust the cardiologist, et cetera. Similarly, yes, of course a patient who

1206
01:52:55,960 --> 01:53:01,000
has sort of an issue with their knee and it's chronically hurting will ultimately wind up

1207
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,200
seeing an orthopedic surgeon, but they're usually going through several levels. They'll see their

1208
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:08,520
primary care doctor. Their doctor sends them to an orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon

1209
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:13,640
goes through a whole bunch of checks and balances. It's very rare that someone wakes up, says, you

1210
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:18,360
know what, I've had it with this knee bugging me. I need a knee replacement. Let me just Google knee

1211
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:23,960
replacement and anyone can show up. That's the first thing. So the demand is not really coming

1212
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:29,240
straight from patient to ultimate practitioner. The second thing is the complexity of the case.

1213
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,720
At the end of the day, you want to do a coronary artery bypass graph. You want to do a hip

1214
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:39,240
replacement. That's really complicated. You are not going to in a million years figure out how

1215
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:44,280
to do that without going through the formal training. Whereas in the end liposuction,

1216
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:48,760
relatively simple procedure. And as you pointed out, the simpler the procedure,

1217
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:55,080
the more likely. My guess is there aren't too many non-plastic surgeons doing deep flaps.

1218
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:59,800
Right. Or even a breast reduction only done by plastic surgeons. It's a complicated procedure.

1219
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:06,200
Right. And then the third piece is this hospital piece. There's a huge divide between what happens

1220
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:14,120
in a hospital and what doesn't. The moment you walk into an accredited hospital, the bar is just

1221
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:20,200
raised dramatically and it would require outright fraud for a charlatan to be in there doing that,

1222
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:25,160
which of course I'm sure happens from time to time, but that's that's an abject failure of the system.

1223
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:30,600
So it's really these three things together, which is what procedures can be done completely outside

1224
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:36,120
of the purview of a hospital. What procedure can be done that's relatively simple to learn,

1225
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:43,800
at least to be able to fake it. And what procedures are being driven by enormous patient demand where

1226
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:49,480
the patient directly comes to the practitioner. I mean, to me, it's those three things that have

1227
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:57,240
created this trifecta of disaster. And another way to put it is that in a lot of patients' minds,

1228
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:03,400
plastic surgery is not in the same category as other types of surgery. It's more like getting

1229
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:09,400
a haircut or getting your teeth bleached or getting your nails done. It's cosmetic procedures. I'm

1230
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:14,360
just going to go in for a little afternoon liposuction. And so people don't think about it

1231
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:20,280
in the same way as they think of other surgical procedures. And then the money is such a big part

1232
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:25,960
of it because there's so much money in this field. When you get your knee replaced, your insurance is

1233
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:30,200
hopefully paying the majority of it. Right. This is all patients are paying out of pocket for it.

1234
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:38,840
And other doctors who are primarily insurance based doctors, which is most physicians in America,

1235
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:45,000
see this lucrative cash paying procedures and they want a piece of it. I mean, they want to

1236
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,200
augment their income with it. It's just so funny. I always think about how different it is to be a

1237
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:55,800
plastic surgeon. I'm probably the only specialty where when people go to the emergency room,

1238
01:55:55,800 --> 01:56:01,800
I do emergency call at a local busy hospital where they ask for a plastic surgeon. You know,

1239
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:07,560
little Sally's has a cut on her cheek and the mom's like, I want a plastic surgeon. I demand

1240
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,680
a plastic surgeon. Nobody's asking for a cardiologist when they need to have chest pain

1241
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:18,920
and or an EKG. I think we're in a different category than all the other doctors where patients

1242
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:24,920
think that, you know, for whatever reason, we're just much more readily available and

1243
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:29,000
we're sort of technicians that they can just summon at a whim.

1244
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:36,680
Do you find yourself ever feeling conflicted where on the one hand you're in a profession

1245
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:44,200
which sort of feeds off the vanity and insecurity of people, both of which you don't seem to

1246
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:49,240
necessarily display yourself and on the one hand you sort of have this obligation like, look,

1247
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:55,080
if a person is committed to doing procedure X, Y, or Z, I, Zolcrieger, might not actually even

1248
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:59,480
understand the rationale for this. I think this person looks perfectly wonderful. I don't think

1249
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:04,040
they need to do anything, but one, there's an economic incentive. I mean, at the end of the

1250
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:09,960
day, this is how you make a living. Two, I think knowing you, I can say you also feel like, well,

1251
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:13,400
if this person is going to have this procedure done and it's a Brazilian butt lift that I think

1252
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:19,080
is probably ridiculous, I would certainly rather they do it with me and I have a much higher

1253
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:25,640
probability of getting them home safely than they go to somebody else. So how do you process all of

1254
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:32,680
those sort of emotions and thoughts? I think about it simplistically that I'm, like many other

1255
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:38,920
doctors, I'm just helping people. People come to me with a problem, just like they come to any

1256
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:46,120
doctor with a problem. Psychiatrists see people with psychiatric problems and the rest of the

1257
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,720
physicians see people with physical problems and I, it's a combination of both. I'm like a psychiatrist

1258
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:56,680
with a knife, basically. I fix a lot of psychiatric problems with a knife. Now that might sound...

1259
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:59,400
But do you think you're fixing them? Or do you think it's band-aids?

1260
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:05,080
Sometimes I do and that's a key part of being a good plastic surgeon is understanding,

1261
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:12,120
am I going to fix this problem with the knife or is this a problem that requires some other

1262
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:19,400
type of treatment? I'll give you a good example. Take a girl who's 18 years old, she just finished

1263
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:24,520
high school, she's about to go off to college. She's a beautiful girl but she has a huge giant

1264
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:31,240
nose. She was born with a big giant nose, she inherited it from her Middle Eastern father and

1265
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:36,920
it looks horrible on her face. She's completely self-conscious about this nose. If you did a

1266
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:43,080
photo manipulation with a computer program and showed her a picture of her face with an altered

1267
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:50,280
post-surgical nose, she's crying, she loves it. You showed those two pictures to any person in

1268
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,880
anywhere in the world. They would say the one girl looks hideous and the other girl looks

1269
01:58:53,880 --> 01:59:00,280
attractive. It's the same girl before and after surgery. If you do surgery for that girl,

1270
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:07,160
you change her life. You help her in a profound way. She's not excessively vain, she's not

1271
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:12,120
psychologically ill, she doesn't have mental problems. She looks in the mirror and sees a

1272
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:17,960
nose that is way out of proportion to her face. She's bothered by it, she's been teased about it

1273
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:23,640
before, she compares herself to other people. Now yeah, you could make an argument that we should

1274
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:28,760
live in a society where we don't care about the size of people's noses and we don't care about

1275
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:33,960
the way people look but until that happens, which I doubt is happening anytime soon,

1276
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:41,720
people attach importance and value to the way they look. So yeah, I think operating on that girl,

1277
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:46,840
I'm doing her a huge service, I'm helping her, I'm essentially a psychiatrist with a knife.

1278
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:52,440
She doesn't need that surgery, she's not doing it because she has cancer, she's not doing it

1279
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:57,880
because she's not able to exercise or function because she can't breathe through the nose,

1280
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:03,000
she's doing it for the appearance. But we all know that girl, we've all met someone like that,

1281
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:10,840
we might even be that person. And so making that change is profound. I mean, if you have a woman

1282
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:16,920
who's happily married, she's normal, she has children, she functions regularly in life and

1283
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:23,080
she believes whether rightly or so that her husband does not find her attractive because

1284
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:28,360
her body has changed after having children and she has a big roll of skin hanging over her

1285
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:34,120
C-section scar and she wants it gone, it gets in the way of her exercise. It affects her during

1286
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:39,000
her periods of intimacy with her husband, she's super self-conscious about it. You're going to

1287
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,760
change that person's life doing that. So there's nothing wrong with that. Most of my patients are

1288
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:51,720
normal, I don't take care of porn stars, I don't take care of people who have body dysmorphic

1289
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:58,680
disorder where they say I can't go outside because of this part of my body. I try to avoid celebrities,

1290
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:05,080
they're a huge pain in the butt. I just take care of regular people. I do functional surgery and I do

1291
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:10,600
aesthetic surgery. That same girl with the nose, maybe she can't breathe through her nose and that's

1292
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:17,640
her problem. So ultimately, the way I try to stay grounded and wake up in the morning and go to work

1293
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:24,520
and do a good job and then come home feeling satisfied and like I help people is to understand

1294
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:31,000
that my job is to evaluate someone, try and understand what the problem is and then know

1295
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:37,080
am I able to help them in a safe ethical way and make a difference for them. That actually makes a

1296
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:43,480
lot of sense and you could argue that what's the difference in the vanity that says I don't like

1297
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:49,880
the fact that my nose is crooked and I want to have it straightened versus someone who comes to me

1298
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:55,400
and says I want to live longer. You could argue those are equally vain statements and meaning

1299
02:01:55,400 --> 02:02:00,680
both totally reasonable cases to be made for trying to help that person. It goes back to something I've

1300
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:06,680
heard you talk about in the podcast about the difference between increasing the length of your

1301
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:13,560
life versus improving the quality of your life. Do I want to live to be 100 but the last 15 years

1302
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:18,600
I'm in a chair and I can't get up and move and my brain doesn't work? No, none of us want that. We

1303
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:25,160
want quality of life. That's what it's about. And so quality of life is a really complex issue.

1304
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:30,600
There's so many factors that go into it. It's avoiding injury, it's feeling healthy, it's not

1305
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:35,400
having medical problems, it's feeling good about yourself, it's being able to do the things you

1306
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:42,840
enjoy. The list goes on and on and on. So what I'm trying to do is to contribute to quality of life

1307
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:49,720
and it's just one aspect of quality of life. I mean I always wonder like if you succeed

1308
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:55,320
with your goal to get people to live longer, we're going to have a lot of really old looking

1309
02:02:55,320 --> 02:03:02,600
people walking around. Do you ever turn patients down who show up through the normal channels

1310
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:07,000
either through a referral or just on their own but after you sit down with them you come to the

1311
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,800
conclusion that you know what I could certainly mechanically fix whatever it is they're asking but

1312
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:18,360
this is not the root of the issue and you just you get the sense that you're going down a slippery

1313
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:25,720
slope with them. Yeah for sure and the hardest thing to do as a plastic surgeon is to see the

1314
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:31,560
dollar signs in front of your eyes. I could make a lot of money if I do the surgery and turn the

1315
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:36,920
person away. I mean just think of any businessman where someone comes and says I'd like to purchase

1316
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:41,960
this and you say to them actually no I don't think you should purchase this. Yeah I do it at least

1317
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:47,480
once or twice and sometimes more a day when I see people. Once or twice a day? Yeah absolutely.

1318
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:51,800
Purely because you don't think they're the right candidate. I thought you were going to say once

1319
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:56,840
or twice a month. No once or twice a day. Tell me the one that you did yesterday. Tell me one that

1320
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:01,960
you turned down and how did you explain to the patient that without offending them that this

1321
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:08,520
you didn't think this was in their best interest. So a very common patient I turned down is an

1322
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:13,560
overweight patient who comes in for liposuction and this is one of my most common ones that I

1323
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:19,880
turned down and they have this idea in their head that they can use liposuction as a means of weight

1324
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:27,720
loss. And I again I go back to my principle of just be honest with people and I just say to them

1325
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:33,080
you know in a way I don't think people want to hear your fat and I basically explain to them

1326
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:37,480
there's a limit on what we can achieve with liposuction we can only suck out subcutaneous fat.

1327
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:43,240
You have a lot of visceral fat. I explain to them that I can only remove a certain amount of

1328
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:48,120
safely. I talk to them about the effects on the skin that if you take too much fat you leave them

1329
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:53,880
with loose skin but if you lose the weight gradually it's better. And ultimately I talk

1330
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:59,800
to focus on health and well-being and that the difference between losing 15 pounds through

1331
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:05,080
liposuction versus losing 15 pounds through diet and exercise is profound. That's actually

1332
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:10,920
been studied. So they're much better off and I say this is how much I would charge you. Let's

1333
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:15,880
sit together right now and talk about how you could take the same amount of money get a gym

1334
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:22,680
membership hire a nutritionist change your eating. You're gonna very easily lose 15 pounds that I

1335
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:26,440
would suck off. You're going to be healthier you're going to look better. It's a much better use of

1336
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:32,360
your money. People appreciate it and I sort of feel like I'm investing in my business doing this

1337
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:37,800
because this person is going to walk away saying wow this guy's an honest plastic surgeon and I'm

1338
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:43,400
going to refer someone to him if I need to. So yeah maybe I'm losing that patient but I'm I'm

1339
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:49,640
going to gain someone else in the future. Another type of patient that we see is people who have

1340
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:56,040
what's called body dysmorphic disorder. They are just simply totally fixated on something. They've

1341
02:05:56,040 --> 02:06:02,120
had multiple surgeries. There are a number of red flags that we look for. We have an acronym

1342
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:09,240
called Simon. Avoid the Simon. It stands for single immature male overly narcissistic Simon.

1343
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:21,480
The Simon is a young guy. He's single. He's not been married. He may be gay but usually straight

1344
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:29,880
and oftentimes it's his nose or some other body part and he basically is cannot function. My life

1345
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:34,440
I can't go outside. I can't date. No women want to talk to me because of this body part.

1346
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:42,360
It doesn't take long to understand that guy should not have surgery. He needs counseling. So we you

1347
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:46,840
know I usually won't give him the number of a psychiatrist but I'll sometimes I'll have to

1348
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:55,080
resort to my go-to line which is I don't have the skill and knowledge necessary to help you

1349
02:06:55,080 --> 02:07:00,200
in a way that is going to make you happy. We see people who've had multiple surgeries. Which by

1350
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:04,920
the way is true. I mean it is true. Yeah people who've had multiple surgeries and the first thing

1351
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:10,920
they do is start bad mouthing other surgeons. Yeah I had this surgery done and he botched it

1352
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:15,800
and and you can see how horrible this is and he was such a jerk and he charged me all that.

1353
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:21,000
That's the first thing they do. Anytime someone bad mouthing another plastic surgeon there's a

1354
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,600
very low chance I'm going to ever operate on them just at from that moment on. Now there are

1355
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:31,640
exceptions you know people have had botched surgery. Maybe it wasn't a plastic surgeon who did it but

1356
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:36,280
if it was a board certified plastic surgeon and I know that person and I know they're smart and

1357
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:42,680
reasonable then I know right away that this person has problems and no one else could make them happy.

1358
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:47,400
I'm probably not going to make them happy. Any other procedures that we should give people kind

1359
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:55,080
of the skinny on? You know I think that today these minimally invasive procedures like Botox

1360
02:07:55,080 --> 02:08:02,680
and filler and facial peels and laser treatments they're very very popular stem cell treatments

1361
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:07,800
where they harvest your stem cells and inject them in your face. There are all sorts of things out

1362
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:12,520
there and you know when you look at the full field of plastic surgery the minimally invasive things

1363
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:19,400
are rapidly increasing because people want cheap and quick and easy with low risk and you know

1364
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:26,920
very little downtime. These procedures are not without risk. It's just a golden rule in

1365
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:35,000
surgery and in plastic surgery. If something has no risk, no recovery, no downtime, low cost, it has

1366
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,040
no result. That's just a rule. There's nothing out there that you can just do it in the office in 30

1367
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:47,720
minutes and achieve a remarkable result. All of these things have risks. We've seen probably 25

1368
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:54,920
reported cases of blindness from filler injected near the eyes. One of the most popular procedures

1369
02:08:54,920 --> 02:09:00,760
and that's a pretty horrible risk. How does that happen? What's the what's the filler enters into

1370
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:08,840
an artery and gets transported retrograde and then flows into the retinal artery and obstructs the

1371
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:15,880
retinal artery and causes blindness. But aren't these fillers typically done beneath the eye?

1372
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:22,440
Yeah but it's it's easy to get into the wrong spot. There's an artery that comes out on the side of

1373
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:28,520
the nose just below the inside corner of the eye that if you get the filler in there it can transport.

1374
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:33,320
People inject filler in the forehead and in between the eyebrows for the wrinkles and there's an

1375
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:39,400
artery that comes out right above the eyebrow that if you inject it in there it can get transported

1376
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:46,840
backwards retrogradely against the flow and enter into the retinal. So I mean there are you know we

1377
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:54,520
see patients who have permanent pigment damage from lasers and peels done on the face. None of

1378
02:09:54,520 --> 02:10:02,040
these we've recently seen several HIV cases from these vampire facials where people have PRP blood

1379
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:08,440
harvested and then spun and re-injected into their face. It's you know it's not proven. You mean it's

1380
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:14,920
done from multiple donor pools? No from their own but but the machines are not adequately cleaned

1381
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:20,280
and processed and so they're contaminated with blood from another patient who maybe has HIV.

1382
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:26,680
There was just a recent reported several of these in the popular press. Several patients in one clinic

1383
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:33,240
this happened to them. So these procedures are not without risk. Again you got to you got to do your

1384
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:39,000
homework. You have to know who you're going to. You have to really research. I mean the great thing

1385
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,520
about Dr. Google these days is you can find out all this information online. There's a lot of

1386
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:49,960
resources. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons has a great website. It talks about every

1387
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:54,680
procedure. It talks about the risks of every procedure but just to be knowledgeable going in.

1388
02:10:54,680 --> 02:11:00,040
I mean knowledge is power in these things and to understand that there's just no free lunch. You

1389
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:07,080
can't just undergo one of these lunchtime procedures without risk. Well Zal this is super helpful. I

1390
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:11,800
think what what we'll probably do is with your help put together a little checklist for patients.

1391
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:15,560
Maybe we'll include this in the show notes. You know something they can just download as a PDF

1392
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:22,040
or something and and use as sort of I'm thinking about having a fill in the blank procedure. Here

1393
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:26,120
are the questions I want to be asking. Some of them will be just general questions right but

1394
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:30,440
then some of them can be procedure specific and almost put together a cheat sheet of this stuff

1395
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:34,360
because I think this is super helpful. Well I really appreciate it man. This has been exciting

1396
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:39,640
to sit down and I haven't seen you in like over a year so it's great and it's weird because we

1397
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:44,760
only live like a couple hours away from each other. It's tragic. We're busy. I'll take any opportunity

1398
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:52,440
to get together with you. Thanks man. Thanks. You can find all of this information and more at

1402
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:14,520
the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity, science, performance,

1403
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:21,400
sleep, etc. On social you can find me on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook all with the ID peteratiamd

1404
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:25,640
but usually Twitter is the best way to reach me to share your questions and comments. Now for the
