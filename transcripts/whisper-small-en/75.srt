00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,560
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
on this podcast. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better. I have

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,040
a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally and

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,760
I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,120
team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,440
our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,360
is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this. So all of this

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,560
raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this?

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,920
As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,960
of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,000
first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,040
telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,440
to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,640
just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,680
nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,320
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,960
have proved can work over time. And that is to create a subscriber model for my audience.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,920
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,520
you can become a member. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,840
for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,760
to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members will receive

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,480
full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we plan to build upon. These

34
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,920
are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of our shows.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,080
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,600
episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,760
these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,680
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,800
I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,520
companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,320
have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,240
is that many of you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,080
content exclusive for members. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you

44
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,720
learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,840
by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is David Light, the CEO of

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,120
Valisher, which is an online pharmacy and analytical laboratory that tests the drugs

47
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,000
it dispenses. As some of you may have heard, on September 13th of this year, a citizen's petition

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,840
was filed by David's company to the FDA requesting the immediate attention to and potentially removal

49
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,560
of a very common drug called Zantac or Renitidine from the market based on a lot of analytical

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,240
horsepower that they had thrown at it, suggesting that Zantac, Renitidine in its generic form was

51
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:42,680
unstable and it decayed heavily into a carcinogen known as NDMA. The details of this obviously we

52
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,080
discuss in the podcast, but they are quite staggering when you consider the magnitude at

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,240
which this decay occurs and therefore the level at which people could be exposed. Now the purpose

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,280
of this episode of course is not to scare people, though in the end I do something I rarely do,

55
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,040
which is make a recommendation, which is if you are playing this through the lens of standard

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,880
risk analysis, the better thing to do is to probably at least yourself stop taking this

57
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,680
drug even if the FDA, which at the time of this recording has not asked for a withdrawal either

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,560
voluntary or otherwise. It's important to note that at this time 30 other countries including

59
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Canada, many countries in Europe, the Middle East have done that, have gone to the step of saying

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,480
this drug is off the market until we clarify what these issues are. In the first 20 minutes of this

61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,520
episode we get into the background and it is kind of important to understand David's background in

62
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,920
chemistry and the background of how this company became formed and what the impetus was for that.

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,440
We then get into kind of their first real insight that they made at the public health level, which

64
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,360
was the discovery of a carcinogen in a very commonly prescribed blood pressure medication

65
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,280
called Valsartan. In this case it was a contaminant, meaning it was not unique to the entire drug, but

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,360
only to certain manufacturers. However, the majority of this episode is devoted to the

67
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,840
discussion of Zantac and Renidin. I don't need to really say much more. I think the episode

68
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,000
speaks for itself and it is timely. And again, if you've never taken Zantac, don't care about this,

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,600
great, might not be an episode for you, but if you know anybody who takes this and at last check,

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,880
15 million prescriptions of this were filled annually in the United States. And when you

71
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,560
consider the over the counter being easily two to three times, the number of that odds are if

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,160
you're listening to this, either you take Zantac or know somebody who does. At the very least,

73
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,720
you'd want to pass that on to them. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with

74
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,800
David Light. David, thank you so much for making time to speak on a Saturday evening.

75
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,800
My pleasure. Likewise. If the listener is wondering why we're having this discussion on a Saturday

76
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,480
evening, it's in large part I suspect because this is kind of a timely issue and so many of

77
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,640
my podcasts are scheduled out months in advance, but this was something I didn't really feel should

78
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,160
be put off for several months. So I thought if you were willing to talk on a Saturday night,

79
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,840
then I would too. Thanks for having me. Yeah. So let's spend just a couple of minutes on some

80
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,080
background before we jump into the real meat of this discussion. I first learned about you through

81
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,720
a woman named Catherine Eban. Do you know Catherine? Yes, I do. So you may know them that I interviewed

82
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,360
her a couple of months ago and it was honestly for me one of the most upsetting interviews I've

83
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,400
ever done. I guess I haven't interviewed enough bad guys in my life. Not that Catherine's a bad

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,840
guy, but she was really talking about a story that was for me very disheartening, but I think also

85
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,880
for virtually every listener kind of just blew people away. And I knew that the moment we published

86
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,320
that podcast, which we did in probably early September, that there was going to be a lot of

87
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,440
questions coming out. A lot of people were going to wonder what the implications of this were. And

88
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,240
even just in my own little tiny bubble of a world, which is my very small medical practice with fewer

89
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,800
than 100 patients, the implications have been pretty significant. We have basically changed the

90
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,960
way we do everything in terms of we now exclusively work with one pharmacy. That pharmacy while not

91
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,440
able to do what your pharmacy does, and we'll talk about that in a moment, they're able to do

92
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,140
something pretty darn good, which is at our discretion and without any hesitation, they will

93
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,240
dispense exactly which medications we want. So branded when the patient is willing to pay for

94
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,040
branded and if generic, then they are able to do what we do with them. Actually, we do the heavy

95
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,360
lifting, I suppose, which is we go and look at the company that makes the specific generic and look

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,880
to see if there's been any interaction with the FDA. Now that doesn't guarantee that we're safe,

97
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,240
but I think it's reducing our odds a lot. But let's now talk about what you do professionally

98
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,840
and within the pharmacy space and maybe a little bit about how you even decided to do that.

99
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:09,600
Sure. So Valisher company that I co-founded and the CEO of is an online pharmacy, but it's also

100
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,040
attached to an analytical laboratory. So it's actually the first pharmacy whether online or not

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,680
that is chemically validating samples from every single batch of every single medication that

102
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,200
comes to our pharmacy and screening out those that have problems and quite a few do. And then for

103
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,200
our patients only dispensing those that pass and we also dispense it with a certificate of

104
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,400
analysis and very much like nutritional information. I mean, you don't buy food without

105
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,680
looking at the nutrition label and seeing what's in it. But where is that for your medications? So

106
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
in that certificate of analysis, we're actually giving the information of what we've actually

107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,320
analyzed for that particular batch of that particular medication.

108
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,160
Now, a lot of people might be saying, Well, David, why is that necessary? I mean, didn't the FDA

109
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,960
already do that? Isn't the point of having the FDA that when I go into my pharmacy and I'm

110
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,360
dispensed my blood pressure medicine, isn't the FDA's seal on that in the same way that the USDA's

111
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,880
seal is on the chicken breast that I buy at the grocery store?

112
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,720
So the FDA seal is on it. But I think a lot of people are rather shocked to understand that the

113
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,680
FDA is not doing chemical testing on the vast majority of medications that are out there. The

114
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,880
testing that is done sometimes and some of the batches are done by the manufacturing companies

115
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,920
themselves, which these days are almost entirely overseas. 80% of drug products in the United

116
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,560
States are manufactured in either India or China, and then self reported to the FDA. So there's

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,760
obviously a lot of options for problems and cracks in that kind of self reported system. These days,

118
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,960
you hear a lot about self reporting system problems with aviation and the Boeing 737 MAX. An

119
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,800
airplane exploding is obviously a very visible component of something going wrong. But your

120
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,600
medications going wrong is actually very hard to see or to find out. And then not to mention, as you

121
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,080
mentioned, Catherine, even before she did a very deep study of all the fraud that goes on when

122
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:20,720
there's a self reported mechanism. So we definitely saw that and said this is not acceptable for how

123
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,400
we would want pharmacy to be. Valisher actually started with a good friend of mine from college

124
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,280
that called me up one day was telling me about all these problems he was having with his

125
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,680
anti convulsive medications. Essentially every once in a while he'd refill it and just have this

126
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,800
terrible month get all these side effects and relapses sometimes and just felt very different

127
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,080
from how he felt otherwise. And he talked to his doctors, he's got some great doctors and the

128
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,280
doctor telling listen, you know, this system is problematic. 90% of what's out there these days

129
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,640
is generic and it can be made from all over the place. And I think as you're kind of alluding to

130
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,800
in terms of working with one pharmacy, just switching from generic to generic could be

131
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,840
problematic. They're formulated differently. They're allowed to vary in their bio equivalence by 45%

132
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,320
from one another. So our high level solution for this was we want to actually have medications

133
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:18,640
chemically tested at the end of the supply chain in the United States where it matters most and test

134
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,040
them see what's actually inside of them and then decide if we want to actually dispense them.

135
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,400
Forgive me for being skeptical. Because while today this sounds like a great idea. How long has

136
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
Valusher been around?

137
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,760
My friend Adam and I so Adam was the one that called me up with this issue. We started the

138
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:42,080
company in 2015. And originally looking at this as a technology problem. A potential reason why

139
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,720
nobody's been doing this before is that the technology can be very expensive and cumbersome

140
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,160
and really just tailored to one or two drugs when you do this in a manufacturing plant and in

141
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,840
pharma companies. But if we wanted to do this in an economical way at the end of the supply chain,

142
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,280
there's kind of this technology gap. And so we actually spent a number of years developing core

143
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,080
technology, a spectroscopy based approach, essentially applying lasers to pharmaceutical

144
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,880
analysis so that we can do some of the most difficult and costly components of this analysis in a

145
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,680
much higher throughput, much easier to use way while still maintaining high precision. And after

146
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,800
a couple of years of bootstrapping this whole thing and putting a lot of our own resources into

147
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,280
developing the technology, we achieved it. We got ISO accreditation on the system itself. That's the

148
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,320
international organization for standardization. We filed patents. We kind of thought of this as the

149
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,360
traditional biotech model, which is where the kind of industry that I'm from where a lot of the

150
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,280
original founders of Alisher are from. And we went and talked to the industry, the big distributors

151
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:58,120
and pharmacies and manufacturers. And it was a very odd discourse because all these major players

152
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,080
were telling us, yeah, you know, there are a lot of problems in the system and it looks like the

153
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,800
problems are getting worse. But it's not our problem. There's always ended up being somebody

154
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,400
else's problem. And we also realized that there actually seems to be disincentives. The established

155
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:19,360
industry actually looked closer at what's on the shelves. They may not like what they see. And so

156
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,960
this was really around now end of 2017, early 2018. That's when we decided, you know, we actually

157
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,240
have to attach this to a pharmacy. So we already had the credited laboratory control of substance

158
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,320
licenses and everything else around a laboratory. And then we built out the online pharmacy component.

159
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,800
And that launched just about a year ago. And when I was referring to my skepticism, I guess what I

160
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,080
was really getting at was in 2015, if you had pitched this idea to me and said, Hey, I got this

161
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,320
idea, which is we're going to actually test individually every single drug that gets dispensed,

162
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,240
I would have said, Gosh, that doesn't really sound like it's a significant enough problem. I mean,

163
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,400
there's two issues with it. Is there enough demand for it? I would have said no. And secondly,

164
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,720
the scalability of that strikes me as cumbersome and difficult. So maybe to give me a tangible

165
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,600
example, if my doctor called me in a prescription for 90 tablets of alopurinol, 300 milligrams of

166
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,920
alopurinol, 90 tablets to last me for three months, would you open a batch of alopurinol that you got

167
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,480
from your generic supplier? And let's say that batch that you got wholesale, how many tablets

168
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,240
would that contain? So you're actually getting to the exact root of the business plan of how

169
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,640
to make this economical is that at Valisher on the pharmacy side, unlike most other pharmacies

170
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,680
that are going to be buying every day or every week and are kind of just constantly looking for

171
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,880
the cheapest possible source and therefore also not having a lot of inventory, we buy large batches.

172
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:57,960
So we'll look six months out, usually at least to buy a lot of that medication up front. So we have

173
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,800
a larger batch of it so that when we sample it, when we do all of our analytics, obviously that

174
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,200
adds some cost, but that cost is amortized over the larger batch. So per pill that you're buying

175
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,200
from us, it's not adding a whole lot of cost to us, especially as we have proprietary technology

176
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,320
that also allows us to do this in arguably some of the cheapest possible ways. And we really optimize

177
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,760
for it. But we're obviously making less money than your standard big name pharmacy that's not doing

178
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,360
any of this. But you're seeing that a lot in the world of online pharmacy these days, there's all

179
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,760
these kind of value ads that are coming out there. So whereas our competitors are working on spending

180
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,760
money on specialty packaging or sending chocolates with your birth control pills that cost money to

181
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,720
instead of spending money on that, we spend money on analysis. And it obviously cuts into the overall

182
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:59,480
profit margins, but we're still able to make money as a company and offer this what we certainly

183
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,520
believe is a really critical service of analysis on that batch of medication. I don't know if you

184
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,320
ever heard the podcast with Catherine, but I believe in that podcast, I tell a story about

185
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,480
sort of the first time it occurred to me that generics, there might be something wrong with

186
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,400
a generic and it was several years ago and it was a patient who I had prescribed Crestor, which of

187
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,120
course got filled as resuvastatin, which is not uncommon at all. That's the generic version of

188
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,960
Crestor. And he had previously been on atorvastatin, the generic version of Lipitor, but there was just

189
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,600
there was something I didn't like. There was a blood biomarker I didn't I wasn't happy about. And I

190
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,360
thought before we abandon a statin altogether, let's give it one more try. So we put him on an

191
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,200
equivalent dose of resuvastatin, which is usually half the dose. So I think if he was on 40 of Lipitor

192
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,080
or atorvastatin, I put him down to 20 of Crestor, which got filled as resuvastatin.

193
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,760
Eight weeks later, I get his blood back and he's back to his baseline level of ApoB,

194
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,080
which is the thing that I'm tracking, suggesting he's not taking his medication at all.

195
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,000
Now, I'm not a browbeating doc, so I'm very straightforward with my patients. I just say,

196
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,200
hey, did you forget to take them? Did you run out like a month before the test or what was going on?

197
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,920
And he said, because and if that were the case, he would simply say, yes, I just my patients are very

198
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,320
transparent. And he said, no, no, no, I take it, take this thing religiously. And I remember

199
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,880
scratching my head and thinking, we know that he is statin responsive. So there's something about

200
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:31,480
this batch that could be different. So I just had my team call in and insist that we get the branded

201
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,200
version. We got it. He took it. It worked. I sort of forgot about it. That type of thing happened a

202
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,680
few times over the last few years. And then of course, reading Catherine's book, I was like,

203
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,240
oh, my God, the lucky times are the times when we see the drug and it has a very obvious,

204
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,600
measurable response in a biomarker. But then there's a whole other class of drugs for which

205
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,440
that's not entirely true drugs like blood pressure medications or seizure medications or antibiotics.

206
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:08,120
In fact, most drugs do not fit in the camp of a very clear biomarker. So when you set out to do

207
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,680
this again, based on your friend's experience, what did you expect to find? Because at the time

208
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,720
you guys started, Catherine hadn't done her complete investigative watershed expose of the

209
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,400
mass fraud coming out of India and China. So did you think this was a needle in a haystack problem,

210
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,240
but you just wanted to give people peace of mind? Or did you think this was a much larger systemic

211
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,040
issue? Actually, when Adam called me about the issues that he was seeing himself with

212
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,880
anticonvulsant medication, I mean, obviously, I was concerned about his own health, but

213
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:44,120
for a business, definitely wanted to understand, is this something more pervasive? And I myself

214
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:51,320
was not on any medications at the time. So I had no personal experience to relate it to and figured,

215
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,600
hey, as a scientist myself, let's look at the literature. And there's a lot of literature out

216
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,880
there, especially in certain areas, like antiepileptic drugs, you start talking to

217
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,880
neurologists, oftentimes, especially psychiatrists that see a lot of these issues between brand and

218
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,360
generic, between generic and generic substitution. And I recall even back then that one of the

219
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,600
papers that I looked at was a Harvard Medical School study that had almost 2000 patients and

220
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,440
showed simply the act of refilling your antiepileptic medication was associated with an over

221
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,160
twofold increased chance of getting a seizure. And I'm like, wow, as a scientist looking at this,

222
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,760
this sounds really serious, and especially in a kind of a class of medication where it's so clear

223
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,880
when your medication is off, you get a seizure. But to your point, this must be happening in all

224
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,320
sorts of medications where it's less clear. And once you really start talking to a variety of

225
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,160
different doctors, you start hearing it a lot too. Like it seems like a lot of doctors have

226
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,120
at least suspected there's a problem or have similar stories as you talk about. I know

227
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,840
certainly in Katherine Eben's book, Bottle of Lies, she talks to a couple of different doctors

228
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,960
from the Cleveland Clinic that have seen it in your heart failure medications and diuretics.

229
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,480
And it's very hard to actually pinpoint the exact problem and nobody's really looking and

230
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,160
analyzing. So what we thought in the beginning was at the very least in certain key areas,

231
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,360
like antiepileptic drugs, like antidepressants and various others that are very big markets,

232
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,080
and a lot of people seeing these issues, that at the very least there we could have a lot of

233
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,800
impact and start looking. But to answer your question, did we think the problem would be as

234
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:44,200
pervasive as we're already seeing? I don't think we quite predicted just how much we'd be finding

235
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,920
and how quickly and how the engagement of all this has just really, really increased in certainly in

236
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,240
the last few years. But if you look at it, there is a huge problem with well butrin and pubropion

237
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,680
back in the late 2000s, 2007, 2008. There's a lot of these cases that have happened. And I think

238
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,400
a big part of what we set out to do and what we're actually hearing from these doctors now

239
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,760
is that there really just wasn't much that a doctor could do. It's either brand or generic.

240
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Brand you tend to trust more, but can't obviously afford very often. And then you have generic

241
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,840
that there's less and less trust in, but you can afford and essentially set out to create a

242
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:33,800
validated generic. So something that has actual chemical validation behind it. And you can still

243
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,840
afford same price as generic that you'd be buying anywhere else. Was the business model, and more

244
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,680
importantly, I guess your hypothesis that this was a problem confined to the generic market? Or did

245
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,040
you also intend to check branded drugs? And did you by extension, then assume that brand it's

246
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,760
could be susceptible to the same problems? I think that the general thesis was that this

247
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,760
is probably worse in generics than in brand. However, we had nothing to really back that up.

248
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,440
And obviously, the data just didn't exist, period for these kinds of things. So our intention was

249
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,160
always to say, we don't know exactly where these problems are gonna be from. And we're not going to

250
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:17,000
make any assumptions ahead of time. Just everything needs to be independently tested at the end of the

251
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,280
supply chain before a patient gets it. And David, one last question really, and as far as background

252
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,800
goes, you've alluded to the fact that you have a scientific background, but specifically, what is

253
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,440
it about your background that allowed you to come into this space and actually innovate?

254
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm a molecular biologist by training at Yale University. And I spent most of my working time

255
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,520
in the field of DNA sequencing. So in biotech, essentially developing complex tools for analysis

256
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,360
of complex problems. I spent eight years most recently at a company called Ion Torrent, where

257
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,120
I was one of the original technology founders there and head of chemistry R&D. And we essentially had

258
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,120
this concept that we would sequence DNA on a microchip. It was based on some papers that we

259
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,280
spent millions of dollars proving was just noise. But luckily, we had some other ideas in mind and

260
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,720
had an amazingly innovative group of people there even early on, that were able to make it work.

261
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,000
And Ion Torrent is now the number two DNA sequencing technology in the world. So myself

262
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,400
and some of the other key developers, even at Ion Torrent and folks that I've worked with before,

263
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,120
I think we're well positioned to develop some new technology, which is, again, how we saw this

264
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,880
problem originally being solved is something that we can develop and then just plug into the existing

265
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,720
system. And that's what we started off doing, and then brought in some more folks to enable

266
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,280
the pharmacy side to work as well. All right, so let's fast forward to a little over a year ago.

267
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,400
It's the summer of 2018. I actually get a call from one of my patients, the only one of my patients,

268
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:58,760
who takes a medication called Valsartan, which is a drug called an angiotensin to receptor blocker.

269
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,600
It's a drug that we use in certain patients with high blood pressure. And in particular,

270
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,160
this is a patient who all the other boxes had been checked. Otherwise, a very healthy guy,

271
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,760
but just couldn't get the blood pressure where we wanted it. So here he was taking

272
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,920
this medication and he said, Hey, guys, I saw something in the paper today

273
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,320
about some of these things being withdrawn. Should I be taking it? Tell me a little bit about that

274
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,200
and your involvement in that. So Valsartan and Losartan and various other ARB medications or

275
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,880
SARTAN medications that have been recalled over the last year, I think are unfortunately a very

276
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,600
clear and visible case of how the system can go wrong and how many cracks there are in it.

277
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,840
The fact that this global supply chain is a self-reported, has a lot of visible fraud

278
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,760
that's happened in the past. And really what happened with Valsartan was there was a manufacturing

279
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,200
change to save some money in China or other places overseas that are making the variety of these

280
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,520
different active pharmaceutical ingredients. And by having this manufacturing change,

281
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,440
they were creating all sorts of impurities. So these impurities themselves being extremely

282
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,080
potent carcinogens, one of them that I'm sure we're going to be talking more about is NDMA,

283
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:21,880
nitrosodimethylamine. It's actually talked about as a probable human carcinogen, but you have to

284
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,600
keep in mind that's only because you can't ethically have a study where you give humans

285
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,160
a carcinogen. And the data in animals is extremely clear. It's been studied since the 1950s.

286
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,280
NDMA is literally one of the best studied, most potent carcinogens known to man. It's actually

287
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,480
used as a control to induce cancer in rats. If you're doing a clinical study and want to make

288
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,600
absolutely sure that a rat's going to get cancer, you give it NDMA. So this was one of the contaminants

289
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:57,400
that they were creating in this process that they obviously didn't do the proper quality controls

290
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,920
that they were reporting to the FDA and went all over the world. And this happened for years.

291
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,640
It was only detected years later, I'm sure just kind of randomly. And then as people were looking

292
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,840
more into it and then actually overseas countries started recalling it, eventually was also recalled

293
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,400
in the United States. And it was obviously a very real problem that even continues today. So we're

294
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,880
talking about it in 2018, summer of 2000 teens when it started. The most recent recall in Los

295
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:35,160
Arden, I think was like a week ago. And we're in October, September here of 2019. And this continues

296
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,400
to be a pervasive problem. Before we leave this topic and get to what we really want to talk about

297
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,760
today, which is Zantac and Renitidine. What is the take on message for patients and physicians

298
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,120
either taking or prescribing respectively ARBs, this class of drug?

299
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,640
It certainly seems like the problems even there are not over, especially the fact that there's

300
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,520
been recent recalls even now. We at Valisher are trying to be very proactive about this whole space.

301
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,400
We incorporated this kind of carcinogen analysis earlier this year. I mean, we just launched the

302
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:14,760
pharmacy at the end of 2018. Towards the beginning of 2019, we added nitrosamine assay and

303
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,240
incorporated the FDA recommended protocol for analyzing for NDMA and other carcinogens and

304
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,680
impurities. And we wanted to not just look where everybody else is looking. We also looked at other

305
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:36,280
seemingly obvious places to look. So when this manufacturing change happened, what the change was

306
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:42,280
is they changed solvents. And they started using this solvent called DMF, dimethylformamide.

307
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:48,360
Can you explain to people, David, what a solvent is and why it's necessary to make a drug or do

308
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,760
most organic chemical reactions with solvents? Sure. So a solvent is basically something that

309
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,360
you're dissolving different components of chemistry into in order to make a reaction. You can think of

310
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,720
it like cooking. If you're gonna make a soup and you want a whole bunch of things in it,

311
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,760
your solvent is essentially water. Or even if you're cooking an egg, for example, there's so

312
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,840
many different ways to cook the egg. But if you change your solvent, if you change how you're

313
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,640
essentially cooking that egg, although it's still an egg, all sorts of other things can happen. So

314
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,000
what they really did in this case of Valsartan was they might have been cooking the egg in water for

315
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,880
a long time. And then all of a sudden they decided to switch to oil. If you've ever fried an egg,

316
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,160
obviously it tastes different than if you boiled the egg. And those differences are because of all

317
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,280
these side reactions and side products that are happening that give it different flavors and all

318
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,240
sorts of different properties. But yes, it's still an egg. So they were still making Valsartan the

319
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,960
key ingredient they were trying to make. But there's just so much happening on the side that

320
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,520
they apparently were not doing the proper controls of trying to find out what's happening there.

321
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:02,360
And NDMA, true that it's hard to look for every possible contaminant that there exists. But again,

322
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,240
NDMA has been well studied. It's been talked about as a problem in pharmaceuticals since

323
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:14,840
at least the 70s. So it seemed like a fairly obvious thing to look for. And for us, when we

324
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,640
started seeing all this, of course, we were going to look for NDMA and DEA and a few of these other

325
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,360
common carcinogens that were being talked about as byproducts of this manufacturing change.

326
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,120
But we wanted to also look for this new solvent. I mean, if you're going to cook the egg in oil now,

327
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,200
there might also be oil still on that egg. And that solvent that the DMF, Dymethoformamide,

328
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,640
is itself a probable human carcinogen. It's in the same class of a carcinogen as NDMA. And this is

329
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,280
a categorization from the World Health Organization and the International Organization for the Research

330
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:54,440
Cancer. So we started looking for that too. And as soon as we started looking, we found it all

331
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,400
over Valsartan. We found two thirds of the manufacturers that were making Valsartan that

332
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:06,520
we actually looked at their batches at the time had hundreds of nanograms to over 100,000 nanograms

333
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:15,160
of this DMF contaminant, which is a probable human carcinogen. And so we put together an FDA citizen

334
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:21,720
petition and filed it with the FDA saying, listen, obviously, NDMA is a problem and there's other

335
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,840
problems out there that are certainly a good idea to continue looking at. But the solvent itself is

336
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,240
carrying over in this system. And whatever these companies are doing to try and clean up their

337
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,600
process, they're apparently not even cleaning up the solvent. So it certainly underscores the

338
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,440
importance of checking everything and also checking every single batch. I mean, we had

339
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,840
manufacturers that were clean sometimes. And then another batch had not only very high levels

340
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:55,560
of DMF even had levels of NDMA that were violating the FDA rules. So it certainly underscores the

341
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,200
pervasiveness of the problem and certainly in certain areas. David, some people who are familiar

342
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,480
with the biotech industry will have heard a term GMP. Do you want to explain what GMP means and

343
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,480
what the implication is for something that's manufactured according to that standard?

344
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Yeah, GMP, standing for good manufacturing practices, anything that's under FDA purview

345
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,920
that touches the manufacturing process is required to be under GMP. And it's essentially hundreds of

346
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,600
documents and systems that are in place in order to make sure that things are very well documented

347
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,240
and done consistently and any errors or problems or manufacturing changes like changing over your

348
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,160
solvent, checking for contaminants, these kinds of things are all expected to be part of the GMP

349
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:50,440
process. And when you're following the whole GMP system, then it's supposed to catch these kinds of

350
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,080
issues. But this is certainly a very robust system. However, it's predicated on the concept

351
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,400
that you're going to self-report it to the FDA and that when the FDA comes and inspects, they're

352
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,360
going over these documents. They're not checking the chemistry of what's actually in that pill.

353
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,240
Is the implication here then that, well, let me just ask the question more directly. Is there any

354
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,360
evidence that any of the companies involved in the production of angiotensin receptor blockers,

355
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,600
drugs such as Valsartan and Losartan actually were criminally negligent? In other words,

356
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:31,320
saw that their chemical processes yielded molecules that exceeded the acceptable limits

357
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,760
of various toxins and failed to report it? Or do you believe the evidence suggests that rather

358
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,840
all of this was simply negligence and oversight? Honestly, I haven't looked at that kind of

359
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,240
evidence well enough to answer directly. I would say either is certainly possible. It could have

360
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,280
been maliciously covered up by a manufacturer or it could just be that they were saving a few pennies

361
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:02,600
per pound of these kinds of solvents and just didn't bother to look. I definitely don't have

362
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,840
that answer. I don't want to get too far down this rabbit hole because like I said, what I really

363
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,560
want to talk about is the most timely issue here, which is the Renidin and Zantec one. So I apologize.

364
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,680
I keep saying we'll get to it. And maybe we can park this question, but it's a broader one which

365
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:25,640
says, why do we have the FDA if not to do this? If not to be the one to ensure that every pill

366
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:32,280
that goes in a person's body comes from a batch that has a certificate that demonstrates not only

367
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,600
what's in it, but what's not in it. Yeah, look, what the FDA is there to do is a lot of things.

368
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,080
I know we're talking a lot about the oversight of drugs that are already in the market. Obviously,

369
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,360
a lot of what the FDA is doing is looking at new drugs and a billion dollars that goes into

370
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,360
developing something new. I think the bottom line is that with limited resources, there's only so

371
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:01,640
much you can do. And a lot of what the FDA oversight is about is going through that GMP process and

372
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,960
looking over a bunch of paperwork that's being self-reported by the industry. And that obviously

373
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,760
has limitations, which honestly, the FDA itself admits in a 2015 white paper direct from the FDA.

374
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,560
A, they're saying there's an unacceptably high occurrence of problems. And B, the FDA was saying

375
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,720
that there's no formal means for quality surveillance except through inspections.

376
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,320
And inspection findings have not been a reliable predictor of the state of quality.

377
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,280
Those are pretty much direct quotes. So we at Valisher and the original founders saw this as

378
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,440
further underscoring of industry should be stepping in and doing more. Why don't we actually

379
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,760
analyze every single batch at the end of the supply chain? FDA doesn't seem to have the

380
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,480
resources to be able to do something like that. But in the core of a new business model with some

381
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,960
new technology and everything else, so we thought we could do it. There's more I want to talk about

382
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,480
on that front, but I think I'm going to save it until we get to the end of our discussion. So let's

383
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,920
start talking about this drug Zantac. So Zantac, the generic name for that is Renitidine has been

384
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,520
around for quite some time. I can't tell you how long it's been, but I certainly know it's been

385
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,280
more than 20 years because it was among one of the most commonly prescribed drugs that I would have

386
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,000
written prescriptions for for patients in medical school. It's an H2 blocker, which means that's one

387
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,360
of there are three ways that you can reduce the acid secreted by the stomach. And this is one of

388
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:34,760
those ways is you can actually block the H2 receptor on the type of gastric cell that makes

389
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,640
hydrochloric acid. And therefore it became a very popular drug, not just for people with heartburn,

390
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,360
but more importantly, or at least as importantly, I suppose, even patients who didn't have heartburn

391
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:50,120
who were undergoing hospitalization in whom one needed to reduce the burden of insult to their

392
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:56,840
gastric lining. So I don't even have the stats on how many people take Renitidine or Zantac in the

393
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:04,280
United States. Do you know those numbers, David? The prescription Renitidine in 2016 was roughly

394
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,640
15 million. I was in the top 50 most prescribed drugs. And obviously that's certainly a small

395
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,960
percentage of the overall use being that it's largely used over the counter by the brand Zantac

396
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,520
or other various generics, practically any pharmacy that you used to go to, it's not there anymore.

397
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,320
But pretty much every pharmacy had their own versions and is one of the most common over the

398
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,360
counter medications used certainly by millions of Americans and folks over the world. Yeah,

399
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:39,240
I've been fortunate in my life to not have heartburn more than twice a year. But those two times a

400
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,200
year, I sure took myself some Renitidine. One other thing to mention there that was certainly

401
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,360
of particularly high concern to us is that the safety profile of Renitidine was considered so high

402
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:58,920
that is one of the only drugs prescribed to women while they were pregnant and given to infants for

403
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,800
similar stomach issues. Yes, my third child had reflux and he took a little liquid elixir of

404
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,240
Renitidine for about three months when he was little. And I also remember from doing my rotation

405
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,800
in pediatrics, that was not an uncommon thing to do. So tell me how you became interested in

406
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:25,000
Renitidine. In early 2019, when we're obviously responding to all these issues, as we've just

407
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,680
talked about with Valsartan and other of these blood pressure medications that had these carcinogen

408
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:38,760
issues, it was obvious that we needed to incorporate that technology and then be proactive

409
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,440
as we talked about, not just look for NDMA and the standard carcinogens that others were looking for,

410
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,480
but look for other common sense molecules and carcinogens at the same time, but also the same

411
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,600
time, not just look at the blood pressure medications. So our whole concept, of course,

412
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,920
in Valsartan is analyzing from every single batch of every single medication. And ironically,

413
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,040
Renitidine was pretty high in our list to go through the system because that same friend of

414
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,320
mine, Adam, his infant daughter also got a prescription for that elixir of Renitidine,

415
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:20,360
the syrup form. And as soon as we put it through the machine, following the standard FDA protocol

416
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:28,120
at the time, we were just floored by the results. It didn't seem possible what we were seeing on the

417
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:35,880
machine. And obviously we ran it a few more times and just consistently seeing millions of nanograms,

418
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,600
a detection of millions when the FDA maximum permissible exposure to NDMA is 96.

419
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,240
And again, there's no safe level of this kind of carcinogen. The ideal level is zero. And we were

420
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,720
seeing millions and that's how this all started. At some point, I'm sure it crosses your mind.

421
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:01,000
There's a mistake here. It's one thing if the FDA limit is 96, you're consistently seeing 100 to 110,

422
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,160
but you're seeing five logarithms higher than an FDA limit. What's your self audit on that?

423
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,800
Gut reaction right away being a scientist is that something went wrong. Something got in there or who

424
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:20,600
knows? Control went wrong perhaps and contaminated the column. The machines themselves we're talking

425
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:26,760
about don't get data wrong. I mean, these are forensic level machines. The machine specifically

426
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,000
is called a GCMS, a gas chromatography mass spectrometer. It's been the gold standard for

427
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,600
this kind of impurity analysis for decades, over 50 years. And so you start looking for

428
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:46,360
potentially human error or anything else. And I went to our chief scientific officer who brought

429
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,400
this obviously straight to my desk. Let's look through this system. Let's clean it. Let's run

430
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,600
it again. Let's run more controls. And we kept rerunning it and rerunning it and seeing the same

431
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,320
thing. It was very odd, but the other thing that we did at the same time was starting to look at

432
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:08,280
the literature. I mean, this is such an extreme finding. Five logarithms higher, five orders of

433
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:15,480
magnitude higher than what is even still not a good place to be. We started reading about this

434
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,480
and there's been literature about it for 37 years. So you're talking about it being out at least 20.

435
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,160
The molecule was approved in 1981. The first studies that came out that started raising

436
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,240
concerns about NDMA and Renidin were published in 1982. It wasn't approved in the United States till

437
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:42,360
1983. And there was literally decades of studies about the instability of the Renidin molecule.

438
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,800
There's 17 years of research in the United States over the potential of Renidin getting into the

439
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,400
water supply and then forming NDMA and drinking water. And they showed all sorts of instabilities

440
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,000
in the molecule, reactions with chlorine, with ozone, with all these components that happen in

441
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,800
wastewater treatment plants, which are pretty much benign for anything else. And that's when

442
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,360
we also kind of came to the conclusion, well, actually, if it's such an amazingly unstable

443
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,800
molecule, perhaps it's just even breaking down in the machinery that's meant to test these kinds

444
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,880
of medications. So does this mean that you were more leaning to the idea that this was not an

445
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,320
issue specific to a particular drug, meaning to a particular manufacturer, but rather to the drug? So

446
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,000
when you looked at the first sample where you see a million nanograms per dose, did I hear you

447
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,120
correctly? A million nanograms in a dose? We were actually seeing between two and three million.

448
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:43,000
Okay. I'm guessing the first call you make once you decide this isn't a human error is somebody go

449
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,800
and get me branded Zantac. You got to think that this is a contaminant from the shady manufacturer

450
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,920
of this generic. You got it exactly correct. At the same time as we're delving into the literature,

451
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,240
we said, okay, this is very odd about whatever was in this particular bottle,

452
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:09,240
but let's just go to all of the local pharmacies around us and buy exactly the brand Zantac. Let's

453
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:17,240
buy all the various pharmacy versions of Renitidine and test them all and get the cool mint version

454
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,640
and the standard version and the maximum strength and every single pill of every single

455
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,360
manufactured label or wherever it was coming from, including the reference powder. So not only did

456
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,880
we check every single bottle that we could get our hands on at the time, we also bought the

457
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,280
certified reference powder that's as pure as you possibly can get it to rule out inactive

458
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,080
ingredients or any interactions there. And even in the reference powder, we are seeing

459
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,240
millions of nanograms of NDMA being detected by this test.

460
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:00,440
Well, that's problematic. I mean, that suggests that let me rather than tell you what I think it

461
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,440
suggests, what's your Occam's razor explanation for at that moment? Meaning before you do another

462
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,720
assay, what is Occam's razor suggest is happening when branded generics alike are containing

463
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,680
millions of nanograms of something that should be completely absent?

464
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,560
I love Occam's razor and Occam's rater specifically said it's a problem with the drug.

465
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,720
Everybody's head has always been in this Valsartan and contamination and bad generics overseas and

466
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:36,200
these kinds of things which are a problem too, but this was a problem must be just a totally

467
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:43,560
different level as in the drug itself is just so incredibly unstable and not just unstable

468
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:50,360
in terms of, okay, maybe you're going to get a less potent pill. It's directly forming NDMA,

469
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:57,000
the extremely potent carcinogen. And actually, one of the reasons that the specific data around

470
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,360
these millions of nanograms was so important, regardless of the conditions and that's now

471
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:09,880
becoming one of the discussion points, is that there's no other way to get millions of nanograms,

472
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,720
which is milligrams. I mean, these pills are at 75 milligrams, 150 milligrams. So we're seeing

473
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:23,400
milligrams of this carcinogen NDMA. There's no other way that it could be there except if the

474
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,880
molecule itself was reacting with itself and forming it. There's no other source of nitrogen

475
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,840
for this carcinogen, a very basic organic chemistry. I want to double click on that for

476
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,000
the listener who might be misunderstanding what you're saying. This is such an important point

477
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,520
that I'm a little floored. So a standard dose of ranitidine is 75 milligrams to 150 milligrams,

478
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:54,040
correct? Correct. Okay. So, and again, just to state this for the record, when you test a, call it 150

479
00:45:54,120 --> 00:46:05,240
milligram tablet of ranitidine, you could discover, call it 1.5 million nanograms of NDMA. Yes? At least.

480
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:11,320
Right. Which I didn't write it down, but I think that 1.5 million nanograms is 1.5 milligrams,

481
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:20,040
right? Correct. Okay. So that means 1%, one full percent of the supposedly active drug you're

482
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,120
getting is a potential carcinogen. And by the way, I want to come back to understanding the

483
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,320
carcinogenic nature of NDMA, but let's park that for a moment. What you're saying is just at a mass

484
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:37,160
balance level, the only way you could get enough organic building block inclusive of nitrogen to

485
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,000
make NDMA is if you're taking some of it from the ranitidine, meaning it has to be an almost

486
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,920
decay or chemical reaction of the drug itself. Is that correct? Exactly. Exactly. And from a

487
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,160
chemistry perspective, that's extremely concerning. And I'll say one thing also that makes it actually

488
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:05,080
10 times worse is that the NDMA molecule is a lot smaller or lighter than the ranitidine molecule.

489
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:12,600
So the molar conversion or the conversion of a ranitidine molecule into an NDMA molecule

490
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:18,680
is actually even more efficient than that 1%. The numbers are suggesting 10% or so conversion

491
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:26,120
of the ranitidine molecule into NDMA in an incredibly short period of time.

492
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:34,680
So what we're talking about in terms of this GCMS analysis is the way that it pretty much works is

493
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,360
you have this vial where we have a pill in it and some solvent. And then it goes into an oven,

494
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:46,200
chromatography oven, where it's being heated up and then you sample the gas and run it through a

495
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,360
column and then run it through a mass spec. Long story short, you need to heat it up for a little

496
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:57,080
bit to capture as many molecules as you can that's coming off and NDMA is a very volatile molecule.

497
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:03,800
It goes into the gas. It's 15 minutes. So it spends 15 minutes at 130 degrees Celsius,

498
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,680
which is benign for practically any other drug that we're looking at and is part of the FDA

499
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:16,040
standard protocol. And for just these 15 minutes, which in the chemistry world, there's very rarely

500
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,280
do you have such a short reaction. That's like cooking a scrambled egg or cooking a fried egg

501
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,880
in 10 minutes. That's pretty low temp. Exactly. And usually if you're doing serious chemistry in

502
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,880
a chemistry lab, you leave it for hours or days and sometimes it requires weeks, but 15 minutes

503
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:39,320
of exposure and you're getting at around a 10% conversion into NDMA. That's incredible instability.

504
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:45,640
And again, the reason you're saying 10% for the listener is even though it's 1% by mass on a

505
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:52,040
molar basis, the way we actually count molecules, it's much greater. Correct. Let's pause for a moment

506
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,760
and talk about NDMA. I certainly have a lot of questions about this. You've already stated the

507
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:03,240
formal name of the molecule. How big a molecule is it? It's just a few atoms, right? It's a couple

508
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:09,160
nitrogens and carbon and I don't have the molecular weight in front of me, but it's pretty small.

509
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,720
It's a tiny little thing. Yeah. NDMA is cataracts is a small molecule. It's particularly small,

510
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,880
even among small molecules. What is the mechanism by which it causes cancer in animal models?

511
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:26,920
Yeah. NDMA basically sticks to DNA. It sticks to DNA. It modifies what it calls alkalates it.

512
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:33,880
It also oxidizes it. Long story short, it's very bad for your DNA and by modifying the DNA is what

513
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,520
causes cancers. Yeah. Sticking to DNA is not the worst thing in the world. I mean, methyl groups

514
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,800
stick to DNA all the time and that's called epigenetic modification, which can be quite bad,

515
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,640
but can also be completely inert and in some cases can be good, but this isn't just sticking to it.

516
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,080
It's changing the structure in the DNA in such a way that, well, presumably if it's a carcinogen,

517
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:00,600
the definition is it changes the DNA in a way that the DNA in that cell no longer responds

518
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:06,120
to appropriate cell cycle signaling. So now you have growth of a cell that can be unregulated as

519
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:12,920
opposed to regulated. How well is that documented and in what model systems is that documented,

520
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:21,640
both cell type and in vivo versus in vitro? So the background in NDMA goes to at least the 1950s.

521
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:28,680
I'll say that it's extremely well documented in almost every clinical model, obviously other than

522
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:36,920
human in mice, rats, cell assays. It's been heavily, heavily studied for decades. And like I was saying

523
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:46,600
before, and I just studied, but also used actively as a control for inducing cancer in mice and rats.

524
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Just to explain to the listener, in vitro means it causes cancer in a petri dish where you take the

525
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,320
cells out. And if something does that, that's interesting, but it's a lot more interesting if

526
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,360
it can cause cancer inside the animal itself. And that's called in vivo. And that's what you just

527
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:08,840
said. Do you have a sense of what doses are necessary to induce cancer in rats? So this part

528
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,800
is also well studied. I don't know the exact dose, but what I can say is that the calculus that the FDA

529
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:22,440
has actually already gone through in terms of its potential effect on humans is based on these exact

530
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:29,160
kinds of animal models and studies. So during all the Valsartan and Losartan issues, one of the

531
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,240
statements that came from the FDA was that, well, if somebody had been taking the worst case scenario

532
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,840
of what they'd found, which I believe was somewhere around 17,000 nanograms or so of NDMA,

533
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,760
taking it consistently for years, there would be one additional cancer case in 8,000,

534
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,080
which may sound like a low number, but when you multiply that by the millions of people taking it,

535
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:59,000
there's still thousands of cancer cases that shouldn't have been. Obviously, there should be

536
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,320
zero cancer cases that come from carcinogens in your medications. And if you ask me, I'd say that

537
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:11,560
number is concerning period to have thousands of cancer cases. So those animal models are actually

538
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:17,960
used to at least make a best guess on what would happen in a human. And again, this is also best

539
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,920
guess. It could be worse or could be better. It's obviously not something you can test and to

540
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:29,160
actually put inside humans. But that doesn't seem nearly as high as some of the other carcinogens

541
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,280
that we would expect. I mean, there are other carcinogens that are used in laboratory testing

542
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:41,080
that are guaranteed to cause cancer. Is the difference you think the dose that in the animal

543
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:48,120
studies when such agents are used, they are used at astronomical doses, but not the same here. I

544
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,440
mean, I'm going to tell you where I'm going with my question in a moment so that you can think about

545
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:58,760
it as you answer this question, which is when you look at the ubiquity of Zantac use, the question

546
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,760
is going to be where are the body bags associated with Zantac? So before we answer that question,

547
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,440
let's try to tease this idea out a bit more if you don't mind. Sure. Definitely when you'd be

548
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:18,520
doing a study with mice or rats and you're trying to get them to have cancer, the dosage that those

549
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,640
animals are getting is going to be much higher than these trace amounts that are being found in the

550
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:31,480
medications like Valsartan. I don't know exactly what those dosages are, but I could imagine they're

551
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:37,880
in the milligrams. Interesting. So let's now talk about this epidemiologic question. I'm not a big

552
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:45,640
fan of epidemiology in general. I've railed on epidemiology when it comes to nutrition, exercise,

553
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:52,040
so many things, which is not to say I think it is of no value, but I think one has to be very careful,

554
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:59,160
especially when you see weak hazard ratios and try to infer causality. So when you see a hazard

555
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:09,000
ratio of 1.17, meaning there's a 17% increase in relative risk when exposed to X, and X can be

556
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,520
something you eat or something else, I generally have a hard time with those things. And if that

557
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,440
is a statistically significant hazard ratio, it will have a confidence interval that is well north

558
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,320
of one. So the 95 confidence interval will not include the number one. That's how we statistically

559
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:30,520
get that. But I find epidemiology can be especially helpful when it's not there. In other words,

560
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:37,240
when epidemiology says there's no association between X and Y, it becomes a lot easier to say

561
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:44,120
there's much less likelihood that there's a causal relationship between X and Y. So again, when you

562
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:52,280
consider the ubiquity in size, 15 million prescriptions a year plus I would say easily

563
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,880
three times that in over the counter use. So let's just call it 60 million dispensed

564
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:06,120
Zantex over the counter for almost 40 years. If NDMA is problematic, there should be a good

565
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,680
collection of body bags, shouldn't there? Definitely possible. And when we were putting

566
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:16,920
the FDA citizen petition together that we filed, we tried hard to look up. There are these

567
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:24,920
epidemiological studies and we found one from 2004 published by the National Cancer Institute

568
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,800
where they looked at the anti-acids at the time, the prescription anti-acids at the time when the

569
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:38,440
study started in 1986, I believe. And they found a link to bladder cancer when looking at those

570
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,960
anti-acids, which were both reninidine and submittidine at the time. And so it's kind of

571
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,000
as far as epidemiology goes, obviously you want to look at the individual drugs, not have them

572
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,600
lumped together. But that was particularly concerning for us thinking about another study

573
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:02,280
that was done by Stanford University and published in 2016, which was the only clinical study that we

574
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,760
could find where somebody actually gave people a pill of Zantac and they found over 40,000

575
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:14,520
nanograms of NDMA in their urine. So we may want to talk more about that in a second, but to

576
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:19,640
answer your question about epidemiology is essentially, it was just so assumed that this

577
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,800
is such an incredibly safe drug that at least as far as we could find that there just wasn't much

578
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:30,680
of that study out there. However, we have been working with a number of folks at Memorial Sloan

579
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:36,520
Kettering Cancer Center and there's been for at least a few months now a lot of efforts led by

580
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,840
Leore Bronstein to look into exactly that question. I mean, obviously, as you know, to do

581
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:48,680
a full breadth epidemiological study, I mean, these can take years, but we are looking forward

582
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:54,920
to hopefully get the initial results from Leore Bronstein and his team as soon as we can get them

583
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,400
published in a journal. And so what it really suggests is if there is an increase in the risk

584
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,720
of human cancers from the use of this, it's not going to be a la smoking. I mean, it's important,

585
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:10,680
I think, for people to understand the magnitude of risk here. In the case of cigarettes and lung

586
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:17,240
cancer, the hazard ratios, depending on the epidemiologic studies that were done, I think

587
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:23,000
they varied somewhere between 8x and 14x. And I could be off by a little bit, but I'm not off by

588
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,640
much. So what that means is if you smoke, if you reach a certain dose threshold of cancers,

589
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:37,160
your risk of lung cancer is somewhere between 800 and 1400 times higher than a non-smoker.

590
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,200
In the words of one of my good friends who's almost assuredly paraphrasing someone else,

591
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:47,080
when you don't need statistics to see the answer, that's usually a scary thing. And that was

592
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:53,080
certainly one of the cases. You didn't need complicated statistical models to tease out

593
00:57:53,080 --> 00:58:00,120
the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer. Now, that does not mean, because Zantac obviously

594
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,000
doesn't fit that. I mean, I just I can't imagine we wouldn't see some signal, but it could have a

595
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,480
hazard ratio of two, meaning it could double your risk of a cancer. And because it's so ubiquitous,

596
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:19,320
and if it's doubling a cancer that is itself ubiquitous, that's the fear. Let me explain why

597
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:25,320
to the listener, because obviously you would get this, David. The reason that lung cancer was easy

598
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:32,680
to spot from smoking is lung cancer, absent smoking is quite rare. So epidemiology is at its finest

599
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:38,840
when the signal is huge, and the thing you're studying is unusual. And that's why I believe

600
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:44,520
epidemiology is almost as useful as a warm bucket of hamster vomit when it comes to studying

601
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,960
nutrition, because when we study nutrition, we're interested in the diseases of civilization,

602
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,720
diabetes, obesity, and things like that. But the problem is those things are so ubiquitous. I mean,

603
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,760
there are so much of those things that it's very difficult to pick up signals associated with

604
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,040
lifestyle factors. So I guess what I'm trying to get at and feel free to disagree with me, I'd like

605
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:12,040
for you to disagree or refine my thinking, but I'm trying to make sense of this on two levels. One,

606
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:18,120
how big a problem is this? And two, what are our blind spots? I think you're basically saying we

607
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,040
don't know how big a problem this is, and that's the fair answer, because the study hasn't been

608
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,600
done. We haven't looked at the cases and the controls, meaning the people who have taken it

609
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,320
and the people who haven't. But the magnitude problem and the blind spot problem really come

610
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,600
down to we will not know the answer until we figure out which type of cancers, because if it

611
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:42,040
increases the risk of a very rare cancer, I suspect it would have shown up. I just think

612
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,720
if there was a huge uptick from 1980 until today of some very rare cancer,

613
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,800
that would be a lot easier to point to an environmental contaminant such as a drug.

614
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:00,760
But if it's increasing the risk of breast cancer and prostate cancer, which are large cancers to

615
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,080
begin with, it would be harder. Do you agree with my assessment? I know you're not an epidemiologist,

616
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,960
but you're a clever guy and you've thought a lot about this, and you've thought about it

617
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,000
more than I have. Well, I think it's going to be a very interesting conversation to get back to

618
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,880
when the results are published. And I will say that the big problem I think that's certainly

619
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,160
underscored with this runitidine issue is that just nobody was looking. You could argue that

620
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,880
how would they have known where to look, which I can also point towards lots of

621
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:36,360
studies and information of should have been looking at NDMA. But nobody was obviously looking

622
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,160
for the NDMA before, and nobody's been looking at the epidemiology before. There have been a number

623
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:46,840
of rare cancers that have gone up that have been unexplained, some of them starting in the 1980s.

624
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:53,000
So let's defer that question for when there's more data, of course. And then I think this is

625
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,640
this is something that is going to take years to really get down to what is the total impact for

626
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:07,000
real. But I can't imagine it's going to be zero. And anything greater than zero multiplied by the

627
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,640
millions of people taking it for 40 years nearly is a tragedy. Especially when you consider that

628
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:19,160
there are no shortage of substitutes that are equally efficacious, if not better. I mean, that

629
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:24,600
I think comes down to it's one thing if this were the only drug out there that could treat

630
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:30,840
patients with HIV, in which case you have to weigh out the benefits of a drug versus the costs. But

631
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:36,120
when we're talking about reducing gastric acid, which again, there are more drugs in that category

632
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:41,000
than I can certainly count, it begs the question why. Now, I want to go back to something you said.

633
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,560
So you brought up the study by Zeng and Mitch in 2016 at Stanford. I never heard of that study

634
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:53,960
until I started looking into this Zantac Ranitidine story. Presumably you hadn't either

635
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,880
until you made your discovery and went back. Why did the Zeng and Mitch article not get more

636
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:07,000
attention given the largely accepted carcinogenic nature of NDMA and the, I mean, staggering nature

637
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,240
of the study. If I recall the study, one pill, 150 milligrams given to subjects overnight who had been

638
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,480
not taking it before and you just collected the urine and you found, I don't know, was it

639
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:27,000
40,000 nanograms of NDMA? Right. Over 40,000 nanograms in urine, which in and of itself sounds

640
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,960
really bad and obviously it is, but it's actually at least a hundred times worse because the renal

641
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:40,920
clearance of NDMA, so how much NDMA actually makes it into the urine is that often 1% or less.

642
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:48,120
And that's because NDMA sticks to DNA and your body is full of DNA and it's reacting all over

643
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:54,920
your body. And so very little of it is actually expected to make it to the urine. So really what

644
01:02:54,920 --> 01:03:02,600
those results were suggesting is that somewhere around 4 million or millions of nanograms of

645
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:08,920
NDMA are being exposed in your body with a single pill of Zantac and they were using the

646
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:14,680
Brans Zantac in that particular study, which again loops back into our results that we were

647
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:19,720
seeing in the lab conditions, also the potential of this molecule to form millions of nanograms.

648
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:26,680
So totally agree with you. It was an extremely eye-opening study. And to go back to when we at

649
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:32,920
Valisher were originally finding this problem and Corey Kuchera, our chief scientific officer,

650
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,400
brought it to my desk and we started looking at the literature. That was, we were not aware of

651
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,960
that study beforehand, but as soon as we saw that study, we're like, what? Like this is,

652
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,240
this is an extremely alarming study. Yeah. And it sort of validates your numbers because

653
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:53,320
if one pill is putting 40,000 in the urine, as you said, you could assume that there was 4 million

654
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,000
in the bloodstream. That's the same order of magnitude as what you found in your chemical

655
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,640
analysis, which may or may not be compromised by temperature, which we'll come back to.

656
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,920
So why didn't that study get more attention is my question.

657
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:13,560
I mean, honestly, professor Bill Mitch, great guy that is in the environmental sciences. So he'd

658
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:19,640
been looking at this ranitidine problem himself at Yale University, at Stanford University for 17

659
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:28,120
years. His first papers published in 2002 were concerned about where does NDMA come from when

660
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:33,400
it's in drinking water and coming out of wastewater treatment plants. And the irony

661
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,560
of how this all came up for him was actually that there's this big environmental problem where they

662
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:45,880
had this rocket fuel plant where NDMA is often a byproduct of rocket fuel manufacturing. And they

663
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:51,960
were dumping into a river and all of a sudden there's all this NDMA in drinking water and a

664
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,240
lot of attention to NDMA, a very well-known carcinogen. But what they found is that even

665
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,160
after they cleaned it up and even after they started looking in other cities, they were still

666
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:07,400
finding low levels of NDMA. Basically sparked the 17 years of research for Bill Mitch and all the

667
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,720
various folks that he's been working with and in this field of environmental science of water

668
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:19,560
quality. And I think this has been like this big red button serious problem in a more obscure

669
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:25,960
science than the medical community is used to. I'm sure yourself as a doctor, I try to keep up with

670
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,160
a variety of journals or scientific findings, but I don't know how often you're looking up

671
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:37,800
environmental journals. I can tell you the answer to that. It'd be never. Right. And look, I think

672
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:43,240
what we found ourselves in the position at Valisher was adding some new science, some new

673
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,840
discoveries that we found, but really we were just connecting the dots over 37 years of research.

674
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:56,280
And what was very clear also in Mitch's paper of that specific study was that there was some sort

675
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,160
of missing biological link because there's also been a lot of work at which we also recreated,

676
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:06,200
which Bill Mitch did as well. Looking at the stomach, just conditions of the human stomach,

677
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:12,440
and you tend to find hundreds of thousands of nanograms of NDMA, which is also very bad,

678
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:18,440
being formed by the Renidine molecule. But his study was pointing to the possibility of

679
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:25,240
millions and therefore Renidine forming even outside of the stomach and the body being

680
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:31,400
extremely complex, which drove us at Valisher to look more towards, well, is there a potential

681
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:39,560
biological link here as well? And we identified an enzyme, specifically DDAH1, but this enzyme has

682
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,920
also been well characterized for many years. And what it does is it just grabs onto a molecule and

683
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:52,520
breaks off this DMA group. So NDMA is the N and the DMA components. And once you break off a DMA,

684
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:58,120
it's very easy to form the NDMA. There's nitrite that freely circles in your body and lots of

685
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,960
other ways to make it. And so essentially we looked at this enzyme and did computational modeling

686
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:11,800
to find that seems that the Renidine molecule fits extremely snugly in this enzyme. And that

687
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:17,480
at least gives a potential biological mechanism for forming millions of nanograms throughout the

688
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:23,640
body, even outside of the stomach. We essentially had now that biological link and the chemistry

689
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:30,200
side and then all the way into the full body clinical study that Bill Mitch did that makes

690
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,240
a very compelling story that Renidine is just a toxic molecule in the human body.

691
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:41,160
So let's talk about the FDA's response to all of this. What was the first date you made public,

692
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:47,720
your findings? So we actually confidentially alerted the FDA back in June. I don't recall the

693
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:54,840
exact date we filed an FDA citizen petition that made our much deeper analysis with the biological

694
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:01,000
link and everything else that we were studying. We filed that September 13th, but we did even

695
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,840
without having the full story yet, we thought the results were so alarming that we did this kind of

696
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:13,000
confidential filing to the FDA. We didn't want to be publicly talking about these kinds of problems

697
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,560
if we didn't have the full story. Obviously cognizant that this drug industry can be extremely

698
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,400
litigious. A lot of lawyers don't like it if you're talking about a particular drug badly. So that's

699
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,680
when we did the initial alert and continued to analyze this. And then obviously the FDA made

700
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,880
their own announcement also September 13th. So the September 13th date you filed the citizens

701
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,480
petition was the date that the FDA said that trace amounts. Well, actually I don't have their

702
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,560
statement, but do you know exactly what they said? I mean, I remember reading it because at that level

703
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,120
it starts to even get it. Even guys like me will start to see it when the FDA is saying it, but how

704
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:55,000
did they word their response to the citizens petition? So the FDA's statement Friday the 13th,

705
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,240
September 13th was, I don't have the exact wording in front of me, but that they had found an impurity

706
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:07,800
and DMA at low levels. I think they made some references to barely exceeding those that's in

707
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:13,720
food kind of feels like no big deal, but they're still making an alert and wanted everybody to be

708
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:19,800
aware of that. And us, we've been working for months now on this issue and putting together this

709
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:25,640
citizen petition that has all the information that we've studied about the chemistry,

710
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:31,000
the biology side of the components, a bunch of citations of as much as we could find in terms of

711
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:37,320
epidemiology. But we also had Leora Bronstein and Amoris Lone Kettering folks there working on the

712
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:42,280
epidemiology, which we thought that's going to be the full story that we wanted to publish as a

713
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:48,200
complete document. And we were actually quite taken back by the fact that the FDA made this

714
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:54,280
kind of announcement on September 13th. And although the citizen petition wasn't complete yet

715
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,480
with epidemiological results, we felt it was very important to publish it, get it on file and have

716
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:06,120
everybody see the full story that includes these very alarming findings on the chemistry and biology

717
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:11,640
and underscoring Bill Mitch's study, which all these things even just by themselves are so

718
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,560
incredibly concerning that even though we didn't have the epidemiology done yet, we definitely felt

719
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,800
should be published. Now, the FDA has the authority to do a lot. I certainly learned what they don't

720
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:30,040
have the authority to do in talking with Catherine Iban. But did they have the authority on September,

721
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:35,320
since it was a Friday, let's give them the weekend to think about it. But on September 16th, that

722
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:41,080
Monday, did they have the authority to pull all forms of renitidine and Zantec off the market in

723
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,800
the United States? I believe they do. They definitely at the very least have the authority to

724
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:52,120
request many factors, recall it. When you hear about recalls, it's almost always voluntary

725
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:57,480
recalls, but the FDA can push for it. Interesting that you mentioned that the following Monday or

726
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:04,680
Tuesday of that week, that's when the first other health system, Canada, so Health Canada, made a

727
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:11,400
statement September 17th, that Tuesday, with a very strong message of requesting all companies

728
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:18,280
to stop distributing all forms of renitidine. And the second line in that statement was current

729
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:23,640
evidence suggests that NDMA be present in renitidine, regardless of the manufacturer,

730
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:29,640
which directly underscores what we were finding, that it doesn't matter how it was made or where

731
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:37,080
it was made, just that the drug itself is so incredibly fundamentally unstable, that it can

732
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:42,840
directly form NDMA in a whole variety of conditions and should just be taken off the market.

733
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,160
Yeah. Well, I'm Canadian. I'll take a little victory lap on the conservative nature of Health

734
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,520
Canada. Totally kidding. How many countries besides the great nation to the north of us

735
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:59,800
have followed suit with Canada? So to date, now we're still just only a few weeks away from this

736
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:09,080
September 13th announcement, roughly 30 countries have recalled or banned renitidine and not just

737
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:16,920
places like Italy and France and Germany, but you have Kenya, Libya, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia,

738
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:22,600
Pakistan. Pakistan actually came out not just recalling all renitidine products,

739
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:28,120
they actually told all the manufacturers in their country to stop making it, as in stop

740
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:33,480
everything you're doing with anything related to renitidine. Stop it. And that was in Pakistan.

741
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,400
I mean, I just don't even know how to make sense of this, David, to be completely honest with you.

742
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:44,360
So I sort of get Canada's reaction because they were the first to react and they reacted before

743
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:49,640
the FDA had done what they've done over the past few weeks. Do you think a lot of these other

744
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,880
countries are just in a herd mentality mode or do you think they've independently taken a look

745
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:59,320
at your data, your petition, and come to the same conclusion? I know that's an odd question, but the

746
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:05,320
real question I'm getting at is why has the FDA resisted taking stronger action?

747
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:10,120
Each country has obviously their own health systems. I think a lot of these health systems

748
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:17,080
certainly look towards the FDA, but we were contacted by a number of press that were also

749
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:21,720
talking with the health agencies in their countries. We talked extensively to folks in

750
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:28,920
Switzerland, in Germany, in Poland, in India, in Russia, and it seemed that quite a few

751
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:35,560
agencies were running their own tests. We know specifically in South Korea, they even published

752
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:42,840
some of those results. They were finding at minimum 2,800 nanograms of NDMA and their worst was

753
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:50,520
32,000 nanograms of NDMA that was found by South Korea's regulators. And these numbers in of

754
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:58,280
themselves are obviously not good. But I think one of the unfortunate things that happened out of the

755
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:04,440
FDA's original statement is that it made this whole thing just sound like a contamination.

756
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:11,080
And I think you saw this a lot with countries too, is that some of them like Canada, I think,

757
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:17,080
realized early on, perhaps seeing our petition or just looking at some of the data like Bill

758
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:22,680
Mitch's study, that this is an inherent problem with the drug and therefore stop all manufacturers,

759
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:28,920
stop all distribution. Whereas some other countries were banning certain manufacturers

760
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:34,600
that maybe they tested or they had some data suggesting that this manufacturer had some level

761
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:40,680
of contamination in it of NDMA. But even that contamination, maybe we'll talk more about this,

762
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,920
of contamination versus inherent instability. There's actually a great article in India that

763
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:52,360
talked about this of why has France and Germany banned this substance versus at the time India and

764
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:56,200
the United States had not. And then a lot of what they were concluding is that some people are

765
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,080
looking this as a contamination that maybe happens here and there. And some are realizing the

766
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:06,200
reality that ranidity is a fundamentally unstable molecule and could certainly cause contamination

767
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:13,000
as a byproduct of being unstable, but has a seemingly very high risk of forming tremendous

768
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,360
amounts of NDMA in the human body and should just be taken out completely off the market.

769
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,840
So the FDA released a statement in early October that basically said to the effect,

770
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,400
hey, we're going to continue to test ranidity in its products. We're not saying there's nothing

771
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:33,800
wrong here. But they did very specifically challenge your method for testing. And they

772
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:39,640
said specifically in this, I do quote, it is not suitable for testing ranidity because heating the

773
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:45,560
sample itself generates NDMA and presumably they mean heating it to the low temperature of

774
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:51,880
130 degrees Celsius. Right. So yeah, that exact quote, heating the sample generates NDMA. I mean,

775
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:58,120
they don't mention that specifically, but they do say third party laboratory, which ironically in

776
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,480
the press, I don't think they even bothered talking about that. They just inserted the name

777
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:08,760
Valisher. But I think at the very least, nicely underscores that even just some heat, which again

778
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:15,080
is benign for practically all these other molecules is enough to generate NDMA. So yes,

779
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:21,560
exactly. We agree heat that could be happening anywhere in transit, could be in a hot car or

780
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:28,360
anywhere else could directly degrade this molecule, not just into falling apart, but into falling

781
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:33,160
apart directly into NDMA. So how did we get to the root of this problem? Because this could end up

782
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:38,520
being the jugular issue. I mean, in many ways, the Zeng and Mitch study suggests you don't need heat.

783
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,960
Has the FDA commented specifically on that study?

784
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,080
Not that I'm aware of. There's plenty of studies out there that look at all sorts of other

785
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:51,560
conditions that degrade raninidine. Like they're not even looking at in general, they're just

786
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:57,960
saying, okay, here's raninidine and let's see what happens when we add ozone that is commonly

787
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:04,200
emitted by all sorts of devices and things, or chlorine that you use for cleaning all sorts of

788
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:09,160
things. And there also is using wastewater treatment plants. And even the reaction mechanisms

789
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:15,480
were specifically ironed out chemically of how raninidine degrades directly into NDMA

790
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:23,560
with these relatively minor and benign conditions. And certainly the condition that concerned us at

791
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:30,520
Valcher the most was the conditions of the human body. So yes, we in the introductory paragraph in

792
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:36,600
our citizen's petition also comment on how the FDA method that we use, that was the method

793
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:43,000
available at the time for the analysis of NDMA. We suspect that this 15 minutes of 130 degrees

794
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,160
temperature is causing an incredibly efficient reaction of generating NDMA from raninidine.

795
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:56,920
And so therefore we modified that particular protocol. And I should also say that Valcher,

796
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:02,200
apart from having some great scientists that work with us, we are an ISO accredited facility

797
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:08,840
specifically for the analysis of NDMA. So we modified the protocol, did the proper controls

798
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:15,240
and put down the temperature. So we developed another method still using the GCMS and essentially

799
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,880
copying the rest of the FDA protocol and then bring down the temperature to body temperature.

800
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:26,280
And in this specific way of analysis, we didn't find NDMA in the tablets that we were looking at.

801
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:33,560
And so we used this low temperature version to analyze conditions of the human stomach.

802
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,840
Actually very similar, almost exactly the same conditions that Bill Mitch was using in his study

803
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,560
and others have used it in other studies before, where essentially we have simulated gastric fluid

804
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:49,960
and nitrite present, which seems to be particularly capable of reacting with raninidine in your stomach

805
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:55,160
and is just present in a lot of foods in general and in the human body, even without those foods.

806
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:02,040
So we created those conditions, put one pill of Zantac into essentially a hundred milliliters of

807
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:09,640
this kind of stomach fluid and then using the low temperature system, analyzed that and found

808
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:15,640
very similar numbers as Bill Mitch was finding is in the hundreds of thousands of nanograms of NDMA.

809
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:21,560
So we found up to 300,000 nanograms. Bill Mitch's study found up to 400,000 nanograms.

810
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:28,840
So pretty similar results, very high formation of NDMA in a body relevant condition.

811
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:34,680
So David, let me just make sure I understand that. So obviously the GCMS gold standard,

812
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,680
you can't get around it. You have to be at 130 degrees Celsius in the oven to incubate it.

813
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,040
That's going to produce the numbers we've discussed. But you're saying you came up with

814
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:48,360
a different test, which is instead of just taking the pill, crushing it, sticking it into the

815
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:55,000
GCMS, you dump it into a 37 degrees Celsius bath that is modeled after gastric secretion.

816
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,320
So it'll have a pH of two and it'll have this and that other cofactor and enzyme.

817
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:05,400
And you're saying when you took that little soupy bath, you did not have to put it into

818
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:12,120
the GCMS or you did, but you just ran it at 37 Celsius instead of 130. I want to make sure I

819
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:18,680
understand how you can do a low temp assessment. Yeah, important question. And that's somewhat of

820
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:23,560
the annoying part of where this discussion is now gotten to with these statements is now the

821
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:30,200
devil's in the details. So okay, what you described is how we prepared the sample. So the

822
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:37,080
kind of this bath that's emulating stomach conditions. And to analyze that bath, we had

823
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:43,240
to put it still in a GCMS, but now a low temperature profile of the GCMS, which

824
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:49,240
what that does when you lower the temperature in a GCMS is you've gotten less sensitivity.

825
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:54,600
So instead of being sensitive down to 25 nanograms, which is what the FDA protocol

826
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,760
gets and that they published and what we were getting in terms of the sensitivity when you

827
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:06,200
is 130 degrees, when you take it down to body temperature, now you're at 100 nanograms of

828
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:11,320
sensitivity. So a little bit less sensitive. So obviously, if you're trying to be a good chemist,

829
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:17,240
you would put it up to 130 degrees and get the highest possible sensitivity, which I'm sure is

830
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:23,400
why the FDA published that protocol at 130 degrees. And again, it's fine for Val Sartan and almost

831
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:28,680
every other molecule that we've ever looked at. Why is that the case? Why was it fine to go to 130

832
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:36,040
degrees Celsius with Val Sartan? Val Sartan is not unstable. In other words, the NDMA in Val Sartan

833
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:43,480
is thought to be a contaminant and not a product of degradation. Exactly. Okay. So can you run the

834
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:49,080
GCMS at 37 Celsius? And is that what you're saying? You can, but you can only detect down to 100

835
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:55,080
nanograms? Correct. Exactly. So this is splitting hairs here, but who cares when you're dealing with

836
01:21:55,160 --> 01:22:00,920
a concentration as high as you're dealing with, right? Exactly. And who cares when there's already

837
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:07,160
a clinical study that was done? We can argue all day about the conditions of the stomach, of various

838
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,960
things. You can never recreate biology, right? As soon as we're talking about biology instead

839
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:19,240
of pure chemistry, which is when the data of using the FDA protocol and seeing milligrams of NDMA form

840
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:25,960
from reference powder of Renidin, that's chemistry analysis. So our conclusion from that is that

841
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:32,600
Renidin is incredibly unstable, can form milligrams of NDMA in 15 minutes. And there's

842
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:38,040
no other way you could have done this except from the source of the drug itself. As soon as we start

843
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:44,680
talking about biology and stomach conditions, really the ultimate test there is a clinical test

844
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:50,600
where you go through the entire human body, which is exactly what Bill Mitch did at Stanford

845
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:57,960
University. Although did he use 130 degrees Celsius on the GCMS on the urine? Because the

846
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,600
real gold standard might be, or I wouldn't say the real gold standard, another elegant test would be,

847
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:07,800
you take a person, you give them Renidin, you collect the urine, and without doing anything,

848
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:16,120
you run that urine at 37 Celsius. And if that showed what Mitchell found, or even close to it,

849
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:21,080
if Mitchell found 40,000, let's just say you found 4,000, let's just say that the difference between

850
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:26,040
37 Celsius and 130 Celsius on the breakdown product, because again, the question we don't,

851
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:31,640
what we don't know is, is this person peeing out some byproduct of Renidin that then further decays

852
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:37,800
to NDMA, or are they just peeing out straight NDMA? And if they are, then the temperature should

853
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:44,040
make very little difference in how much you detect, correct? Right, actually, when we saw Bill Mitch's

854
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:50,760
study, and also seeing what we were seeing in the GCMS, we called Bill and started asking about his

855
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,960
work and everything else. We were pushing on some of those questions as well. He wasn't using the

856
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:01,720
FDA method, but obviously the devil's in the detail of all these methods. And he went back

857
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:08,520
and did some significant controls to validate these kinds of systems was something being created in

858
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:15,080
the instrumentation. And after all of his validation, he was still seeing over these 40,000

859
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:22,200
nanograms of NDMA. So how confident are you? And again, the answer can't be 100%, or you wouldn't

860
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:29,160
be a scientist, which I know you're a scientist. So how confident are you that grossly elevated

861
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:37,160
levels of NDMA are being made from Renidin that is not at all an artifact of instrumentation,

862
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:43,080
human error, or most importantly, temperature contamination? Extremely confident. And you hit

863
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:47,560
it on the head that as a proper scientist, I can never be 100% on anything, of course,

864
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:53,800
but the data is just overwhelming. And the other part of this is, as you've mentioned before,

865
01:24:53,800 --> 01:25:00,440
this isn't some life saving drug that there is no alternatives for, where we say, you know what,

866
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:07,080
we're 99% sure, but there's 1% that maybe we're a little bit off here. And people depend on this for

867
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:13,480
their lives. And let's think about that versus the fact that they may cause some cancer over time.

868
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:18,920
That's not the case. Plenty of alternatives, as you've mentioned, this is not a life saving drug.

869
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:25,240
So I don't see how any of that calculus plays into thinking that this should just be taken off the

870
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:31,640
market. Yeah. And I would add another layer to that, which I guess is why I wanted to speak with

871
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:36,280
you about this is I have a little bit of a background in risk, in a formal training in risk.

872
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,200
In risk training, one of the things you're always taught to look for is asymmetry of risk.

873
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:48,280
So if you have a bet, if you bet somebody $10 on the outcome of something, so you put $10 in,

874
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:53,720
they put $10 in, that's not a very asymmetric bet. You're going to win $10 and therefore walk away

875
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:58,600
with 20, or you're going to lose $10 and lose your money. Those are great bets to make because you

876
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:03,240
have a sense of what the downside is and what the upside is. But what I really struggle with here,

877
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:09,240
David, is this is a very asymmetric bet that the FDA is making. There's a chance you're wrong.

878
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:16,040
There's a chance that in a few years, all of the data will be in, including what I consider

879
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:21,960
arguably the most important data, which will be the human epidemiologic data that tracks the cases

880
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:27,720
and the cohorts. And it will show that Zantec is totally fine. And further chemical analysis will

881
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:32,920
reveal that there is some error in the methodology that you and countless others have made. It doesn't

882
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:39,400
sound like that's the case, but it could be. In that case, the FDA will have been the hero for

883
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:46,840
not recalling the drug. What's the upside in that situation? Conversely, in five years, if the

884
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:54,040
epidemiology or two years or whatever suggests the opposite, which is this totally unnecessary,

885
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:01,720
ubiquitous drug increased by two and a half fold, a risk of cancer, of fill in the blank cancer,

886
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:09,400
and when the FDA was notified of this, they did nothing, that's a very asymmetric downside. That

887
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:15,480
downside is infinitely greater than the upside of having done nothing. If anybody at the FDA is

888
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:20,840
listening, I'm sorry if I sound like I'm being a jerk, but I can't help but ask, what is your

889
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:26,280
chief risk officer telling you right now? Because if I was your chief risk officer, and I didn't

890
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:31,640
know a thing about biology, I'd be explaining this to you. Where is that discussion, David? Do you

891
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:37,640
know enough about the FDA to understand that? Do they have a chief risk officer? We have had no

892
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:43,880
interaction with the FDA throughout all this other than our submitting of the citizen petition and

893
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:49,400
seeing what they're saying about us in these statements. Huh. Well, I guess the only thing

894
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:53,880
I can tell you is here's what we've done. We've told that we have three patients in our practice

895
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,880
that take Zantac, so the first thing we did when I really figured out how serious this was, which

896
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:02,920
was not on Friday the 13th, by the way. The front of the 13th, I took the FDA's word for it. Stupid

897
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:08,040
Peter, sorry. But it was a few days later that a little bit more digging made me realize,

898
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:13,960
the FDA might be making a mistake here, that we went and scrubbed the medical

899
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:18,040
reconciliations of all our patients, realized three of them took Renitidine.

900
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,120
Luckily, none of them regularly. We just called them immediately, said, stop taking this drug,

901
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,720
do not pass go, do not collect $200. Here's the drug you're going to take instead.

902
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:30,760
Presumably anybody listening to this, I'd feel pretty comfortable suggesting they do the same.

903
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:35,960
What else is there to do? What can citizens do beyond not taking this drug themselves and

904
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,280
passing along that insight? Is there anything that the citizens can do with respect to the FDA? I

905
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:44,760
mean, how many citizens petitions does the FDA get a year, by the way? I'm not sure what that

906
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,320
exact number is. It's used for such a variety of different things, but I think they get a few of

907
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,520
them a week. But I assume that they're all different, right? I mean, obviously they're

908
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,560
all different. I guess what I'm saying is I assume they're of different magnitude of importance. I

909
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:02,040
mean, when a chemical lab of yours stature is submitting this type of data, that's probably

910
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,960
different than if I just rung up the FDA and said, Hey guys, I noticed when my patient took Crestor,

911
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,800
it worked. And when he took Resuvastat and it didn't, that's the type of citizens petition,

912
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:16,760
I assume that doesn't go too far. But do you have a sense of how many citizens petitions of your

913
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:22,120
nature and gravity hit their desk? I don't think very many. Do you know how the FDA set the limit

914
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:30,680
at 96 nanograms, by the way? Yeah. So the calculus behind that is basically ensuring that there is

915
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:38,280
less than one cancer case in a hundred thousand over the course of 70 years. That's an extrapolation

916
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:42,920
from an animal model, correct? Correct. So again, as a scientist, it could be maybe it's not that

917
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:48,520
bad or it could be worse. Humans are not the same as a mouse. Well, David, is there anything else you

918
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:53,560
want to say on this story? I mean, this is, I got to be brutally honest with you. I was a little bit

919
01:29:53,560 --> 01:30:00,200
reluctant to speak with you so early in the development of this story because I know that

920
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:06,440
time always brings new insights. But at the same time, I think truthfully, I felt a little bit

921
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,160
a sense of responsibility. Feel fortunate that we have an audience now that is quite large.

922
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:17,480
And if for no other reason than if this message gets to a lot of people who then share it with

923
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:23,000
a lot of people, it can make a difference in at least some people's lives. And again, my calculation

924
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:29,080
is on the asymmetric side of this, if this is wrong, I still feel like we've done no harm in that,

925
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:34,280
at least to a person, meaning we've harmed a company. Let's be clear. If this is wrong,

926
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:39,320
all the companies that make, who makes Zantac, by the way, is it Sanofi? Sanofi bought the rights

927
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:43,240
to in the United States. It's made by a whole bunch of different companies. Right, right. So

928
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:47,000
you've got all the generics in Sanofi that makes the brand, et cetera. I mean, let's be honest.

929
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,440
Let's look at it from their standpoint. They're being hurt by this. And if this turns out to be

930
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:56,360
wrong, that's potentially devastating financially. I guess I am taking a slightly different risk,

931
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:03,000
which is that the risk of someone switching over to a different H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor

932
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,960
is the worst thing that's going to happen. And the best thing that happens is hopefully some

933
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:13,160
cases of cancer could be averted over the next, God knows how long. That might be naive, but that's

934
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:17,880
sort of the reason I wanted to talk with you. But I'm uneasy of the fact that we, there's more

935
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:23,560
questions than answers too. One other thing actually that I think is important to underscore here and

936
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:31,480
could also play into this overall upside downside calculus is that the reason this whole issue came

937
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:37,160
up again in the scientific literature in the early 2000s is concern over water quality.

938
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:44,360
I'm an NDMA in drinking water. And what we mentioned in the petition that is getting very

939
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:50,600
little attention, unfortunately, is that now that there's all this news and everybody's worried

940
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:56,520
about it for one reason or another of whatever they're reading about Zantac and Renidine,

941
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:03,560
if you're throwing it away in the sink, down the toilet, even in trash, which goes to landfills and

942
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:09,560
bleach, eight runoff from that can be treated in chemical methods. All of this is exactly what all

943
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:14,280
these environmental scientists for the last 17 years have been saying is a potential problem

944
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:19,240
because it will form NDMA in the wastewater treatment plant, which then gets used as drinking

945
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:27,640
water. So we certainly feel that if you're making the decision to no longer use a Renidine product,

946
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:33,400
make sure you don't just throw it away or certainly don't throw it down the sink or down

947
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:38,840
the toilet. It needs to be disposed of properly. I mean, essentially, it's got to be disposed of

948
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:44,680
as toxic waste. It's got to be returned to the pharmacy or to all these facilities that do

949
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:52,120
medication disposal. Because another potential downside of all this is that everybody's dumping

950
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:57,800
it and it's going into the water system and then being converted to high levels of NDMA in drinking

951
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:03,160
water. And now you have another potential crisis. Well, that's a really good point. So again, just

952
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:07,160
to make sure the listener understands exactly what you're talking about, it's one thing to say, wow,

953
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:11,960
this is an issue. I'm going to stop taking my Renidine, but to flush it down the toilet or throw

954
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:18,520
it in the garbage potentially spreads the problem. Now, have you heard of pharmacies accepting samples

955
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:23,080
back and doing whatever is appropriate to dispose of it? I mean, from a practical standpoint,

956
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,800
what could somebody do the day they're hearing this? I think specifically, I believe it was

957
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:34,280
Walmart or some of the big pharmacy chains have said that they'll take your product back and even

958
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:38,840
give you a refund. I mean, I don't want to put words in their mouth, but it's something that

959
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:43,320
pharmacies are set up to do. And quite sure that a number of them have gone out and said that you

960
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,440
can even get a refund for this. Well, David, this may not be the last time we speak because I suspect

961
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:54,520
one, there'll be more to this story, but I suspect that there may be other interesting health issues

962
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,520
that crop up as a result of your work. But again, I want to thank you for speaking on very short

963
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:03,400
notice. I want to thank you for speaking with me on a Saturday night. And more than all of that,

964
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:09,640
of course, I want to thank you for the public service that your company does to take care of

965
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:14,600
a problem that honestly, a couple of years ago, I thought was non-existent. And now between your

966
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:22,280
work and certainly that of Catherine's, I've come to really, really doubt the veracity of the FDA

967
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:26,440
and in general, our regulatory environment. I don't say that lightly. I certainly think the

968
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:32,040
FDA is an amazing organization and I think we're richer for it with respect to what most countries

969
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:37,000
go through. I've met many people who work at the FDA. There's great folks there. I want to be clear

970
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,480
that I'm not disparaging the FDA, but there's something fundamentally wrong with this type

971
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:45,960
of decision making. And I don't know where the buck stops, but I'm definitely frustrated by this.

972
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:50,120
And I want to make sure that people are at least armed to make their own decisions,

973
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:53,480
which may differ from mine and yours, but at least they're informed.

974
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:58,280
Absolutely. And I would totally echo that there's tremendous good that comes out of the FDA and

975
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:04,280
tons of great people that work there. And I certainly hope that these kinds of scenarios

976
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:10,280
will at the very least bring more overall engagement on these issues. And I also not

977
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:15,720
entirely sure what all the decisions are being made here. And I wish that there would be faster

978
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:22,760
action on this specific grenadine case, but we certainly hope to work with FDA and regulators

979
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:28,440
as a whole on these real problems. I think obviously we have to come to the grasp, the

980
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:35,480
reality that there are problems in the medication system and generics, potentially even brand and

981
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:43,800
all sorts of holes that exist in how the system is now for medications. And we want to be a part

982
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:51,960
of that solution and work together to ensure that every patient is getting a high quality medication.

983
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,760
Yeah. Well, thank you very much, David. I appreciate your time and

984
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,480
look forward to seeing how this story unfolds.

985
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,760
Thank you very much, Peter, as well for spending the time on your Saturday night.
