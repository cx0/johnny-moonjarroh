00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,960
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,000
to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,160
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. I guess this week is Jaco and like Madonna, Sting,

46
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,560
or Cher, he's one of those rare individuals that only needs to go by one name. For those not

47
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,280
familiar with Jaco, he spent 20 years in the SEAL teams where he was a commander of SEAL Team

48
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,040
3's task unit, Bruiser, I believe, which led the battle of Ramadi becoming one of the more

49
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,680
decorated special operations units of the Iraq War. Jaco returned from the Iraq War, served as

50
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,400
an officer in charge of training SEALs on the West Coast, and ultimately when he stepped down

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,720
from that role, he co-founded Echelon Front, a leadership consulting company. Along the way,

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,040
he's become a New York Times bestselling author on leadership and has also written a number of,

53
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:55,320
frankly, fantastic kids' books, which my kids adore. He hosts the Jaco podcast, which is an

54
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,840
amazing podcast, and of all the podcasts I've ever been on, that episode that I did with Jaco

55
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,200
is certainly one of my favorites. He's a Black Belt and Jiu-Jitsu and the co-founder of Victory MMA

56
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,240
in San Diego. I met Jaco maybe four years ago through another mutual friend, Kirk Parsley,

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,000
himself a SEAL. This podcast was a ton of fun. It also took a while. We sort of lost track of time,

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,560
and before you knew it, I realized this was going to have to be released over two weeks and not just

59
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:29,160
one. In this episode, Jaco and I cover objectives, strategy, tactics, both in concept, but also using

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,760
specific examples from his experience. We talk about training versus actual combat, when you

61
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,640
should be humble and when you shouldn't, being wrong as a person and as a leader, dealing with

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,240
loss and the prospect of death, the importance of having protocols in place, what is worth putting

63
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,600
energy into and what is not, what SEAL training was actually like, transitioning from deployments

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,680
and post-military life into civilian life, obeying orders. Then we actually had this total tangent

65
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,440
where we talked about US history with respect to various wars from World War I all the way forward.

66
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,080
At the end of this episode, we talk a little about decisions in hindsight. So without further delay,

67
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,800
please enjoy the first part of my conversation with Jaco.

68
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,200
Dude, it is so nice to have you here. Thanks for having me. I have to tell you right up front,

69
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,800
when my daughter left this morning, she said, you have to stall as long as possible because I want

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,560
him to be there when I get home from school. What time does she get home? I don't know. We'll make it

71
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,600
happen. You're sort of like Snuffleupagus to her. Like she knows so much about Snuffleupagus. She

72
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,200
sees videos of Snuffleupagus. She listens to Snuffleupagus talk. She reads his books, but she

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,720
doesn't know if he exists. No, he exists, but I don't want to disappoint her. Maybe we should

74
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,640
keep the mystery there and I should get out of here. And I'll be like, oh, Olivia, I'm so sorry.

75
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,520
You just missed. Yeah. And then you got to say he wanted to stay, but he had to go and save the

76
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,280
world. So he couldn't stick around. There was a crisis. Big Bird was in trouble and he just had

77
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,600
to go. There you go. When we had dinner, what was that about two, three months ago? Something like

78
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,960
that. Which means when I watched you have dinner. Oh yeah, that's right. Cause you were fasting.

79
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,480
That was the best looking hummus I'd ever seen. I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was. You were

80
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,920
four days in, three days in. I was on day five. Oh yeah. Which actually is easier by day five.

81
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,560
You're over the hump. Got it. Your energy is incredible. You're smoking down the ketones.

82
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,680
It's all good. If that dinner were day two, it would have been more unpleasant. But we got talking

83
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,440
about something that we had been talking about for a year, which was there may be few people who can

84
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,600
speak to a concept that's near and dear to my heart better than you can, which is this notion of

85
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,240
differentiating between an objective strategy and tactics. And I think this came up, it literally

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,160
came up through something in social media where I had made a point. I don't even recall what the

87
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,440
point was, but so I'll use a different example, but your response was epic. It was sort of like

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:00,120
in 140 characters, you just completely embodied what I was trying to say poorly in like a treatise.

89
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,160
Right. So I'll tell sort of my story about it quickly so that I want you to be able to sort

90
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,640
of expand on this. So I met this guy once named Dennis Calabrese and he really changed the way I

91
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,600
thought about this because he has this sort of framework for solving hard problems, which is you

92
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
have to start with defining your objective and you have to do that really clearly. Most people

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,640
actually even miss that step. You then have to actually put a strategy in place and strategies

94
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,560
are frameworks are scaffoldings upon which you will hang tactics. And he said, most people,

95
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,080
if they're lucky enough to form the objective correctly, which they usually aren't,

96
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,840
immediately go to tactics without this strategic piece in the middle. So when you think about that,

97
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,240
I mean, you live that right. I mean, that's sort of anyone doing something senior in the military

98
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,400
is intimately familiar with that. Was that something that you learned along the way? Was

99
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,160
it something that was specifically taught or modeled? I think I learned it from a leadership

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,560
perspective, realizing at some point in my leadership career in the military that if the

101
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,880
frontline troops didn't understand things at a little bit higher level than the tactical level,

102
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,200
then they couldn't make decisions on their own and then decentralized command doesn't work.

103
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,600
And now we've got a real problem. So one of the things that can happen is, and this is something

104
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,960
that I would try and teach the young seals when I ended up in that role, is that a mistake that you

105
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:28,120
make on a tactical level can have a strategic negative impact. So the classic examples of this

106
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,640
are one classic example, I would say just from the Iraq war is the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.

107
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:44,760
So you take a bunch of young soldiers and they're literally 18, 19, 20 years old. You put them

108
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,040
in charge of detainee treatment at a holding facility in Abu Ghraib. They're guarding people

109
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,360
that they believe to be terrorists or bad guys. And so what do they do with them? They treat them

110
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,440
bad. And then you can kind of decipher what that really means. You know, were they torturing anyone?

111
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,760
Maybe not really. Were they out of the bounds of how a prisoner should be treated by Americans? Yes,

112
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,720
they were. And what is torture and we could try and discuss that. I think you actually can come up

113
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,720
with a decent answer. But they were doing things that they shouldn't have been doing with these

114
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,840
prisoners. And some of it, if it leaned up against some kind of torture, okay. I looked at it as more

115
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,000
like things that it was basically hazing. It's amazing, by the way, to think how long ago that

116
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,480
was like, it's such a coincidence. So you met Josh earlier today. Yeah. So Josh was working on me

117
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,520
yesterday. And I remembered while I was on the table and he was grinding on me that the Iraq

118
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,000
invasion took place on my 30th birthday, because it was March 19, 2003. I remember having dinner

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,040
that night. Nothing special, right? And it was just having dinner on my birthday. But I just

120
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,360
remember it was my birthday and that was the night of the invasion. And I was like, how is it possible

121
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,960
that was 16 years ago? Like I remember that day so clearly and not just that day, the days that

122
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,240
followed. And when I think about how tangentially and irrelevant I am to any of these things and to

123
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,360
think like, how much more would you remember that? Right? How much more can you think back to what

124
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,720
happened when the pictures and the videos came out from Abu Ghraib? I mean, it's interesting to

125
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,080
think of how everybody's psyche can be sort of seared and scarred by these events. It can. And

126
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,800
certainly those events that took place in Abu Ghraib where I was going with this is these young

127
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,320
kids did these stupid things with these detainees. It was bad. Even worse, they took pictures of them.

128
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,280
And then what happened was those pictures got into the hands of Al Qaeda and Al Jazeera and they put

129
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,880
them up and said, hey, Americans are evil. And the pictures looked horrible. And there you go. So it

130
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,640
had a huge negative strategic impact and did a lot to fuel the insurgency and make a lot of people

131
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,680
that would have otherwise said, oh, you know, the Americans are trying to do their best here. And

132
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,800
then they see pictures of Americans torturing these Iraqi citizens, because that's what the

133
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,520
propaganda is coming out as. So this is a massive strategic negative impact, because these frontline

134
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,320
soldiers didn't fully understand the strategic situation that they were in. So if they understood

135
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,200
that, if they understood, hey, we're trying to make sure that the Iraqi people think that we're

136
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,400
good guys. And if we do anything that presents us in a different light, it's going to really have a

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,760
negative impact. So don't do dumb things. If they had understood that, then perhaps they would have

138
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,600
thought a little bit more about what they're doing. So there's a classic example of troops on the

139
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,440
frontline not understanding the strategy at all. And therefore, their tactics are totally off base,

140
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,200
their tactics were beyond off base just because of their tactics, they were doing some dumb stuff. But

141
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,160
it's the same thing. It's like you're doing dumb things, dumb tactical decisions on the

142
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,880
frontlines, because you don't understand what the strategy is. So that's a classic example nowadays

143
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,920
that I still talk about with young seals and young military people, hey, you've got to make sure that

144
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,080
your troops understand what it is you're trying to accomplish. Because if they don't understand what

145
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,280
they're trying to accomplish strategically, their tactical decisions can be bad based on that fact

146
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,720
of what they're missing. And the other point you made even prior to that strikes me as even more

147
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,000
ubiquitous, which is, if you don't understand the strategy, and all of a sudden you get separated

148
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,280
from central command, and you have to call an audible, you have to pivot tactically, you're lost.

149
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,440
That's why decentralized command works. And that's also why centralized command fails. Because

150
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,960
oftentimes you are separated, you don't even have to be separated. If you're one of my snipers,

151
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,520
and you're looking down a street in an overwatch position, and you see something,

152
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,960
you don't have time to call me and say, hey, Jocko, this is what I'm seeing. What do you think

153
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,760
I should do? No, you have to understand what your mission is, what the rules of engagement are,

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,480
what our overall strategic mission is, what risk we're willing to take against that strategic

155
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,480
mission. And then you can make a decision, by the way, in a half a second, whether you're going to

156
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,160
kill someone or not. And so yeah, you absolutely have to understand the impact of what you're doing,

157
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,040
you have to understand the strategic mission, not just because you're going to be separated,

158
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,320
but you have decisive moments where you're going to have to figure if you're going to go one way

159
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,160
or the other way. And that's based on your understanding of the strategy, not just the

160
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,520
tactics. Yeah, the way I've always thought about it is through a much less crucial lens in the

161
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,120
moment, because it's a longer lens, but it's through health, right? It's through longevity.

162
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,240
People want to talk about tactical things all the time. Peter, should I eat this much,

163
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,680
or should I eat this much, or should I fast like this, or should I fast like that, or is a keto

164
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,520
diet better than a Mediterranean diet? And one, I just don't like talking about that stuff all

165
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,760
that much. I guess I'm just bored. But more importantly, I try to discourage that kind of

166
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,560
discussion because it's very tactical. And if you ask tactical questions, or tech questions that

167
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,560
demand tactical answers, you'll never get the bigger picture. And therefore, when the information

168
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,040
changes, which it will, as sure as God made little green apples, as sure as Tuesday follows Monday,

169
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,120
what we know about nutrition today is going to be far less accurate than what we're going to know

170
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,960
about it in 10 years. So instead of pegging yourself to what's the right thing to eat today,

171
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,320
peg yourself to the principle of nutritional biochemistry, and then you can evolve over time.

172
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,120
And so again, that's not a minute by minute decision the way you're describing it. But in

173
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,760
many ways, what you're describing is the pinnacle of that thinking, because it's going to require

174
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,560
split second decision making, which means it almost has to become autonomic. You have to be that wed

175
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,040
to the objective and the strategy. Anytime that you miss out on that, again, what you're talking

176
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:30,200
about, like health and nutrition, everybody wants to hear the tactical answer, because it makes life

177
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,640
easy. It takes the decision out of their hands. So if I'm a sniper, and I'm waiting to shoot,

178
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,280
and guess what? I'm not sure if I should shoot or not. The easiest thing in the world is just to

179
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,560
have Jocko say, Hey, if this is exactly what you see, then you take the shot. Or if this is what

180
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,800
you see, you don't take the shot. Hey, cool, you're free and clear. You don't have to think you don't

181
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,200
accept any blame. You're just doing what you were told. And so people want that, right? It makes life

182
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:56,200
very easy. If I go, Hey, Peter, I want to lose weight. What should I eat today? What should I eat

183
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,800
for my next meal? That's really easy, right? Because they don't have to think about it. But as you just

184
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,360
said, in the long run, guess what? You're in an airport, guess what? You're at a hotel, they don't

185
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,240
have the food that Peter told you to eat. So now what are you going to do? Well, if you have the

186
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,120
strategy, if you understand the strategy, then you can make a good decision. And that's going to get

187
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,360
you through. Whereas if you're sitting there waiting for that little tactical moment, it doesn't exist.

188
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,000
Because how many situations can I describe for that sniper? Can I describe 30 things that he can

189
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,560
see? Sure. Can I describe 50 things that he can see? Sure. Can I describe 100 things that he can

190
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,200
see? Now we're starting to get to the reality. And even if you could, is he going to have like a Tom

191
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Brady armband that's got every play? I mean, it's impossible. Yes. And the other thing is combat

192
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,920
things are gonna happen that no one, no one thought was going to happen. No one could have predicted

193
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,280
this in a million years that this individual is going to do what they did. One time I was watching

194
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,240
ISR. So the overhead coverage, and I got my troops are out in the field and I'm watching some of this

195
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,320
ISR. And we see a vehicle pull up and then the guys get out and they're kind of looking around.

196
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,120
And all of a sudden the trunk goes open. And okay, so now we're focusing our eyes on this thing.

197
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,920
And tell me in that moment, what is the range of possibilities you are entertaining when that trunk

198
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,000
opens? What is the best scenario you can imagine? And what is the worst scenario you can imagine?

199
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,240
What I assume is happening is this is the beginning of some kind of an attack, right? These people

200
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,080
pulled up and there's an RPG in the trunk. There's an RPG in the trunk. More likely, I was thinking

201
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,880
mortar because it was pretty typical. These guys would pre stage a spot where they knew the range

202
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,920
that they had to fire a mortar if you know anything about firing mortars. It's a tricky,

203
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,840
nothing about. Yeah, it's a tricky thing. You've got the angle and elevation, it's indirect fire,

204
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,040
it's going to go 1000 feet up in the air and there's going to drop down. So you've got to

205
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,240
know the range, you've got to calculate the angle that you're going to set the mortar out, you're

206
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,880
going to calculate how much explosive you're going to put on the mortar so that it projects as far as

207
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,640
you want. So it's a complicated thing. So what these guys would do is kind of pre measure

208
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,720
everything and know the hey, when we pull up our car to this spot, we know how many meters it is,

209
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,240
we got our charges ready, we got the angle of the mortar set. So we can do it in 30 seconds.

210
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,440
Boom, we're out, we set up the mortar, we drop three rounds, we put the mortar back and we leave.

211
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,200
So that's kind of what I was thinking. So you are planning for the worst. Is there anything that's

212
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,080
crossing your mind that says these dudes are literally on a meditation retreat? I'm using

213
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,120
this to be facetious, but like, they're just here to get their smoke on. Well, you definitely

214
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,920
have to think about that. Because in Ramadi, for instance, there was 400,000 civilians living

215
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,240
there. And there was probably anywhere between 1000 and 5000. Insurgents. Yeah, it may have been

216
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,600
less than that may have been more than that at certain times, but and they blend well, they blend

217
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,520
very well. So my mind isn't thinking, Oh, they're open their trunk, that's definitely an attack.

218
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,440
And actually, I'll go over another situation where the same thing happened to me before. So this was

219
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,640
something that I'm kind of used to. So I'm watching this happen. And the guys they're kind

220
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,440
of mulling around the car, they're looking and you're thinking, okay, here they are, they're

221
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,400
getting ready to set it up. And sure enough, the guy pulls something out of the car, and you can't

222
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,400
make it the other thing that's really hard about by the way, what distance are you at? I'm in a

223
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,120
tactical operation center, I'm two miles away. And this is one thing that makes it hard in the city.

224
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,480
When people talk about ISR, and you've got coverage overhead. Well, just imagine you got

225
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,360
buildings. And as the angle changes, all of a sudden, the person disappears behind the building,

226
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,280
right? You just can't see them until the orbit of the platform gets back to where you can see.

227
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,840
So there's a little bit of that going on. And by the time the orbit comes back on,

228
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,000
boom, here, the guys, they're pulling something out of the truck, oh, what is it? And it's hard

229
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,960
to tell what things are. And to make a long story short, they were getting a jack out of their car

230
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,080
to jack up their car, they had a flat tire, and they pulled off their tire, they changed the tire,

231
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,640
they left. And meanwhile, my guys got attacked from another position that I wasn't paying

232
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,880
attention to, right? Why wasn't I paying attention to it? Now, is there a chance that these guys were

233
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,600
a decoy actually a pretty high probability, most of the people running around in the city,

234
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,080
doing things like this were generally bad. And when firefights were going on, or when there was

235
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,560
big movements in the city, most of the civilians knew, okay, the Iraqi soldiers and the Americans

236
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,520
are sweeping through this area, guess what we're gonna do? We're gonna go in our house, and we're

237
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,400
gonna stay there. That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna try not to bother, and we're gonna stay in

238
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,600
our house. So when you see someone doing something, you are definitely more suspect than in a situation

239
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,040
where there's people going all over the place. Anyways, the streets would clear when we would go

240
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,400
out or when the enemy was going to attack, the streets would clear and that was the way it was.

241
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,200
So to see someone out there doing this, you're definitely suspect. And there's a probably a

242
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,680
pretty good chance that these guys were doing that specifically to draw attention away from

243
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,720
this other element that was attacking. They're good. They know what they're doing. So those are

244
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:39,000
situations that you can't predict. And if people don't understand what the strategic vision is,

245
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,800
then they can't make decisions out there. Another example that I've experienced that is

246
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,680
so dwarfed compared to both the stakes and the risks of what you're describing is bow hunting.

247
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,760
So I just came back from my first bow hunting trip and game changing experience for me. I mean,

248
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,440
when I bought my first bow two years ago, I didn't think I would ever hunt. I specifically went in

249
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,000
there to say, look, I just want to shoot targets all day long. And they said, well, you sure you

250
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,040
don't want to hunt? Nope. Don't want to hunt. Just want to shoot targets. Fast forward a couple of

251
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,880
years and now I want to go and hunt. And what a learning experience, right? So when you're sitting

252
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,760
there shooting targets all day long, you're putting all of your emphasis on precision,

253
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,320
perfect fire, perfect shot over, over, over again. How far can you be and make that perfect shot? Boom,

254
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,160
boom, boom, boom, boom. Then you get in the field and we were fortunate to be going after one of the

255
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,360
hardest pieces of game in North America, the axis deer in their terrain, incredibly mountainous.

256
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,560
So there are places where you can hunt them flat, but we were in a place that was

257
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,720
staggeringly mountainous. All of a sudden, two things occurred to me within 48 hours. One,

258
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,880
it's happening way faster than I've ever prepared for. Meaning when a deer is anywhere within

259
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,160
shooting distance and our guide is like, knock now, put the arrow, like knock the arrow.

260
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,840
It's like, but I don't have good footing. Like I can't see where I am. Like I don't know how far

261
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,000
the animal is. I haven't got my range finders. Like everything's going wrong. Secondly, the noise

262
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,280
that you make, the fumbling around to get in position, the deer's gone. The deer's gone.

263
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:13,080
These things can hear, see, and smell at a level that makes us seem like single cell amoeba that

264
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,400
are pointless. Like so now, of course, by the end of the trip, six days into this, we're figuring

265
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,600
this out. I'm getting so much better at anticipating what's happening, but it actually

266
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,720
made me think in my tracks, how frightening is it for a soldier to train, which again,

267
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,320
your training is better than my training. Meaning the way that a soldier is training for combat is

268
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,000
much more comparable to the event than the way I'm training to shoot. But it's like that saying,

269
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,200
right? Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. I can't imagine what it's

270
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,440
like the first time a patrol is out there and a roadside bomb goes off and someone gets their

271
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,160
leg blown off. Right? Like so now you're seeing this. And to me, that's another example of how

272
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:59,560
when stuff goes really, really, really bad. One, you have to understand, have you been trained

273
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,480
enough to automatically do the right thing? And two, do you start making a whole bunch of tactical

274
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,120
errors because that wasn't a planned reality? I mean, how in the hell do you train someone for

275
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,680
that? Well, thankfully, the training evolved so much even while I was in. So when I first came

276
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:24,840
in the SEAL teams, we used blank fire for land warfare and we used live fire for CQC,

277
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,560
close quarters combat. So that means you're going into a building and you're using live fire,

278
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,920
which means you and I are going to be a foot away from each other. We're shooting rounds

279
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,120
really in close proximity at targets. Why would you be using blanks at long range versus? Well,

280
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,280
okay. So we do the same thing. We do live fire in the desert as well. And in the jungle,

281
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:48,280
we do live fire primarily. We would occasionally use blanks, but we used blanks in the land warfare

282
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,960
with this old system that the army used called miles gear, which was basically a laser tag

283
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,720
system. Right. But it's not that great. That was the problem. It wasn't that great. And so a lot

284
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,000
of times it was like, Oh, you know what? This is really isn't that great. And so we just said,

285
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,080
you know what? The most intense thing we can do is train with live fire. So I should have completed

286
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,240
that statement, which was we tried using blanks and this miles gear. There's two factors. I

287
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,920
shouldn't just blame the miles gear as seals. We weren't that good at it. We got old equipment.

288
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,720
We'd get it from the army. It wouldn't be that good. We didn't really know how to sight it

289
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,720
incorrectly. And so guess what? We end up with something that's not all that great. So we just

290
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,960
kind of focused on live fire and live fire. Let's face it. That's like, Hey, we're going live fire.

291
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,240
That's just the intensity is higher. That's what we do. We're seals. We train live fire. And then

292
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,520
you go into kill house and you're training live fire and you're shooting at targets. And it's

293
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,000
intense because you know, if you screw up in the kill house, you can easily shoot one of your

294
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
bodies. So it's intense. The problem with it is you're going against paper targets. And there's

295
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,520
two things that the enemy will do that will have a massive negative impact on your brain

296
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,480
and on the situation. And that is the enemy will shoot back at you and they'll maneuver.

297
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,240
Those are the two things that the enemy has. That's what the enemy does. Well, there's two

298
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,920
things that a paper target can't do shoot back or maneuver. And so guess what? We used to just

299
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,200
crush these paper targets. I never got beat by a paper target in my life. And I spent many years

300
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,000
in the SEAL teams where we just kicked the shit out of paper targets. And we felt really good

301
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,080
about it. Right in the late nineties, we started using something called simunition, which is you

302
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,120
use your real gun, but there's a different barrel that you put on the gun. And the barrel that you

303
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,360
put on the gun allows the gun to fire paint rounds. Even though you're loading with a magazine,

304
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,600
you still have 25 rounds. So it's a blank that's being fired. That's pushing out a paintball.

305
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,360
Yes. Basically it's a paintball gun. You still have to do magazine changes. You're still getting

306
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,480
the same weight, the same kind of sight picture. So it's very similar, I should say. And that had

307
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:54,040
just a huge impact on us tactically, because all of a sudden these tactics that we were using

308
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,480
where the enemy never maneuvered and never shot back at us. All of a sudden they didn't work.

309
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,000
A classic example is we used to stack in a hallway to move through a building. We would

310
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,120
all just stack in the hallway and then we'd go down the hallway putting people in the rooms.

311
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,400
You take this room on the left. Next two guys take the room on the right. Next two guys take

312
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,720
the room on the left. So there you go. You got 20 guys in the hallway and then you move down

313
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,360
the hallway and you clear the rooms as you go down the hallway. Well, what we didn't realize,

314
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,280
because those paper targets never popped out of the door and shot back at us, as soon as we started

315
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,080
using simunition, you are all stacked up in the hallway. So you got 20 guys in the hallway and

316
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,480
somebody way down at the end of the hallway sticks their simunition gun around the corner. They don't

317
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,800
even expose themselves at all. And they spray off a magazine around. It's 25 rounds, comes down the

318
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:40,600
hallway and guess what? Eight guys are hit. And there's this pushback against that. There was

319
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,360
actually some pushback against that, which was that's not realistic. That guy didn't even take

320
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,840
a sight picture. That guy didn't expose himself. So it's not realistic. And my thought was, wait a

321
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,960
second. It just happened. And believe me, an AK 47 would have been even worse than a simunition.

322
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,720
That's what I was going to ask you. I mean, is the paintball under or overestimating the

323
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,480
potential spray of the round? Underestimating. Oh, so then you're right, right?

324
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,120
Yes. And there were some guys that would say it's not realistic. And there were some guys that

325
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,960
would say, actually, what's messed up is our tactics. And so that was kind of the beginning

326
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:19,240
of us putting pressure on each other with more, we call it force on force training. We eventually

327
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,960
got a system for our land warfare because the problem with simunition is it's accurate to like

328
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,520
20 meters, 10 meters, not very accurate. Whereas land warfare, our guys can shoot you at 800 yards,

329
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,720
700 yards pretty easily. This isn't like a big challenge. Even me, I'm not a sniper, but with

330
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,200
my weapon and a scope on there, I'm going to knock you out, you know, at 500, 600, 700 yards,

331
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,960
it's going to happen. So the paint doesn't simulate that eventually ended up getting a very good

332
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,160
laser tag system for external movement for land warfare. And it had little speakers on the system,

333
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,040
little speakers next to your shoulders. So as you were getting shot at, if it wasn't hitting you,

334
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,080
but it was close to you, it would make noises like there was rounds going over your head on these

335
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,480
little speakers. It was so good when I was running the training, the punishment for getting shot was

336
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,720
your buddies had to carry you for two kilometers, three kilometers in the desert at night on night

337
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,360
vision, you and all your gear and let's put that in perspective, your gear weighs because you're in

338
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,960
body armor. So what's the total poundage of gear armor, everything pack, probably 60 to 100 pounds

339
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,520
depending on the position the guy has in a platoon. So you're easily carrying 280 to 325 pounds

340
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:43,160
easily. And carrying bodies is much, much harder than it seems. And it's much, much harder than

341
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,760
it looks in the movies. By the way, it doesn't seem or look at all easy. When I, when I see,

342
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,880
I mean, again, not to keep coming back to this hunting thing, but it's just so fresh in my mind,

343
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,640
like even when we would shoot an 80 pound animal and you would field dress it and then carry it

344
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,400
out. I'm like, this isn't that heavy, but why is this so awkward? Yeah. And then imagine that that

345
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,480
deer isn't dead, but it's wounded. It's a lot harder than people think it's going to be. And

346
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,760
realistically, oftentimes carrying one person can take four people. If you lay out a litter and this

347
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,320
guy weighs 200 pounds and you got his gear on there and now it's 280 pounds and you're going

348
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,640
through the desert. And by the way, everyone's already carrying 70, 80 pounds anyways. So it's

349
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,720
very, very problematic. So as we got more and more engaged in the force on force training,

350
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,840
we got better and better and better and more prepared for what combat was really going to

351
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,560
be like. Now there are still our discrepancies. Cause one thing that you can't train or what I

352
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,720
was going to say about the realism, I would see guys out in the desert because the punishment was

353
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,520
you would get carried and it's not punishment for you. Actually it is punishment for you.

354
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,800
Cause guess what? You feel horrible that your boys are getting, not only that, they're not going to

355
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,080
do an effective job. They're going to drop you. You're going to fall. You're going to lose gear.

356
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,760
It's like getting a beat down for two or three hours in the desert. So the punishment was really

357
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,480
hard. And so when you'd see like a guy starting to get shot at and rounds were getting close to him

358
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,080
and he was hearing those snaps on his little speakers on his gear, you would see them dive

359
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,200
for cover as if they were really getting shot at. It was kind of crazy to watch that. Sometimes

360
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,560
that being said, they still knew that they weren't going to die. They weren't going to

361
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,760
literally die. So you would still see guys take risks that you think to yourself, would you really

362
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:33,160
take that risk? If that building was getting hit with AK 47 rounds and were impacting right

363
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,440
outside the door, you probably wouldn't do the metal of honor run. You'd hesitate. You go, okay,

364
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,560
what can we do to mitigate this? So there were some times where that becomes a little bit unrealistic

365
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,280
on both sides, both the opposing force that the guys would be going against versus the good guys,

366
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,000
the quote unquote good guys, because they're all seals. Do you remember the first time you were in

367
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:01,000
combat and you had that moment of hesitation, which was this is live rounds. This is all the

368
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,800
marbles here. I guess what I'm getting at is was there a moment that you recall when if it were

369
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,680
training and you couldn't die, you would have done something. But in the situation you were in,

370
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,080
your instinct was actually to do something more conservative. The first time I was in a situation

371
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:22,680
where I got very, very lucky. The reason that I got lucky was almost as if it was planned. My

372
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:29,240
career in combat slowly escalated. It slowly escalated. It wasn't like, Oh, all of a sudden,

373
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,320
I mean, my whole first deployment to Iraq was six months long, but the amount of we did a bunch of

374
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,240
operations and we generally had the upper hand almost all the time. So it was a really good

375
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,520
confidence builder. The few times we got ambushed or whatever we responded really well, felt really

376
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,480
good. And so I got to kind of experience that and kind of get it out of my system. But I was going

377
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,800
to say the first time I had a guy, we were doing a convoy, we were going to a location in Baghdad.

378
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,680
I had a guy get on our way to where we were going. We started taking rounds and I actually didn't know

379
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,080
it because I didn't know what it was like. And you're in a Humvee and you can't hear and what I

380
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,960
saw was and it's day or night, it's nighttime. And what I saw was it looked like somebody was

381
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,240
throwing cigarettes out of one of the Humvees ahead of me because I'm the number two Humvee.

382
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,720
I think to myself, who's smoking right now? We're on patrol. What is I see a couple of sparks fly.

383
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,200
And then I see more sparks. And I'm thinking, wait a second. Now we got multiple smokers in the lead

384
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,120
Humvee. What's going on here? And then it occurred to me, I was like, Oh, idiot, you're getting shot

385
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,400
at right now. And then sure enough, we had a guy that took around in the head and actually was okay.

386
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Again, the miracle of what bullets do and they actually hit it was probably a ricochet and it

387
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,800
went underneath the skin and then kind of wrapped around the outside of his skull. So it didn't

388
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,320
penetrate his skull. So it was clearly it was a ricochet or something like that. But that's such

389
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,960
an interesting example, right? Like here, someone like me listening to this, you look at an AV seal

390
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,160
and you think, man, you guys must know everything that's happening in every moment. Like you're like

391
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,760
cartoon characters, right? But yet in that moment, there's a vulnerability, which is

392
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,840
you literally didn't even realize you were being shot for a few minutes. Like you had to go through

393
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,080
the processing of, Oh my God, this is real now. This is actually happening. And there was a lot

394
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,000
of that steep learning curve and these kids that are coming in now, I call them kids. I don't mean

395
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,160
disrespect by that because the young guys that came in the SEAL teams in 2005 and 2003, I mean,

396
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,760
I came in in 1991. Okay. The first Gulf war was about to go down and I was excited about it,

397
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,200
but it was over really quickly. So there's a whole time period where people are coming in the

398
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,160
SEAL teams and they didn't really have it. I didn't realize that. I know we had talked about

399
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,080
this years and years ago. I think I had forgotten that you were in the early nineties. I don't know

400
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,680
why I thought it was like mid nineties. So I mean, 10 years before nine 11, I didn't shoot my weapon

401
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:47,080
at a bad guy for 13 years of just training and trying to be ready. And I guess to your point,

402
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,320
your question was we had trained so much at this point that we all felt pretty good about

403
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,320
what was going on. Now let's talk about the difference between an enlisted guy who's coming

404
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,080
in in 2003 into the army. I mean, he can't have a fraction of the training that you've just

405
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,320
described, right? That is true. That is true. And that was one thing that was a real disparity

406
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,280
is like, for instance, we got to Ramadi, the guys that were on the ground in Ramadi when we got

407
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,280
there, they were national guard unit. And so these guys were part time soldiers and they had been on

408
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,560
the ground fighting in Ramadi for 14 months and they had done an unbelievable job and they took

409
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,640
some very hard lessons, but it just shows you the professionalism of the military and the dedication

410
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,760
of these soldiers. We were in all these guys when we got there, every one of these national guard

411
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,800
units, every one of these guys in these national guard units had more combat experience than anyone

412
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,040
in my whole task unit. That's a humbling experience. I can't imagine what you're thinking when you roll

413
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,040
into that. I'm humble about it. I'm thinking to myself, what can we learn from these guys? And we

414
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,360
did. That's what we did. We said, hey, you guys are the professionals here. What do you think about

415
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,120
this mission? What do you think about this area? What do you think about this tactic, this technique?

416
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,400
And they would tell us what they thought. And what was kind of cool was a lot of the young soldiers,

417
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,280
they would look at us and go, you guys are seals. You guys are Navy seals. And so they kind of had

418
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,680
a little bit of respect for us just because whatever kind of stories they'd heard or whatever,

419
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,720
the legendary seals. And for us to go in and say, hey, how do you think we should do this? Or what

420
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,720
do you think about this tactic? These young Marines, these young soldiers, they were just awesome guys.

421
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,600
And it is very humbling. What took 14 months? Is this a resource issue? I mean, why were national

422
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,600
guards been sitting there for 14 months in one of the most violent parts of the world without a

423
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,600
greater support system? That's the way it is. I mean, this is something that the recruiter is not

424
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,200
going to tell the people that joined the national guard or joined the reserves. It's in the fine

425
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,040
print that if we're at war and we need you, you're going to get called up and you're going to go.

426
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,960
And so that's what happened. That's awesome. These guys were teachers and electricians and

427
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,800
plumbers and lawyers and doctors. And one day they get told, hey, you're going to go to Iraq.

428
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,320
And you know what they do? They get their gear on and they go to Iraq and they do a hell of a job

429
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:08,920
over there and make just incredible, incredible sacrifices for the mission. And so yes, we held

430
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,160
those guys in the highest regard and still do think about the guys that were there and we got there

431
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,000
who definitely had less training than us. But man, they were hardened combat warriors by the time we

432
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,360
showed up and they definitely helped us and kept a lot of us alive because they were able to share

433
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:30,040
with us the way that they operated. And to the credit of my guys, all the guys in my task unit,

434
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,680
Tasking to Bruiser, we were listening. We were all ears. We were humble and wanted to learn from

435
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,800
these guys who had been fighting for so long there. Is that a lesson specifically that you talk about?

436
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,480
Because so much of the work you do today is working with people who have never held a gun

437
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,840
and are never going to hold a gun, right? They're in a board room. They're wearing a suit. Do you see

438
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,680
that parallel lesson show up in the business world? I always say that humility is the most important

439
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,880
attribute or characteristic for a leader to have. And it really applies to everyone. Remind me to

440
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,680
talk about the counter to this because there are situations where humility is not something I need

441
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,480
to stress with someone. But yes, in the business world, in any leadership position, when you're in

442
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,520
that position and you don't have humility or you think, you know, I already know everything.

443
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,960
Think about this. If my task unit, if we showed up in Ramadi and thought we knew everything,

444
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,800
these guys were learning lessons. These guys were fighting so hard. They were learning so many

445
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,640
lessons. We were all ears because we were humble enough to think to ourselves, hey, guess what?

446
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,160
These guys have been fighting for 14 straight months. These guys have been out in this, this

447
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,960
road that we're going to go on patrol tonight, this army private, he's gone down that road

448
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,800
a hundred times, literally a hundred times. And we're all fired up because we're going to go on

449
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,520
this mission and down this road. And we go to this guy, hey, what should we watch out for? Oh,

450
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,520
here's a couple of things. Guess what? The enemy likes to set up in these buildings over here.

451
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,920
Thank you. We'll hold extra security on them. Guess what? If you do get a firefight, here's

452
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,000
where they're going to try and push you towards. Be careful because they'll choke this point. Like,

453
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,160
these are just common things. And so in the business world, that happens too. You get someone

454
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,080
that's been in the industry. You hear this all the time, right? I've been in this industry for 22

455
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,600
years. I've been in this industry for 27 years. No one's going to tell me what's going to happen

456
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,360
with the market. No one's going to tell me a new methodology of doing something. No one's going to

457
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,960
tell me how to run my company. Okay, cool. We'll see how that works out for you. It generally

458
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,360
doesn't work out good. Now I'm not saying that in 22 years, you don't have some good knowledge or in

459
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,280
27 years, you don't learn some good stuff. You absolutely do. Do you know everything?

460
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,920
Are there any times when you should maybe listen to what somebody else has to say or look at the

461
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,760
way someone else is running something and maybe think yourself, oh, that seems like a good idea.

462
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,400
The classic examples that I talk about a lot is Blackberry, right? Blackberry was their market

463
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,440
share. 80%. It was 90%. Was it that high? It was crazy. Someone just told me what the share price

464
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,280
on RIM is today and how, I mean, they're a completely different company. Obviously, it

465
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,600
doesn't exist in the format that it once did. But yes, that was at the height of that market. I mean,

466
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:01,080
that must have been $140 a share company in an 07. Yeah. And who could ever teach them anything?

467
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,720
Who could ever explain to someone that, you know what, what you're doing right now might not be

468
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,320
the same in a year. Same thing with Blockbuster, right? We're going to do videos. You're going to

469
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,160
come and you're going to rent videos from a store. I have to explain that to my kids. My kids are,

470
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,640
they can't even comprehend that. What do you mean you would go somewhere and get a movie from

471
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,760
somewhere else? What does that mean? And yet there's arrogance there, right? I mean, tell me

472
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,360
Blockbuster didn't have the capital to start streaming movies. During that time, they could

473
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,880
have easily said, oh, that seems like a pretty decent idea. Let's get in on that game right now.

474
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,360
Instead, it was denial. And again, I'm kind of assuming this book, just looking at the outcome.

475
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,000
I don't know the people that ran Blockbuster, but there was, had to be some level of denial

476
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,880
that some, oh, what are you going to do? You're going to stream movies? My internet barely works.

477
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,000
I can barely stream a one minute video. How are you going to stream? That doesn't make any sense.

478
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,960
We're going to keep doing what we're doing. People will keep coming to our stores. Come on a Friday

479
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,480
night. You see how crowded my store is? Where are all those people going to go? They love coming to

480
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,640
our store and buying some popcorn and getting a video. So there's arrogance there. And so that's

481
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,520
why you have to be humble as a leader so that your mind is open so you can listen to what other

482
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,880
people are saying. And you can make an honest assessment of whether it's right or not. You can

483
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,280
constantly look at yourself and say, you know what? Am I really right? Am I really right? I'm

484
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,560
constantly asking myself that. Am I really, okay, I feel pretty good about it, but I'm not a hundred

485
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,960
percent. There's a great book on this called, I'm going to screw this up. So the show notes will

486
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,280
definitely correct me. I think it's called Being Wrong. And I believe the author is Catherine

487
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,200
Schultz. So I could have gotten both of those wrong. That's the beauty of reading this book is

488
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:38,680
you, it teaches you something that I really needed to be taught. So I have a pretty good memory.

489
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,360
I would say my memory is better than average, at least when I'm paying attention. So I actually

490
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,360
have a bad memory with names and things at a party because I'm definitely not paying attention.

491
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,840
I don't have like sort of that Bill Clinton like memory of everybody's name, but for little details

492
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,560
and things that I deem important, a pretty accurate memory. This book goes into how often we are wrong

493
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:06,520
and wrong in times when we are convinced we are right. So I read this book and it's riveting. It's

494
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,440
sort of on the list of sort of 15, 20 books I've read that I can't freaking stop reading once I'm

495
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,800
into it. Like I'm on my bike in the garage. This is pre-audible, or at least I didn't use audible at

496
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,600
the time. I'm literally sweating over this book, flipping the pages, right? For me, that's a

497
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,840
to interrupt the workout to do that as a big deal. But it leaves me with this vulnerability, which is

498
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,440
what if Katherine Schultz is right? What if my memory is not as good as I think it is?

499
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:43,960
And I started just putting a tiny bit of humility into statements I was making. And I remember

500
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,040
having arguments too strong a word, but it spirited debate with a friend of mine about

501
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:54,120
something that occurred in the past and could be verified. And so we go into this discussion and

502
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,720
I've got my point of view, which is Peter the great is right, because I freaking remember

503
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,760
everything. And by the way, the friend that I'm debating is notoriously moronic at remembering

504
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,200
stuff. So like the pretest probability is so high that I'm correct. And I'm like, yeah, no, no,

505
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,480
it's exactly like this. Like this is exactly what happened. But then I remember, I'm like,

506
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,440
you know what? Remember that book you just read? And I go through all like the sort of thought

507
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,920
process that she brings to it and why we get tripped up and why we are so arrogant and blah,

508
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,040
and afterwards I'm like, I'm going to actually go check if I was right. And sure enough, I was

509
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:37,000
back. I mean, I couldn't have been more wrong, Jaco. I was 100% wrong. I mean, on the one hand,

510
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,320
it humbled me. On another hand, it scared me. It made me think how many times have you been so sure

511
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,160
of yourself in the last 40 years only to realize you were probably wrong. Yeah. When this really

512
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,640
occurred to me is when I started telling people this statement, it's kind of the opposite statement.

513
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,480
I would tell guys that I was teaching. I would say, listen, I don't know everything, but let me

514
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,200
tell you something. If I tell you something that I know and I tell you it's a hundred percent,

515
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,600
I'm going to guarantee that it's a hundred percent right. Like you're going to hear me say it so

516
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,720
seldomly, but like I'd have somebody that I was teaching something and they maybe would say, well,

517
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,120
you know, they'd have their opinion about something and 95% of the time, 99% of the time,

518
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,080
I'd say, you know what? Yeah, let's give that a try. Let's see if that tactic work. Let's see if

519
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:27,560
that functions. And then occasionally I'd say, listen, if I'm telling you that I know something

520
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,480
a hundred percent, you should listen to me because I don't play around with that statement and I

521
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,560
don't, you will very seldomly hear me say, I know something a hundred percent because it's so rare

522
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,360
that it actually happens. And my mind is open because what I think is just what I think right

523
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:50,120
now. And there's definitely other ways to come. So I definitely don't ever box myself into a corner

524
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,840
of saying I'm right and you're wrong or what I'm saying is a hundred percent right. Unless there

525
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:00,520
are some principles in the world or some tactical things that I know or some leadership things that

526
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,640
I know where I say, again, very few, but I'll say this is the truth right here. And there's very few

527
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,560
of them. Let's hear a couple of them. Even a specific example that might be contextually

528
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,880
sort of limited. Well, one of the fundamental truths of combat is cover and move. It's the

529
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,960
number one law of combat that I wrote about an extreme ownership and I talk about all the time,

530
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,240
but it's just the way it is. Meaning if you're taking fire, cover and move. Well, what it really

531
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,600
means is you and I have to work together. One of us has to put down cover fire and the other one

532
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,280
has to move. If we decide, guess what? You and I are just going to go for it together at the same

533
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,280
time and there's no cover fire. That's wrong. It's just wrong. And what's going to happen is we're

534
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,120
both going to die. So what we should do is if you want to get across the street, I'm going to get in

535
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,000
a good position. I'm going to lay down cover fire and then you're going to move while I'm shooting at

536
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,400
the bad guys and they can't shoot back. Or you're going to put down cover fire and I'm going to move.

537
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,560
But if someone says to me, well, what we're going to do is we're just going to run for it. Now,

538
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,160
are there situations where it's like, okay, if you said to me, hey, you know what? We're both going

539
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,480
to go and we're both going to shoot at the same time. I'd be like, so you're going to cover for

540
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,400
yourselves kind of fits in there. Okay. We can try it. There are situations where you may have to do

541
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,360
that, but that's not the rule we want to follow. It's different when you say just because you get

542
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,640
away with something doesn't mean it was the right thing to do. That's true too, which is an example.

543
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,040
Right? So you almost would assert that that's almost an axiom, right? Like we reserve that

544
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,920
term for something that on first principles is immutable or dogmatic, right? So, you know,

545
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,080
in biology, there aren't many things that we are so confident in that we say that about, but one of

546
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:35,320
them is that DNA codes for RNA codes for protein that has just become an axiom of biology. There

547
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,760
aren't really ways around that. And of course, on the margins you sort of talk about like, is a

548
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,120
pre-on sort of an exception to that and maybe blah, blah, blah. But yeah, this is as close to axiomatic

549
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,840
as you can get in biology or in your case. Now, was that something that came naturally to you to

550
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,560
have that humility? Because it doesn't come naturally to me. Like I think arrogance and

551
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:03,000
grandiosity are my natural default States. So I have to work staggeringly hard to pause in my

552
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,800
tracks and consider the world through another person's lens. Yeah. So you go into combat and

553
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,960
you'll get humbled by it. I mean, now this doesn't always work because there's sometimes where like

554
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,720
my first deployment to Iraq have felt pretty good about it. It felt like kind of badass, like, hey,

555
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,120
we can handle this second deployment to Iraq to Ramadi. Very humbling. Cause there's going to be

556
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,960
situations where as good as you might think you are, you're not going to be able to control it and

557
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,640
things are going to go wrong and it's going to be a nightmare. And you're going to be holding,

558
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,800
it's like trying to hold on the water, right? You're trying to hold on to the situation and

559
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,320
it's going to humble you. But I still think that says just as much about you as it does the

560
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,000
situation because I think there are a lot of people in that situation, Drago, that are going

561
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
to blame their surroundings. They're not going to be humbled by that. When everything goes wrong,

562
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,040
they're going to say it's because of this, it's because of that. It's because of him,

563
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,920
it's because of her, it's because of the insurgence. So I still think you're pre-wired

564
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,800
and pre-conditioned to be able to fail and say, okay, that's humbling. I think that's an admirable

565
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,880
trait. I'm trying to understand if it came, did you come out of the womb with that?

566
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:08,520
I think I saw great examples of that along the way and realized how if you want to do well,

567
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,800
then that's the attitude that's going to happen. And I had a boss that I worked for who was the

568
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,680
most experienced guy that I ever worked for. He was the most tactically savvy guy I'd ever worked

569
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:25,560
for. He was the most experienced guy I had ever worked for. And he was the most humble guy I ever

570
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,600
worked for. And all of us in the platoon, he was our platoon commander, all of us in the platoon,

571
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,040
we wanted nothing more, nothing more than to make that guy look good, to not let him down.

572
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:43,240
And I felt that I was a young SEAL. I was 21 or 22 years old. And here's this guy who has all this

573
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:52,120
experience, combat experience in the 90s, which not many people had. And we, me, the rest of the guys,

574
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,960
we just wanted to make this guy look good. And we didn't want to let him down. And it was because he

575
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,120
was so humble. That was like the initial opening for my life of thinking to myself, why do I want

576
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,200
to follow that guy? And it was a very interesting situation because we had a mutiny against the

577
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,160
previous platoon commander. So there was a mutiny. Us young enlisted guys went before our command

578
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,640
officer and said, we don't want to work for this guy. How many times does that work? It doesn't. I

579
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,320
mean, that's a mutiny. You know what the punishment for mutiny is? Death. It's death. Yeah. That's

580
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:29,080
treason basically, right? So we had a mutiny in a SEAL platoon in 1990, whatever. And the guy that

581
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:36,200
we were mutinists against, he was not humble. And I got to see this, this incredible contrast between

582
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,640
these two guys, one who was extremely arrogant and inexperienced and arrogant, which is a horrible

583
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,400
combination. The other guy who was extremely experienced and super humble. And the contrast

584
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,720
between those two guys painted a very clear picture in my mind as a young guy. Okay. What was

585
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:56,040
the difference between these two guys? Why did we all hate this other guy? And why do we all love

586
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,240
this one? Well, here's the big difference. This guy thought he knew everything and acted like it.

587
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:09,000
And this guy knew everything and acted like a humble guy that wanted to listen to us and left

588
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,560
the biggest imprint on my mind. And that's why humility has always been so important. Now,

589
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,240
I told you to remind me about when is humility not important. And I talk about this now, and there

590
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,880
is, there's a dichotomy and all these things. That's why I wrote the dichotomy leadership is

591
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,400
because there's a dichotomy in can people be too humble? Yes, absolutely they can. And I went and

592
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,000
talked to some underprivileged kids up in LA, a pretty unique group of underprivileged kids who

593
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,480
kind of had, let's say some kind of potential that they were smart kids that had, and they were young

594
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,680
too between the ages of, I'd say eight and 13, something like that. And they've been kind of

595
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,760
selected as kids that had some potential, even though they were in these underprivileged situations.

596
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,320
The reason I say that is because when I went into this room, and I was going to talk to them about

597
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,440
what I've learned, and one of the big things I was going to tell them is that you got to be humble.

598
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,160
And I'm looking around this room. And every one of these kids in this room, just about every one of

599
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,320
them was shoulders folded forward, eyes towards the ground, heads hung low. So they were already

600
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,840
broken. They were already broken. You know, they were beat because you know, you can go to the

601
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,560
city, you can go to the inner city, and you can meet kids that are not humble at all. They're

602
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,280
arrogant. They're super hyper confident. They're overconfident. That's why I had to make this

603
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,960
distinction. These weren't those kids. So this was another example, by the way, tying it back,

604
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,280
you made a tactical decision on the front line in real time, you went in there with a plan.

605
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,520
But you understood the strategy. What are you trying to do? You're not here to give a talk.

606
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,760
That's a tactic. Yep. And the immediate change was I talked to him about confidence. I didn't

607
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:35,880
talk to him about humility. I said, Hey, you put your shoulders back a little bit. Sit up,

608
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,800
look at me. Well, you want to ask me a question? Stand up. And then the question comes like, well,

609
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:45,080
sir, no, hey, talk to me louder. That's what you got to do, right? You got to instill that

610
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,160
confidence in these kids. So there's a balance with all these dichotomies. And can you be too

611
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,200
humble? Yes, you absolutely can. Can you be too humble as a leader? Yes, you absolutely can. You

612
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,200
can be too humble where Peter, you come in and you're barking about something and I go, well,

613
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,800
Peter's probably right. And I'm just gonna go with it. Well, no, if I disagree with you,

614
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,680
I need to say, Hey, Peter, can you explain to me why you want to do it that way? Because I'm not

615
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,360
really seeing it. That's not me being arrogant. Yeah, that's not confrontational. It's very

616
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:12,040
confident in your opposition. Exactly. And so there are times where people are too humble.

617
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,040
Again, that's why we wrote the dichotomy of leadership, because every trait that a human

618
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,840
being can have can be negative and positive. You can take something too far. Any of them,

619
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,160
what's the most positive quality you can think of a leader to have? Poise. Okay, poise. Can you be

620
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:31,640
a person that gets so poised and is so elevated above the situation that people are looking at

621
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,120
you going, Hey, wait a second. This guy's not even absolutely connected to what we're doing. He's a

622
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,880
robot. We're down here gritting it out. And Peter's up there, no sweat on his face. And he looks like

623
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,920
he doesn't even or even just a more extreme example is not showing emotion is generally a good thing.

624
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,120
But sometimes it's people need to know that you hurt that the leader is also devastated by this

625
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,640
finding. When you even look at presidents, I mean, some of the most powerful moments are when

626
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,760
presidents show their emotions, which again, not with them in the current one, it's generally quite

627
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,440
rare to see a president's emotions. Yeah, no, it is. And when you do think about George W. Bush

628
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:12,760
standing at the base of the Twin Towers, think about Barack Obama after I think it was the one

629
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,040
of the school shootings. I mean, these are very powerful moments. And it doesn't matter if you

630
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,080
agree with the politics, by the way, it doesn't matter if you agree with what's going on and what

631
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,320
the implications are. Oh, is this about gun control? Oh, no, no, it's not about that in the

632
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,680
moment. It's that person's a human. Yeah, that's another great example. We talk about this in the

633
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,040
dichotomy of leadership. It's like, yeah, if you have no emotions, you're a robot and people don't

634
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,360
follow robots. You won't have any connection with them. So having control over your emotions is one

635
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,640
thing. But not having any emotions at all is not going to make you into a good leader. It's just

636
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,520
not the story you told a second ago, I think it's almost going to have to become the litmus test for

637
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,720
great leadership because to hear you tell it made me think about the person that I most thought of

638
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,440
in that way, which actually I spoke about. I spoke about this guy on your podcast like four years ago.

639
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:04,040
His name is Chris Sonenday. He was the best senior resident I ever had when I was in surgery. And

640
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,480
it's exactly that thing, which is when you have a senior resident that you were in service of,

641
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,160
all you wanted to do was make sure, one, you never let them down. Like you never wanted them to ask

642
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,240
you a question and you didn't know the answer or you hadn't done what they asked you to do.

643
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,560
But it goes beyond that. And that's the point that you made. They are the interface between

644
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,680
the person, the attending, the higher up. And all you wanted, everything you did was through the

645
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:34,760
lens of will this make Chris look better? Will this make Chris shine more in the eyes of the

646
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,840
attending? And that's a rare, rare benchmark. But it's interesting. It's exactly what you describe.

647
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,680
I'm sure you also worked for guys that were arrogant jerks that thought they knew everything

648
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,240
and you most people were in between, but there were more extremes at the other end, you take the

649
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,000
extremes at the other end. And now you're actually hoping that they fail. You're hoping that things

650
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,360
fall apart on them. You're praying for it, which is a disaster. When you think about it, it's the

651
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,240
worst morale imaginable. It's a total disaster. And this is why I always answer that question with

652
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:07,240
humility being the most important characteristic for a leader to have. Because in most situations,

653
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,680
the reason that the leader ended up in the position is because they have some level of confidence

654
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,560
already. So it's not normal for a leader to end up in a leadership position, but they lack confidence

655
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,280
and they're overly humble. That's not normal. It does happen occasionally, but it's not normal.

656
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,280
The normal case is you've got someone that's an alpha, you've got someone that's fought their way

657
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,320
to get up through the ranks, you've got someone that was confident enough to be like, Hey, I'll

658
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,000
take control of this. Hey, I'll run this people elevate to that position because they're confident.

659
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,400
And that's why it tends to be the greater percentage of the time there's a problem with

660
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,240
humility. It's because they lack humility, not because they have too much humility. Occasionally,

661
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,240
you get a tech company with a startup where you had some really humble guy that kind of figured

662
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,760
something out and he started a little company and all of a sudden he's the CEO and he totally lacks

663
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,600
confidence and he's overly humble. He doesn't think he can make any good decisions. That's a different

664
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:56,680
situation. That's a more rare situation. The more common situation is I'm at the top because I

665
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,760
deserve to be, I made it here. And that's why everyone should listen to me. And that's why I'm

666
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,800
not going to listen to anyone else. And the minute you're in that situation, you're going in the wrong

667
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,640
direction. It needs to get balanced out. So let's back up for a minute. You finished high school in

668
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:13,160
90, 91, 89, 89. What did you do right after high school? We're in the Navy. You went straight in.

669
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,880
And talk to me about that decision. It's 89, right? So the cold war is over. This is like the most

670
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,880
peaceful time in the world. People are thinking the most peaceful time in the world, except for

671
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,600
what happened in Panama. So there was the invasion in Panama. Four seals were killed on

672
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:36,280
Patia airfield. Oh, I thought that was 1990. No. And it was like December of 1989. And I saw that

673
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:44,280
and I couldn't believe that a war happened. In my mind, that was just a war that a war happened.

674
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,040
And I wasn't in it and went and talked to the Navy recruiter and rock and roll.

675
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,160
Did you talk to your parents about it?

676
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,480
I told them afterwards. What did they say?

677
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,520
My dad said, you're not going to like the Navy because you don't like listening to other people

678
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,680
and you hate authority. So my dad said, what'd your mom say? She was happy. I had some kind of

679
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,720
a job prospect. You wrestled in high school? No. What sports did you play in high school?

680
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,680
Soccer and basketball.

681
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,960
When you were in junior year, were you thinking college? Like what was going through your mind?

682
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:18,360
My mom sent me something 10 years ago that was like sixth grade, something like that. What do

683
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:24,360
you want to do when you grow up? And I put Marine Corps. Wow. Yeah.

684
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,640
I think remember you telling me once you weighed like a buck 60 in high school, right?

685
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,840
Yeah, probably maybe.

686
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,440
You were not a walking wall.

687
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,240
No. When I checked into SEAL training, I was 174 pounds. And then I gained 10 pounds in SEAL

688
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,280
training, 11 pounds because I graduated at 185.

689
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,160
You had already gone to the recruiter before you finished high school or?

690
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,480
Yeah.

691
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,920
Okay. So then you come out of high school and now it's what, 90 and they ship you off where you come

692
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,560
to San Diego?

693
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,240
No, went to Orlando, Florida.

694
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,480
Okay. And tell me what you do. What's the first week like away from home?

695
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,160
Went to bootcamp. And the coolest thing about going to Navy bootcamp for me was it was a clean slate.

696
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,600
Nothing else mattered. They don't care what your high school, they don't care what your grades were.

697
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,800
They don't care what sports you play. They didn't care how good you were at any sport.

698
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,360
They didn't care about anything. What they did care about is could you do what we're telling you to do?

699
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,560
And did you pick the Navy because of the SEALs in 89?

700
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:21,640
Yes. Yep. Yep. I liked the water and I wanted to get out of New England. I look back now and I

701
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,560
love New England and I got my company up in Maine and it's awesome to go back up there. But as a kid,

702
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,920
the small town thing wasn't for me. I wanted to get out of there. I wanted to literally see the

703
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:38,200
world as they say. And so the SEAL teams are Virginia Beach and San Diego. And I grew up

704
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,200
surfing in Maine. And so I knew that San Diego and Southern California had epic surfing. And I said

705
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,400
to myself, well, if I'm going to go in to be a commando, let's work in the water and get stationed

706
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:58,040
in San Diego, California. That to me, it's hard to comprehend this, I guess, but it'd be like right

707
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,600
now saying, hey, I'm going to go and live on Mars. That's how foreign it was to me to think

708
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:09,720
that to myself that I had a pathway where I could actually go out and live in California. I was

709
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,600
amazed that that opportunity was there. And so that was definitely a big reason, a big reason to

710
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,200
pick the SEAL teams. And I heard that the SEAL teams had the hardest training and I wanted the

711
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:29,000
hardest training. I also heard that SEALs had a 50% casualty rate, which is probably drawn from

712
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,280
the fact that in the D-Day invasion, the NCDU is the Navy combat demolition units. They did have

713
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:44,120
a 50% precursor. The SEALs have been around since like 1970 or 1963. Yeah. Well, 62 63. So those

714
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:50,920
guys did suffer a 50% casualty, but you know, whatever pre-internet knowledge I had heard

715
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,200
through the rumor mill was, hey, if you're in the SEAL teams, you got a 50% chance that you're going

716
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,280
to die. So why did that appeal to you when you were 18? I wanted to fight. I wanted to fight or

717
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,000
I wanted to die. I wanted to fight, wanted to fight wars. Yeah. Didn't want to die. No, but I wanted

718
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,120
to fight war. And plus when you're young, you don't think it's going to be you. You're not the one

719
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,320
that's going to die. I see. So it was, this is the highest stakes thing that I can do. Yes, bring it,

720
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,640
bring it. And you're fired up for that. And again, you know, it's always important to remember that

721
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,840
you don't think it's going to happen to you. You think that you're, I think you and I have talked

722
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:23,080
about this before. Like I think if I'm on an airplane on a civilian aircraft, commercial

723
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,800
aircraft, and it blows up in the sky, I think that I'm going to be the guy that you might be able to

724
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,240
do a somersault. No, I think I'm going to live. I'm going to come down. I'm going to get in a

725
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,160
freefall position. I'm going to track to a pool and I'm going to land in a pool and I'm going to

726
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,120
break my leg and it's going to be cool. That's what my mentality is. So that's ignorant and

727
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,600
stupid and fine. But you could also argue that that's necessary. Yeah, I guess so. But here's

728
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,560
the reality. When you're a kid, you think that it's not really going to happen to you. And I guess

729
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,600
if you did think it was going to happen to you and you were afraid of it, well, then that would be a

730
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:57,560
problem, right? But you have to at some point, you're like, okay, you know what? If I die, then

731
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,600
I'm dead and this is what I'm going to do with my life and you're over it. I'm not afraid of that.

732
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:07,480
I'm still not afraid of it. I could die. Okay. In the battle of Ramadi, the guys were facing and

733
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,360
it's like, if you go out, there's a good chance you're going to die. There's at least a decent

734
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,280
chance. Maybe it's not a good chance. There's a chance you're going to die. We're going to

735
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,920
memorial services almost all the time for the soldiers and Marines that were out there

736
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:26,120
fighting. And so that's a reality is guess what? You can die and you can't, in my opinion, if

737
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,600
you're afraid of that, you're going to have a real hard time. You're going to have a real hard time

738
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:36,200
doing your job. Do you think that changes once you have kids? I know it changes once you have kids

739
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,600
and it doesn't change in the way that you think it might. When I had kids, I was like, okay, cool.

740
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,480
Well, at least now if I die, I got kids. I wasn't like, oh, now I want to stay alive more. I thought

741
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:54,440
to myself, okay, I have kids. They'll carry on my genetic pool and that's cool. And do I wish I could

742
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:01,480
see them? Yes, but they'll know that I did my job and did what I was supposed to do and did what I

743
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,960
wanted to do. I loved my job. Best job in the world. Best job in the world. When did you meet

744
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,800
your wife in this process? I want to come back and go through this story in some detail, but I met

745
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:16,840
my wife in 1994. And did that because you could argue, well, your wife is not your lineage, right?

746
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:23,160
She's your partner. Did that change anything in your mind about the willingness to survive?

747
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,600
Like I wanted to survive more. Yeah. Did that change? I mean, not that you didn't want to

748
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:32,280
survive prior to that, but did it introduce an element of not wanting to die more? No,

749
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,880
not really. Going back to something you said a second ago, did you ever see the movie Taking

750
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,800
Chance? Do you know the one I'm talking about with Kevin Bacon in it? No. It's a very interesting

751
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,040
movie. It's a very touching story and I believe it's a true story. And if not, it's based on a

752
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:52,600
true story. It's an entire movie about what is involved to bring a Marine home after he died.

753
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,640
So the name of the Marine in this movie, I believe, his last name was Chance.

754
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,760
Last name was Chance. Now I do remember. I remember hearing about it, but I haven't seen it.

755
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,720
I saw it many years ago, like when it came out, which is 060708 or something like that. And then

756
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,840
I saw it again recently a year ago and it was just as moving. And I can't imagine what it would

757
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:16,840
be like for you to see that having seen, my guess is you've seen each piece of it along the way.

758
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,120
Yeah, it's a very powerful movie. It's slow. It's not like this is not high drama, right? This is

759
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:30,120
just the drama is the silence. The drama are the pauses. The drama is the humble realization of

760
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:36,760
how many times that happened. Yeah, I was going to say if it came out in 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008,

761
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:43,560
I mean, there was that was just incredible amount of guys were getting killed. And you're right. And

762
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:48,840
every single one of those guys is an absolute tragedy. Every one of those guys has a family,

763
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:55,720
has a wife, has a mom, has a dad, has brothers and sisters, has dreams, has goals in their life,

764
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:04,440
has things that they want to do, has inherent ideas and knowledge and thoughts and wisdom

765
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,200
that is completely and utterly unique to them. And we never get to see that. We never get to see

766
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:17,960
what would have manifested from these kids. And it's, it's awful. What was the hardest loss you

767
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:24,280
ever saw there personally, meaning the person that died, you knew them and you couldn't distance

768
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:30,040
yourself from it emotionally. Well, my guys, any one of your guys. Yeah. Yeah. So how do you do

769
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:35,800
that? I don't understand that for most of us in civilian life. When we do encounter that you lose

770
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:41,400
a parent, you lose a child. I mean, you think of the worst things that you can imagine. You get to,

771
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,120
if you choose to completely retreat, like you don't have to go out and do something

772
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,840
in that next moment. Whereas that's quite different from what you're doing. You don't

773
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,600
have that luxury of saying, I'm going to spend the next three months in therapy dealing with this.

774
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,840
No, as a matter of fact, you're saying, Hey, in 48 hours, we're going to go back and put our gear

775
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:03,960
on and lock and load and go do what we're supposed to do. That's what you're saying. And lately I've

776
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:10,200
been talking a bit about the fact that as Americans, we've taken all these different cultures and we've

777
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,160
kind of compiled them all together. And in doing that, we've lost normal protocols that other

778
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:21,240
cultures have. And one of the protocols that we've kind of lost and mixed up or mismatched

779
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,320
is what's the protocol for death? In other religions or specific religions or in other

780
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:32,200
cultures, it's like, okay, this person died. Okay, here's the ceremony that we do now. Here's the

781
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,240
next thing we do down the line. After that, we're going to have this party, then we're going to get

782
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,200
together. Then we're going to say these things, then we're going to use these words and we're

783
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,640
going to make these motions. Then we're going to do the final thing. And then everyone's going to go

784
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,840
back to, you know, everyone's going to move on because that's what we know. That's how it works.

785
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,960
And in America, we've put so many of these things together and we've combined them and separated

786
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:55,800
them and lost pieces that there's no real immediate, hey, here's the protocol. Because when bad things

787
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,880
happen, you need to follow a protocol, right? You need to have a protocol in place. You should have

788
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,720
a protocol in place, right? When your house burns down, your kids have a protocol of where they're

789
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,640
going to go. You have a protocol of what you're going to do and boom, that's what happens. If

790
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,640
there's an accident, right? We work with all kinds of different businesses, but we work with

791
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:16,600
businesses or companies that are run a fairly high risk of having something bad happen. You go on a

792
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,720
big construction site, people get hurt. You got to have a protocol for that. This is what we're

793
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,360
going to do. Not just what we're going to do on the job site, but what we're going to do with the

794
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:27,400
family, how we're going to follow that stuff up. So you've got to have protocols in place. And for

795
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:36,440
us, we don't really have these both psychological, spiritual protocols. Now, again, there's some

796
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,920
religions that people follow in America, which like, oh yeah, this is the protocol. But even

797
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,640
those people have been, I don't want to use the word polluted, but your protocol has been polluted.

798
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:50,200
If you're a Catholic or Protestant or you're a Muslim, your ideas have been mixed in with some

799
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,600
other ideas along the way. And maybe it's been taken that protocol a little bit out of your,

800
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,800
what it was. And now it's not a hundred percent and you're not a hundred percent about it. And

801
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,440
you don't really know how to follow it. Cause you've never followed it before and no one else you

802
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:06,840
know has. So what are we going to do? What are we going to do? So that's a big problem. So when we

803
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:13,640
went to Ramadi, we didn't have any protocol. We didn't really even think about the fact,

804
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:18,440
like, what do you do from an operational perspective? You get 16 guys in a platoon and one of them gets

805
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:23,000
killed. That's one 16th. That's one specialty inside of a platoon. What do you mean you didn't

806
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,840
have a protocol? Meaning outside of the immediate tactics of a person's deceased and the body has

807
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:33,080
to go here and then there's a whole team that takes over. You're saying you didn't have a plan

808
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:37,480
for how you would all deal with that. Yes. To the point of you had never discussed it. No,

809
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,640
Nope. The 16 of you are going into the most dangerous. Yeah. And actually,

810
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:46,600
so we're talking to seal platoons. We've got 40 guys. Did we talk about it? Sure. Just so you know,

811
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:51,560
the military has what's called a Keiko procedure that you followed as a book. You open up and we

812
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,400
had a book that we opened up. What does Keiko mean or stand for? Casualty care officer or something

813
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,720
like that. Okay. And so there's a book that you follow as a manual. So yeah, the protocol did

814
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,600
exist. The protocol, the outward protocol of like, Hey, this is what you're going to do.

815
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,280
This is how the whole seal team of whatever, 200 guys and plus the support people, that's

816
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,160
800 guys. This is what's going to happen. Okay, cool. Everyone follows that protocol a little bit.

817
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,440
What happens in the platoon and what happens with your head? What happens with the guy that

818
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,240
just lost his best friend? What's the protocol for that? The answer is we don't have one.

819
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:29,560
And so then what do you do? And I'll tell you what I did. I tried to create one. I said, okay,

820
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:38,280
guys, this is what we're going to do. And my basic protocol was, was to do what I knew how to do.

821
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:43,400
And this may be wrong. I may be wrong. My protocol was to do what I know how to do is I know how to

822
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:49,320
work. That's what I know how to do. And I know that letting your mind be idle, letting your

823
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:54,680
mind sit there and think about what just happened to me, that's not a good protocol. The protocol

824
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,440
is here's what we're going to do. We're not going to do anything tonight. We're going to do a service

825
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:03,240
tomorrow. And the day after that, we're going to say goodbye. And then guess what we're going to do?

826
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,040
We're going to get on our gear. We're going to lock a note and weapons and we're going to go

827
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:12,040
back to work because that's what our brothers would want us to do in this situation. So, you know,

828
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:16,360
Mark Lee was the first seal killed in Iraq. The first seal killed in Iraq. Mikey Munsell was the

829
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,280
second seal killed in Iraq. When you're surprised that we hadn't talked about that, who's going to

830
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:25,560
kill us? We've been fighting here for three years. We're good. It's like maybe not. So,

831
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:32,920
we ended up losing Ryan Job as well. But each time it's like, okay, here's what we need to figure

832
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:38,040
out. And you know, I've been discussing now on my podcast, writing a book about protocols,

833
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:43,880
because here's another protocol that people don't have is you just got dumped. You're 21 years old.

834
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:49,640
You're 18 years old. You're 23 years old. You've been with the same girl or with the same guy for

835
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:56,200
six years, three years, two years. They're the love of your life. They dump you. And guys don't have a

836
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,400
protocol for that. What do you do? So, guess what? If you have a protocol to follow, you open up the

837
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,240
book, you figure out what the protocol is and you execute the protocol. There's all kinds of things.

838
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,560
Sick disease. What's your protocol when you get fired? If you don't have a protocol, what do you do?

839
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:16,040
What do you do? And the answer is you follow the protocol. So, I will likely be writing a book of

840
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:20,680
protocols so that people know what to do when things happen. By the way, you need a protocol

841
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:25,720
for good things too, right? What's the protocol for? You just got married. That's a great thing,

842
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,400
right? That could be a great thing. It can also be a disaster if you don't have a good protocol to

843
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,400
follow once you're married. You bought a new house. What's your protocol? What's your protocol? What

844
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:38,200
do we do now? We got this house. What do we do? How do we handle that going forward? So, there's

845
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:43,400
all kinds of things that we need protocols for and we don't have them and it's not like it's that

846
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:50,280
complex. It's not like I would need to do a year worth of research to figure out what the protocol

847
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:55,000
is when your girlfriend of two years dumps you. This is not a hard problem to figure out but when

848
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,280
you have no idea what to do, it's a real problem and I think I heard this recently and you could

849
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,400
probably confirm this but when people kill themselves, they kill themselves because they

850
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:10,520
got dumped. One of the biggest reasons is they lost their significant other and I talked about

851
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,960
this on my podcast as well. I was going through buds, going through basic skill training and I

852
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:23,880
talked to my mom and my best friend who is my best friend from like first grade through seventh

853
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:30,040
grade. He ended up going down the wrong path and he ended up killing himself and my mom said,

854
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:36,680
hey, this kid Jeff, he killed himself and why did he do it in a relationship? He's young and

855
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,040
he doesn't have a protocol to follow. You don't have a protocol to follow, what do you do? I think

856
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,240
the point on suicide that's really tragic, so I don't want to quote stats because I just don't

857
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,600
know them but directionally, oftentimes when someone kills themselves, it's due to an acute

858
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,680
issue. Oh, for sure. In other words, oh, I get you. Yeah, when you reflect on that for a moment,

859
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:02,120
it's very upsetting because yeah, the example could be I just lost my job and the shame of

860
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:08,200
not being able to do X, Y, and Z or I just got dumped or I'm in an acute phase of depression,

861
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:14,440
very acute. This isn't like I've been sitting in my room for three years with a razor blade

862
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:20,120
just grazing over my wrist and then I finally work up the nerve to do it. No, that's far less likely

863
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:26,360
and far less often the scenario. Actually, what you're saying makes a ton of sense because

864
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:33,080
I would argue that where protocols are most important are in acute moments and that's why

865
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:38,200
you want a protocol. Yes, so you don't have to think about what to do because another thing

866
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,520
that's good is when you have problems, when you're caught up in something psychologically,

867
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,240
one of the best things you can do is do something, take some kind of action that moves you forward.

868
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,400
What you don't want to do is stay stagnant and dwell on what's happening. You want to say, okay,

869
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,760
this horrible thing happened. Let me get out the book and follow the protocol because that's going

870
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,400
to move me in some direction and it's going to start to get me to the point where I can

871
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,400
move past this. Whereas staying here stagnant, it's not a good protocol.

872
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,240
I was just about to say, this is going to be a long book, my friend, and you are prolific.

873
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:13,160
I mean, your discipline, maybe a couple of times ago when we were playing Patty Cakes,

874
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,560
I was just blown away at the discipline with your writing because writing is hard. There's just no

875
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,480
way to put it. I can't say this in any easier way. It's the hardest thing I've ever tried to do.

876
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,360
I'm constantly amazed at the quality of stuff that you can put out whilst doing so many other

877
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:35,000
things. It's hard enough to write if you're a writer. If your job is writing, all you have to

878
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
do is write. That's hard. That would be a luxury. It's a luxury, but it's still hard.

879
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:44,680
But if writing is your night weekend job, which that's what it is for you, that's what it is for

880
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:49,160
many people that we know that's what it's becoming for me, it's really difficult. This will be a

881
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:56,200
long book. There's a lot here. There is, but I'm actually looking at it right now as a pretty,

882
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,440
keeping it pretty narrow, keeping it on the big things.

883
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:03,080
10 scenarios kind of thing. Maybe 20. Also, this is interesting. There's protocols

884
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,280
for what to do when you don't know what to do. Right? There's protocols.

885
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,240
That's the protocol.

886
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:13,400
The reason that I know this is because, again, when I was running SEAL training,

887
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,440
I couldn't put a guy in every scenario that they were going to be in, just like we already talked

888
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,440
about. I couldn't put you in every scenario that you're going to see. There's going to be some

889
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,000
scenarios that you can't predict and I can't predict.

890
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,840
This is the strategy protocol. The protocol for what to do when you don't know what to do,

891
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:35,000
it's come back to the strategy and the objective. It is. So tactically, what do you do if you don't

892
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,200
know what to do? Part of it is definitely going back to the strategy, but tactically, what does

893
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,760
that mean? What do you do? Okay, so we're getting shot at, we're in this situation. What do I need

894
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,960
to do? Here's the protocol that you follow. And there is a protocol you can follow there. Like,

895
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,520
take a step back, look around, make sure you assess everything that's happening.

896
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,680
Think about what your possibilities are. What decisions could you make right now? And what

897
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:59,800
would the general outcomes of those decisions be? If you can follow that and then say, okay,

898
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,760
take an iterative step towards what you think is the best decision. Not a giant step because you

899
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,600
don't even know what's going on. Yeah, maybe even a reversible step. Yeah, I guess that's what I mean

900
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,760
by an iterative, a smaller iterative step. That's not a full commitment because you're not ready to

901
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,160
commit because you don't even know what's happening. But we think it's this direction. So that's what

902
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,440
I'm going to do. It's a very simple protocol. I'm going to take a step back. I'm going to assess

903
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,520
everything that I see. I'm going to think about what my possible maneuvers that I can make are

904
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,200
going to think about the outcomes that I'm going to take a small, what you call it a hesitant step.

905
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:33,240
Yeah, just a non committed. Yeah, a non committed step that I can somewhat move in the right

906
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,320
direction. That right there, if you know, that's the protocol when you don't know what's happening.

907
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,640
That's a great protocol. That's a fantastic protocol. And that's going to cover a lot of bases.

908
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:46,440
Because guess what? Even though we write to cover 20 scenarios or 20 protocols of bad things that

909
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,040
can happen, good things can happen. It's not going to cover them all. There's going to be things that

910
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,720
you don't expect. There's sort of a parallel here between what you're describing and what Jordan

911
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,520
Peterson has written about in 12 rules. And I don't know Jordan, but I know you know him pretty well.

912
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:04,120
Have you guys talked about this? Because just listening to this, I see this, this significant

913
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:09,960
parallel. We haven't talked about this specific thing because I've only truly started talking

914
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:15,400
about it in the last six months. You know, it came up on my podcast and it actually came up on the

915
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:20,840
podcast. I had discussed it before in terms of people dying, right? I've discussed that before.

916
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,920
And then basically there's two podcasts that I did where I covered two protocols. One of them

917
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,400
was someone died. A father had written in and said, my wife and I lost our kid.

918
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,960
I don't know what to do. And when someone asks you that question,

919
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:45,160
the sad thing is, is I actually do know what to do because I've dealt with it a lot. And I know

920
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:49,720
what I've done. I know what I figured out to do. I didn't know it at first, but I figured it out

921
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:54,760
over time. Like this is what you actually do. Here's the protocol that I'm recommending to you.

922
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:02,120
Do these things, do these things. And that's going to get you. And the other thing I gave them was

923
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:06,760
an understanding of what you're going to feel because what's going to happen is you're going

924
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:11,160
to get hit with a tidal wave that you are going to think is going to consume you forever. That's

925
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,280
what it's going to feel like. And what you don't realize, especially when you first get hit with a

926
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,080
tidal wave is that tidal wave is going to eventually subside a little bit, a little bit.

927
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,800
And what happens is people feel guilty about that because they say all of a sudden, oh, wait,

928
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:29,080
for a split second. I wasn't thinking about this person that I lost. I'm a bad person. It's like,

929
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:34,600
no, that's actually, you're not a bad person. You're starting to move, right? And

930
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,320
that's okay. And eventually these waves of pain, the period of these waves is going to separate

931
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:46,440
more and more and the strength of the waves is going to subside. The other thing that's scary

932
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:51,720
about it is when you lose someone and you have that kind of heavy sorrow, sometimes for the first

933
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:56,920
time in your life, you can't control your sorrow. Like you'll be sitting there and you'll look at

934
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,560
something and it'll remind you of someone and you'll start crying. You'll break down and you can't

935
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,360
control it, which is scary for people. It's very scary to have that happen. And they think this is

936
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,440
the way it's going to be from now on. And what I tried to explain to people is like, no, that's not

937
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,240
what it's going to be like from now on. This is what it's like right now, but those waves of sorrow

938
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:21,400
are going to diminish over time. And that's not bad. That's not bad. It's good, actually. It's good.

939
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,640
And you should look when the sorrow diminishes, when the wave is a little bit weaker, you should

940
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,240
be like, okay, cool. I'm starting to process this. I'm starting to get through it. I'm starting to

941
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:35,080
accept the situation I'm in. And then the final thing that I told this particular individual was

942
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,920
like, okay, when you get to a point, then what you do is you're going to write a letter to your child

943
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,400
and you're going to explain to them how much they meant to you, how much you love them, how much you

944
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:52,600
cherish the time you were together and how you are going to move forward. And you're going to live a

945
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,440
beautiful life and you're never going to stop thinking about them, but you're going to move.

946
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:01,240
You're going to do incredible things with your life to honor them. And then you're going to take

947
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,520
that to where they're buried and you're going to give it to them. You're going to read it to them.

948
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:09,320
And then you're going to walk away. You're going to move on because you have to, because otherwise,

949
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:16,680
what are you doing? You're burdening. You're burdening this soul with your own sorrow.

950
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,920
You're ruining your life on account of them. They don't want that. They don't want that.

951
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,680
They don't want that. They want you to move on. They want you to be happy.

952
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:32,440
So go and move on and be happy. So that was one protocol. And the other protocol was like, okay,

953
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:36,360
when you break up with someone, what are you going to do? And if you have a good protocol to follow

954
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:40,040
and you have a good way to think about that, then it's going to be very positive for you.

955
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,560
I think the big connection I made there is explaining to people that when someone dumps you,

956
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:48,600
the main thing you have to consider to get through that is when you get dumped,

957
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:54,680
you have to recognize that the person that dumped you is not the person that you thought they were.

958
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:01,960
So if my girlfriend dumps me, I have her in this elevated position. She's a freaking angel,

959
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:07,960
right? She's an angel, but she dumped me. She's not an angel. The person that dumped me,

960
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,600
the person that I miss, the person that I thought I was going to spend with,

961
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,520
that person doesn't exist. It's not that person for sure. Because that person wouldn't have dumped

962
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,520
you. So you have to get through that part. And there's a bunch of other things to do from a

963
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,880
protocol perspective when you get dumped. But I think that's the key fact, the key fact,

964
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:27,880
you have to recognize that the person that you thought was your everything doesn't exist.

965
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:32,920
That's a hard reality to face, but it's a better reality than the person that I was my forever

966
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,480
person doesn't want me forever. Well, that's a worse reality to face. And it's also not the reality.

967
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,400
And there's probably even another side to that going back to what you said earlier, which is

968
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:47,320
we could also take the view of I'm probably not completely without fault here. There's almost

969
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:52,200
inevitably something I can learn about this that I can do better next time.

970
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:57,320
Yeah, for sure. There's no doubt about it. And I think that's something to consider more when

971
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:01,000
you're in the relationship, when you're in the relationship and things are not going the way you

972
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,360
want them to, most likely you're doing something wrong. Now I can tell you right now, a good

973
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:12,200
relationship will have challenges, right? So if all you're doing is submitting constantly to your

974
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:17,480
partner, that's not engaging for them. So that attitude of like, well, I've done something wrong.

975
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,920
What can I fix? I've done something wrong. What can I fix? I've done something wrong. What can I

976
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:25,640
fix? The reality is, okay, it's not, hey, I've done something wrong. It's, hey, the ownership

977
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,360
that I'm taking is I have feelings for this person that I shouldn't actually have. They're

978
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:33,480
actually unrealistic feelings. So I'm not necessarily going to be looking at, hey,

979
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:39,240
there's a problem in relationship. It's my fault. And I need to change the way I am to

980
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,720
strengthen this relationship. If I'm going out with a girl and things aren't right,

981
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:48,040
I'd take ownership by saying, Hey, you know what, maybe I've done a bad job selecting this situation.

982
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,480
Now once you're married and you have kids, guess what? You got to take ownership of some problems

983
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,640
because you're in there. You're in there and you want to make it work. And something as stupid as

984
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,960
what I'd say in the other day, I was doing some kind of a Q and A in an event or something.

985
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:06,120
And it's like, Hey, if your wife makes bad sandwiches, or Noah saying if your wife

986
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,680
didn't wake up in time to make sandwiches for the kids, and you could say like, Hey,

987
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:14,040
you didn't make sandwiches for the kids, your immediate reaction, that is not going to be good

988
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,040
for her. You know, I've been up all night. I was this, I was that energy. Why don't you make the

989
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,560
sandwiches? And you're already in a bad situation. Whereas if you wake up and say, Hey, I noticed you

990
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,640
didn't get to make sandwiches. Is there anything I can do to help? Maybe it'd be better if I made

991
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,680
the sandwiches in the morning. And like, that's going to move your relationship in the right

992
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:35,240
direction. For sure. So get some. My two cents on relationship advice, and I wish I kept it, but

993
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:40,440
in high school, college, medical school, I actually physically had these pieces of paper

994
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:46,760
that I kept with me that were two lists. So each time you went through a relationship and it could

995
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,840
be a really meaningful one, or it could be one that turned out not to be very meaningful,

996
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,840
but I always felt like there were two things I learned from these relationships and they fed

997
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:01,640
to these two lists. The first list was things that I now believe are absolutely essential in

998
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:06,680
the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. And then the second list was things that I

999
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:12,760
under no circumstance, I'm ever willing to tolerate in a person. And every relationship

1000
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,920
should be able to add at least one thing to those lists. And by the way, the best relationships will

1001
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,560
add to both of those lists. So, and it's hard in the moment to think about that. Like sometimes you

1002
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:27,240
can only think about that in the months that follow or beyond. I wish I still had those things

1003
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,960
because I remember some of them protocol checklist for relationships. Yeah, but I wish I still had

1004
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,320
it. And I don't know. Luckily my kids, I say luckily my kids are still young enough that

1005
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,840
we haven't had to have those discussions yet. These will be things that we talk about at some

1006
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,880
point. And I don't know. That's a whole other world, frankly, that I don't want to think about,

1007
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,200
which is it's one thing when your heart's broken. It's another thing. When you imagine for parents

1008
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:52,360
listening to this, it must be much worse when your child's heart is broken. I got a lot of

1009
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:56,920
experiences in this in the SEAL teams because you always had guys that were in a relationship.

1010
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:01,960
One of your friends, one of your bros in platoon is in a relationship with a train wreck, legitimately

1011
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:09,960
a train wreck. And it's so clear. It's so obvious. You're looking at them and there's not one single

1012
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:15,720
way in any possible situation, any possible thing that you can say that's going to get them out of

1013
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:20,600
the scenario. They're going in and it's awful. So this is what you see with your kids, right? You

1014
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:27,960
see your kids. And then the other thing that happens with kids and it happens a lot is everything is so

1015
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:34,280
important. Things that you know from your 47 year old self or your 27 year old self, you're like,

1016
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:43,720
oh, this is literally no factor at all ever in the world and you are broken about it. This is also a

1017
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:49,080
good little sanity check to put on yourself, you know, and like, how often are you upset or your,

1018
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:53,160
this is something that I don't know when I figured out, but bad things happen to me. I'm like, oh,

1019
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:58,920
okay, this is just no factor. I'm not going to waste one little bit of energy about what's going

1020
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,080
on right now because this is going to be fine and this doesn't matter. But believe me, I've had

1021
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:09,960
conversations with especially my older daughters because I think, well, for me, my daughters are

1022
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:17,240
a little bit more, they will care more like my son. Oh, really? Whatever. Like move past stuff.

1023
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:23,720
Just no factor. Just that mentality. And although in each of my daughters is particular in their own

1024
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:29,000
way, they can move past some things, other things, maybe not. But you're looking at them going, this

1025
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,360
will have no bearing. I remember telling my, my daughter, I remember saying, hey, the girls that

1026
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:40,200
I went out with in high school, I can't even remember them. They don't even exist. And of course,

1027
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:46,440
when I was 15 years old and I had the girlfriend, she was the whole world. She was the whole world.

1028
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:51,000
Haven't even thought about her. Haven't thought about her 30 years. It's no, it's zero factor.

1029
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,680
And that's where you're at right now. I know that this situation, it seems like it's the whole world,

1030
01:24:54,680 --> 01:25:00,520
whether it's school, whether it's grades, whether it's some boy, and you think it's a big deal,

1031
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:06,520
it literally means nothing. But here's the deal. I could say that over and over and over again,

1032
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:11,000
just like I could say it to a young seal that's going out with a girl that is a disaster. And

1033
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,960
they're not going to listen to you because they can't, they get trapped in that heart shaped box.

1034
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:23,880
And it's, you can't use logic. It doesn't work. Very seldom. Just hearing you say that I'm reflecting

1035
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,920
on all of these things that anyone listening to this can imagine, right? Which is all of these

1036
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:35,240
things that we thought mattered so much. And then of course they don't. One of my favorite

1037
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:42,920
Ted talks, arguably still my favorite Ted talk, it was maybe 2010, 2011, Rick Elias, RIC, we'll link

1038
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:49,400
to it, E-L-I-A-S, very short talk, seven or eight minutes. And he was one of the passengers on the

1039
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:55,080
US air flight that landed in the Hudson actually just 10 years ago. That was January of 2009 was

1040
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:59,560
that flight. And his Ted talk and Rick has now become a good friend and actually can't wait to

1041
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:06,120
have him on the podcast at some point. His Ted talk is so much for me like the David Foster Wallace

1042
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:11,320
commencement speech. This is water, which are just things I listened to so often because they're such

1043
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:16,920
stark reminders. And one of the things that he talks about is having this gift of knowing you're

1044
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:24,600
going to die in a minute. And I've had the luxury of not only getting to know Rick closely to be

1045
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,920
able to speak about that in much more detail than he can talk about in a seven minute Ted talk,

1046
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,400
but I also went on to meet another guy who I've since introduced Rick and this other guy,

1047
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:39,080
who was in a very similar situation. He was in a helicopter crash and it turned out he had about a

1048
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:45,720
minute until impact. He survived. One other person survived. Everybody else was torn into pieces.

1049
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:52,200
Like, I mean, he was trapped under shrapnel and metal looking at dead people all around him that

1050
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:56,520
all died in the helicopter crash. And independently, they both describe it the exact same way,

1051
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:02,840
which is one time slows down to a degree you can't imagine. Taking a detour for a moment,

1052
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,840
people who have survived the jump off the Golden Gate Bridge all say the same thing. That's about

1053
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:13,880
a 2.9 to 3.1 second fall, 220 feet until you hit what will turn out to be concrete when you hit

1054
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,880
the water, the Golden Gate below the bridge. Every one of those survivor accounts that I've read says

1055
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:22,760
the same thing. It's the longest three seconds of your life. I mean, it feels like minutes, right?

1056
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:27,400
And so similarly, both Rick and Dan, this other guy talking about that minute that you're just

1057
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:34,680
waiting to die. It's like takes forever. Second thing they both said independently, not scary

1058
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:40,120
because Dan hadn't even didn't even know who Rick was until I introduced them, even though Rick had

1059
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:45,080
already given this talk. Now, for me, that's hard to imagine. I think for you, that's not hard to

1060
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:50,600
imagine. I feel like you understand what that would mean. For me, I don't know. I think that

1061
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:56,040
would be really scary, but I think the part that they also both talked about really resonates with

1062
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,440
me, which is how sad it is. You just don't want it to end. You're sort of like, I'm not ready for

1063
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:04,600
this to be the last moment. There's something else I want to do. There's one more hug I want to give.

1064
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:10,360
There's one more person I want to see or these things. But both of these guys have this incredible

1065
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:16,360
gift, which I think to some extent you've also captured through seeing things that our sanitized

1066
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:22,280
world doesn't show us, which is you very quickly start to realize what's worth putting energy into

1067
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:28,440
and what's not. And that's one of these things that Rick talks about is when you basically die

1068
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:33,800
and then miraculously don't, and you get a gift, which is you get a do over in life,

1069
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,840
you really start to think about the, he describes it very eloquently, which is just like all the

1070
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:45,320
time I wasted on all the things that don't matter. And yeah, this just fits into that category.

1071
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,600
It's negative energy, it's sad energy, it's all of these things. And I still, I do it every day,

1072
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:56,120
Jaco. I mean, just a week ago, someone said something on Twitter, which why I'm even looking

1073
01:28:56,120 --> 01:29:00,280
at Twitter and reading comments, like I need a smack in the head for that, but I don't often,

1074
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:06,280
but sometimes I do. And sure enough, it's Twitter, right? It's literally the world's worst neighborhood.

1075
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:14,840
It easily stayed within me for like three hours, just thinking about why would somebody say that?

1076
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:18,840
Like, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's again, it's not like pure negative energy.

1077
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:23,000
It's not like, I want to kill that person. No, no, it's just like, why would they say that? Like,

1078
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,560
how can they not understand this? What do they think? And then you look back and you're like,

1079
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:33,000
you wasted three hours. Yeah, you were doing something else, but you weren't doing it to the

1080
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,360
level you could have been doing it, right? You were distracted. You pride yourself in never

1081
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:42,600
having a phone at the dinner table. Okay, great. Give yourself a pat on the back. But how many

1082
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:47,160
times are you sitting at the dinner table and your mind is somewhere else? At some email that some

1083
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:52,120
patient sent you that was snippy and they were rude and blah, blah, blah. And it's like, dude,

1084
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:57,720
you're wasting time. So I mean, can you come up with a protocol for that? Because to me,

1085
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:02,680
that is the problem of civilization is like, we have lost track of what problems really are.

1086
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,440
Well, I can tell you one protocol is go overseas and have your friends and see a bunch of guys

1087
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:15,960
sacrifice their lives and come home. And then realize that you talk about these guys,

1088
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:20,040
how they realize they were given this gift. Like that's how I feel every single day.

1089
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:26,200
I can only imagine. And I think many of the guys that serve in the military and women that serve

1090
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:32,120
in the military that went overseas and spent that time over there, like I said, Hey, maybe it's not

1091
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,960
a good chance you're going to get killed, but you got to face the fact that, yeah, it's going to take

1092
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:42,120
some luck to get through this. And you realize life is a gift without question, without question,

1093
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:48,360
it's a gift. I think also something that I talk about a lot, and I suppose there's some big

1094
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:55,080
philosophical kind of realm behind it, because I hear people talk about it, but just having the

1095
01:30:55,080 --> 01:31:00,440
ability to detach from what's going on and look at things from the outside. And this is something

1096
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:08,120
that I specifically know for a fact that I started doing when I was in the SEAL teams. I know why I

1097
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:14,840
started doing it. I understood the benefit that it gave me, but I started applying that to basically

1098
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:22,760
everything that happens to me is oftentimes I just am detached from what's going on. So I can see

1099
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:26,120
that, Oh, this doesn't matter. This thing right here doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to me.

1100
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,160
These things are not important. And from a leadership perspective, I talk about the same

1101
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:35,080
thing because good leaders, they realize what's important and what's not. And a bad leader gets

1102
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:41,320
wound up about something that doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter. And it's really hard to watch

1103
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:45,720
because just like your teenage daughter doesn't realize that this thing doesn't matter. You get

1104
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:51,640
someone that's a leader and they're mad. They're mad about this guy disobeyed me and he didn't do

1105
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:55,320
the thing that I told him to do. And you're thinking to yourself, this does not matter. And

1106
01:31:55,320 --> 01:32:01,240
so you tell them this doesn't matter. And you know what they say, but, but it, but you don't see.

1107
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:05,160
No, it's like, no, I'm telling you this doesn't matter. I talked about that on my podcast when

1108
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:09,960
you get good at jujitsu, you realize that there's some things that don't matter. Like it doesn't

1109
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:14,760
matter. Someone's grabbing your hand, your arm here. That doesn't matter. What matters is what

1110
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,760
you're doing over here with your hips. That's what matters. And so the more advanced you get jujitsu,

1111
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,360
the more you realize what's important and what matters and what doesn't matter. And so it's the

1112
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:29,000
same thing with life. The better you get at life, the more you're able to detach from inside your own

1113
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:35,960
just storm emotion filled ego filled crazy brain. The more you can get out of that thing and you

1114
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:39,800
can take a step back and look at what's actually occurring, the better decisions you're going to

1115
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:44,760
be able to make. Again, I'm not saying you should be devoid of emotions and I'm certainly not devoid

1116
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,960
of emotions, but I know that if I'm going to make a decision, I want to take a step back from those

1117
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,600
emotions. I want to take a step back from that chaos and ma'am because so you can actually see

1118
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,760
what's important and what's not because you're a hundred percent right when you're going out on an

1119
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:06,440
operation and you're going into an area where there's been, there's been 20 guys killed in the

1120
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:12,360
last two months from big IEDs that blew up. By the way, you have no control over that. Like, okay,

1121
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:17,720
you do your best. You study the Intel, you do mind clearance that you try and take the routes that

1122
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,000
have been cleared. You do all those things. Great. That's fine. It doesn't matter. You can still get

1123
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,040
blown up and you can still die. That's the way it is. So you say to yourself, okay, you accept that.

1124
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:31,080
And now when you come home after you do that for an extended period of time, you come home and you're

1125
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:35,720
like, I'm actually this little thing over here doesn't really matter. I'm going to be all right.

1126
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:43,880
I mean, the IEDs are, I can't imagine that because I don't know why it just strikes me as by far the

1127
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:48,680
thing I would be most afraid of if I were in the situation of those soldiers. Because as you said,

1128
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:54,280
I don't know what the hell you do about it. Like you could do everything right. Not that you can

1129
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,760
always do everything right, but it's different from saying, well, no, look, if I'm in a theater of

1130
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:05,000
combat, I can be more defensive. I can take this posture. I can take less risk. Well, like IED.

1131
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,920
And especially as you said, in areas where they seemed completely endemic. I mean, they were as

1132
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
ubiquitous as sand. Yeah, what do you do then? Well, the thing that's interesting that you're

1133
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,880
saying is that would worry you the most. Yeah, paradoxically, the thing I have the least control

1134
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:24,200
over, I would spend the most time wasting time thinking about and you wouldn't. Well, hopefully

1135
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,560
I would have been working for you and you would have beat that out of me would have been like,

1136
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,920
okay, there's nothing we can do about that. Well, actually, there is there's some things we can do.

1137
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,120
There's some things we can do to mitigate the risk. And we're going to do those things. And once we've

1138
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,320
mitigated the risk to the best of our ability, now we're going to worry about the things we can't

1139
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,760
control. And we're going to focus on the things we can control. And that's what we're going to

1140
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,880
do to get through this. Because you do not want to get stuck like that. No. And my guess is you saw

1141
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,600
people who couldn't get out of that way. I mean, there must have been guys that were paralyzed by

1142
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:58,120
that fear. There definitely are. That's one thing that I don't want to say this as a rule,

1143
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:04,680
but it makes me nervous when people are nervous. Right. When you're nervous, you're going to hesitate

1144
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:09,400
when you're nervous, you're thinking about the wrong things. So it made me nervous when guys

1145
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:14,840
were nervous. I didn't like it. I liked when guys were confident. They weren't scared. That's the guy

1146
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,200
that's going to do something aggressive that's going to keep everyone alive because we're getting

1147
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,640
shot at from over. I'm going to go attack that person as opposed to, oh, we're getting shot at.

1148
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:25,880
I'm going to hide because when you're hiding and you're not shooting, guess what the enemy is doing?

1149
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,040
They're maneuvering on you. They're going to kill you. So I think about that to this day. Some

1150
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:34,680
situations happening to me, I don't hide from it. I'm going to go after it. I'm going to get

1151
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:38,280
aggressive. Like I'm going to default aggressive. That's going to be my mode because to sit back

1152
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:42,280
and allow and wait things to happen to you, the more you do that, the more defensive you are,

1153
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,880
the more defensive your mindset is, the worst things are going to turn out. Let's go back to

1154
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:52,040
training because I've never really heard the full story of how you make this progression. So when

1155
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:57,320
you show up as an enlisted kid in the Navy, it's like you and a billion other kids, right? How

1156
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:02,920
many of you are actually thinking I'm going to go to buds? Is that the next step? Like after you do

1157
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:08,680
some basic period of time in the Navy, I have no idea what the number of people that joined the Navy

1158
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:14,280
to be in the SEAL teams is, but you end up with a bunch of people that go to basic SEAL training

1159
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:19,960
and a bunch of them don't make it. So how long were you in Orlando before you came out to San

1160
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:25,800
Diego eight week Navy bootcamp? Navy bootcamp is pretty straightforward. What you're learning in

1161
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:31,320
the Navy, you're in some kind of an industrial job, right? That's what you're doing. That's what

1162
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:37,000
the regular Navy does. They're, they're running engines. They're maintaining weapons. They're

1163
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:43,240
working on the ship. That's what you're doing. You're doing some kind of a mechanical generally.

1164
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:47,800
That's what the Navy is, right? It's a bunch of ships. The ships are big machines with engines.

1165
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,240
Oh, you might be working on aircraft. Guess what? Or you're flying an aircraft or you're

1166
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:56,120
navigating the ship, right? So everything is, is a technical. And so you have pilots in the Navy

1167
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,600
that are distinct from Marines, which also have pilots. Yes. The Navy has pilots, the Air Force

1168
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:05,080
have pilots. The Marine Corps has pilots in the army. Everyone has pilots. I think I want to say

1169
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:10,040
the Navy has more aircraft than the Air Force does. I might be wrong about that, but it's very

1170
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,800
similar and the army might have probably has more aircraft than both because they have helicopters

1171
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,920
and they have a 10. So there's every service kind of has their own thing. And just like the army

1172
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:25,320
has boats, right? The army has boats. The Marine Corps has some kind of boats as well. So yeah,

1173
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:29,640
everyone's got a little bit of everything. But what I'm saying is the Navy is pretty technical.

1174
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:34,280
Yeah, there's less hand to hand combat in the Navy than the others, presumably. Oh, no doubt

1175
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,320
about that. And that's one thing that's a disadvantage for the SEAL teams. The disadvantage

1176
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:41,160
for the SEAL teams is you don't have the basic infantry because you go through army or Marine

1177
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:45,640
Corps bootcamp, you're getting basic infantry skills. Whereas the Navy doesn't give you basic

1178
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:50,120
infantry skills. Now, are there guys that go from being in the Marines to the SEALs? There are. You

1179
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:55,560
have to get out. You have to transfer. You have to go into the Navy, but that's it happens. Also,

1180
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:59,880
when you enlist as a Marine, you're not enlisting in the Navy first. You're in the Marine Corps.

1181
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:05,160
Directly in the Marine Corps. Yeah. Okay. So eight weeks in, eight weeks out, you now go straight

1182
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:09,400
to Buds. Yeah. And then you go to Buds. Well, and this is one of those things where what they do

1183
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:14,040
right now is you go from bootcamp, you go to, I think it's, it's like a prep course where you go

1184
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:19,960
for two months in Chicago and you basically run swim and get in good shape to go to Buds. Okay.

1185
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:23,960
Now you were already in pretty good shape showing up, I'm guessing. Did you know what you were going

1186
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:29,400
to have to do? And did you train to do that back when you were in New England? We had no idea. So,

1187
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:33,080
for instance, if I thought, well, I know we can do a lot of pull ups, so I'm going to do a lot of

1188
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:36,680
pull ups. What was a lot of pull ups to me when I was 18 years old? A lot of pull ups was like

1189
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:41,720
five sets of 12, right? That's what you're going to do. That seemed like a good workout. Now,

1190
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:45,640
I mean, I do hundreds and hundreds of pull ups when I do pull ups now, hundreds, hundreds, 500

1191
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:50,520
pull ups, right? That's a normal workout, but I didn't know that. So you go to Buds and you don't

1192
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:55,080
know it. Just same thing with push ups. You're going to do so many push ups. So no, I wasn't

1193
01:38:55,080 --> 01:39:00,440
ready. You weren't ready for Buds. The kids now are much more prepared because they know more

1194
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,280
about what's going to happen. There's training programs. You can watch the whole damn, you can

1195
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:08,520
watch all of Buds. I didn't know anything about Buds. So Buds is basic underwater demolition.

1196
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:15,400
Seal training, yeah. And how many weeks is it? The basic part is 26 weeks, so it's six months.

1197
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:21,160
And what is the process or what is the attrition rate over that 26 weeks? Is it mostly in the

1198
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:25,960
beginning? Yeah, it's mostly in the beginning. Yeah. 70 or 80% attrition rate. And is the hell

1199
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,400
week very early in that? It actually changes around. When I went through, it was like the

1200
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:33,720
fifth week, I think. And it's somewhere around there. Maybe it's the fourth week, maybe it's a

1201
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,680
six week, but it's somewhere around there. They give you a month or so to get ready. And then you

1202
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:40,680
go through hell week and hell week. Is that the greatest period of attrition? It is the biggest

1203
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:45,640
period of attrition. Yeah. So let's talk about what hell week is. You do a bunch of working out

1204
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:50,200
for five days. And the conditions are pretty tough. I mean, you're in San Diego, the water

1205
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:55,880
ain't warm. Yeah, the water's cold. You don't sleep and you work out a bunch. The thing is,

1206
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:03,160
man, people make seal training into this mythical thing. And it's really not. But you've told me

1207
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:10,520
stories. I remember you telling me about a guy who was in your class who was like the top water

1208
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:17,080
polo player coming out of UCLA. Like you couldn't create a better aquatic machine, a better specimen

1209
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:25,320
than someone who can keep their hands out of water, maneuver and propel themselves. Like I am

1210
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:30,760
as good a swimmer as the average schmell out there. I can't do that very well. So how does this guy

1211
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,600
not pass buds? Didn't want to be there, apparently. So that's the part I'm interested in, right? It's

1212
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:39,480
like the mental fortitude that is required to suffer. Yeah, but there's knuckleheads that make

1213
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,560
it through. I'm telling you, I mean, I've had a couple of my buddies reach out to me and say,

1214
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:50,360
you said buds is easy. It's not and they're right. It's not easy. And I had as hard of time as anyone.

1215
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:54,280
I made it through one class, which means I didn't get rolled back. But what does that mean? When I

1216
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,240
went through, if you failed, there's three phases that you'd go through. And you know what, don't

1217
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:04,360
quote me on this stuff. It's like kind of what I remember. But in first phase, so basically,

1218
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:09,080
there's two things going on. One, they're waiting for you to quit. Yes. Two, there's metrics you

1219
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:16,520
must hit during the workouts. So run, swim, obstacle course. And then they have these other

1220
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:22,680
kind of evolutions that are just going to crush you. So like underwater knot tying, you go down

1221
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:27,240
to 15 feet, they've got a little cord down there, you tie a knot on it, they give you a thumbs up or

1222
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:31,640
a thumbs down, you retie it, and then you go up, you get a breath, you come down, you tie another

1223
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:34,680
one. This is the kind of thing where it's like, it doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but a bunch

1224
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:38,920
of people fail underwater knot tying. Life saving. Same thing. You're going to rescue a seal

1225
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,080
instructor from quote unquote drowning. And this person's doing everything to drown you. They're

1226
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:47,320
going to drown you. So that's one pool competency, which is where you're learning scuba and they're

1227
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:50,200
bringing you down there and they're ripping your mask off and they're pulling your regulator out.

1228
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,920
And they're just going to, they're basically going to, again, they're going to make you as

1229
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,080
uncomfortable as they possibly can in the water. And you're either going to bolt to the surface,

1230
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,520
in which case you fail, or you're going to do the wrong procedures, in which case you fail. So they

1231
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:05,640
got these kinds of things that you're constantly doing. There was also some crazy thing you told me

1232
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:10,120
about that. Like in the water, you had to do something like a pretty long breath hold with

1233
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:14,440
a pretty significant task. It was beyond the knot tying. Well, there's a 50 meter underwater swim,

1234
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:19,400
which is not that big of a without fins or with fins. That's without fins. Jeez, that's hard.

1235
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:22,760
I guarantee you could do that. You're a swimmer. So anyways, there's those. And then there are these

1236
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:29,720
timed evolutions that you have to do run, swim, and obstacle course. So to make a long story short,

1237
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:35,800
for me, none of those were easy. I was not a good runner. I was not a good swimmer. What was the run

1238
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:40,440
criteria, roughly? Those I remember because those haven't changed, but there's a caveat to them. So

1239
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:47,000
the run first phase, four miles, soft sand boots, 32 minutes, second phase, 30 minutes, third phase,

1240
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,440
28 minutes. Meaning you had to do three runs and clear those times successively? They were weekly.

1241
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:57,640
Okay. And you had to hit those times. And if you miss those times, you fail. So the last one's 28

1242
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:01,320
minutes. So that's a seven minute mile. Seven minute mile, which is a joke, right? Well,

1243
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:08,200
it's a joke on pavement, but it's not a joke. And so here's the caveat. The caveat is you're in sand,

1244
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:15,800
you're in boots. You the night before did 1000, literally 1008 count body builders, which is like

1245
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:21,800
a burpee with another movement in there. You slept for three hours. You're on the beach. It's cold.

1246
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:28,440
And the run that's supposed to be four miles is actually 4.42 miles or whatever. You have no

1247
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:33,640
idea. But so it's not as easy as it sounds. It doesn't sound easy. It crushes plenty of people.

1248
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:37,160
Now, if you ran track in high school, it's not going to be hard for you. If you swam in high

1249
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:41,800
school, the swims are going to be easy for you. If you wrestled, you're probably going to do pretty

1250
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:45,560
good on the obstacle course. So there's some advantages you can have. For me, it was all

1251
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:51,400
hard. I wasn't great at running. I wasn't great at swimming and I failed to run. I failed to run

1252
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:55,080
because I decided I was going to pace myself. And by the way, you're not allowed to wear a watch.

1253
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:57,960
And so I wasn't wearing a watch. I paced myself. I said, Oh, you know what? I'm going to save a

1254
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:03,320
little energy. So I went out and was coming to the finish line. And the guy started pointing to the,

1255
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:07,480
you can go over there and take a knee. He's pointing to the ocean, which means you failed.

1256
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:12,920
And so I'm saying, I'm like, damn it. But from then on, I just had to run as hard as I possibly

1257
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:16,520
could. Cause you have no idea how long it's going to be. You have no idea what your time is. So I

1258
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:20,040
would just go out from then on and you don't run together. You're staggered in the start. This is

1259
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:23,880
like on your market set go everybody. Yeah, everyone, every man for himself. And so yeah,

1260
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,280
some people pass, some people fail. That's the one that I failed. So I failed to swim as well.

1261
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:33,400
And the same thing. And actually this one, I was swimming with a guy who wasn't the best swimmer.

1262
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:37,640
And this wasn't a funny story. I swam with the guy who is not a great swimmer. And there's

1263
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:41,320
something called guiding, which means you're looking at the shore and you're keeping yourself

1264
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,520
going in a straight line. By the way, what are you wearing when you swim in the ocean?

1265
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:50,760
What we used to wear was the crappy, useless wetsuit tops with a beaver tail bottom that let

1266
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:55,800
water flow through them. It was almost pointless. Nowadays they wear a little bit nicer of a

1267
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,280
shorty wetsuit. So when you guide, you're looking, you're keeping the distance, keeping the distance,

1268
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:04,920
you're going in the right direction. So myself and my swim buddy, we failed to swim. And so now we're

1269
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:09,080
all lined up with all the other people that failed to swim. And we have to go and explain what happened.

1270
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:15,480
And my swim buddy, he says, what went wrong with you guys? And I said something like,

1271
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:21,320
didn't swim hard enough. Right? Which is the right answer. My swim buddy says, Willink doesn't know

1272
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:26,760
how to guide, meaning it was my fault. And I was, I was kind of taken aback because I didn't expect it.

1273
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:32,280
And the instructors were like, okay, fine. They split us up and put us with other swim buddies.

1274
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:37,320
And I passed the next one and this guy failed it again. But this all happened in one week because

1275
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:40,680
you said a lot of people have to repeat buds, right? There's a lot of people that get rolled

1276
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:47,160
back, which means you got hurt or you failed. So when I went through and again, this is to the best

1277
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:51,400
of my recollection, because here's the thing, man, seal training is a little tiny fraction of your

1278
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:56,600
career. No one freaking cares about it. We never sit around in the stories and talk about it. Like

1279
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:01,240
it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. No one cares about buds. Here's the deal with buds. You work out

1280
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:07,960
a bunch for six months. That's the deal. You compare buds to being in a convoy, getting ready

1281
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:11,960
to roll out in the city of Ramadi or getting ready to patrol out of one of the forward operating

1282
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:17,560
bases there. The mentality is not even close. It doesn't compare. Does buds accomplish what it

1283
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:21,880
sounds like is one of the most important or two things that seem the most important one, making

1284
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:29,240
sure that the soldier is physically prepared at a certain level and two, and perhaps more importantly,

1285
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:34,280
making sure that the mental fortitude is at a level as well. I'd say it does a decent job.

1286
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:39,800
You get like probably a 90% solution on those physically ready. Like yeah, 90% of the guys come

1287
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,640
out of there and they're pretty good to go. Once they get to a team, 90% of the guys, they get out

1288
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:47,000
of there and they're pretty good to go as far as like, Hey, we're not going to give up. But you

1289
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,160
still end up with guys in the seal teams that are totally weak and totally mentally pathetic. And

1290
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:54,360
this is the way it is. Every organization, you can't perfectly screen anything, right? I mean,

1291
01:46:54,360 --> 01:47:00,200
it just doesn't work. And I'm guessing that buds is not a predictor of your success as a seal. In

1292
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:05,880
other words, bud says almost zero prediction of what someone's going to be like as a seal, because

1293
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:10,040
you can be a great athlete. It doesn't test leadership, for example, doesn't really test

1294
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:14,440
teamwork to a high level. Sure. There's teamwork things that you have to do, but you can play the

1295
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:19,560
game to get through the training and then you can show up at a team and be a complete idiot and

1296
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:23,400
look out for yourself. And then you're not a good team member. Does it test intelligence?

1297
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,720
Barely. Yeah. So you've got intelligence, intuition, leadership. There are lots of things

1298
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:33,560
that are necessary to succeed as a seal. Yeah. Buds is pretty, as far as all that stuff goes,

1299
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:37,640
yeah. If you took guys and said, okay, this guy did great in buds, what are the chances that he's

1300
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:41,560
a great seal? It's a random number generator. It's a coin toss. Yeah. It's pretty much a coin toss.

1301
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,600
There's guys that go through buds that are studs and there's horrible seals. They're just horrible

1302
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:51,240
seals and no one wants them. So we don't hear about these seals. Like we sort of think, well,

1303
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:57,240
if you're a seals or if you're a ranger or if you're Delta, like if you're elite of the elite,

1304
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:01,480
by definition, it's a meritocracy. Isn't everybody perfect? Everybody's awesome. That's the funny

1305
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:06,120
thing is everyone thinks, oh, if you were in the seal teams, then you're a great leader. If you're

1306
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:10,760
in the seal teams, then you're got incredible teamwork and everyone thinks that, but no,

1307
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:15,160
it's not true at all. I'm a perfect example because people think, oh, Jock was super strong

1308
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:19,480
or Jock was super athlete. I'm not a super strong and I'm not a super athlete by any stretch.

1309
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:25,080
I'm kind of like average. I'm kind of like low average, you know, and do I work out a lot? Sure.

1310
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:31,160
I work out a lot, but I couldn't win a damn weightlifting competition in any situation.

1311
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:36,520
Just not that. So I'm a good example of the fact that people get a mythical idea that every seal

1312
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:41,160
is a great leader or every seal is a great athlete or every seal was incredible mental fortitude.

1313
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,600
When did you get out? 11.

1314
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,120
2010. Yeah. It's hard to believe it's been that long. It is. It is.

1315
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:50,920
Oh my God. Time does go faster the older we get.

1316
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,320
Yes. Yes, it does indeed.

1317
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:59,240
What was the hardest transition for you to getting out? Your kids were young.

1318
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:00,040
Pretty young. Yeah.

1319
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:05,880
What was it like? Were there moments when you're at a stoplight and it occurs to you like no one's

1320
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:09,880
actually trying to kill you? That's coming home from deployment. When you come home from deployment,

1321
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:13,560
that part is a very clear one, especially my first deployment. We're in vehicles all the time

1322
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:20,120
and the IED threat was high and you were getting used to it and we were doing convoys in Baghdad.

1323
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:23,880
And it was like, okay, cool. These people, we don't want to let them in our convoy and you're

1324
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:28,280
driving really aggressive. So there's a little bit of that. But once I came home, I was,

1325
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:33,960
from my last deployment was doing work and you get rid of those feelings after a little, we had a

1326
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:39,960
little, when we came home from Ramadi, we had a little, I'd call it a little decompression time

1327
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:45,960
where it wasn't formal, but we were going hard. We were celebrating life. I'll put it that way.

1328
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:51,640
We were happy to be home. We were mourning the fact that we lost guys and we were a little bit,

1329
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:56,680
I know I personally was going, I was just going, living hard. We'll say that living hard.

1330
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:03,320
Was it hard for your wife to sort of, I guess it's hard for me to put myself in her shoes or your

1331
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:07,640
shoes for that matter, but more so in hers to think I've kind of been holding down the fort here

1332
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:13,480
and I'm really glad you're home, but I'm confused as to why you're doing this or was she totally

1333
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:19,560
understanding of my wife as a saint and my wife is a saint. And first of all, when I was gone,

1334
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:28,280
my wife was raising our three kids at the time she was holding down the fort. She was giving me

1335
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:33,320
zero concerns. Like I was overseas and as far as I knew, everything was fine. Everything was perfect.

1336
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:39,480
No water heater was broken. No car was broken down. No kid was sick. No diapers were being

1337
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:46,040
changed. Everything was just handled. That's what was going on. And then my wife was going to visit

1338
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:53,160
my guys that were wounded in the hospital. My wife was going to my guys funerals and she was doing

1339
01:50:53,160 --> 01:51:01,960
that. And by the way, when you've got families of seals that are going to the funerals of guys from

1340
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:08,200
the task unit, every single one of those wives knows that there's just a coin toss that that's

1341
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:13,480
not my husband, that that's not my son, that's not everybody. They feel that, right? So basically,

1342
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:20,200
when you're going to bury one of your spouses, teammates, there's no way you can't think that

1343
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:24,520
one of the chances that this is my husband. And it never occurred to me until you just said that,

1344
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:31,080
but you're not there. No. I never really thought about that. Yeah. The funerals are the families

1345
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:37,400
without the soldiers. Well, there's seals there that go that are back. But many of the families

1346
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:41,800
are going without their spouse. Yeah. So everyone from task unit bruiser, every one of those spouses,

1347
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:47,560
kids, they're all going and they're seeing one of their dad's friends get buried. So your kids,

1348
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:52,920
was your oldest even old enough to have gone? My kids did not go. No, my kids did not go. When

1349
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:57,320
they got older and there would be, especially my son, I would take my son. If a seal gets killed,

1350
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:01,480
we'll go to the memorial service because I want him to see what it's about. You know what I mean?

1351
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:07,000
You need to understand what this is because everyone thinks, like I said, when you're a kid,

1352
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:12,040
you think, oh no, this will never happen to me. But you got to realize, no, this is real. This is

1353
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:17,720
what happens. And that's part of life. That's part of war and all the glory that people talk about a

1354
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:23,480
war. They don't show this part of it. So, but my wife was doing all that. And so when I came home,

1355
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:28,680
man, she was just happy I was home more than anything else. And my wife has always been very

1356
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:36,520
emotionally independent. She also knew that I'm not normal. And she'd made that pretty clear to me,

1357
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:40,360
maybe a year or so ago when I was explaining something, I was trying to explain the way

1358
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:47,560
someone was behaving. And I was kind of saying, well, I would never do that. And she's like,

1359
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:51,640
you're not normal. And she didn't say it. That's not a derogatory statement.

1360
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,800
The first time where she said it, because she'd said it before, but she said it in a way that was,

1361
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:59,640
I was thinking about it. She goes, the thing is, you're not normal. And I thought about it. I thought,

1362
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:06,200
you know what, she's right. I'm not normal. And that's fine. But as far as me coming home,

1363
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:12,200
she was awesome. And she, when I said that she basically supported me with what I was doing,

1364
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:18,600
here's an example. I'm a total jerk when it comes to jujitsu. And we were married, I was in, in a

1365
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:22,760
platoon, I was in a task unit. And when I'd come home from work at seven o'clock at night,

1366
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:27,640
I would grab my bag and I'd go train jujitsu. And then I'd get up the next morning at five o'clock

1367
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:31,720
in the morning and I'd go to work and she wouldn't see me all day. And I'd come home and seven o'clock

1368
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:36,280
the next day and I'd pick up my bag and I'd go to jujitsu. And I would say of the hundreds and

1369
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:39,800
hundreds of times that I did that, there was probably three times that I can remember where

1370
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:48,040
she was actually looking at me with, with a look of disappointment. Like, are you serious right now?

1371
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:52,120
You've been gone for three weeks. You've been working every night until seven o'clock and you're

1372
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:55,880
going to actually go and train jujitsu instead of hanging out with your kids for an hour before

1373
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:01,320
they go to sleep. And three times out of hundreds and hundreds of times is pretty legitimate. But

1374
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:07,720
she realized that I'm not normal and that she realized that her objections to that were not

1375
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:11,640
worth it. Because now all of a sudden I'm not doing something that really is important to me.

1376
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:15,000
Not that my family's not important to me, but this is my release. This is my thing.

1377
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:19,880
So she cleared me hot, you know, almost every single time, other than maybe three.

1378
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:25,320
But it's funny, like I remember we were talking maybe last year at some point and you said

1379
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:31,640
something that really resonated with me because each passing day I feel it more and more.

1380
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:36,120
And it was, we were talking about doing something going somewhere and you were like, you know,

1381
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:44,760
there is nothing I like doing more than hanging out with my family. Like when it's me and my

1382
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:51,400
wife and my daughters and my son and we're at home, like there's really nothing else I want to

1383
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:55,880
do and nowhere else I want to go. And it's sort of funny. Like I've been reflecting on that and I

1384
01:54:55,880 --> 01:55:02,040
was like, you know, I kind of feel the same way. Like I just never like going anywhere anymore.

1385
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:07,640
I really most enjoy being home. And that's a relatively recent phenomenon for me. I don't

1386
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:11,720
know. Was that an evolution for you? Well, two things. Number one, I'm doing jujitsu, right?

1387
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:15,560
I'm working out every day. If there's waves, I'm surfing. I play guitar a lot when my family is

1388
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:19,960
sitting around, whether they want to hear me or not. But those are some things. So I definitely

1389
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:24,600
want to do those things. And to be quite frank, if there was a war going on and I was still active

1390
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:28,840
duty and I'd want to be going doing that. And this is another crazy thing about my wife is like,

1391
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:32,920
I used to tell my wife, think about this, this is hard. And I caught some flack. I said this on the

1392
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:38,920
podcast, but here's the reality of the situation. I told my wife, I was like, the teams is my number

1393
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,840
one priority. The SEAL teams is my priority in my life. You are up there, but that's my number one

1394
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:51,320
priority. And that's a crazy thing to say. That's just a crazy thing to say. And one of the things

1395
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:56,840
that I didn't really make clear on the podcast when I talked about it is one of the reasons that it

1396
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:01,320
is not just it is my party has to be my priority. It has to be my priority because here's the deal.

1397
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:07,160
I'm going to go overseas. I'm going to be in a combat situation. The best thing that I can do

1398
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:14,040
for our family is be completely and utterly as prepared as I possibly can so that when things

1399
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:21,240
happen, I'm ready so I can come home. And by the way, it's not just me. I got 40 guys that are

1400
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:25,960
counting on me to make the right decisions at the right time. So they come home too.

1401
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:32,920
So when I say that the SEAL teams is my priority, the reason is because that's my tactical priority

1402
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:39,320
right now. So that strategically in the long run, I'll be here in the future. And so will my friends.

1403
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:44,680
So I had to clarify that a little bit because that's a pretty harsh statement to make.

1404
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:47,640
Do you think that most of your peers felt the same way?

1405
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:53,160
Most, I don't know, but a lot of them. A lot of them. Man, I'm telling you, when you're in a SEAL

1406
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:57,240
platoon, when you're a young guy in a SEAL platoon, there's nothing else in the world.

1407
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:03,240
The rest of the world doesn't exist or it exists only for you to go and get into.

1408
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:07,720
But thinking about what you said a moment ago, right? Which was if tomorrow there was a need

1409
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:13,640
for you to go back and serve under the same conditions. So not in some nice green zone where

1410
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:18,840
you're there in part, but you're actually back out there in front of the IDs. You would do it again.

1411
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:19,400
Yeah.

1412
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:19,880
Today.

1413
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:20,520
Yes.

1414
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,680
You have three kids. You have a wife.

1415
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,560
I have four kids.

1416
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:27,800
I mean, you've got different responsibilities than you had when you were 25.

1417
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,880
And yet you would be willing to go out there and make that sacrifice.

1418
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:35,560
And I have to tell you, I wouldn't.

1419
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:36,440
Understood.

1420
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:39,640
I've never really thought about it until now, but the way you frame it that way,

1421
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:45,320
I would not be willing to do it. I think I'm too selfish. I would not do that.

1422
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:51,560
And I wonder how many of your peers today, meaning the guys that you were with in your 20s,

1423
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:56,680
in your 30s who now are in the situation you were in, which is they've been civilians for a decade.

1424
01:57:56,680 --> 01:58:01,000
They have families. Do you have a sense of how many of them could actually go back and put their

1425
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,160
lives at that type of risk?

1426
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,440
A decent amount.

1427
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:04,920
Wow.

1428
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:12,040
Yeah. Decent amount. Yeah. There's something you use the word selfish to describe yourself.

1429
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:15,880
And I mean, that's obviously pretty harsh, but to go in the opposite direction, there's something

1430
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,840
incredibly unselfish about the guys that I used to work with and the guys that still serve right now.

1431
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:27,320
And it's not a completely, I don't want to make everyone out to be these kind of angelic people

1432
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:33,080
because there's definitely some self gratification in it. Like you love doing this.

1433
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:41,000
And so it's not a hundred percent just you're an angel, but there's guys that are willing to

1434
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,760
sacrifice. I mean, that's what the US military is filled with. The US military is filled with men

1435
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:51,160
and women that are willing to set aside everything that they have, including their life, because they

1436
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:58,760
believe in a higher ideal. And yeah, that's a huge, huge, incredible thing. That's why it's

1437
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:02,760
so incredible to have been part of that in any way. It's incredible.

1438
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:07,080
Do you think part of it is just if you believe the idea that there's no such thing as true

1439
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:12,200
altruism, right? So even when we act at our most altruistic, it's because we are getting something

1440
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:16,440
from that. We are getting a sense of connectedness. We are getting a sense of joy, a sense of pride,

1441
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:22,360
a sense of relational connectivity. What you're describing is like this higher calling that says,

1442
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:27,880
look, I mean, there is no higher honor. Do you think that there's just something missing from

1443
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:35,640
the world today versus the world in the 1940s post World War II? David Brooks has written about this

1444
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:39,960
quite a bit in a book that he wrote several years ago called The Road to Character, where he talks

1445
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:46,600
about the difference between eulogy virtues and resume virtues. And he talks a lot about a big

1446
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:53,000
turning point, which was sort of post World War II. During the Second World War, you didn't just have

1447
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,520
to be a soldier to understand sacrifice, right? The women who weren't going to war were killing

1448
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:04,040
themselves here, making ammunition. People were, everyone in the country knew what a sacrifice was

1449
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:10,360
now. The highest sacrifice was paid by the young men on the front lines, but everybody was connected

1450
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:16,200
to that. Vietnam, which would be the next major conflict, I guess Korea, but then Vietnam,

1451
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:20,680
it became disconnected. And I would argue that what you went through was even more disconnected.

1452
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:27,080
So part of the argument of Brooks is we lost something when we lost that connection. I don't

1453
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:32,440
think he articulated that way, but the gist of it was many good things happen from the progression

1454
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:37,080
of society through the sixties and seventies and beyond. But one of the things we sort of lost was

1455
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:43,080
this sense of something greater than ourselves. I guess I wonder if that's part of what appeals

1456
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:48,920
to you still is, why would you risk today potentially, again, it was a thought experiment,

1457
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:55,240
not seeing your family again. There must be something really, really amazing to take that risk.

1458
02:00:56,040 --> 02:01:00,760
And that amazing thing is, is it this sense of a purpose that goes so far beyond anything you can

1459
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:07,480
contemplate as a civilian? Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is because it's very clear to me. Yeah. When you

1460
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:14,600
ask this question, it's a little bit as I listened to you, the fact that you would miss it, you're

1461
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:20,840
like, no, I wouldn't do that. Not even like, well, you know, I get it. I mean, we could press you

1462
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:24,760
further. Like if it was an existential threat to you and your family, you'd be on the front line.

1463
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:27,880
So there's the difference. I guess there's the connection part that you're talking about.

1464
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:36,920
And I guess for me, I still have a connection in my blood to the guys that I worked with from the

1465
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:43,480
guys that raised me in the SEAL teams, that if there was something that they needed me, your

1466
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:48,280
thought is, well, yes, I'll be there. You know, I think part of it is I just feel like my world is

1467
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:54,680
shrinking as I get older and I feel less and less important. I think I'm converging on a point where

1468
02:01:54,680 --> 02:02:03,800
I think technically the only thing that matters is my family. And they're the only ones who I can

1469
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:10,600
really influence in a way that matters. And therefore my life is not that important outside

1470
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:16,680
of that. I don't think I have enough belief that I matter or can make a difference outside of that.

1471
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:21,080
That sounds like such a nihilist view, which is not how I, I don't want to take that to an extreme

1472
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:25,800
or I can just imagine how many people are going to write and say, oh, you're an idiot for saying

1473
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:31,960
that. But again, I'll try not to read it, right? But I just think I have a shrinking view of my

1474
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:38,120
place in the universe. I think I feel less and less significant as time passes on. And that's not a

1475
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:43,240
bad thing for someone with my appetite for grandiosity to feel less and less significant,

1476
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:47,880
but it converges to, yeah, you know what? In the end, like outside of your kids, your wife,

1477
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:52,440
your closest, closest friends, family, like you're sort of irrelevant. Like if you fell off the

1478
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:58,920
planet tomorrow, it wouldn't matter. The earth wouldn't even slow one degree on its axis. And so

1479
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:04,840
more of that effort feels like those are the only people who matter. And those are the ones who I

1480
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:10,520
want to make sure I'm doing the best for. So I guess that's where it comes from. But it also says

1481
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:18,040
that I probably can't relate to. Even when I watch a movie like Saving Private Ryan, which,

1482
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:22,840
I mean, I'm sure everybody has seen that, but if you've listened to this and you haven't seen it,

1483
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:29,960
you must watch it. That opening scene is riveting on many levels, but one of the levels, because I

1484
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:36,680
actually went to Normandy by total coincidence. I was there in December of 99 and I happened to

1485
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:40,920
go to Normandy on December 6th of 99, which if you're like me and you like to do the math,

1486
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:47,800
you realize is 666 months to the day from the D-Day invasion, June 6th of 44 or 45, sorry.

1487
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:52,840
So in December, which is not a nice time in the year to be in Northern France, the weather was

1488
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:59,160
horrible, but it actually looked just like the photos of that day, which is why that invasion

1489
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:04,360
was so challenging because you didn't get what you expected in June. One of the gifts of doing that

1490
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:12,280
was there was not another soul at the cemetery. So you could see 10,000 crosses virtually

1491
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:22,120
unobstructed. Also, when I climbed down the cliffs at Omaha, it was awful. It was like the weather

1492
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:29,400
was awful. And so I got to look up and see, or at least try to imagine what it would have looked

1493
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:35,800
like to be a lamb in a slaughterhouse. And what occurred to me was what you said a second ago,

1494
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:44,120
which was, how many of those kids died? How quickly did they die? And how easy is it to forget?

1495
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,880
How many dreams were never realized? And that was the other thing that, I mean, just made me cry,

1496
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:57,880
was looking at the dates on the crosses. Because even by that point, I was in my late 20s or

1497
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:03,080
something. And I realized that virtually all of them were younger than me. And I was like,

1498
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:06,280
wait, this guy never got to go to school. This guy never got to go to college. This guy never

1499
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:11,240
got married. And I don't know. On the one hand, I think they died with more purpose than I'll

1500
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:17,080
probably ever have. But more than that, I was riveted by, but did that person's actual life

1501
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:22,680
matter more dead or alive? In other words, like, would we have lost the war if John Smith hadn't

1502
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:27,800
died on that day? These are silly arguments that are circular, but the answer to that question is

1503
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:32,280
no, we wouldn't have lost the war if John Smith didn't die on that day. But if we didn't have

1504
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:40,120
hundreds and hundreds of thousands, millions of John Smith, John Smith's that were ready to go

1505
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:45,080
and make the ultimate sacrifice, darkness would have prevailed. Changing gears from it. How do

1506
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:52,040
you think about warfare in that evolution that we just talked about, right? World War II, Vietnam,

1507
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:57,560
Afghanistan, Iraq. Don't forget Korea. I have forgotten Korea twice now. They call it the

1508
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:06,360
forgotten war. There's a reason. Korea was a complete nightmare in many respects and all

1509
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:15,480
wars are hell and Korea's right up there. Korea was 51, 55, something like that.

1510
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:20,280
How much of an evolution took place between World War II and Korea from a military,

1511
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:25,800
strategic, and tactical point? Pretty similar, except for the fact that towards the end of Korea,

1512
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:30,680
it turned into almost like a trench warfare scenario. Like almost a World War I type scenario

1513
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:34,600
over the deep military zone. Yeah, they were in trenches. I mean, not even kind of. They were in

1514
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:38,600
trenches and they're fighting over. Could we push their trench back a hundred yards? So that kind

1515
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:42,360
of happened, but we had at least learned like, okay, you know what? We're in their trench and

1516
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:46,520
they're in their trench. It's kind of a whole, but we got here for a little while instead of

1517
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:52,680
which World War I to me, World War I is the ultimate just nightmare of a war. Remind me

1518
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:56,680
the casualties because they always blow my mind. And this is like, I talk about how good my memory

1519
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:02,520
is. This is something I constantly forget because it's so upsetting. World War I battle of the Som

1520
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:08,760
60,000 casualties in the first 24 hours. To put that in perspective, what was the casualty on the

1521
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:15,560
American side from 9 11 till today, approximately? I don't know, less than 10,000. And 10,000 was

1522
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:22,040
the D-Day invasion within four days. Yeah. So the casualties are in those wars were completely

1523
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:27,880
insane, completely insane. And World War I was a special kind of nightmare. The thing that I hate

1524
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:37,880
about World War I is it didn't really matter how good you were with tactics, with leadership,

1525
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:44,360
with your skill level. You were going to get told at 0 600 when you hear the bugle or you hear the

1526
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:50,200
whistle, you're going to go over the top and you're going to charge. And by the way, at 5 45, another

1527
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:56,840
battalion went and you're going to hear them get mowed down. They're not going to survive. And 10

1528
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:02,200
minutes later, another battalion is going to go. They're not going to survive. And then at 6 o'clock,

1529
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:06,120
you're going to go and you're not going to survive. And there's nothing you can do about it.

1530
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:12,760
That is the most sickening war. I hate that war. I hate all wars, but that one I especially hate

1531
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:20,120
because of that. And because there's some horrible things in World War I, if you were unable to buy

1532
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:26,760
a prodded man in England and for whatever reason, you weren't in a uniform or you weren't going into

1533
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:31,080
service. So let's say you are the sole support for their family and they wouldn't have to go.

1534
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:38,040
There was a thing that they would, the women would give someone a white flower,

1535
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:45,640
which means you're a coward. So to think about that, that's the way the society was. And by the

1536
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:50,680
way, and then you were going to go and you were going to sit in a trench until you got told to

1537
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:57,320
attack and you were going to die. And the fact that these soldiers on both sides did this day

1538
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:02,440
after day, month after month, year after year, it's incredible. It's incredible that no senior

1539
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:09,720
leader called bullshit on it. No one said, you know what? This is the dumbest thing I've ever

1540
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:15,400
heard. I'm not going to send my 700 man battalion to die tomorrow. I'm not going to do it. You can

1541
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:21,240
shoot me. And by the way, they did, did a podcast about that shot at dawn. They took British soldiers

1542
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:29,240
that had serious PTSD and traumatic brain injuries that couldn't fight anymore, refuse to fight,

1543
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:35,240
bring them out in the morning and shoot them. And they were all pardoned, but it's just crazy.

1544
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:40,440
It's crazy to even think about. So that's why I get very, I always talk a lot about the fact that

1545
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:44,040
people think in the military, you just follow orders, like, oh, you just follow orders. That's

1546
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:47,960
what you're going to do. It's like, no, actually no. If something's not a good plan, then I'm not

1547
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:52,360
going to obey it. I'm not going to obey orders just for the sake of obeying orders. That's a tough

1548
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:56,760
one too. And that's a great business lesson, right? That's not cut and dry either. Because if you

1549
02:09:56,760 --> 02:10:03,560
tell me to do something that's going to get my platoon killed and I say Peter or sir, you know,

1550
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:09,080
captain Peter, I'm not going to do it. And you go, okay, cool. You're fired. And here's one of my

1551
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:13,400
other guys who's a yes, man. And he's going to take them and he's going to do what I told him to do.

1552
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:17,800
So would I have been better to have said, you know what, captain, I totally disagree with what

1553
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:22,600
you're doing. Here's another plan. Here's an alternate. No, do it my way. I really disagree.

1554
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:27,320
I think it's going to get people, I don't care. Do it my way. Am I better off at that point saying,

1555
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:32,520
okay, I'll got it. And I go and I mitigate risks to the best of my ability. Or am I better off

1556
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:35,720
holding the line and saying, you know what, you can find someone else. And maybe that's enough to

1557
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:39,000
wake you up and say, wait a second. Jocko has been a great guy. He's been really supportive. Now

1558
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:43,080
he's telling me, no, I must be wrong. There's that fine line. Well, it's going to depend heavily on

1559
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:46,520
both of those things, right? It's a function of your track record and it's a function of that

1560
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:52,120
person's humility. For sure. For sure. But as the young leader, that's a decision I'm going to have

1561
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:56,920
to make, which is going to be better for me, which is going to be better for my troops. More importantly,

1562
02:10:56,920 --> 02:11:00,360
which is going to be better for my troops is it could be better for me to hold the line and say,

1563
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:07,160
boss, this is such a bad plan that I am not willing to execute it. You can fire me. You can send me to

1564
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:12,120
court martial or whatever, but this is a horrible plan. It's going to get people killed. And then

1565
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:15,800
you go, fine, you're getting court martialed. And by the way, here's Joe and he's going to do

1566
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:21,560
what I told him to do. When I read crack hours book where men win glory, it's a powerful book on so

1567
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:28,520
many levels, but a big part of it again is the complete and utter futility of the mission that

1568
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:33,480
cost Pat Tillman his life. Like I couldn't understand and you have to help me understand

1569
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:36,920
this. You remember the details, right? There was like, I don't know, it's like a helicopter or a

1570
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:42,360
Humvee that was down. Like they basically had to go in and get a downed piece of equipment and go

1571
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:49,000
through what was clearly a completely risky exposed terrain. And then of course, on top of that,

1572
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:54,600
to die a friendly fire just is the ultimate, you know, injury upon insult. But I'm reading this.

1573
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:58,440
And of course, you know how it ends when you're reading it, which makes it hard to read. And you're

1574
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:03,320
thinking like, how did nobody because there was like, it's been so long since I've read it. But

1575
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:07,560
one of the very senior people on the ground, so not in command, but on the ground was like,

1576
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:13,880
it's an awful idea. It's an awful idea. Like we're going to risk the lives of 10 men

1577
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:21,160
to get a piece of equipment. Nope, that's the plan. We're doing it. I just and you think, well,

1578
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:25,640
okay, that story got written by crack hour because of Pat Tillman. How many times did that story

1579
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:31,560
happen? How many Pat Tillman's are there? That's why I tell people all the time. And I tell them

1580
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:35,480
in business too, because it happens in business too. But in the military and business, if you're

1581
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:41,480
a subordinate, and you have an obligation and in some cases, a moral obligation to stand up and say,

1582
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:45,160
hey, I don't know, I don't think this is the best plan. Again, I wish it was that cut and dry.

1583
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:49,320
Because there's a good chance that if you're Pat Tillman's platoon commander, and you say,

1584
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:53,880
hey, boss, this is a horrible idea. I'm not doing it. The general or the colonel says,

1585
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:57,640
okay, fine, you're not doing it. Cool. I'm sending this other group of guys, I'm firing you and

1586
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:02,440
replacing you. This is what makes leadership so hard. It does happen in the business world too.

1587
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:05,320
And what is all the stem from it goes back to what we were talking about earlier, this is a

1588
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:09,320
lack of humility up the chain of command, you've got people that are not humble, you can also take

1589
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:12,520
ownership of yourself, because if you're telling me to do something, I don't think it's smart. And

1590
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:16,440
I haven't developed a good enough relationship with you, where you actually listen to me, which is,

1591
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:20,120
by the way, everything that I'm trying to do as a subordinate leaders, I'm trying to get a

1592
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:24,280
relationship with you so that you trust me so that when I actually say to you, hey, boss, this isn't

1593
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:29,560
a good idea, you listen. And that's the goal. Right? Because if I don't take any ownership,

1594
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:32,680
and it's like, hey, my boss told me to do something, I just have to go do it. Like, no,

1595
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:35,720
you have to take ownership of that relationship, you have to make sure that they understand that

1596
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:40,360
you have to support them enough. So that you trust me. Because if everything that you tell me to do,

1597
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:43,400
I object to, well, then I'm just a boy that cried wolf. And eventually, you just say, oh,

1598
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:47,080
jocko doesn't want to do anything I say. But if I do what you tell me to do, and I support you,

1599
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:51,240
and I carry out the things that you want me to carry out, and then eventually you tell me to do

1600
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:55,720
something, I say, this doesn't make any sense, you'll listen to me. So we have to take ownership

1601
02:13:55,720 --> 02:14:00,760
of the relationship that we have up the chain of command. Otherwise, you're at the whim of some

1602
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:05,240
random person that you don't know, and that doesn't listen to you. I can't remember which organization

1603
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:10,360
coined this term, but the obligation to dissent is basically what it's called, right? Which is,

1604
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:16,600
you actually, as a subordinate, you have an obligation to speak up when something is wrong,

1605
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:21,960
not that it's an option, it's an obligation. Is that becoming more ingrained in the culture of

1606
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:26,760
the military? It's interesting. Napoleon said that. Napoleon said if you get told to do something

1607
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:31,960
that you know is a bad plan, and you execute it, you're culpable. That's Napoleon. So this idea has

1608
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:36,840
been around for a long time. As to where it falls out in the military today, it's all over the place.

1609
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:41,400
In other words, it's still so even the style of leadership is that decentralized. When I said

1610
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:46,360
it's all over the place, I use the wrong term, I meant that it's scattered. So some places have it.

1611
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:52,120
That's what I mean. It's heterogeneously laced. Some people are good leaders that listen to the

1612
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:56,680
decentralized command, and some people are not, and that's the way it is. And are we moving in

1613
02:14:56,680 --> 02:15:01,720
the right direction? I sure hope so. I'm doing my best to get it there. So going back to World War

1614
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:08,040
I, the time between World War I and World War II is about 20 years, right? Yeah, 1918 to 1939.

1615
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:13,400
And when we think about like 20 years ago, it seems like yesterday, in that 20-year period,

1616
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:18,040
what were the significant changes in either technology, strategy... Maneuver warfare.

1617
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:22,440
Maneuver. Yeah. Because World War II has almost nothing in common with World War I in terms of

1618
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:27,560
the fighting, right? Towards the end of World War I, the Germans started to employ decentralized

1619
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:31,400
command. That's what they started to do. They started to say, you know what, Sergeant? We got

1620
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:38,280
some bad guys over here. Go and figure out how to handle them. This actually came from

1621
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:49,320
the Napoleonic Wars, where the Germans, the Austrians, the Prussians got beat up by Napoleon.

1622
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:53,640
And they started to say, why are we getting beaten by Napoleon? And what they realized was

1623
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:57,880
they had too much centralized command. They had a bunch of fundamental problems. And so they started

1624
02:15:57,880 --> 02:16:04,120
to make plans to figure out a better way to run their organizations. That's where you find the

1625
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:09,320
famous command staff, the German-Austrian command staff. That's sort of like a famous thing. And

1626
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:13,480
that's where it started. Well, they didn't really get it going till the end of World War I, because

1627
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:17,960
it's so hard to change a big organization's attitude. By the end of World War I, they started

1628
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:21,400
doing it. They started doing decentralized command. They started doing maneuver warfare. It would have

1629
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:25,640
really helped them, but they were way late. They waited till the end. And by then, they didn't have

1630
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:31,800
the men or material to continue the war. So you take 20 years. So they realized that at the end,

1631
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:35,480
it was working. They still are going to lose. They get crushed by the Treaty of Versailles.

1632
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:39,880
And now when they start rebuilding, they start rebuilding with the attitude, we're going to

1633
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:43,160
move fast. We're going to use maneuver warfare. We're going to use decentralized command. And

1634
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:47,240
that's what they did. That's what Blitzkrieg was. It was decentralized command, maneuver warfare

1635
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:51,320
very quickly. And they would have done exceptionally well and continued to do well. The Germans,

1636
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:56,920
had they not started to centralize everything back again to Hitler, who started making decisions

1637
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:00,520
and started telling the generals that were on the Eastern front what to do.

1638
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:03,640
What year approximately did Hitler kill Rommel?

1639
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:05,480
It was towards the end.

1640
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:07,800
It was towards the end, right? It was like 43, 44.

1641
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:08,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1642
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:13,800
I've only read one book on Rommel and I don't know why I find him to be such a fascinating

1643
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:17,160
character. I imagine there are Rommel scholars out there.

1644
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:18,280
What book did you read, Attacks?

1645
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:22,440
Yellow cover. I can show it to you. I still have it. It's been about 10 years.

1646
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:26,280
I thought of doing Rommel on the podcast and I'm actually going to start it off with how he

1647
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,400
circumstances under which he killed himself or which he was murdered, depending on what I say.

1648
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:34,360
Very interesting circumstances. They brought him and said, okay,

1649
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:38,040
you're either going to go out as a hero and we'll take care of your family or everyone dies. So,

1650
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:38,600
what do you want?

1651
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:39,160
Unbelievable.

1652
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:43,720
Jump in the car. Hitler thought he was part of the group that tried to kill him, which-

1653
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:47,880
I don't think he was. Certainly that's not how I read it, was that he was not. One of the guys who

1654
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:52,760
worked for me many years ago, loved the book so much because after I read it, I think I bought a

1655
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:58,440
copy for all the guys that I was working with and he typed up these incredible notes from it.

1656
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:01,960
I'll find them in something to you. You will love this. It's like 20 pages of-

1657
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:03,160
Was it a book by Rommel?

1658
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:03,480
No.

1659
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:05,560
Because his most famous book is Attacks.

1660
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:09,080
That's the book when George C. Scott is playing Patton and he's saying, I read your book. Because

1661
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:13,720
that book is about World War I and it's a great book and there's some really, really good lessons

1662
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:20,120
in there. It's written very German, dry, straightforward. These are the facts. Every

1663
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:23,560
section has a little section at the end that's like the lessons learned, which is probably the

1664
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:27,160
highlight when I do it on the podcast. I'll probably spend most of my time in those

1665
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:33,400
sections. It's also very, very tactical. Now inside tactical lessons, there are leadership

1666
02:18:33,400 --> 02:18:38,280
lessons, there are strategic lessons inside tactical lessons for sure, but it is very tactical,

1667
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:40,360
very tactical book.

1668
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:41,400
The Rommel papers.

1669
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:41,720
Okay.

1670
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:42,280
That's the one.

1671
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:43,480
I'll take a look at that one.

1672
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:47,160
Yeah. And it's funny, you think about how even at the level of an enormous war,

1673
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:52,440
slightly different decisions, right? Like you could argue Hitler's arrogance in North Africa,

1674
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:56,120
a hundred percent cost them the war and his arrogance to think I can fight on two fronts

1675
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,560
in the West and in the East. That's probably the bigger one. And I'll tell you what,

1676
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:06,120
the Stalingrad scenario, I covered that one on my podcast and most of the books that I cover

1677
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:09,880
on my podcast are first person council guys that were there. I covered one that was a German guy.

1678
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:17,080
They're listening to Hitler on the radio talking about the great sacrifice that was made

1679
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:21,720
past tense. You guys are still alive. They're going to say, Hey, these guys held the line.

1680
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:25,480
They did their best. They fought on. We're going to win because of their sacrifices.

1681
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:28,920
They're still alive. They're trapped. They're starving. They're freezing. They're getting

1682
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:34,760
killed, but that's what Hitler did. Just wrote them off and said, no surrender. That's it.

1683
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:42,760
Horrible, horrible situation. But the difference is that World War One was, hey, we're going to

1684
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:46,680
be in these trenches, no decentralized command. And then that's the big thing that the Nazis

1685
02:19:46,680 --> 02:19:50,520
changed was we're going super decentralized command at the beginning of the war. And that's

1686
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:55,320
why they were so effective with Blitzkrieg. Here's the goal. The goal is take Poland,

1687
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:58,840
take the Rhineland. That's the goal. Make it happen. And these guys were cut loose to go

1688
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:03,400
and do that. And they did it and they did it quickly and they did it well. And then, like I said,

1689
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:07,480
by the end of World War Two, all the decisions had been centralized back through arrogance.

1690
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:13,080
Because guess what? When you win, every victory increases your confidence in your arrogance,

1691
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:16,040
right? And it doesn't take long to tip it in the wrong direction where you think,

1692
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:22,760
I can take Russia. Hey, no problem. We've got plenty of time. Winter won't come. Oh no,

1693
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:29,560
my friend. Winter is coming. Winter is coming. And that's the big differences there. Now you

1694
02:20:29,560 --> 02:20:33,800
get to Korea. Like I said, Korea was definitely. Wait, one last World War Two question, which is

1695
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:37,720
again, just sort of a philosophical or theoretical thought experiment. If the Japanese had not

1696
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:42,200
attacked Pearl Harbor. In fact, if the Japanese had said, we're never going to wake the sleeping

1697
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:45,240
giant over there. We're going to just keep mucking around over here on our side of the

1698
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:50,120
Pacific Rim. How does World War Two end? Would have been rough. Would the Americans have got

1699
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:54,680
involved? Eventually, I think they would have. I think so. Yeah. Would it have been too little,

1700
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:59,160
too late? Could have been. But they'll tell you what, when you flip the switch on the American

1701
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:04,920
machine, the production, I'm talking about the industry. Like, okay, the war fighters for sure.

1702
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:09,560
Incredible. I mean, I remember speaking of the internet, when the internet first kind of started,

1703
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:13,800
I was on some martial arts. I don't even know what they were called back then,

1704
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:19,160
but it was like a chat page or a forum and I was in it too. And so this is like 90. Yeah,

1705
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:24,760
this is in the mid 90s. Yeah, this is like 90, 93, 94, 95, five may be when I got internet.

1706
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:31,240
I know exactly this moment. And anyways, somebody was talking about the Japanese martial arts and

1707
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:38,760
the Japanese warriors and all that. And the incredible fortitude of the Bushido mindset

1708
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:44,840
that the Japanese empire had. And it was like the first snide Twitter comment I ever made.

1709
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:53,080
But I said the Japanese Bushido warrior spirit was defeated and destroyed by the United States

1710
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:58,600
Marine Corps in the Pacific campaign. And that's the way it is. So the soldier, the marine, the

1711
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:05,240
airman, the sailor from America, man, that is a, you know, there's another great quote. I wish I

1712
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:10,840
had this quote on the top of my head. It was something along the lines of when the Germans

1713
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:18,200
attack, they yell when the British attack, they scream when the French attack, they sing

1714
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:25,320
when the Americans attack, they're silent and they just keep coming. They will not stop. And

1715
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:32,520
that is like just such an awesome in my mind as a kid hearing that I was like, wow, that's powerful.

1716
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:35,320
Right? There's no saying what we're going to do is we're going to do our job. We're going to do it

1717
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:42,600
quietly. We're going to crush. So on top of this American fighting from a humanistic point, from

1718
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:45,880
this culture, this warrior culture, this we have in America, then you want to talk about what we've

1719
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:52,840
lost a little bit. We still have it, but there's no doubt there is an American culture of fighting,

1720
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:58,200
which is deep, right? It's deep. It's part of American culture. Like we're war fighters. We're

1721
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:02,600
revolutionaries. And do you think it's because we are close enough to our independence relative

1722
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:07,160
to some of the other countries? I certainly hope so because you're right. I always say that, hey,

1723
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:11,800
when people get a taste of freedom, that's like the ultimate peacemaker, right? You want a country

1724
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:16,280
to be free or to stop being hostile, give them a taste of freedom, give them a taste of freedom.

1725
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:22,280
And people start seeing that a vast majority of people will say, wow, I like this lifestyle.

1726
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:26,440
You know what people don't want freedom? The people that don't want freedom are the people

1727
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:36,680
that fear that their status will come undone because they'll be judged on their performance.

1728
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:42,840
This is really right. So if you take a country where there's no freedom and freedom starts to

1729
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:47,240
manifest itself, the people that will be scared of the freedom are the people that think if there's

1730
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:50,920
freedom, I'm going to be tested against everyone else and I'm going to fail. So I'm just going to

1731
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:56,120
keep everyone under the heel. Now, do you buy the argument that certain parts of the world,

1732
02:23:56,120 --> 02:24:01,320
let's just take Egypt as an example, benevolent dictatorship is a better model than freedom.

1733
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:04,840
Or do you say that freedom can be included within benevolent dictatorship? In other words,

1734
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:09,000
you know, I don't want to expose myself as the complete ignoramus that I am when it comes to

1735
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:15,160
the politics of the world. But could you make the argument that under a Mubarak style of leadership,

1736
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:20,520
where basically the fundamentalists were shut out, right? I think where you're going with this is to

1737
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:28,520
find out my opinion, I think that those types of situations can be good to usher in true freedom

1738
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:33,240
over time. That's what I think because what you have there, exactly that situation, you've got the

1739
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:37,000
Muslim Brotherhood that is scared of freedom, because they're going to end up in a situation

1740
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,560
that they don't have any control over that they're going to have to compete with other people that

1741
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:43,320
they're going to, they're going to be judged on their merit rather than just being judged on their

1742
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:48,600
force, right? And so they want to stop that. So then you have the government come in and say,

1743
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:53,160
okay, you know what, we're going to instill, we're going to impose freedom, we're going to impose

1744
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:56,600
discipline, right? We're going to impose discipline on the situation, get rid of people that feel that

1745
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:01,320
way. And then hopefully that creates a culture where we can eventually evolve to truly free

1746
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:04,680
society. I mean, the biggest challenge with this, it actually was something that my daughter and I

1747
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:08,840
talked about two nights ago, just by a complete random coincidence, but we were, it was our turn

1748
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:15,080
cleaning up the kitchen. And I don't know how it came up, but somehow she asked me, she said,

1749
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:22,040
who is your favorite president? And I said, probably Lincoln. And I gave all my reasons.

1750
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:26,440
And I said, but you could ask 10 people. And I think half of them would probably say either

1751
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:30,920
Teddy Roosevelt or FDR and kind of walked her through sort of high level history. And she said,

1752
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:37,000
well, what about recent presidents? And I said, you know, it's really tough, Olivia, to evaluate

1753
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:42,520
a president whose presidency has taken place in the last 40 years. And I don't know if my argument

1754
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:46,280
to her made sense, but she seemed to get it, which was like, look, by definition, any decision a

1755
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:51,720
president makes is brutal. Any book you read on presidents, it's like no easy decisions come to

1756
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:57,160
them. So by definition, they're only dealing with the world's worst decisions. And maybe part of me

1757
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:04,680
getting a little older is realizing the humility of that, which is it's a very long arc of history

1758
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:11,800
to be able to truly judge what another person did. And I think if anything, I've got more empathy

1759
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:19,480
for things that at the time I felt very strongly about. Like I remember very strongly in oh four,

1760
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:25,960
seeing Bush talk about what was clearly looking like a botched war in Iraq. I just wanted him to

1761
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:31,480
apologize. I just wanted him to say, I screwed this up. Here's a plan to fix it. And he didn't,

1762
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:35,640
he kept doubling down on, no, this is right. This is right. This is right. And I remember

1763
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:39,240
just being completely turned off. Right. And of course, now I look back and I said, look,

1764
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:45,640
if we're going to be brutally honest, Olivia, I don't think we have enough time to know if any of

1765
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:50,280
these things made sense. You could argue, well, I think it's been enough time since Vietnam to say

1766
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:54,440
that maybe that wasn't the right thing. But even there, once you really start to understand what

1767
02:26:54,440 --> 02:27:00,840
happened in Vietnam and now that it's become quite clear how long, meaning how many generations of

1768
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:06,280
presidents had seen what was happening there, it's not just about blaming one president either.

1769
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:10,440
You can't just say, well, look, this was Johnson's war or this was even Kennedy's war. No, no,

1770
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:19,720
this goes back. This goes back to probably Truman. Right. So this idea that you can't

1771
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:27,080
look through the retrospective scope with a short lens is a scary idea on some ways when you consider

1772
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:33,960
how reactionary we can become. Right. Another point to that is you're making decisions with what you

1773
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:39,800
know at the time. Right. Of course, this happens a lot with combat where people want an armchair

1774
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:43,720
quarterback in hindsight. Right. It's not even just armchair quarterbacking, which is, hey, I'm

1775
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:47,560
sitting out here and I could tell what you could do. But we're armchair quarterbacking in hindsight

1776
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:51,720
with all the perfect knowledge that we have. You don't have that situation. You're making decisions

1777
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:55,000
based on what you know at that time. And you're making the best decision you can. And it's almost

1778
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,560
impossible to actually get in that person's frame of mind when they're making those decisions.

1779
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:03,240
So not only does it take time to pass to see if that was the right decision or not from a

1780
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:08,040
presidential standpoint, but you've got to look and say, what did they actually know at that time?

1781
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:12,280
And okay, you can say, I would have done something different. Really, really, you would have done

1782
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:16,600
something different. And here's another thing that can happen. You can make a great decision and

1783
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:20,360
things can go horribly wrong and you can make a bad decision and things can be fine. That was a

1784
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:25,640
flip side of the discussion with her, which is on one level presidents have to make these really

1785
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:30,520
hard decisions and they only have so much control over it. On the other level, it's like you almost

1786
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:33,640
wonder how much they matter sometimes when, especially when you talk about things like the

1787
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:38,680
economy, every president wants to take credit for a good economy. There's like a hundred other

1788
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:43,560
forces there, right? That are playing a role. You know, how much credit does Clinton deserve

1789
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:48,040
for the booming economy in the late nineties? I don't know. I've read arguments that say none.

1790
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:52,200
I've read arguments that have said all of it, probably neither of those extremes.

1791
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:57,400
Yeah. There's all kinds of factors playing into all those situations, but the economy is obviously

1792
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:01,640
one of my favorite examples of things like the president's touting what the stock market is doing.

1793
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:05,880
Like they've got their hand on that scale. Yeah. Especially if they knew what was going to happen,

1794
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:09,880
which it's going to go down, they might want to keep their mouth a little bit, a little bit to

1795
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:13,560
themselves when they start bragging about how good the economy is doing. Cause it's never going to

1796
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:18,440
keep going in that direction for too long. So now world war two to Korea is a very short period of

1797
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:23,320
time. What was the big strategic tactical or technological change, even though it was a bit

1798
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:27,880
of a reversion to this horrible sort of trench warfare? It was, there wasn't that much time

1799
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:33,080
between these two wars actually. And a lot of they called up veterans from world war two and said,

1800
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:39,000
okay, reload, we're going again. And one really interesting story is, you know, Dick Winters,

1801
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:44,120
who is the guy that's the commander of the second of the five oh six in the band of brothers series.

1802
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:48,280
You've seen that, right? I have, but I don't recall his name. Okay. So he's just an incredible

1803
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:54,600
leader. I've covered books about him and his book on my podcasts. And I talk about band of

1804
02:29:54,600 --> 02:30:00,280
brothers all the time. Cause band of brothers is really incredible leadership story. And Dick

1805
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:07,880
Winters got recalled, go to Korea and they got to San Francisco and they said, Hey, don't know what

1806
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:12,120
the criteria was, but it was something like if you've done two years of world war two, step over

1807
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:17,000
here. And they went over there and they said, does anyone not want to go? Cause you don't have to go.

1808
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:21,240
And Dick Winters was like, I'm not going. So this is what I was thinking about when you were asking.

1809
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:26,520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like there's an example of a guy whose commitment and whose leadership is

1810
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:32,440
impeccable, impeccable. And he'd come home. And I mean, he saw it infinitely more,

1811
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:37,960
infinitely, I can't make that word big enough, more combat than I ever even came close to seeing.

1812
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:43,400
He came home, started a farm in Pennsylvania or whatever, and started doing his thing,

1813
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:47,320
carrying on with his life and got recalled. And they said, Hey, if you don't want to go,

1814
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:52,920
you don't have to. And he said, yeah, I'm going home. And he did. He went home. So that's the way

1815
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:57,560
some people and no one, no one's going to say anything to Dick Winters ever. He died,

1816
02:30:57,560 --> 02:31:02,760
but no one would ever question his patriotism, his willingness to sacrifice his leadership,

1817
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:05,560
his commitment. No one would ever question that in any single way. And when they said,

1818
02:31:05,560 --> 02:31:08,760
Hey, do you want to go? He said, Nope, not going. Cool. I'll go home. Don't need you.

1819
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:12,680
So what was Korea like? Definitely a lot of similar things from world war two. And then

1820
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:18,760
it kind of stagnated into world war one. And now Vietnam is 20, no, not even 20 years later.

1821
02:31:18,760 --> 02:31:23,640
It's basically 10, 15 years later. Yeah. And is that the introduction for Americans to guerrilla

1822
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:30,600
warfare? It definitely is the introduction on a large scale to guerrilla warfare. And that's

1823
02:31:30,600 --> 02:31:35,960
what made it so challenging. We're fighting against asymmetrical situation where we're bigger,

1824
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:42,280
stronger, more well-equipped, technologically more advanced against a foe that is inferior

1825
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:49,720
in all those ways, technology, industry capability. And we came up against someone that knew how to

1826
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:54,600
fight against us and figured it out just like they'd figured out against the French Vietnam's

1827
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:59,000
never been taken. That's a proud history. You've been around for thousands of years and you've

1828
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,200
never been taken. Why is that? Because you know how to fight in retrospect, aside from not going

1829
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:09,320
into Vietnam at all, knowing everything we know today and perhaps what we've learned through

1830
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:14,760
the next huge asymmetric war, which was the one you were a part of. What is the lesson you take

1831
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:20,520
back to that war? If Jaco's in a time capsule and he goes back to 1964. Yeah. These are the common

1832
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:24,040
lessons that everyone talks about. The big thing in a counterinsurgency is you have to win over the

1833
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:28,520
populace. And we didn't do that. We didn't do that in Vietnam. You know who did that? The Viet Cong

1834
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:33,320
did that. The communists did that. They won over the populace. And that's because they are the ones

1835
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:39,160
who protect you, who allow you to be camouflaged, who you mingle. Aside from winning hearts in the

1836
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:45,000
rebuilding, which clearly that makes sense. It seems like that's also important in combat.

1837
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:49,240
Yeah. At a minimum, they're going to passively support the insurgents, which is basically what

1838
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:53,560
happened in Vietnam. There's passive support. The villager doesn't care. The villager just wants

1839
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:57,080
to grow rice. The villagers wants to raise their kids or whatever. That's what the villager wants

1840
02:32:57,080 --> 02:33:02,360
to do. Well, the Americans just dropped the bomb. The Americans shot one of my kids. The Americans

1841
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:06,520
did this and the Viet Cong are coming in saying, hey, why they do this to you, we'll protect you,

1842
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:11,320
we'll help you and plant these booby traps for us. So those are the mistakes we made. One of my

1843
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:15,800
favorite, well, actually my favorite book is called About Face by Colonel David Hackworth. And he was

1844
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:19,800
trying to fight that guerrilla type war, trying to win the hearts and minds. That's what he was trying

1845
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:28,040
to do. And he did it and they did very well with it. But that strategy did not spread. And what you

1846
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:35,800
had was the WizKids. This is another great dichotomy. The WizKids saying, hey, this is how we're going

1847
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:39,160
to beat them. These are the metrics we're going to use to decide if we're winning or not. And everyone

1848
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:43,000
knows now that the metrics that they decided to use was the body count. And so if we're killing

1849
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:48,520
more of the enemy than they're killing of us, then we'll beat him in a war of attrition. And what was

1850
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:53,560
that kill count? It was the I Drang Valley is kind of where we started to realize, wait a second,

1851
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:59,240
we can kill way more of them than they can kill of us. And I think the I Drang Valley, the kill count

1852
02:33:59,320 --> 02:34:07,240
was like 173 to one. So for every one American that was dead, we suspected that we killed

1853
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:14,280
173 or something like that. It's some crazy kill count. And so as Americans, we think to ourselves,

1854
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:18,440
okay, well, who's going to put up with that kind of situation? No one. No one's going to put up with

1855
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:21,800
that. What we didn't realize, you know, who's going to put up with that? The Viet Cong are going to

1856
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:26,360
put up with that. And you know who's not going to put up with losing one? America. There it is.

1857
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:32,360
There's the answer. We fought the war with the wrong strategy. And you stick to your guns and

1858
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:36,680
those whiz kids. And my point is because I do this with businesses, the leadership consulting

1859
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:39,720
company. And sometimes what we deal with is we deal with companies that are looking at metrics,

1860
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:44,040
and they're looking at metrics really hard. And they bring in a consulting company. And what's

1861
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:46,520
that consulting company going to do? And they get there, they're going to look at the metrics,

1862
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:49,480
and they're going to start saying, okay, here's what you need to do to win. You need to drive these

1863
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:53,800
metrics over here. And that's cool. You got to look at metrics, but you got to balance out what's

1864
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:59,080
going on the human side, the human factor, the leadership, what's unfolding inside the company,

1865
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:02,440
what's the culture inside the company? Because if you don't have the right culture inside the

1866
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:07,160
company, the metrics aren't going to matter. And so you have to find that balance between the two.

1867
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:10,760
Sure, you got to check the metrics, you got to make sure that you're not sacrificing more people

1868
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:17,480
than they are. But at the same time, you can't drive your strategy based on pure metrics. And

1869
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:23,320
if you do that, you absolutely have problems. Absolutely. So is McNamara still alive? Or has

1870
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:29,960
he passed away? Dead, I believe. Wes Moreland's definitely dead because I remember when he died.

1871
02:35:29,960 --> 02:35:33,880
I'm trying to remember, wasn't McNamara the one that they did the documentary on the fog of war?

1872
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:37,240
Possibly. I feel like there was a pretty good documentary done. Either I didn't see it or I

1873
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:42,600
saw it so long ago, I don't remember. Did he ever come to grips with the mistakes of Vietnam?

1874
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:46,280
I don't know. Not a whole lot of ownership across the board though, I can tell you that much.

1875
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:55,000
So then we fast forward to the first Gulf War, which is in many ways the greatest technological

1876
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:00,040
leap forward, right? Yes. In terms of like Warcraft. Yeah, because we're talking smart bombs.

1877
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:04,760
Stealth, right? Yeah, night vision. Oh my God, I never even thought of that. You didn't even

1878
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:10,040
have night vision. Vietnam, they had like starlight, but it wasn't anything even close, not even remotely

1879
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:14,120
close to what we have now. So in some ways, you could argue, quote unquote, the problem with the

1880
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:20,920
first Gulf War is maybe a false sense of confidence that this new style of warfare, this shock and awe,

1881
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:26,040
this complete, like there's probably no greater Delta in the technological advantage between

1882
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:30,840
two entities than that war, right? That's a good one. Yeah. And then that becomes the setup of the

1883
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:39,160
hubris a decade later, right? Yeah, I guess. But let's say in the second war in Iraq, we just said,

1884
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:42,440
you know what we're going to do? We're going to get Saddam out of power and then we're going to leave.

1885
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:46,600
If we did that, we were done really quick. Yeah. It was over pretty quick. And then if we were

1886
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:51,560
said, okay, cool, we're done, figured out that would have been, we would have been similar. It

1887
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:55,800
would have been a similar situation over very quickly. I mean, the first one was over in 72

1888
02:36:55,800 --> 02:37:01,800
hours, I think of ground fighting the second one few months. It's interesting as a civilian,

1889
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:09,160
I had a hard time in my mind when the news was coming on to understand the difference between

1890
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:12,440
the different fronts to understand that there was something going on in Afghanistan and there

1891
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:18,120
was something going on in Iraq. And these were under very different control, right? How interchangeable

1892
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:24,280
were the macro units between those two? In other words, were there teams of SEALs also in

1893
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:27,400
Afghanistan, but the groups that were in Afghanistan were always going to stay in

1894
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:30,600
Afghanistan when they were deployed or were you going back and forth potentially?

1895
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:34,760
All services were going back and forth. Yeah. So Marines were going to both, Army were going to

1896
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:42,760
both. The special operations were going to both. Yeah, for sure. You can find all of this information

1897

1899
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:59,400
thing to do is to sign up for my subjectively non-lame once a week email where I'll update you on

1900
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:04,280
what I've been up to, the most interesting papers I've read, and all things related to longevity,

1901
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:09,880
science, performance, sleep, et cetera. On social, you can find me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook,

1902
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:15,000
all with the ID PeterAttiaMD, but usually Twitter is the best way to reach me to share your questions

1903
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:19,960
