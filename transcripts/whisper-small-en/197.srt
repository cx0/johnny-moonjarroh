00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,360
Hey, David. Great to see you today.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,520
My pleasure as always, Peter. Good to see you.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,200
It's been a while since we've seen each other in person. I feel like it's probably been,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
I don't know, three or four years, right?

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,680
Easily. Easily. We've spent many an hour on Zoom together in the last couple of years,

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,120
but it's been a while since we've been in the same state, in the same building, in the

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,680
same room at the same time.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,960
Now you're no stranger to this podcast in the sense that I feel like you probably listen

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,380
to podcasts before anybody. In fact, I think you and Nir Barzilai must hold the record

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,120
for being the first people to listen to a podcast because, you know, they come out on

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,200
Mondays and it's barely the early part of the morning. And usually you and Nir are the

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,720
first two to send me an email with your thoughts. So I know you're a fan and it's great to have

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,000
you on. I've been wanting to do this for some time.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,200
Well, thank you. I really admire the podcast and I admire Nir Barzilai. So to know I'm

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,680
in league with him is pretty cool.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,840
So you're one of the most interesting people I know and I always love just spending time

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,900
with you and talking with you about subjects. And I think one of the things I've always

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:30,660
admired about you is you're known for being in a field such as obesity, which tends to

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:40,940
attract a lot of dogmatic thinking. And yet you tend to approach this field with a distant,

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,020
you know, sort of lack of emotion, right? You just come at it very sort of intellectually.

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,180
And I guess I realize, as I'm saying, that it speaks disparagingly of people in the field

23
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,660
of obesity, which is not really what I'm trying to say. But I think for many people

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,420
the field of obesity is a loaded field scientifically even, let alone sort of politically and all

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,340
the other things that go with it. So I've always assumed that that's because your background

26
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,780
is slightly different than maybe some of the people who came to obesity through physiology.

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,660
So tell us a little bit about your background. What did you study? What did you do your PhD?

28
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,500
And that sort of thing.

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,660
Sure. You know, I sometimes will have people say, you know, why are you like this? Or why

30
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,860
did you do this? Why did you choose that? And the truth is, even as a scientist, often

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,300
say, following my friend Don Rubin, who I admire a lot, we may be able to figure out

32
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,820
what the causal effect of X is, but we may not be able to assess whether X caused Y. So

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,020
I don't really know why it turned out the way I turned out. But even as a kid, I was

34
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,220
always the kid asking questions. Sometimes that would interest people. Sometimes that

35
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,420
would annoy people. And that's true today. But I was always one saying, are you sure?

36
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,780
How do you know? Where did that come from? What makes you think that's true? And then

37
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,580
of course, my kids fed it back to me as they were growing up and heard me say it. And when

38
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,220
I would say to them, don't do that, you'll get hurt. They'd say, what's your evidence

39
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,260
for that data? So, you know, I went to college and I started out knowing I wanted to be a

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,740
psychologist. But what that meant to me at the time was Hitchcock films, right? I was

41
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,540
going to interpret people's dreams and I would figure out what the meaning of the clock

42
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,260
in the dream was or something like that. And then the person would be cured and it would

43
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,620
be a great movie. And then as I got to college, I started to think about, well, what's the

44
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,780
evidence for these things? And that sort of opens up this whole can of worms about asking

45
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,020
about evidence. Became more and more cognitive behaviorally oriented, still thought I wanted

46
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,380
to be a clinician, got to graduate school. And I asked the professor at one point as

47
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,780
we're being trained in graduate school, PhD program, to administer IQ tests. And we're

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,500
learning these different theories of intelligence. Some people think there's one factor, some

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,100
people think three. One person thought 144. And I said, well, who's right? And the professor

50
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,100
says, well, they bring their different evidence to bear and they argue. I said, well, what's

51
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,420
the evidence? He said, these factor analyses. I don't really know what that is. What's a

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,020
factor analysis? He says, well, you have to go study multivariate statistics if you want

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,220
to understand that. So I don't like to take anybody's word for anything. So I went and

54
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,420
studied multivariate statistics and became more and more involved with statistical analysis

55
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,260
to the point where eventually later in my career, people started thinking I was a statistician.

56
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,540
And I stopped fighting it. I said, OK. The American Statistical Association thinks so,

57
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,300
and the university thinks so, and the NIH and NSF thinks so. I think so too. And so

58
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,820
that's great. So I sort of became by evolution a statistician, having been trained as a psychologist.

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,700
But I think all of that comes down to evidence and all the thinking that people are no different

60
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,260
than anything else. Body fat is no different than any other variable. And that still has

61
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,800
to obey the same laws of probability and physics and mathematics and so on that we apply to

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,460
anything else. And I think we often forget that. People talk. And so folks who study

63
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,700
people think about the words that people say. Whereas if you're studying atoms and molecules,

64
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,020
you don't think about the words they say. You just apply scientific methods. The same

65
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,220
person who would never question a diabetologist on what the beta cell of a pancreas is doing,

66
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,180
unless they themselves are a diabetologist studying the beta cells of the pancreas, will

67
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,720
say to an obesity researcher, well, this is how obesity works. And it's this aspect of

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,540
food or that aspect of culture or that aspect of child rearing based only on the fact that

69
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,380
they were children or had children and had some experience. And so to me, it's just taking a step

70
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,860
back and just treating, as my old boss in biostatistics used to say, whether it's X's and Y's,

71
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,420
they're just variables and applying the same laws of thinking to all those systems.

72
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:59,780
So when was it either post PhD or during PhD that you were drawn to obesity in particular as a

73
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,300
clinical field? You know, I actually started as an undergraduate. And so it was, I think,

74
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,220
was a sophomore. And I took a class at Vassar College. And I should say that all my remarks

75
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,660
today just reflect my own opinions. I'm not speaking for Indiana University or Vassar College

76
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:22,780
or anybody else, just myself. And I took a class at Vassar College on human emotion and motivation.

77
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,860
And we studied the theories of Stanley Schachter, who at the time was a professor of psychology at

78
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,900
Columbia University. He's since deceased. An amazing, brilliant man who wrote a book called

79
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,700
Emotion, Obesity and Crime. And he talked about the connections among these and how the distinction

80
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:49,060
between our cognitive state and our physiologic arousal state might lead us to certain kinds of

81
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,300
behaviors, including in the case of some people, eating more calories than they might otherwise

82
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,460
eat. And his experiments were so creative. I just loved it. And he would put like a clock on the

83
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,180
wall. And he would have the clock move a little faster, but not perceptibly faster. And then he

84
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,220
would bring some students in and give them some work to do under some ruse. And then the clock

85
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,260
would say for some of the students at 11am that it was noon. And he'd say, by the way, I have a big

86
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,660
tray of roast beef sandwiches out here. So, you know, whenever you're hungry for lunch, just let

87
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,860
me know and you can have some sandwiches. And for some people, the clock wouldn't say it was noon

88
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,780
until 1pm. And for some people, it was noon at noon. And he'd say, who would be following the

89
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:39,380
clock and who would be following the actual time? And obese or overweight persons were more likely

90
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,860
to follow the clock. And this became the external theory. And then it didn't always work out. And

91
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,580
then you'd have another experiment. Well, it only holds up under this circumstance. And it was

92
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:55,020
incredibly creative how we'd keep looping through. And so I just got hooked on it. Then we had to

93
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,300
write lots and lots of papers at Vassar College. I got a great education in writing and thinking

94
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:06,020
there. Not so many tests, lots of papers. And so when I would take Physiologic Psychology, I would

95
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,300
write about the Physiologic Psychology of obesity. And when I took Behavioral Psychology, I wrote

96
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,460
Behavioral on obesity. When I took Developmental, I'd write about Developmental aspects of obesity.

97
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,220
And I love the fact that you not only could, but in my opinion, had to look at obesity from so many

98
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,500
of those different angles that no one thing was going to do it. Everybody's got their pet thing.

99
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,780
This nutrient is toxic. It's this food marketing practice. It's this cultural practice. It's

100
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,740
exercise. It's not exercise. I think there are many factors involved and I enjoyed studying it

101
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,900
and still do from many angles. Now, this is happening in the late 80s, correct? When you're

102
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:50,380
in school, finishing your PhD. Mid to late 80s. And at the time, what was the both political and

103
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,660
medical view of obesity? I don't think it was the same issue it was today. Was it? Obesity rates

104
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,820
weren't particularly high in the 80s or were they? I don't really recall. They weren't as high as they

105
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:10,900
are now. And there had been steady increases. If you go back and look at data from at least the

106
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,260
1700s forward, there have been relatively steady increases in obesity rates in westernized,

107
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:24,300
industrialized countries since then. But there seemed to be this wake up moment in the late 90s,

108
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,060
in the early 90s with the NHANES III. And so at that point, we didn't have the NHANES, which is

109
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,100
the National Health Nutrition Examination Survey, which annually does today a survey of a representative

110
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,540
sample of Americans with measured heights and weights. That's how we track obesity levels. At

111
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,980
that point, it was only done every few years. And so there was this big gap in years between NHANES II

112
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:57,260
and NHANES III. So NHANES II had happened, I think, in the early 80s or mid 80s. And obesity rates

113
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:03,020
were climbing, but not dramatically. And so obesity was an issue, but it wasn't on top of everybody's

114
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,940
mind, especially for kids. Pharmaceuticals were still seen as the realm of charlatans at that

115
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:16,020
point. If you were a doc and you proposed, promoted the use of obesity medications, you were called a

116
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:23,100
diet doc, and that was like a very bad stigma. There weren't many good medications available.

117
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:31,320
Surgery was still looked at as a very peculiar thing for very extreme cases. And even many medical

118
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:40,760
professionals distained it. And then something happened in the very early 1990s, which is the

119
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:48,360
NHANES III data came out. And what you saw was this big jump in obesity levels. And that got

120
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,600
everybody's attention. And words like epidemic started to be used, especially around childhood.

121
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:02,040
And the public health policy and environmental perspective came in. And things started to shift

122
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,160
in the mid 90s. And that was when you had people like Kelly Brownell, probably one of the most

123
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:14,200
forceful voices at the time, who was a sort of old school, University of Pennsylvania,

124
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:23,560
colleague of Tom Wadden, devotee, a student of Mickey Stunkard, of the cognitive behavioral

125
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,520
individual clinical treatment approach to obesity, suddenly starting to say, maybe we've got it

126
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,800
wrong. Maybe it's this environment. I don't know if Kelly coined the term toxic environment,

127
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,280
but he certainly either coined it or popularized it. And people started to think about prevention

128
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:51,000
and children and the overall environment, the political, economic, social, food marketing

129
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:59,080
environment we lived in. And it all started to take off. And ideas from the cigarette world,

130
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,280
the same public health people who had been battling cigarette companies and tobacco for decades,

131
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,240
many of they and their tools came in and said, we know how to deal with things that are environmental,

132
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,600
social, political problems. And it began to be seen as an environmental, social, political problem.

133
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,400
And in some way, a lot was gained because we got a lot more funding for it, we got a lot more

134
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,760
attention, a lot more efforts, a lot more research. But in some ways, it was lost. In the early 90s,

135
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,280
when I kind of grew up in the field, I grew up in the first federally funded obesity research

136
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,040
center, which is the New York obesity research center for a long time, the only one. And by gosh,

137
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,120
if as a young postdoc, I were to say something that didn't quite jibe with physiology or genetics

138
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,560
or anatomy or clinical medicine, there was a physiologist and a geneticist and an anatomist

139
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,240
and a medical doctor who would say, uh-uh. And they knew all, they knew each other,

140
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,960
they knew the arguments, they knew the literature for the last 20 years.

141
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,240
Then the public health people came in fresh without kind of knowing so much. So on the one hand,

142
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,280
it launched things up a lot, which was great. But on the other hand, back to what you were

143
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,520
saying earlier about the dilution of the rigor of the field intellectually, it became a lot more

144
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,960
of opinion, a lot more of advocacy in the absence of rigorous evidence showing what worked. You're

145
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,440
just saying, this seems like it ought to work. So David, prior to NHANES III and prior to

146
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,720
Kelly and others saying, hey, we should look for something else, what was believed to be the

147
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,800
environmental or otherwise trigger for obesity? In other words, what was viewed as the cause?

148
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,520
Yeah, I don't know that there was a single cause. I mean, clearly, what some people today call the

149
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,960
energy balance model, which we can go back to and ask whether that really is even a model in some

150
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:01,080
realistic sense, I think was then and still is today by most people in the field, except that as

151
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,200
valid, but maybe not as a model, maybe as a description of what occurs.

152
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Yeah, I was going to say that's sort of a tautology and doesn't really tell us anything.

153
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,160
It's implied and obvious and not explanatory.

154
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,800
Right. I think not explanatory is maybe the best way of describing it in some sense.

155
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,960
The analogy I would use to that is I think the energy balance statement, I won't say model,

156
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,560
say the energy balance statement is as long as you accept the laws of thermodynamics unequivocally

157
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,000
correct in the same sense as if you accept Euclidean geometry, the statements about the

158
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,840
relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse of a triangle are unequivocally correct.

159
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:55,400
But if I say to you, I have a triangle of this size with legs of length A and B, and I proportionately

160
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,920
imagine another triangle that has legs greater than length A and B, it doesn't cause the

161
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:10,040
hypotenuse to be bigger. It means the hypotenuse is bigger. And if I say I imagine one with a

162
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,760
bigger hypotenuse, it doesn't cause the legs to be bigger. It means the legs are bigger.

163
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,440
And any question about whether the legs cause the hypotenuse or the hypotenuse

164
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,760
cause the legs is nonsense. They don't cause each other. They're inherent in the definition of

165
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,600
triangle just as inherent in the definition of energy is the law of conservation. And it just

166
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,920
says delta energy stores equals delta energy in minus delta energy out. It's just a statement.

167
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,800
So was the belief though that this was behavioral prior to NHANES III was the belief that,

168
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:52,120
well, if a person is overweight or obese, they are just eating more than they're expending

169
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,680
because of a choice? I think it's almost hard to answer that because I think the thinking was,

170
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,560
and still remains, so sloppy that people don't even distinguish among things well. I was just

171
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:12,600
invited to a panel literally today that I'm going to be on in a few months where somebody said,

172
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,240
we're going to contrast for obesity the relative influence of biology versus behavior.

173
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,520
As though we could behave without biology. I mean, I don't know about you, but I'm not a

174
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:31,000
disembodied soul. And if you're a disembodied soul, maybe. But for the rest of us who are in the

175
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,480
material world, you behave with a body and it's got to obey the same laws of physics and so on

176
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:44,200
that any other body has to behave. So I think there's a lot of sloppy thinking, but I think if

177
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,840
you really drill down and you got to smart people who understood, they would say, of course, they're

178
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,160
a genetic component. Any rancher could have told you a hundred or more years ago that there's a

179
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,600
genetic component. We can selectively breed animals for being thinner or fatter. That shows you there's

180
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,360
a genetic component. There are many other things I'd show you that, but that's probably the strongest

181
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,680
prima facie evidence. You can selectively breed animals to be fatter or leaner.

182
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,400
It's prima facie evidence. But by the way, is the concordance of identical twins separated at birth?

183
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,200
I've always found that to be one of the most interesting ways to assess everything from

184
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,120
autism to schizophrenia. Like it's really a beautiful natural experiment. But I don't know

185
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,680
what the concordance is with respect to obesity and identical twins separated. Do you? Yeah. There are

186
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,600
a lot of different ways to quantify that, and we've written a couple of papers on it. But I think

187
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,680
the easiest way is just the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, the ordinary

188
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:50,040
correlation coefficient of BMI twin to twin. And it turns out that for monozygotic or identical twins

189
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:59,320
separated at or near itly after birth, it's nearly the same magnitude as it is for twins reared

190
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:08,200
together, which is about 0.9 ish. Wow. It varies from study to study. So it's very similar. And so

191
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,640
it's probably now, of course, you can argue, well, that also takes into account the

192
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,680
contribute or environment. Yeah, exactly. Maybe some epigenetic things. But bottom line is whatever

193
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,280
those things are, they're not just the child rearing of the home. It looks like for many traits,

194
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,160
including obesity, the child rearing of the home does have an influence, but it's not a huge

195
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,960
influence. That's an incredible degree of concordance. It sure is. When was that realized?

196
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,520
When were those studies first done? Well, it's interesting because you can go back to quite some

197
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,520
period of time to find the hints of those studies. And often when you look at science, it's often

198
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,200
that we at some level, we kind of knew something. The information was sort of there, but there was

199
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:03,960
this moment where a key figure had to come in and both see it and say it with a degree of crispness

200
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,000
that wasn't there before. As I said, so lots of people could have seen the ranching data and the

201
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,920
mouse data and family data. In 1923, Davenport, who he's kind of looked at now probably as a racist

202
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:23,240
from the past, but at the time, Davenport published under the Carnegie Foundation these studies of

203
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,360
concordance of families. And you could have seen the genetic component in his 1923 data,

204
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,680
but it was Albert J. Mickey Stunkard, who was someone I had the great privilege of knowing

205
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:45,480
and a wonderful, wonderful man. And Mickey did the first major high quality twin and adoption

206
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,240
studies, and he did what he was great at. He got on a plane and he went around the world and he

207
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,640
met bright, young, interesting people and he said, you have resources and you have ideas and you have

208
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,240
data and you're smart. Can I work with you? Can we work on this together? And he got Torquilled

209
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,560
Sorensen and other people to start working on twin studies with the great Nordic data,

210
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,480
Sweden, Denmark, and so on, and adoption studies. And it was the twin and adoption studies coming

211
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,800
out of Sweden and Denmark that I think really nailed it. That finally, New England Journal of Medicine

212
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,000
with Mickey Stunkard behind it, with clear writing, with high quality data, people said,

213
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,280
we got it. There's a big genetic component. And this was approximately what year, David?

214
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:38,440
This would have been 83 ish plus or minus a couple. So again, trying to bring this back to

215
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,480
kind of the clinical side of things. So if by the early eighties, it's or it should be patently

216
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:53,400
clear that genetics are playing an important role, it would be at least a decade before people would

217
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,880
say, well, pharmacologic therapy might make sense here. Just as, for example, if somebody

218
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,760
is genetically more likely to have hypothyroidism, right, a very relatively straightforward

219
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:14,200
endocrinology or endocrine system to understand, we wouldn't really think twice about replacing or

220
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:23,400
you know, abrogating thyroid hormone as necessary. So where was that disconnect where it's the early

221
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,360
eighties and we realize there's a very strong genetic component to this, we probably have some

222
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:35,160
medical tools that we could use. But it still seems like that wasn't being done. So what what

223
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,240
was being done? Were was it just a case of counseling people to eat less and exercise more?

224
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:49,160
It was mostly developing the tools that would help people reduce energy intake. And I think today,

225
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:57,000
that's still most of what we do. So even surgery and drugs, mostly, but not only help people reduce

226
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,600
energy intake. We know that reducing energy intake works, it's just really hard to do and telling

227
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,960
people to do it and saying, I'll try to do it is not all that effective. And so all these things

228
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,320
were tools and we use the tools of behavior therapy, starting in, I would say really the

229
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,880
60s is probably where the formal behavioral stuff really kicked in with I think was Stuart

230
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,240
and the behavioral thinking about obesity, then it continued to get better and better,

231
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,080
all the way through present still continues to get better and better. But my sense is that, you know,

232
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,640
we've been asymptoting for a long time. That is, we're getting incrementally better,

233
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,800
not meaningfully better with many of the behavioral cognitive things. What happened then

234
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,240
in the early 90s is, and I remember because I was a postdoc at the New York obesity research center

235
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:59,320
at the time, is a few people started to really kick in with pharmaceuticals. And they started to come

236
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,080
out of this idea that you're a diet doc and it's a bad thing. And fen-phen, which now we know was

237
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:12,680
dangerous and is gone, at least one of the fens in fen-phen, that came up and that caught people's

238
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,720
attention. Tell folks a little bit about fen-phen. Many people listening probably won't be familiar

239
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,520
with what it is, how it worked, and what the unfortunate consequence was in a small but

240
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:30,440
non-trivial subset of people. So fen-phen was, is a nickname for two drugs used in combination,

241
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,840
fentramine and fen-fluoramine. Fentramine is a drug that was and still is approved by the FDA

242
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,200
for the treatment of obesity, though it's never been approved for long term. So it goes back a

243
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,800
long way. It's a catecholaminergic agonist. It's a relatively safe drug, though not a,

244
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:56,920
no drug is perfectly safe. And it's modestly effective. Fen-fluoramine is a selective

245
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:03,400
serotonergic reuptake inhibitor, which I think originally was used for depression.

246
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:11,080
And people realized sometimes those drugs, those SSRIs cause weight loss. Somebody realized you

247
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,160
could put those two together and seem to get better results. So that became a big craze.

248
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:23,000
And there were many unscrupulous medical providers who did provide that in ways they

249
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,160
shouldn't have. But there were many scrupulous medical providers who used it carefully and

250
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:34,120
thoughtfully. And it did seem to have much better benefit than other people had predicted before

251
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:41,480
that. And so suddenly, pharmaceutical treatment was no longer the realm of drive-through pill mills

252
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,280
and charlatans and diatox and rainbow pills and so on. It was starting to be credible. You had

253
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,600
people like George Bray, who's still around today and working on obesity, jumping on board and

254
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,720
starting to really think through all the cornucopia of pharmaceuticals we knew about and which ones

255
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:07,160
might be useful, others weighing in. And then a very smart young person whose name I no longer

256
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:14,040
recall, but who was a pathologist, not an obesity researcher as far as I know, at the Mayo Clinic,

257
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:22,360
started noticing some people coming through as cadavers. And she was being asked to do autopsies

258
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,240
and did autopsies and started noticing a peculiar valvulopathy that she didn't see very often. And

259
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,520
she started seeing a little run of cases and then noticed that all of these cases had been on fen-phen

260
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:43,000
and reported it. And then many, many other people started to investigate it. And very quickly,

261
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,240
people realized, in fact, this did produce a certain valvulopathy. And further investigation

262
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,040
made it clear it was the fenfloramine component, not the fen-ter-mine component that did that.

263
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:00,280
So the fen-floramine was withdrawn. Fen-ter-mine is still used today. But I think what was

264
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,040
terrible, of course, is that one of the many drugs in the history of obesity that hurt people.

265
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:13,480
But what was good about it is that it really started getting people thinking more about

266
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,640
obesity as a serious medical disorder that merited serious attention from credible physicians

267
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,640
and credible scientists working at the molecular, pharmaceutical, and physiologic level.

268
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,240
And how much of fen-phen's mechanism was understood? I mean, obviously, at the superficial

269
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:40,840
level it was. But in terms of its direct action, was the belief that one component was simply

270
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,800
increasing energy expenditure while the other was reducing appetite?

271
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,200
I don't think it was quite that simple. And I don't think with any of these things, we ever

272
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,480
fully know the components. This is where you know far more than I. But I mean, even in the case of

273
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,200
statins, which we think so highly of and use so well, whether they really have their beneficial

274
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,440
effects by reducing LDL cholesterol, which is sort of the initial thought, or through other

275
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:09,240
mechanisms, I think is even being debated now. I think we suspected and still would believe

276
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,880
that they reduced appetite and therefore helped people control their food intake better, that the

277
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,840
two things did it through slightly different mechanisms, one being more serotonergic, one

278
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,840
being more adrenergic. They may have also had effects on energy expenditure, albeit probably

279
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,960
modest ones. And that was probably more the fentramine than the fenfloramine. In terms of

280
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,440
the mechanism for the valvulopathy, I'll have to leave that to you. That's out of my realm.

281
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,040
And when was fen-phen pulled? Was that the mid to late 90s?

282
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,280
I think it was the late 90s, but I don't remember the exact date, probably 97-ish somewhere around

283
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:53,400
there. What about gastric bypass and other surgical approaches? Now we have sleeves,

284
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,960
ruin why, all sorts of different approaches to it. But when did that sort of go from being

285
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:08,040
presumably incredibly fringe to, quite frankly, where we are today, where this is something that

286
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,080
will be covered by an insurance company if the BMI is high enough?

287
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,320
I don't know that there was a single moment, so I think there's been a sort of a relatively

288
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,720
steady march, but I do think there was one key step that was kind of a step function in the

289
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:30,120
credibility of it. And that was the Swedish obese subject study as from Lars Schostrum in Sweden.

290
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,840
Surgery had been around for a while. Interestingly, even among physicians and scientists,

291
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,600
it was very controversial, and still is. Some people think it's Bob Eric, some people think

292
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,560
it's uphorn. Again, I think you just have to take the data as it is. You might say, wouldn't

293
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,040
it be better if we had a world where no one needed surgery, where our solution to obesity

294
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,560
was not let children start to gain weight, and then when they become massively obese adults,

295
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,480
give them surgery and rearrange their internal anatomy? Yeah, it probably would be better.

296
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,840
But that's not the world we live in. We live in this world, and in this world,

297
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,240
that's the most effective, life-saving, life-changing treatment we have, and it's a good one.

298
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,840
And so what happened is many physicians would battle among each other. I remember John Kral,

299
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:30,040
who's since passed on, a very good surgeon, one of another physician colleague chastising him over

300
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,320
dinner at a conference and saying, when you're done with a patient, Dr. Kral, they will never

301
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,400
eat normally again. And he said, no, when I'm done, they will never eat abnormally again.

302
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:47,400
So there were these real vitriolic battles. I think what happened is the surgeries, of course,

303
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,600
got better and better and better. I said, everything else, people learn how to do things

304
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:57,560
better. Mortality rates went way down. Efficacy went up. But what Lars Schostrum did is he said,

305
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,800
I want to look at whether this prolongs life. And I remember him telling me many decades ago

306
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:10,840
that his senior mentor, Per Bjornthorpe, who was known for fat cell theories and the Apple versus

307
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,680
Pear idea, where I was originally Jean Vague, was Apple versus Pear from France in the 1950s.

308
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,160
But then in the 80s, really, 70s and 80s, Bjornthorpe was one of the big people who picked it up.

309
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,240
Bjornthorpe laughed at his mentoring. He says, Lars, everybody knows this. Everybody knows that

310
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,400
surgery will cause weight loss and help people live longer. There's no point in doing this study.

311
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,960
And Lars said, you may be right that it does, but we have to do this study because everybody

312
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,480
doesn't accept and believe that and hasn't been shown. And I think we know over and over again,

313
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,520
you've got to do the experiment. As John Hunter famously said to Edward Jenner, when Jenner says,

314
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,000
I think, and he's thinking about the first vaccine, and Hunter comes back and says, why think,

315
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:01,240
do the experiment? You've got to do the experiment and show it. So Schostrum didn't do a pure

316
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:07,880
experiment. It's not a randomized trial, but it's a controlled trial. And the IRB at the time didn't

317
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,600
think it was ethical to randomly assign people to the surgery or not. So if they're willing to get

318
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,200
surgery, he would find a closely matched control and give them usual care. And then what he showed

319
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,600
well more than a decade later in the New England Journal of Medicine is that the surgery reduced

320
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:34,280
mortality rate. It reduced obesity, very powerful effects, clearly a life saving and a beneficially

321
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,680
life changing treatment. I think that was probably the big jump. And then since then,

322
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,960
many other trials, some randomized, have been done showing positive benefits on many things,

323
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,440
including longevity. Do you recall what the risk reduction was in all-cause mortality in that study?

324
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:57,320
I don't recall in that study per se, but when you look across studies, it varies quite a bit from

325
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,200
study to study. There's a lot of heterogeneity, but it's usually well on the order of a 50%

326
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,200
reduction, sometimes a little bit more. And maybe getting to in the weeds on this, but

327
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,040
how does that change when you do and do not correct for the presence of type 2 diabetes

328
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:21,640
at the outset? In other words, I would imagine that that's a combination of people who had and

329
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,920
did not have type 2 diabetes. And do you have a sense of what the differences are amongst those

330
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:33,560
two cohorts? Your premise is correct that it is among people who do and don't have type 2 diabetes.

331
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,680
But no, I don't know at the top of my head. I share your intuition that it's probably stronger

332
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,840
among people who do. And we need to also look at many different factors. So for example, in the

333
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,760
Swedish Obese Object Study, and I'm not sure this would hold up at all, one of the things that was

334
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,520
very puzzling and surprising, at least to me, was that although diabetes really came down and stayed

335
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,240
down very well, even if weight came back up a little, which it did on average, hypertension

336
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:09,080
came down very well, but did not stay down very well. It would come back up. And why that is,

337
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,360
is it damage to the endothelial elasticity that's not really repairable, and so you get a

338
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,440
short-term effect of negative energy balance that's not sustained? I don't know. But it goes

339
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,120
back to that John Hunter thing. You've got to do the experiment. And so we can't make our priority

340
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,440
assumptions about the effects of treatments. We've got to do the experimental look at the effects of

341
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,400
treatment. It's interesting that hypertension would return, and yet mortality would still

342
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:45,000
improve, which suggests that perhaps the benefits of improved insulin sensitivity, which do persevere,

343
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,520
play a greater role in mortality than body weight, which does not surprise me,

344
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,600
but also hypertension, which is somewhat surprising, given how causally related hypertension

345
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,880
is at atherosclerosis. Well, it may not be a greater role as much as an additional role,

346
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,080
right? So it could be that if you got the hypertension down, you'd get an even bigger reduction.

347
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:16,760
So when did this idea of kind of an obesity paradox, which I know you've written about,

348
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:25,960
when did that start to become observed? I think that phrase obesity paradox has never been

349
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,080
really crisply defined, and whether it really is something that's a paradox is not clear. People

350
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:38,440
use it to mean at least two different things. One thing is that there's this so-called U-shaped

351
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,520
curve, more accurately concave upward as a bathtub-shaped curve, if you imagine a Cartesian or

352
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:52,680
XY plot in which the Y or ordinate is mortality rate or some function of it, and the X is BMI or

353
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,920
relative body weight or something. So one is that it is U-shaped, that it's not monotonic increasing.

354
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:06,200
And so people at the very thin end also die earlier than people in the middle, just as

355
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,520
people at the very heavy end die earlier than people in the middle. Now, the Duchess of Windsor

356
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,880
has supposedly said, you can never be too rich or too thin. And she may have been right on the rich

357
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,920
part, I don't know, haven't gotten there yet, but apparently not on the too thin part. Now,

358
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,320
we can argue whether it's causal, and there are lots of arguments about whether it's causal.

359
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,840
But that's one thing, it's the idea that thinner people than sort of intermediate levels of BMI

360
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:37,480
also die earlier. That's one part. The other part is that even though obesity is associated with

361
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,720
increased mortality rate or decreased longevity, that when you look at people who are sick

362
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,880
or injured, they often live the longest. So somebody comes in with kidney failure,

363
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,560
or someone comes in after a major injury or a major infection, they're in the hospital,

364
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,600
it's often the heaviest people that live longer. And that started to be talked about 10, 15 years

365
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:08,920
ago, maybe. It's very difficult to disentangle cause and effect. We can observe lots of associations,

366
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,360
but it's just hard to know what to make of all of these associations and what's causal.

367
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,040
As the philosophers say, the hypotheses are underdetermined by the data. There are multiple

368
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,240
hypotheses that are consistent with the data. That's why the randomized experiment allows us

369
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,160
to do things that otherwise we can't do, sort of eliminates more competing hypotheses. So

370
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,880
I don't think we know what's causal yet. We've thrown out a model, a man named Doug Childers

371
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,880
and I, who's a postdoc, who was a good mathematician working with me, in which we said,

372
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,440
what if obesity makes it more likely that you get a major illness or injury?

373
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,320
So it's not good for your health in that sense. Age, of course, also makes it more likely that

374
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:04,360
you get a major illness or injury. But once you get a major illness or injury, being heavier,

375
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:11,640
more obese, may reduce your risk of dying from it. And an analogy I use is this. Suppose you and

376
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,120
I are sort of going for a hike on the edge of the Grand Canyon and we go to some outfitter who's

377
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:23,240
setting us up. And he says to you, who's about 10 years younger than me, I think, and he says to you,

378
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,000
you have a choice. I can give you this fat suit you can wear. It has lots of padding on it.

379
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,040
If you fall off the cliff, it makes it much more likely you'll survive.

380
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,880
But it makes you a little clumsy, so it makes you more likely to fall off the cliff.

381
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,600
You might say, I've got good balance and good eyesight and I'm young and strong. And no,

382
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,080
it comes to me and I say, I'm not quite as young and strong. Maybe. I don't know. It comes to me,

383
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:51,240
somebody 10 years older than me, that person says, I'm really struggling with my eyesight or balance

384
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:57,480
or strength. I'll take the fat suit. All right. And so whether the fat suit is good for you may

385
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,440
depend upon your probability of falling to begin with. And under that mathematical model, we can

386
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:11,080
show, in fact, that the point of BMI, the nadir of that bathtub-shaped concave upward curve,

387
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:18,680
should keep moving to the right as you age, which is exactly what it does. So we have a model that's

388
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,840
consistent with the data, but the data don't prove our model. There are other models that

389
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:30,120
would be consistent with it. Let's give people an idea of what those numbers look like. So just

390
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,440
for someone listening to this, maybe I'm not even watching, it can be hard to imagine what we're

391
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,800
talking about, right? But a U-shaped curve that at its nadir is giving you the optimal BMI. This

392
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,160
would be the lowest mortality. And what you're saying is rather than just plot one of these

393
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,040
curves for everybody, let's plot them by decade. So what does the U-shaped curve look like for

394
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:58,040
people in their 20s, in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, up to their 90s? And what you're saying is,

395
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:05,080
if your hypothesis is correct, one place you would expect to see that is that these curves would not

396
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,560
only not look the same by decade, but they would move rightward, meaning the nadir is getting to

397
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:17,160
a heavier and heavier BMI. Can you give me a sense of how much movement there is by decade?

398
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:27,080
Yeah. In fact, I'm going to smooth over things. So the story I'm about to tell you is not perfectly

399
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,720
true, but it's sort of a roughly true, and it sort of conveys the sort of nice element of this.

400
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,320
The average American might gain about a pound a year. For an average height American,

401
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,080
about six or so pounds might be a BMI unit, right? If you gained about six pounds,

402
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:51,320
you might gain about a BMI unit. And so that might mean that over six years,

403
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,880
you'd be about one BMI unit heavier. And that's not too far off from how the nadir moves. It's

404
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:05,480
almost as though your weight is increasing to keep you on at the nadir, which is an interesting

405
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:14,360
speculation. And if you looked at people who are maybe 20 years old, that nadir might not be too

406
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:21,160
far from 20 in some populations. An astute reader of the epidemiologic literature who's listening

407
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,880
now might appropriately be saying, hey, wait a minute now, Alison needs to make distinctions by

408
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,520
age, race, and sex. He's doing age. He's not doing race and sex and other factors, and they'd be

409
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,360
right. We can come back to that if you wish. But putting that aside for the moment, very loosely

410
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,960
speaking, you might say that nadir might be far down near 20 when you're 20. And by the time you're

411
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,120
80, it's not to 80. But by the time you're 80, it might be well above 30. It might be in the low

412
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:57,480
30s where that nadir is, which is we generally say 30 is the beginning of obesity. And for those

413
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,760
who are not used to BMIs, I used to lay it out like this. The supermodel, Kate Moss, at least from a

414
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,440
few decades ago when she was the top model, had a BMI, I think, in 16 to 17 range. We say that about

415
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:18,600
18.5 is sort of the beginning of normal weight. We think less than that is underweight. My BMI

416
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:25,880
right now is probably 21-ish. Bill Clinton's at the height of his presidency. He's since lost

417
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:33,880
way. He was probably 27, 28. We say 30 is where obesity begins. And a secretary sumo wrestler,

418
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:41,160
top class sumo wrestler, about 43, 44. So that gives you a sense of what those BMIs are. And so

419
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:49,320
it's really 30, 32, where you see people 70, 80 and above having that lowest mortality rate.

420
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,760
Is there a risk that we're looking at confounders here? I don't know if this would be a confounder.

421
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,760
It wouldn't seem like it would be a confounder in this year, meaning in this time and place we're

422
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,480
in. But would it be a confounder for affluence, for example, as it may have been hundreds of years

423
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:21,240
ago? You know, other things like that. And the other thing about BMI is, you know, when you look

424
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:29,800
at other data that look at body composition, do we see the same thing hold up? So you can have a BMI

425
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,600
of 30 and not even though you're obese by BMI, no one would look at you and say you're obese.

426
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:44,680
You might have a body fat of 15 percent, which is pretty low and be incredibly muscular, for example.

427
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:52,360
So how do we reconcile one, the potential confounders of that type of an analysis with

428
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:00,920
sort of this other next layer of granularity in the data that look at adiposity versus lean mass?

429
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,000
Let's start with the confounding question. Now let's get to the body composition. Of course,

430
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,240
the confounding question is a nightmare. This is the challenge of observational research in general.

431
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,200
And there's no simple solutions to it other than, in my opinion, trying to triangulate on the answer

432
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,760
with multiple studies. What we really want is the pure randomized experiment in humans,

433
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,800
in large samples, with perfect compliance for many years. And we want to randomly assign people to

434
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,320
be obese or not obese. Obviously, we can't do that. So what do we do? Well, we look at observational

435
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,200
epidemiology. We look at randomized trials where we have people lose weight. We look at non-randomized

436
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,920
trials like showrooms with surgery. We look at mouse studies. You know, we look at all these

437
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,360
different things. We try to just put the puzzle together as best we can. But there's absolutely

438
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,400
a lot of possibility for confounding. Cigarette smoking was one of the early ones. Very famous

439
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,960
paper by Joanne Manson and colleagues published in New England Journal, excuse me, at JAMA,

440
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,320
pointing out that the quote right way, according to them, to analyze BMI and mortality data was

441
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,280
you must exclude ever smokers. You only look at never smokers. Otherwise, you may have confounding

442
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,760
by smoking. Smoking makes you thinner. Smoking kills you earlier. You've got to take care of that.

443
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,480
You've got to throw out the subjects who die early because subjects who die early may have

444
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,040
been sick. Sickness makes you thinner. Sickness makes you die earlier. That is a confounder.

445
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,560
We've since proved mathematically that that's not a good thing to do. But for a long time,

446
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,040
it was believed. Is that even true, David, on the low end? Because that does strike me as one of

447
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:45,560
the most obvious explanations for the uptick in mortality at very low BMIs is all of the

448
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,320
delivered disease, the kidney disease, the types of chronic diseases that actually do

449
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,640
lead to muscle wasting and things like that. Are you also including them in your analysis?

450
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,600
So yes, we are. What we showed is not that that confounding doesn't occur.

451
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,280
That confounding absolutely can occur, or we agree that it can occur. We speculate. We think

452
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,680
it's likely. What we've shown is that throwing out subjects who die early in the analysis doesn't

453
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,120
help or doesn't reliably help. It was very interesting back to the discussion of the field.

454
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,960
When I went to analyze my first BMI mortality data set, I had no training in this, so I get a data

455
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,960
set and I'm about to try it. I don't know what I'm doing. So I call up my friends and I say,

456
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,360
I read this paper in JAMA and it says you have to eliminate the early deaths. But how do I do

457
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:43,720
that? How do I pick how many years to do? Exactly how does this work? And it was interesting because

458
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,560
when I would call the epidemiologists and I would say, how does this work? And then I'd say, by the

459
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,680
way, is there a reference that explains and proves that this works? They'd say, no, it's obvious that

460
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,480
it works. I said, well, it's not obvious to me. And they said, well, maybe you're not smart enough

461
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:07,320
to be an epidemiologist. Okay. Those words were actually uttered? Jokingly. But yeah, then I would

462
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,240
call my friends with statisticians and I would say, there's this paper and it says you have to

463
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,680
eliminate the early deaths. They would laugh at me like, what? That's the most ridiculous thing

464
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,600
I've ever heard. We don't just throw out data and think it makes things better. You've got to have

465
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,960
a model that you fit things to. So we then got a small grant from the CDC and we looked at

466
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,080
mathematical proofs, computer simulations, and meta-analyses. And the mathematical proof showed

467
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,200
it not only didn't have to help reduce the confounding, it could make it worse.

468
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,440
Simulations showed the same thing in realistic data scenarios. And then the meta-analyses showed

469
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,920
that on average didn't make much difference at all. So throwing out the subjects who die early

470
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:52,280
basically just reduces your power in most practical situations. Then they would say,

471
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,480
you've got to not control for the intermediary variables like the diabetes and hypertension.

472
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:04,520
That's probably true. I think I would agree with that. Later in subsequent paper in 1995 in the

473
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,680
Journal of Medicine, that same group said, you've got to throw out the subjects who have more weight

474
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:14,600
variability. All the things they said in 1987 weren't enough to flatten out that left end of the

475
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,880
U-shaped curve. So they said, throw out the subjects who die, who have a lot of weight

476
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:26,600
fluctuation. And that didn't completely get rid of it, but got rid of most of it. That's the bigger

477
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:33,160
one. But what it means is unclear. Katherine Fleagle has written very well on this and talked

478
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,360
about these different things and how much you're throwing away and pointing out, yes, these are the

479
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:44,280
patterns we observe, but what they mean causally is unclear. So that's the whole confounding issue.

480
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,080
The bottom line is it's likely that there's confounding by cigarette smoking and socioeconomic

481
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,360
status and stigma. That's one of the big things, right? How much does obesity kill you because it

482
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:01,240
stigmatizes you and it creates some stress? Could be. And that may be, by the way, why the BMI

483
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,920
associated with the lowest mortality has been increasing over calendar time. That's not just

484
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,760
with age of individuals, but if you compare data collected in the 1970s to data collected in the

485
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,720
1990s, obesity doesn't, from an association point of view, look quite as bad in the 1990s as it did

486
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,800
in the 1970s. And that's true in Denmark and that's true in the US and it's true in meta-analysis,

487
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,800
although again, not for every age-race sex group. Why is that? And maybe it's stigma. Maybe it's that

488
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:40,040
if you think about, you watch like the Three Stooges, those old TV shows, and there was Curly

489
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:48,360
and he was often mocked as the fat guy, right? By today's standards, he's not that big. And so,

490
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:55,240
what stigmatized changes over time as different BMIs become normative. And so, it may be that

491
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,280
that's partially accounting for it. So, there's lots of potential confounding going on there,

492
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,920
but there's lots of other possible explanations. So, bottom line, we don't know. And the real

493
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,280
important question then is, what's the effect of intervention? This goes back to my friend

494
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,680
and someone I really idolized in the field, one of the clearest thinkers, Don Rubin,

495
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,520
statistician at Harvard, talks to another Rubin causal model. And he's always asking,

496
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,720
what's the intervention? If you say, does this cause that? What do you mean, compared to what?

497
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,880
It's always got to be compared to what, right? And so, if you say weight loss is going to increase

498
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,240
longevity, that's the question. Well, how are you going to achieve that weight? What are you going

499
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,360
to do to get that? Well, then if it's surgery, then what's the effect of surgery? It's a GLP1

500
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,960
agonist. What's the effect of a GLP1 agonist, et cetera. So, that I think is the key question.

501
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,880
And I think what we're starting to see is some of those things do prolong life, surgery,

502
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:57,160
SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP1 agonist, and so forth. Now, to your other question about body composition,

503
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:05,880
many people like to point out that BMI is a measure of mass divided by stature. It was

504
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,520
developed by Adolf K. Ley, who was a Belgian astronomer, epidemiologist, statistician,

505
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:19,000
mathematician back in the 19th century. Brilliant guy. We actually named a professorship after him

506
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,320
and I held that title. I was very grateful for that opportunity back when I was at the University

507
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:30,680
of Alabama at Birmingham before I came to IU. And Kaitlin made it, you would think that BMI,

508
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:38,680
or rather the mass of a three-dimensional object ought to increase in proportion to the cube

509
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:44,920
of a linear dimension. And if in fact we were spheres of uniform density, that would be true.

510
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,640
But I don't know about you, I'm not a sphere of uniform density. So, it turns out not to work that

511
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:55,880
way exactly. Turns out that empirically, it works closer to the square for adult humans.

512
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:03,960
Kaitlin realized that and so he said, take mass or weight over stature squared, the square of stature.

513
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,880
That's, then it was called Kaitlin's index, now we call it BMI. It was sort of rediscovered in the

514
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:18,760
60s or 70s by Ansel Keys and term BMI, body mass index. And every few years some smart person likes

515
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,440
to come along and says, it should be cubed. We get it, we knew that like a couple hundred years ago

516
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,760
and we worked that out. Then they say, and it doesn't really take into account body composition.

517
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:37,640
We say, we know that. And they say, the NBA center would have a BMI greater than 30 and yet look how

518
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,880
strong and fit that NBA center is. We go, right, if the NBA center comes to your clinical practice,

519
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,640
don't measure his BMI and diagnose him with obesity on that. And what physician in his or

520
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:58,520
her right mind would do such a thing? So, clearly we get that. BMI is a useful tool for epidemiologic

521
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:05,000
research and some simple physiologic research and some simple clinical trials. It's not a perfect

522
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,600
clinical tool. For the average person, it works okay. Now, do we have to be worried about different

523
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:16,680
ethnicities? Obviously the two that come to mind would be Asian and East Asians because,

524
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,480
I think most people are kind of familiar with this idea of skinny fat, right? So, you have

525
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:29,960
someone of East Asian descent whose BMI is 26, which by all intents sounds just wonderful.

526
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,480
But they have metabolic syndrome, right? There's nothing about this person that's healthy, right?

527
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,400
Every metric across the board, tons of visceral fat, very little muscle mass, et cetera.

528
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,880
And that's a different phenotype, right? That's a slightly different phenotype than perhaps

529
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,360
the model was built on. So, how much is the metric that we use for BMI?

530
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:02,040
20 to 25 being perfect, 25 to 30 being overweight, 30 to whatever it is, 40 being

531
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,640
obese and then morbidly obese kicks in at some point, I'm sure.

532
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,440
Is that validated on other ethnicities as well?

533
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:17,240
Yes and no. So, with a few exceptions, the idea that there is a curve and that it's a generally

534
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:24,440
concave up curve, yes. Although again, there are exceptions. But the shape of that curve

535
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:32,520
is not the same in every age, race and sex group. It does seem that the right side, the part where

536
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,720
you're getting too high in BMI and risk is going up, seems to occur a lot earlier

537
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:47,720
among people of Middle Eastern and East Asian descent. And so, that's a very simple model.

538
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,280
You know, it's just sort of says, oh, it's all a curve for everybody. A slightly more complicated

539
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,520
model says, well, we know some of the other factors that come in, like how much of your fat

540
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:02,120
is subcutaneous versus how much is visceral. And it's just that that group has more visceral fat

541
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,960
than that group for any given body mass index and therefore adjust the curves. And there's probably

542
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:14,040
some truth to that. But it's probably even more than that. So, for example, a lot of these statements

543
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:20,040
we hear, and this goes back to way back when I said way at Vassar College, I loved the complexity

544
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,320
of it, that you had to look at it from some obesity from so many different angles. And that's still

545
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:31,560
true. The narratives we have about obesity, including about ethnicity and obesity, are grossly

546
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,600
oversimplified. So, we often hear obesity is selectively a disease of the poor and uneducated

547
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:42,600
that often in this country it's stated, minority status leads to less income,

548
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,480
less education, which in turn leads to poorer access to health care, poorer habits, poorer

549
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,520
living environments, which leads to poorer health and reduced longevity. And there's probably some

550
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:02,120
truth to that. But it's not one-to-one. It's not simple. So, for example, when we hear that there's

551
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:07,160
this inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, which we hear over and over

552
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:13,560
again, first shown by Mickey Stunkard, again, in the 1950s in the Midtown Manhattan Project,

553
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:21,800
that's true in white women. It's reliably true in adult white women. When you go outside the

554
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:28,520
group of adult white women, not always true. If you go to African-American women,

555
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:37,080
virtually no association between socioeconomic status and obesity. When you go to African-American

556
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:43,560
men and you look at their obesity levels, they're very similar to the obesity levels

557
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:48,920
of European-American men, white American men. But if you look at African-American women's obesity

558
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,840
levels and you compare it to European or white American women, much higher. If you bring

559
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,800
Hispanic Americans in, both men and women have higher levels of obesity than do European-American

560
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:09,080
men and women. So now you have an ethnicity difference, but not a gender by ethnicity

561
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,440
difference. Whereas in African-American, you have a gender by ethnicity difference.

562
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:19,560
When you look at mortality, the African-American curves follow similarly, but not identically,

563
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:27,080
to the European-American curves. But in our research, we can't find an association between

564
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,560
BMI and longevity in Hispanic Americans. Wow, just say that again. That's pretty

565
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:39,320
interesting. And that's across all BMIs? We've been unable to find it. Now, you know, the data

566
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,440
sets we have are not perfect. The follow-ups may not be long enough. The sample sizes may not be

567
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,880
big enough. You know, you can always question things. I don't say it's causal. I'm just saying

568
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,880
this is what we observed a few years ago when we got every data set that was publicly available

569
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:02,280
that we could get our hands on that involved Hispanic Americans and BMI and longevity. And

570
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,720
we analyzed them all together with common methods as carefully and thoroughly as we could. We could

571
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:15,560
not find an association between elevated BMI and mortality. As someone who sits on the opposite

572
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,880
end of the spectrum, right, where I don't at all concern myself with public health,

573
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,760
I don't, I'm not trying to make grand observations about what's happening in society across

574
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,400
ethnicities or anything like that. I really just have the luxury of looking at one person at a

575
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,720
time and trying to make a determination about the best course of action. You know, my view of BMI

576
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,480
is generally quite negative, right? It's that it's the, it's the maybe the least bad tool available

577
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:51,320
to get massive data sets and make broad assessments of what's happening at the population

578
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:57,560
level. But to your point earlier, at the individual level, it offers very little insight relative to

579
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:03,880
other tools. You know, when we have patients do DEXA scans, I tell them that, you know,

580
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,360
we're going to get four important pieces of information out of this. But one of them's

581
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,760
really the least important to me, which is your subcutaneous fat. That's the first thing people

582
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,640
want to look at when they have a DEXA scan. They want to see what's their percentage of body fat.

583
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,840
And they say, but there's three things that are much more important to us, right? One is your

584
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:28,120
visceral fat. One is your bone mineral density. And one is your appendicular lean mass index. So

585
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,800
how much muscle mass do you actually have? And we'll look at your subcutaneous fat. But the

586
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:39,240
reality of it is that doesn't really seem to matter because, A, that seems to be incredibly

587
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:47,800
genetic, right? Body habitus in that regard, very genetic, and relatively uncoupled for metabolic

588
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:54,520
health. So the vat, the visceral adipose tissue, seems to be much more tightly correlated to what

589
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,120
we see when we look at more sophisticated biomarkers of insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.

590
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,720
You know, any evidence of liver fat, all these other things tend to track much more closely with

591
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:16,280
that. So, I mean, I guess my view on this is that I'm glad that I get to look at these other metrics

592
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:21,560
because I don't have, I have the luxury that a statistician or an epidemiologist doesn't have,

593
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:26,360
right? Which is when you do things at the individual level, you have much more data

594
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:33,320
and you can be much more nuanced in your appreciation for things. But I can't help but

595
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:38,840
wonder if at the population level something better than BMI will come along one day,

596
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,800
for which there will be enough data to actually do what's out there. And again, this example

597
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:50,120
with the Hispanic subset, that's just, that's mind boggling to me. And it really speaks to,

598
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:59,240
I think, the futility of that measurement in other populations. That is one plausible interpretation.

599
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:04,920
And I don't think we're far away from these better tools. So, for example, we published some work

600
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:11,080
years ago on the idea of using 3D photography, where, you know, just take a picture of somebody

601
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:16,680
from a couple of angles. You know, this came out of work experience way back at the New York obesity

602
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,640
research center where Steve Himesfield, who was my mentor, would study professional basketball

603
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,200
players. They would bring the teams in from New York to him and he would, he was the king of body

604
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:32,120
composition, and he would study them. And in talking with some of the technicians there who

605
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,600
did this every day, who measured people's body composition every day, they would say, I can look

606
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,080
at a person and tell you how much fat they have and I'll be very accurate. They were good at it.

607
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:46,440
I said, well, if you can do it with your eye, why can't my camera do it? So, we got an NIH grant with

608
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,560
Olivia Fuzo and I and Steve Himesfield to look at this, published a paper on it. Since then,

609
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,880
many others have done it. And I think Amazon may be working on this or already have something out

610
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:01,320
on this. So, I think we'll get to the point where we have 3D photography, right? So, that's

611
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,040
Archimedes principle, right? Eureka, I found it, the crown goes under the water, he knows how much

612
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,080
gold is in it because he knows how much water it's displaced. So, if you can weigh it and you can

613
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,320
measure it, if you can measure something's weight and volume, you know it's density. If you know

614
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:21,000
about human anatomy, you can figure out from density, body fat. That's Archimedes principle.

615
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,640
That's what we can do with a camera. So, we have that. We have DEXA. We have plathysmography.

616
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,840
We have isotope dilution techniques. All of these can start to be used more on mass,

617
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,680
on and on. And so, I think these will be coming and we'll do better with that.

618
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,360
But I also think there's this idea of fit for purpose. You know, if you were to say to me,

619
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:49,400
you know, is your, is my vehicle that I drive, is this, you know, precision enough for the Indy 500?

620
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,960
No, I mean, they need better vehicles. But I'm not in the Indy 500. I'm just

621
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:00,760
driving five miles to and from work every day. It's fine. And so, I think it's fit for purpose.

622
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:07,640
If you say to me, tell me how many, what proportion of that country has obesity? BMI is probably

623
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:13,640
perfectly reasonable. If you say, I just want to know on average what's the approximate correlation

624
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:19,640
between obesity level and whether you play golf or not, it's probably okay. But if you want to say,

625
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:26,520
I want to help this individual patient, especially at the sort of, you know, the kind of

626
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,160
artisan level that you go at, then you need the better tools.

627
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,440
Well, the other thing that comes back to your friend, Ruben, is

628
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:42,680
you're still limited in the what to do, you know, the now what question, right? So, if you say,

629
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,520
well, we're going to take our tool of BMI extrapolation and we're going to look at

630
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:54,040
the state of Indiana and we can pretty accurately probably plot out the histogram of exactly what

631
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,960
the BMI is by age and by demographic and all those things. It's the so what question. Well,

632
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,280
what do we do with that information? What's the implication of this? Are people in Indiana more

633
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:09,640
or less healthy than people in Kentucky? And are they more or less healthy than the average American?

634
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,160
And more importantly, are they more or less average than the average, more or less healthy

635
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:17,480
than the average person on this planet? And what can we do to improve their health, even if we don't

636
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:23,080
want to compare them to anybody other than an absolute standard and say, could everybody become

637
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:28,840
healthier? Could we extend the life of the average person in the state of Indiana by three years?

638
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,040
What would the intervention need to be? And that obviously becomes a much more complicated problem,

639
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:39,000
but it's a more germane question, right? It's not a fanciful question. It's a question that we

640
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:47,720
literally are asking. And so this becomes tough because when I talk to people, even physicians,

641
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:57,480
even highly educated scholars, there's this bifurcation. There's the data and those look at

642
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:04,920
the data. And if they really know the data and they're really honest, they say, we agree. Surgery

643
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:11,960
works, pharmaceuticals work, individualized or group-based clinical treatment with behavioral

644
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:18,120
cognitive techniques work somewhat for some period of time. Meal replacement formulas work somewhat

645
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:25,720
for some period of time. But all the public health stuff we've tried now, you really are honest and

646
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:34,840
you really scrape away the obfuscated data. There's virtually no evidence thus far that any of those

647
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:41,320
community, school, public health things for obesity work. Doesn't mean that we won't get them

648
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:46,200
someday, but right now they don't. So when people come and say, well, what do we do about the state

649
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:53,720
of Indiana? And I get this question a lot. See, what's your goal? Is your goal to expose people

650
01:04:53,720 --> 01:05:00,120
to ideas so that there's some really smart kid, right? The next Marie Curie, the next Einstein,

651
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:05,080
the next George Washington Carver is there in that classroom. And maybe the thing you do to

652
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,520
try to reduce obesity has no effect on obesity, but that kid is thinking about it for the next

653
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:16,520
15 years. And then when they become an adult, they go, I got an idea. And suddenly someone's

654
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:22,120
smarter than we are with new knowledge, cracks it. Is that your goal? Then it's consciousness

655
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:27,880
raising. Okay, fine. Is your goal to say to communities, we know you're suffering and we

656
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,720
know this is concerning and we want you to know we care and we're trying. We're not really going

657
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:40,040
to necessarily reduce obesity levels, but we want to know you care. We want you to know we care. And

658
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:47,800
you want farmer's markets in the school parking lot. You want vending machines changed. You want

659
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,280
running tracks built in your neighborhood. We'll build running tracks and so on. And we'll feel

660
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:57,400
better about we're caring for each other. Fair. But it's probably not going to affect obesity,

661
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:04,040
given what we know right now. Or do you say, I actually want to have less people suffering

662
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:10,440
with and from obesity. I want obesity levels in some definable, countable number of people to go

663
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:16,040
down and I want the health to improve. I'd say as you know, it's not going to win you any feel good

664
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:24,760
awards, but surgery, pharmaceuticals, and to some extent individualized treatment, or, you know,

665
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:30,280
cognitive behavioral group based treatment, including things like meal replacements and so on.

666
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:37,320
Those are ways to go. You could take if the state of Indiana handed me 10 million dollars and said,

667
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:45,160
make a difference. I would not go build farmer's markets in schoolyards. I would say

668
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:51,960
it'll only be a small number of people, but let's give bariatric surgery to a subset of people. And

669
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,840
those subset of people will likely live longer on average. What's the best explanation for why

670
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:04,520
weight loss is not particularly difficult, but weight loss maintained is incredibly difficult?

671
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:14,840
There's probably no single explanation. And I think that question of why

672
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,800
is a tough one. Do we mean evolutionarily why? That is what happened in evolution that got us

673
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,800
to be what we are today that leads to that. Or is it biochemically and otherwise why there's one

674
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:32,680
of the mechanisms involved? And I don't, from either point of view, I don't know all the answers.

675
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:41,080
From the evolutionary point of view for a long time, the meme was, it's the thrifty gene hypothesis

676
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:47,160
from James Neal, right? So the idea is that animals in general and including and especially humans

677
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,600
throughout evolutionary history were on the brink of starvation. So anything you could do

678
01:07:52,600 --> 01:08:00,600
to preserve energy, you did. And anything you did that when given the opportunity to get more energy,

679
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:06,360
eat as much as you can while you can. And then you get into this modern environment where there's,

680
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,680
for practical purposes for most of us, unlimited consumable energy, you overconsume.

681
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:17,880
I think that's simplistic for many, many reasons. First of all, as the lawyers say,

682
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,480
objection that assumes facts not in evidence. That is, it's not at all clear that humans have

683
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,600
been on the brink of starvation throughout history. In fact, Robert Fogel, who won the Nobel Prize

684
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:34,040
for looking at these old data going back to at least the 1700s of British naval recruits and

685
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:39,240
other places, you see BMI sort of on average there going up over the centuries. But there's

686
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:45,640
a little fluctuation as things get better and worse in places. Second thing is,

687
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,360
how does this account for pregnancy? Now, maybe now the latest data from John Speakman and

688
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:57,080
colleagues in science with all the double-dibbed water about three months ago, maybe suggests that

689
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:02,360
during pregnancy, women's energy intakes don't need to go up that much, but they still go up.

690
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:10,120
And so if humans have been reproducing for millennia, where did all that extra energy

691
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:15,720
come from if we were on the brink of starvation all the time? And then the last thing I'll say is,

692
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:21,720
anybody who ever goes fishing knows that the idea that every animal is hungry all the time

693
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:28,360
and is going to grab every bite of food you throw in front of it has never been fishing.

694
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,120
But you can see that beautiful bass sitting in the clear water in front of you, and you can dangle

695
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:40,840
your worm or killie or whatever it is you've got, and sometimes the fish just looks at you.

696
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:47,080
So it's not at all clear that this is the case. Some animals do get obese when given unlimited

697
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:52,360
food, some don't, both within and across species. There's lots of differences. So that's that.

698
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:59,480
John Speakman came along and he said, I'm not sure I'm buying this whole idea. He said,

699
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:04,600
I think it's freedom from predation. Back in history, we were prey. Then there was a certain

700
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,320
point where we learned to use tools and hunt together, and we stopped being prey and we

701
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:15,720
started being predators. And when we switched from being prey to predators, then we didn't need to

702
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:22,040
hide in our burrows and eat the least we could because every time you came out of your burrow,

703
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:28,040
you were potentially exposed to a predator, we could sort of walk around and eat kind of ad lib.

704
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:37,640
And in that case, the genes that were being selected for that gave us satiety mechanisms

705
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:44,520
that kept our weight down no longer were being selected for. It wasn't that nature was selecting

706
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:50,600
for genes that made us fatter, it just wasn't selecting for genes that kept us thin. And then

707
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:56,040
what happens is called drift. Mutations happen and things just drift. So he calls it the

708
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:01,880
Drifty Hypothesis. And it's really less, it's less about the thinness. The thinness was really a

709
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:07,560
consequence of what the genes were probably selecting for, which presumably was lower

710
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:13,080
appetite or something like that, right? Probably. And I think these things, it's not one, there's

711
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:19,720
not one factor, right? We see this, for example, in the evolution of sexual reproduction, which is,

712
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,880
it's called the queen of questions in biology, right? Nobody can really figure out why do we

713
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:30,200
have sexual reproduction when asexual reproduction seems so much more efficient from a genetic

714
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:36,040
fitness point of view. And people have proposed different hypotheses for it, and no one seems to

715
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,920
work mathematically. And what it may be is that it's only by putting them all together that it

716
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,880
mathematically works. And it's just an inelegant solution. You see similar things in physics where

717
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,640
it may be, you know, these beautiful, simple mathematical things may not hold up. You may

718
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:54,120
just have to have ugly composite theories. Say a bit more about that. That's interesting. I've

719
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:59,000
never heard the argument for, I don't actually know much about asexual reproduction. I don't

720
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:05,800
spend much time thinking about plants or other life forms that do it. But what's the argument

721
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:11,000
for why we would be better off with asexual reproduction? Well, think about something like

722
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,360
Daphnia, which is a species that can produce both sexually and asexually. There are many species

723
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:27,240
like this all the way up through some vertebrates. And if an organism reproduces itself asexually,

724
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:32,200
just sort of makes a copy of itself, think about what it's done is it's reproduced all of its genes.

725
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:39,160
And so from the Dauchins, the Richard Dawkins point of view, the selfish gene,

726
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:45,640
those genes all got their way. Those genes all won. They got copied and genes that are good at

727
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,320
getting copied will get copied again in the future. So you have more of those. That's how

728
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:57,640
evolution works. Whereas if you reproduce sexually, you get another partner. Now, of course,

729
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:02,280
this assumes other, this invites other questions like, well, why are there only two sexes? And

730
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:08,360
why in fact have sexes at all? You could exchange DNA without having sexes, right? Bacteria do it

731
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:13,400
through conjugation. But we'll put that aside for the moment. Say there are two sexes, male and

732
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:19,960
female, they come together, they mix up their genetic material. The offspring has roughly 50%

733
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:27,240
of the genetic material of one parent and 50% of the other. And now you only copied yourself one

734
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:35,640
half. And so you didn't win as much as if you copied yourself entirely. So why would you ever

735
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:41,320
switch to sexual reproduction? It's very inefficient from a genetic fitness point of view.

736
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:49,000
Now you can hypothesize things. The most compelling hypothesis I've heard to me is the so-called Red

737
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,520
Queen hypothesis, which is from Alice in the Looking Glass where the Red Queen is running with Alice

738
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,000
and Alice at one point says, we don't seem to be getting anywhere. And the Red Queen says, oh,

739
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:06,360
in this world, you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in place. And Alice says, oh,

740
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:11,240
in my world, we run and we actually get somewhere. And so the Red Queen hypothesis is the idea that

741
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:17,240
you keep running as fast as you can just to stay steady. Well, what does that mean is, well,

742
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:23,400
as you're living a long time as a human, there are these microbes in you and they're

743
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:29,000
evolving much more rapidly because they have a much more shorter generation time.

744
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:38,280
And as they evolve, they start to get good at getting past your defenses and your locks.

745
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:44,920
They start developing keys to your locks. And you want to reset the locks. The way you reset the

746
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:51,000
locks is by getting a partner and mixing up your DNA with them. So the idea that it's a way of

747
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,680
keeping up with the Joneses where the Joneses are the bacteria, the microbes in your body.

748
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,640
That's that's super elegant, right? Because if you think about it, if it was all asexual,

749
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:07,320
we'd have a population of identical people. I mean, we would, for all intents and purposes,

750
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,000
it'd be interesting to do the math on what it would look like, but you might only have

751
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:19,160
a few hundred thousand gene pools as opposed to much less diversity, much less diversity.

752
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:24,200
So from a species point of view, if you believed in group selection, right, then you say, oh, right,

753
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,880
it's good for the species. But then the smart evolutionary biologists come along and say,

754
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,040
yeah, but that's group selection. It doesn't make sense. Selection occurs at the individual or gene

755
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:38,600
level. You've got to explain how it makes sense for that individual, how it enhances their fitness

756
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,640
or their genes' fitness. So you say, okay, well, if only half the genes get reproduced,

757
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:50,840
then it's got to be double the fitness level to break even. And that doesn't seem like it really

758
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,160
holds up. So what people have said is, you know what, if you take a handful of things,

759
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:59,080
which I can't explain them all right now, this is Mueller's ratchet and this, this, and that,

760
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:03,800
and you take all of these things and you put them together, then maybe the math works.

761
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:10,040
But it's very inelegant. It's not one nice little theory. And it's probably the same thing with

762
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:17,400
people and evolution. So there was Neil with the thrifty gene. That is, you need to be selected to

763
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,880
get food when you can. There's probably some truth to that. Maybe not everybody's dying of

764
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:27,880
starvation. But if you're not getting enough food, you may not be big enough to win the battle for

765
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:35,400
mates in a polygynous physical combat mating system. And so that may, that may select for

766
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:41,000
wanting to eat more. You may not be, think of the Frisch hypothesis, you get too thin as a woman,

767
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,840
you stop menstruating. So it may be that it's not that you die of starvation, but that your

768
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:54,200
reproductive fitness goes down. On the other hand, the predation, the freedom for predation idea that

769
01:16:54,200 --> 01:17:01,000
John Speakman puts out is also legitimate. And there are yet others. Gary Beauchamp from

770
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:07,960
Monell Chemical Census Center has talked about the idea of the safety of food. Is it possible

771
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:13,320
that if you're back in time and you're not eating out of a refrigerator in a modern safe food supply

772
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:18,120
like we have, you know, we love to insult our food supply, probably the safest food supply in history.

773
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:25,160
Every time you eat something, you're exposing yourself potentially to microbes and toxins,

774
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:30,680
not just predators. And if you eat less, you're less exposure. So there's again, there's an

775
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:37,000
optimization problem. But as you now have a safer food supply, you can relax that constraint a little

776
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,440
bit. You can even think about it socially. If, if I were in a species where I'm just out on my own,

777
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:50,120
all right, if I'm, you know, species that just eat eucalyptus leaves or something, it doesn't depend

778
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:57,080
on anything else, then maybe I can eat the last eucalyptus leaf. But if I'm a species that very

779
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:04,920
much depends upon cooperative living, right, if I am so hungry all the time, that I'm willing to try

780
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:09,320
to kill you for the last bite of chicken, and you're willing to try to kill me for the last bite of

781
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,960
chicken, that's a bad situation, especially for me, because you're a little bigger than me and did

782
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,960
more martial arts, you know, so, so that's not good for fitness. It might be good to have satiety

783
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:25,320
mechanisms, just so we can preserve some social order. So after you and I eat a little chicken,

784
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:30,760
we can actually work together on building tools and engines and steam engines and airplanes and so

785
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:37,800
on. This is super fascinating. I could go down this path forever. I think we'll come back to this

786
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,560
next time we have dinner, because having this discussion over a meal would make it even more

787
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,280
because having this discussion over a meal would make it even better.

788
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:51,640
Let's march on to the topic of nutritional epidemiology. We've talked a little bit about

789
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:58,200
epidemiology. Obviously, epidemiology is married very closely with statistics. Without statistics,

790
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:04,120
you can't really do epidemiology. But it's a field that I think even the casual listener of this

791
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:09,560
podcast will understand has its limitations, if by no other means than they've heard me rail on it

792
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:16,120
many times. So I don't think we need to define it. I think people understand the nature of it.

793
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:23,240
But let's talk a little bit about your, your, your views of it, because I think you

794
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,920
I wouldn't say you're in either camp, right? There's a camp of people that would say

795
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:33,240
there is absolutely nothing wrong with epidemiology, nutritional epidemiology.

796
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:40,200
It is a masterful tool that provides exceptional insights without which we would be lost.

797
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,880
The other end of the spectrum, I'll acknowledge I'm a little closer to the other end of that

798
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:53,640
spectrum. There are people who say this is a tool that has probably reached its peak of utility.

799
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,280
And the epidemiologist should probably focus on other problems outside of nutrition now.

800
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:06,360
You're probably more in the middle of those, but I'd like to hear you talk a little bit about the

801
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:13,800
bookends and how, where you settle out and why more importantly. I appreciate the opportunity

802
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:22,200
to comment on this. It's a topic that I feel really does need more, more courageous addressing.

803
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:28,520
And I think that you have characterized it well. There are at one end the people I would call the

804
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:35,720
abolitionists. You're, I agree you're close. Our mutual friend Gary Taubes has said,

805
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:41,080
at some point we need to recognize that nutrition epidemiology is a dead science.

806
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,120
I'm sorry, that was John Ioannidis, another mutual friend who said,

807
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,600
nutrition epidemiology is a dead science and it's time to bury the corpse. Gary Taubes has been very

808
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:59,480
critical, mean of tea cults. You, many others have pointed out that perhaps this is just a worthless

809
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:05,560
waste of time and misleading. At the other end, there are a number of people.

810
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:12,120
They, they tend to be concentrated in Boston it seems. There's a little school out east there.

811
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,600
I forget the name of it. It's in Cambridge is it? Yeah. Okay. Anyway. Yeah. I think I've heard of it.

812
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,480
Yeah. I think I've heard of it. And there are other places that believe this, but it's probably

813
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:28,040
strongest in Boston that sort of seemed to be the defenders of the status quo. Let's say,

814
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:36,440
nutrition epidemiology is imperfect as all tools are, but it is still a very valuable tool. There's

815
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:43,320
nothing seriously wrong with it. Those who criticize it are naive. And I look at this,

816
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:49,000
I'm naive and ignorant. And I look at a quotation like that and I think, really you're telling me

817
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,920
that Gary Taubes and Johnny Annietes are naive and ignorant. If you want to tell me you don't

818
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:01,720
agree with them, that's fine. Naive and ignorant come now. Not really. So we know that there's

819
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:07,960
something wrong there. When we look at the evidence, it's very clear that many findings

820
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:13,880
from nutrition epidemiology have not held up once we've done randomized controlled trials.

821
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:18,840
Now some people will say, no, you're wrong. And I've had arguments with people from Boston about

822
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:25,800
this. And they said, you're wrong. If you look at these meta-analyses, it looks like non-randomized

823
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:31,960
studies on average give very similar findings to randomized studies. But often they're citing

824
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,720
non-randomized intervention studies, not non-randomized observational studies. And they're

825
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:43,240
often not citing nutrition studies. They're citing pharmaceutical or other medical treatment. So those

826
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:50,200
are very different situations. When you look at the nutrition epi, it's not clear to me that these

827
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:54,360
things hold up very well when they are studied. In fact, it seems to be more the norm that they

828
01:22:54,360 --> 01:23:00,520
don't. If you look at other things going on, as John Annietes probably better than anybody else

829
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:06,840
has done, but many of us have done, and you start to peel the hood open on these. And you really

830
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:13,000
look, you see a lot of things that look like obfuscation, exaggeration, sweeping under the

831
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,600
rug of measurement error, and so on. So we've got huge issues with confounding. We've got huge

832
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:24,680
measurement problems. And so I think many people, including me, say, no, the status quo is not OK.

833
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:31,400
It's not just minor fine tuning. We need reformation. But we also need to use these

834
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:37,560
tools well. This field is not going to go away whether you want it to or not. So my feeling is

835
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:44,600
reformation is essential. The status quo is completely unacceptable. But abolition is neither

836
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:51,400
realistic nor desirable. And I want to cite one paper we did, which I think makes an interesting

837
01:23:51,400 --> 01:24:00,520
point. This paper, you know, I often end reading the observational epidemiology nutrition study

838
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:07,240
in which the author correctly and honestly points out that it's an observational study,

839
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:13,240
as association, not necessarily showing causation, and then says, but how could I be wrong? Well,

840
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:17,160
it could be that this measurement error creates this problem. They say, but I used a validated

841
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:22,520
food frequency questionnaire, so it's really OK. Could be confounding due to socioeconomic status.

842
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:30,200
But all of my subjects had the same profession, so it's really OK, as though the nurse

843
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:36,120
who works in a poor school in rural Indiana has the same socioeconomic status as the nurse

844
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:45,160
who is the married to a billionaire. Of course not. They say we control for we only have to

845
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:52,280
never smokers and so on and so on. So really, it was OK. They dismiss the idea that it's not really

846
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:58,520
causation. And I got this idea once and I said, you know, what they're saying is if I measured

847
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:03,960
everything well and I controlled for food intake and I controlled for diet composition and housing

848
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:09,960
and socioeconomic status and genetic background, then it would be OK. So I said, you know, you

849
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:15,000
could never do this study in humans, but I realized I've done this in mice. And we had a mouse study

850
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,920
where we randomly assigned mice to eat different amounts of calories or food energy, but all on the

851
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,560
same diet. So composition was fixed. The mice had no choice. There were no restaurants. There was no

852
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:31,800
grub hub. There was no door dash. We gave the mice the same food. They all ate the same thing.

853
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:37,880
No self-report. They're all genetically identical in probability because they're,

854
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:44,360
you know, inbred isogenic strain, all C57 black 6J mice. They're all in the same housing conditions.

855
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:50,360
There's no smoking, et cetera. And then we take these mice and we randomly assign them to low

856
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:57,640
calorie, medium calorie, high calorie effectively or ad lib, ad libetum. And what we find is the

857
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:05,080
more calories we assign them to be allowed to eat, the shorter they live. No big surprise there. This

858
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:11,800
has been shown a thousand times in the literature by Ray Walford and, you know, Rick Weindrick and

859
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:19,480
others over the decades. But then we take the ad libetum group. And within that, some choose to

860
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:24,920
eat more than others. And within that group, now we have an observational epidemiologic study

861
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:32,840
and we correlate amount chosen to be eaten with longevity. And those mice that choose to eat more

862
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:41,800
live longer. So the association in the observational component is exactly opposite

863
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:48,840
to the causal effect in the experimental component. And what people say to me is,

864
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:55,720
well, David, it's confounding. What you're seeing, probably almost certainly, is that the mice that

865
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:02,600
are the strongest and healthiest have the biggest appetites. They eat more. And what you're seeing

866
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:11,000
is confounding by general health, to which I say, right. That's the point. The point is even in a

867
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,320
study, an observational study that is more pristine than anybody will ever be able to do a human study,

868
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:22,360
which there's no smoking, no restaurants. Everybody eats the same thing. There's no measurement error.

869
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:29,400
You know, it's, they're all genetically identical in probability. We can't get the observational

870
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:37,320
study to reproduce the causal effect. And that suggests to me why reform is so needed. And we

871
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:42,680
talk about different kinds of observational studies. What I would love to never hear again

872
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:50,200
is the puerile analogy of there's no randomized controlled trials with parachute jumping.

873
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,320
You know what I'm talking about. That comes up every now and then. And there's a wonderful book

874
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:00,520
called Randomistas, like Fashionistas, Randomistas by Andrew Ley. And he says, actually, there are

875
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,640
randomized controlled trials of parachute jumping. So first of all, it's just not true.

876
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:10,280
But beyond the fact that the IRB approved that, you got to be in the army, I think.

877
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:18,760
Yeah. So, you know, the interesting thing there is that this is used often as an excuse to say,

878
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:24,760
okay, I can't do the pure, perfect, pristine, randomized controlled trial. So therefore,

879
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:31,240
you have to accept any old observational study. And I think the answer is no, no, we don't.

880
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:37,480
We may have to accept that we're going to draw some inferences from something other than the pure,

881
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,760
classic, pristine, randomized controlled trial. But in between that and any old

882
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:48,280
observational epidemiologic study, there's a lot of space. And what we're saying is we need to get

883
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:55,000
to this space here. So co-twin controls, right? You hinted at that earlier. How about we take your

884
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,040
identical twin? We randomly assign you to one and the twin to the other. Or if we can't randomly

885
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:05,960
assign, say, oh, Peter, you exercise a lot. Your twin brother doesn't exercise. But you have the

886
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:13,160
same genotype. Okay. That's a tight control. Or how about things in which we intervene,

887
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:18,840
even if it's not randomly intervened, as opposed to just observe. So we say, okay, in this town,

888
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:22,840
we're going to build a restaurant. In that town, we're not going to build the restaurant.

889
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:27,720
It's still an intervention study, even if it's not a randomized study. That's the realm of Brian L.

890
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:32,040
Bell, for example, looks at food deserts and things. He says, gee, you know, we built a grocery

891
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:36,840
store where there's a food desert. We're told that food desert's a problem and doesn't look

892
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,640
like things got better when we built the grocery store. That's a much stronger design than just

893
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:45,880
asking people how far away do you live from a grocery store. Yeah, no, look, I think that's very

894
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:54,120
eloquent. And that mouse study is remarkable, by the way. I remember when that came out. That

895
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:01,960
needs to be a Sunday email to my group. So let's remember that. I would highlight two things that

896
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,200
well, one thing that you've already alluded to and one that you haven't, but I would just

897
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:13,400
add it to my side of the ledger on why I struggle so much with the legitimacy of epidemiology.

898
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:19,400
Anything that relies on a food frequency questionnaire, I simply can't take seriously

899
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:29,560
for the fact that at least with every patient I've ever come in contact with to try to accurately

900
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:35,640
assess what they eat based on a food frequency questionnaire would be a fool's errand. It's

901
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:45,000
simply unrelated to what they eat. Full stop. The second issue I have with nutritional epidemiology

902
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:54,440
comes down to the hazard ratios that very commonly show up and lead to grand statements.

903
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,680
When you see hazard ratios like 1.16 and we talk about this like we have demonstrated the causal

904
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:11,800
relationship between bacon and cancer. I mean, what would the actual fathers of epidemiology

905
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:19,960
be saying in their graves if they were looking at these strength of association? And so

906
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:26,120
I'm not necessarily saying there should be no epidemiology, but boy, there needs to be a

907
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:31,160
referendum on how the media is taught how to interact with such studies on

908
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:40,840
how we scrutinize some of the methodologies behind these things. Because again, checking

909
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:47,800
a food frequency questionnaire once in an eight year study, it just doesn't mean anything. It

910
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:54,120
really means less than nothing actually. And yet it's amazing that that could be the basis

911
01:31:54,120 --> 01:32:00,040
of an observation. So anyway, it's hard for me to say something good about epidemiology.

912
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:08,360
Well, on the measurement issue, which is often I think incorrectly perceived by some people as

913
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:13,480
the key issue and say, well, yeah, we admit the measurement of food intake is a big problem.

914
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:17,320
But other than that, everything's fine. And no, even when the measurement is near perfect,

915
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:22,680
as in my mouse study, it's still not fine. You don't have to go back to the fathers of

916
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:27,560
epidemiology or wait for the fathers of epidemiology. You can go back to at least Confucius,

917
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:35,320
who says to know what you know, and to know what you do not know, that is true knowledge.

918
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:40,280
And so this idea that we have to be honest with ourselves and each other

919
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,840
about what we know and don't know and how we know it and don't know it is clear. And I think that's

920
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:53,000
part of that reform. We need a greater level of honesty. Simeen Vizier just had a paper in

921
01:32:54,200 --> 01:33:00,920
one of the peer-reviewed journals looking at or writing about epistemic humility and saying,

922
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:06,440
you know, when you get to the discussion section of a paper and you consider that

923
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:12,120
the hypothesis that you made, which now seems to be supported by your data, and you say,

924
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:16,680
but I might be wrong. And then you just systematically go through with the greatest

925
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:22,120
effort and art to show how you're not wrong, how you can dismiss all the competing explanations.

926
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:27,240
You say, that's not an honest epistemic humility. An honest epistemic humility, what do you say?

927
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:33,480
I really might be wrong. And here's all the ways I might be wrong that I and others should test

928
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:38,760
going forward. Michael Stravins in his book, The Knowledge Machine, does a beautiful

929
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:44,520
composition, decomposition, construction, deconstruction of this and talks about

930
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:51,320
the idea of communities doing this. And so that we need that sort of constructive battle,

931
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:56,440
but it needs to be an honest battle, right? We can't engage. The battle shouldn't be at hominem.

932
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:02,040
The battle shouldn't be undercutting each other by, you know, who you are and who you work for and

933
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:06,120
what your beliefs are. It needs to be a battle about the data. It calls out the iron rule of

934
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:12,840
evidence. And so if I say, Peter, your theory that X causes Y could be mistaken because your

935
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:19,960
measurement of X is not valid, you need to come back and say, I hear you. What if I measure X this

936
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:24,760
way? That's a legitimate thing. Let's do it and see if we can rule it out. And then we can go back

937
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:28,760
and forth and say, well, maybe the measurement of Y is not right. I think we need to be more honest

938
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:34,360
about that. I don't think the nutrition epidemiology field has been quite honest about the limits of

939
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:40,040
its measurement, but so have the attackers not. I've been careful about saying, I think measurements

940
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:45,800
of energy intake and expenditure from self-report methods are so bad that they shouldn't even be

941
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:51,400
used. That is, it's not enough to say, well, it's not perfect. It's so bad you can't even be

942
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,960
guaranteed to get the directional effect. So don't even use it. Better to not do the study at all.

943
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:02,200
But on the other hand, if you said to me, I want to know if people eat vegetarian or not,

944
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,920
or eat kosher or not, or eat after midnight or not. I don't know. Maybe people do report those

945
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:11,640
accurately. Maybe they don't. I also don't know. I think we have to ask for what purpose.

946
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:18,920
You mentioned very briefly, Katherine Flagle earlier. She also wrote a very famous paper about

947
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:24,920
the obesity wars. Give folks a bit of an idea about that. I thought very excellent paper.

948
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:30,920
Yeah. Katherine Flagle has been a colleague from whom I've had great respect for many,

949
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:37,560
many years. And she's very, very bright and very capable and very careful. And I've learned a lot

950
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:47,480
from her, actually. And she published a paper in, I think it was 2005, that really got people's

951
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:52,680
attention. And it was interesting in the way. It was a meta-analysis and combined pooling analysis.

952
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:58,840
Showed a few things. What was interesting to me is what people harped on, particularly the media,

953
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:08,920
was that BMIs in the overweight range were actually not strongly associated and consistently

954
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:14,120
associated with increased mortality rate. In some cases, were associated with lower mortality rate.

955
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:20,280
The media went crazy with this, as though it were new finding. Just as every few years, they're

956
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,840
right, the new finding that BMI is mass and not fat. The new finding that there's a genetic

957
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:30,200
component to obesity that we knew from decades ago. The media went crazy with this. The people

958
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:35,000
that are the defenders of, you can never be too rich or too thin, went crazy and attacked her.

959
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:42,760
And the bizarreness of it wasn't new. I mean, it was a meta-analysis. How could it have been new?

960
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:48,840
We all knew these data. You can go back to Linus Pauling, the double Nobel Laureate,

961
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:57,240
has a paper in the 1950s on BMI and life expectancy. And he's got a bathtub-shaped curve

962
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:04,920
there. So this is not new at all. But somehow, it was seen as new. It was in JAMA. The newspapers

963
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:09,720
went crazy. The people who were defending it went crazy. And they started attacking her

964
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:17,800
very vociferously. One investigator called it a worthless pile of rubbish. And to me,

965
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,680
these are very inappropriate statements. Who were the most vocal critics?

966
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:28,120
Some people in Boston seem to be among the most vocal critics. So that was kind of a very

967
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:33,960
interesting thing. But as I said, it was all on old news. Anybody been reading the literature

968
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:40,760
for decades was it? But I already knew this. What was actually new, and to me far more intriguing,

969
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:46,760
but got much less attention, was that the nadir was moving over time. That was we talked about

970
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:53,480
earlier, that in 1990, it wasn't the same as 1970. That is, to me, very intriguing. We actually had

971
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:59,320
have an active NIH grant built on that, trying to figure out what's going on with it. But anyway,

972
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,800
they attacked her. And these statements, you know, that it was rubbish and that she didn't know what

973
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,200
she was talking about, that there was nobody with a medical background. And these are all ad hominem

974
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,640
things. First of all, it's not clear there was no one with a medical background on the paper.

975
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:17,960
And even if it was clear, who cares? You know, the data are the data, whether you have an MD or

976
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:22,760
you don't have an MD. It's the data that matter. When I frequently say in science, three things

977
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:28,120
matter. The data, the methods used to collect the data, which give them their probative value,

978
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:32,600
and the logic, which connects the data and the methods to conclusions.

979
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:38,840
Everything else is not science. Now, if you want to look at other things as ways of helping you

980
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:44,840
make a pragmatic decision, that's fine. Right? So if I say, oh, I trust Peter, and he's a smart guy,

981
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:49,960
and I know he studies a lot, and he tells me I should eat this, that's maybe a very pragmatic

982
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:54,600
way of making a decision. But it's not science. Right? The science is the data, the methods,

983
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,120
and the logic connecting the data to conclusions, not whether I trust you or not.

984
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:04,360
And so all these ad hominem things were said, they attacked her. It was very, very vociferous,

985
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:10,600
very inappropriate. But there are many other people who have been attacked. I've been attacked. I know

986
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:16,360
lots of other people have been attacked for their beliefs. When Nina T. Cults had an editorial,

987
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:21,880
I think in Lancet, talking about some elements of nutrition and fat and carbohydrate, many people

988
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:28,280
wrote in, tried to get it retracted. This is a sort of regular occurrence now, when Brad Johnson

989
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:35,240
published on red meat roughly two years ago, big meta analysis showing that the association

990
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:42,760
between red meat consumption and negative health outcomes was not strong and compelling, as,

991
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:49,800
you know, in his words, again, rig vigorously attacked. People tried to get it retracted before

992
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:56,200
it was published, which thankfully didn't work, instead of just engaging with the data, the methods,

993
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:01,960
and the logic. And it's terrible. This happens. It doesn't only happen in obesity and nutrition,

994
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:05,160
but it happens a lot in obesity and nutrition. Yeah, but that's what I was going to say.

995
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:12,360
It does seem to happen disproportionately in this field. Why is that? I think it has to do with the

996
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:19,480
everyday experience. Right? So back to my example from early in our discussion about the beta cell

997
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:26,600
of the pancreas, right? If you are at a cocktail party in your neighborhood and you say to somebody,

998
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:33,400
well, I study diabetes. And here's what I think about the beta cell of the pancreas and how this

999
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:39,720
might work. Unless that person also studies it, they're not going to challenge you. They probably

1000
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:43,560
don't know what the beta cell of the pancreas is. They don't have strong feelings about it. They

1001
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:49,880
don't see it every day, so on. All of us eat every day. Well, almost all of us eat almost every day.

1002
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:58,120
Food is culture. It's family. It's love. It's economy. It's commerce. It's political beliefs.

1003
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:02,200
It's philosophical beliefs. It's ethical beliefs about whether you're a vegetarian or not. It's

1004
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:08,120
the sustainability of the environment. It's so connected to so many emotional things. And we all

1005
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:13,640
have that everyday experience. And we have to make decisions every day. Each of us decides what

1006
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:19,720
to eat, what to feed our kids, right? Whether we wear our seatbelt or not, all these things.

1007
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:25,800
We make these decisions and then we may want to justify them. We may need to believe they're good.

1008
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:32,040
We may mistake our experience for expertise. And that's why I think when you get into any fields

1009
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:39,160
where people have everyday experience, whether it's human sexuality, whether it's relationships,

1010
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:47,240
whether it's child rearing, TV watching, book reading, music, eating, these are things people

1011
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:52,040
have very strong feelings about and often will opine about, often quite aggressively,

1012
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:57,800
in the absence of data. It is not only obesity. Statements about violence in media, statements

1013
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:04,680
about how to best teach mathematics to children. People have very strong feelings that are often

1014
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:10,920
quite in contrast to what the data show. So is there a path forward here? Because it doesn't feel

1015
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:16,280
like there's, from a nutritional standpoint, I mean, I think you've already touched on a few of

1016
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:21,480
them, but we've already seen some pretty exciting pharmacologic things come along. I think

1017
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:30,280
semaglutide, the study that we've talked about before on this podcast, really kind of a remarkable

1018
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:43,640
drug. It's certainly the most impressive thing that I've seen clinically for obesity. So the point

1019
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:50,520
being, we're making great progress there. We talk about surgical treatments. 25 years ago, when I was

1020
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:56,520
in medical school, I remember the first gastric bypass I ever saw done as a medical student,

1021
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:03,720
watching, you know, surgical rotation. And this was an open, this was done before they were doing

1022
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:09,640
them laparoscopically. It was done as an open, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on a 400 pound man

1023
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:15,160
who would die 40 days later in the hospital of sepsis. He never got out of the hospital. He had

1024
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:21,320
an astromotic leak. That was a very dangerous operation. 25 years ago today, that operation

1025
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:27,880
is done almost with that exception laparoscopically. It is an incredibly safe procedure and it has also

1026
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:34,840
remarkable efficacy. So on this surgical front, on this pharmacologic front, we have made amazing

1027
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:43,000
progress. We haven't made progress on the nutritional front. Are we going to? Not clear. You know,

1028
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:49,560
New York Times reporter called me a few years ago and this was in response. There was an article

1029
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:56,120
about president, I think it was president Taft, who was very obese and somebody had found some

1030
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:01,400
letters between him and his physician talking about diet. And it was almost, you could pick

1031
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:05,960
those letters up and said this was between a president and his or her physician today

1032
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:11,960
and they would make equal sense. And the reporter said to me, this is a very bright

1033
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:17,400
science nutrition journalist, said to me, David, why have we made so little progress?

1034
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:24,760
Why have we not been able to find the diet that reliably causes sustained weight loss? And I said,

1035
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:32,520
your question is premised on the idea that there is a diet that reliably causes sustained weight

1036
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:37,960
loss. Why should we believe that that's true? So that's an important thing to think about.

1037
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:44,360
I think one of the things that is perhaps a misperception and maybe a very problematic one

1038
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:49,240
in our field around nutrition and weight loss or food intake and weight loss is that there is a

1039
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:57,800
good diet with respect to weight loss, particularly such that for most, if not all people, if you just

1040
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:03,640
ate the right way, you wouldn't have to count your calories. You wouldn't have to be uncomfortable

1041
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:09,160
and hungry. You wouldn't have to feel deprived and yet you would maintain a good healthy weight.

1042
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:18,600
I know of no reason to believe that's true. I know lots of people who argue, is it diet A or diet B?

1043
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:23,400
Right. So this one thinks it's low carb and this one thinks it's high carb or low fat and this one

1044
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:29,240
thinks it's don't eat at night and this one thinks it's, you know, whatever it is, eat paleo, you know,

1045
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:37,640
etc. I'm just, maybe the null hypothesis is, you know, doesn't matter that much.

1046
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:44,600
There isn't such a diet for many people. Now for some people, they do maintain a normal healthy

1047
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:49,400
desirable weight without trying to restrict their energy. But maybe for others it's just not the

1048
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:56,200
case. I think the paths forward are manifold and I think in some cases we are on the good path

1049
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:06,200
and in some cases we are wandering in the drunkard's walk. We're on the good path, I think, on surgery

1050
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:13,640
and pharmaceuticals. Clearly a long way to go but they've gotten much better. I'd love to see more

1051
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:21,480
funding for those for good research and I think we need to, we are on a good path but I think we

1052
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:27,080
need to get on a much better path about as a society making those available to people.

1053
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:31,720
Right. If you have cancer we're willing to treat you. If you have obesity,

1054
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:38,680
maybe not. Right. So if you're rich you can pay for that. If you're not rich, what do you do?

1055
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:43,080
So I'd love to see more access to care and I think we're on a better path but we need to be on a

1056
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:50,200
better path still. I think we're on a good path on stigma. A long way to go but I think as a society

1057
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:57,240
we've woken up to say stigmatizing obese people is not okay. Do you think the pendulum's gone too

1058
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:03,080
far? I read something, this might have been a joke, but I literally read that Adele was actually

1059
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:07,960
shamed for losing weight. I don't know if that's true but if it was it would certainly suggest

1060
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:12,040
that the pendulum has gone a little too far the other direction. I would certainly say that that's

1061
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:18,760
ridiculous. I don't know if she was or wasn't but if she was that's ridiculous. To me the take-home

1062
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:24,760
message is shaming people about their body habitus is not good in either direction. It's not a

1063
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:31,560
directional thing. It's just shaming people about their body habitus is not okay. And you know

1064
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:36,840
sometimes the counter argument is but it's good for them because it'll help them want to lose weight

1065
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:44,680
and sometimes the argument made against the shaming is empirical. Well the evidence shows

1066
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:48,600
that people who experience a lot of weight shaming gain more weight and then the causal

1067
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:54,280
thing is thrown in and then people say therefore you shouldn't do it. Like you mean if shaming

1068
01:47:54,280 --> 01:48:01,480
didn't cause weight gain it would be okay to be immoral and cruel to others? No. I mean if you

1069
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:08,120
replace things like sex and race in that sentence you're like no it's not okay to shame and denigrate

1070
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:15,080
people because of their sex, race, age, body habitus regardless of whether it causes weight loss or

1071
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:21,800
weight gain. Period. It's a moral issue. It's not an empirical issue and I think that's we have a long

1072
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:28,280
way to go but I think we're making progress in people. Yeah I guess we can generalize this idea

1073
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:33,320
that you shouldn't denigrate people because of age, race, sex. Maybe you shouldn't denigrate them for

1074
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:41,720
other characteristics that are not you know moral failings. I think that on the basic science

1075
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:46,600
we're making progress. We could make better progress if we tightened up the rigor of our

1076
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:52,920
science. We could make better progress if we had more funding and many groups including the National

1077
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:58,600
Academy of Sciences and I'm on a strategic council to increase the rigor of science, all of science

1078
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:04,680
not just obesity nutrition but we're making progress. We know so much more about genes and

1079
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:12,440
physiology and metabolism and cells with respect to obesity and nutrition than we knew 20, 30, 40

1080
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:19,400
years ago. The one area where as far as I can tell we are not making progress and I don't think we

1081
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:25,240
are yet on a good path. I don't think we're on a path at all is the sort of public health community

1082
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:33,480
school-based, community-based, policy-based approach. I think we are continuing to look

1083
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:39,880
for our keys under the lampposts because that's where the light is as opposed to where the keys

1084
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:47,080
might be. I think we are continuing to ignore the data and keep saying the same old hackneyed

1085
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:52,040
suggestions that people have been trying for decades and that when you really look at the data

1086
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,840
have been at best not been shown to work and at worst been shown to not work.

1087
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:05,880
And I think there are some people who are patently obfuscating those data. I think the cluster

1088
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:11,960
randomized trials we see in the childhood obesity literature you know bring to mind the phrase that

1089
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:19,800
rhymes with cluster muck and it just this is cluster muck, this is distorted evidence, this is

1090
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:26,920
science gone wrong in the worst sense. I think we've got to clean that up. We've got to clean up

1091
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:34,200
the quality of the science we do and start treating this like science just as much as the science

1092
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:42,680
of quarks or tires on automobiles or beta cells of pancreases and treat it like real science and take

1093
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:48,360
it just as seriously. Can you tell folks briefly what the cluster randomization problem is? Sure.

1094
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:53,880
So a cluster randomized trial is a trial which instead of randomizing the individual unit of

1095
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:59,480
observation might be let's say a child in a school who you either assign to the treatment group,

1096
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:06,600
maybe it's exercise or the control group, no special exercise. You assign the entire an entire

1097
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:14,440
intact unit such as a classroom or a school or a neighborhood or a family. There's nothing wrong

1098
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:21,560
with that as long as you have theoretically at least two clusters assigned to each condition.

1099
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:27,240
So you have some ability to estimate a variance although frankly with only two you have so little

1100
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:33,160
power and robustness for practical purposes that would be invalid but theoretically it's valid.

1101
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:41,240
But then you must analyze the data to take into account both what's called the clustering and the

1102
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:46,680
nesting. The clustering is that you have people grouped and that grouping leads to more similar

1103
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:53,480
individuals. So imagine that we did a trial and the trial was you and your brother randomly assigned

1104
01:51:53,480 --> 01:52:00,440
to eat low carb and me and my brother randomly assigned to eat high carb and at the end we see

1105
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:07,080
a difference by an ordinary tea test and you say well hold on a second was that really the effective

1106
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:13,320
diet or was that the Attia brothers are different than the Allison brothers? Well you have to take

1107
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:18,680
that into account so that's you need more than one cluster right so if you get the Attia brothers

1108
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:25,080
and the Jones brothers and the Allison brothers and the Smith brothers now in theory you can do it

1109
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:29,880
but now you can't treat us like we're eight different people right what you really have

1110
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:34,600
is four different clusters four different SIB ships four different sets of brothers you've got

1111
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:41,560
to take that into account you have less degrees of freedom people don't do that reliably they don't

1112
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:48,760
do it correctly often and that leads to many papers being wrong we've written countless letters to

1113
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:55,320
editors about this I think we've probably had at least three or four cluster randomized trials

1114
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:59,640
retracted as a result of letters we've written where people have had to come back and just say

1115
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:08,520
the results don't hold up but until until this has changed we have people out there who understandably

1116
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:18,120
say but I read these papers suggesting that this works gardening in schools makes kids thinner

1117
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:23,240
like no that's not what the results showed but that's what the paper says and until we

1118
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:29,240
become more rigorous and more honest we're not on a path so if I were to ask you now to speculate

1119
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:38,120
outside of known things if you had to guess and if you presuppose that there is an intervention

1120
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:46,520
or a set of interventions that could improve public health outcomes what would your guesses be

1121
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:56,600
what would your guesses be what would you guess to test general education not nutrition education

1122
01:53:56,600 --> 01:54:04,120
general education there is provocative data I don't want to say definitive data there are

1123
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:11,080
provocative data strongly suggesting that general education especially for girls and women

1124
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:18,760
leads to lower bmis lesser rates of obesity and lesser diabetes than less education

1125
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:24,440
so there are some studies in europe of policies where someone puts in a policy and it effectively

1126
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:31,560
gives a cohort of people more education and then you see in that cohort less obesity especially

1127
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:37,720
among women there's a famous study by the ramies who were a husband wife investigative team who

1128
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:42,760
actually worked at uab when I first got there and they started this study decades ago at unc

1129
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:49,800
and it was sort of head start on steroids it was they called it the abc adarian or a baccadarian

1130
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:56,360
study and they gave these kids the super head start program and it was mostly just general

1131
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:00,040
education there may have been a little nutrition education but mostly just general education

1132
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:04,680
wasn't a weight loss study wasn't intended to be 30 years later they followed them up there's a

1133
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:11,960
paper in science on this guess what the women have less obesity the moving to opportunity study

1134
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:17,240
funded by the department of housing and urban development took families who lived in so-called

1135
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:23,880
poor neighborhoods and they gave them either randomly assigned them either to control

1136
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:29,800
but it basically got nothing or to housing vouchers but the housing vouchers required that

1137
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:36,600
they move to less poor neighborhoods and what they then found years later in follow-up again

1138
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:42,360
published in science and doing the journal of medicine is that there was less obesity and

1139
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:48,760
diabetes in those assigned to move to the less poor neighborhoods and given the financial

1140
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:56,840
wherewithal to do so so i could go on but these are things that suggest to me that education

1141
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:02,440
general education may help and i think that may speak to this whole socioeconomic thing we started

1142
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:07,960
that way earlier what is it about higher socioeconomic status that at least in some

1143
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:14,920
groups at all but at least in white women seems to be associated with less obesity and i don't know

1144
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:21,080
what the causal mechanisms are but that might be my best so somebody said to me you're going to be

1145
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:26,520
the king for a year and you've got the federal budget and you can take this big chunk of money

1146
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:33,080
and you can make an impact in obesity and diabetes i would say i'm going to divide it into four pots

1147
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:42,600
one pot is going to be surgery and it's going to be both providing it and continue to study it

1148
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:47,400
the next one's going to be pharmaceuticals both providing it continuing to study it

1149
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:52,200
third pot is going to be some general education maybe general well-being safety security

1150
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:58,600
starting in early childhood to see whether that alone is enough and it may be really reducing

1151
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:05,160
disparities back to confucius confucius said we are not so concerned with an absence of wealth

1152
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:12,280
we are concerned with a disparity of wealth and so it may be that reducing disparities is really

1153
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:16,840
important and then the fourth pot would be basic research and i'd like to say let's look at

1154
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:22,920
senolytics and let's look at microchimerism and all the things that you talk about so often in

1155
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:29,960
your podcast that that a butt against both metabolism and obesity and nutrition but also

1156
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:37,320
the fundamental uh fundamental senescence so i'd love to say can we use microchimerism to restore

1157
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:42,920
people to younger metabolic states can we use senolytics to do that that would be my fourth

1158
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:49,000
bucket those basic science questions now a moment ago you you touched briefly on um

1159
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:54,120
the national academy of science engineering and medicine you were on a panel that

1160
01:57:55,400 --> 01:58:01,160
looked at the question of reproducibility in science correct this was two years ago i think

1161
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:09,560
now the consensus i believe was that there was not a crisis but but we shouldn't

1162
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:16,440
we shouldn't let our guards down am i sort of paraphrasing that correctly close uh the phrase

1163
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:21,800
that that uh harvey feinberg who is the chair of it i don't know if it's his phrase but you know

1164
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:30,280
he started using and and we followed is no crisis but no cause for complacency and the idea of no

1165
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:36,120
cause for complacency or no complacency is we must make things better the no crisis is a tricky one

1166
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:41,560
is a tricky one expense what you mean by crisis and some people say if you look at dictionary

1167
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:46,120
definitions of crisis the idea is that's a system about to collapse so you know you need to go to the

1168
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:51,480
icu if you don't get intervention you're going to die you're in crisis there's no evidence that

1169
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:55,720
science is in crisis there's no evidence that science is about to die or it doesn't work anymore

1170
01:58:56,760 --> 01:59:03,720
not at all another way is to say things are getting much much worse rapidly there's also

1171
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:07,800
no clear evidence for that there might be some things that are getting worse but on average

1172
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:11,800
there's a lot of evidence that things are getting better my own belief is science is better and more

1173
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:17,080
rigorous than it's ever been in history um and so in that sense no i still don't think there's a

1174
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:21,800
crisis but there's a third way which is i think the spark for many social movements if you think

1175
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:26,280
about what often happens is a social movement is you have a group of people that for example are

1176
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:31,560
often often it's around oppression and they're oppressed and they're sufficiently oppressed that

1177
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:38,920
people are unwilling to make too much noise and the status quo is only very slowly and grudging

1178
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:44,280
and then at some point people feel a little bit more confident and a little less oppressed

1179
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:50,680
and they start to speak and people say this state of affairs is not acceptable anymore

1180
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:55,560
and if you were to say in that later point in time but it's much better than it was

1181
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:01,880
in the earlier time someone might say it may be much better but we ain't taking it anymore

1182
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:08,040
right things may be much better than they used to be things in 2021 are probably much better for

1183
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:13,400
many situations than they were in 1921 and much better than than they were in 1821

1184
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:19,160
but there comes a point we say you know this lead in gasoline or this lead paint lead in our paint

1185
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:24,840
or this way in which we use heating or these kinds of lack of catalytic converters on cars

1186
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:29,960
or this way in which we burn up fossil fuel or this way in which we treat different age-raised

1187
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:35,880
sex groups it's just not okay anymore yes it may be better than it was years ago the world has

1188
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:40,520
spoken we won't take it anymore i think that's where we are scienceing yes science is probably

1189
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:46,040
better than it's ever been but we also see all the flaws and it must get better and that's why

1190
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:51,800
marshall mcmutt the president of the national academy of sciences instantiated this new strategic

1191
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:57,880
council on trust and integrity and rigor in science and very generously appointed me as one

1192
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:03,640
of the three co-chairs marcia france cordova who's the director emeritus of the national science

1193
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:08,680
foundation and i have three co-chairs and are working on trying to see what you know we as the

1194
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:14,520
academies can do to try to help a little bit and many other organizations are also trying to help

1195
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:21,240
on this how much of the crisis in science uh well i guess we're just decided we're not going to use

1196
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:30,840
the word crisis how much of the situation in science is intrinsic is within science itself

1197
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:41,160
and how much of it is a result of the public inclusive of the media's interface with science

1198
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:48,440
i think it's both i think science is hard uh michael strevin's book which i mentioned earlier

1199
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:54,200
the knowledge machine does a wonderful treatise on that and i think we have to recognize that and

1200
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:59,960
but i think we have to make the distinction between normative errors and non-normative errors

1201
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:05,080
and let's take an example of each so a few hundred years ago gallileo is under house arrest

1202
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:11,720
the pope has said you know bad writing about capernicus stay locked up in your house but we

1203
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:19,560
will kill you and from his house gallileo directs an experiment or not really an experiment a study

1204
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:29,720
and he has um two colleagues go out to two tops of mounds or hills or mountains far apart

1205
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:37,160
each holding a lantern with shutters and a synchronized watch or timepiece and he says

1206
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:43,480
to them at a predetermined moment you guys open your shutters and you record when you see the

1207
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:49,320
other guy's light and we'll figure out whether light travels instantaneously or not right is

1208
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:54,120
there some delay until the light gets to you and they conclude that it's instantaneous they can't

1209
02:02:54,840 --> 02:03:00,680
discern any time now we know today of course that that's wrong ole roma probably is the first

1210
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:05,640
person who convincingly shows it's wrong when he shows that a moon comes around at a time different

1211
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:11,960
than his mentor domini cosini predicted but at the time that's the answer they get with their

1212
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:17,640
instrumentation they couldn't have done better i would call that a norman vera i would not mock

1213
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:23,320
gallileo i don't think gallileo did anything wrong i think we look at him as brilliant my god great

1214
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:30,280
question great worry of working on it but things move along similarly when lion is pauling says

1215
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:37,560
dna is a triple helix right before watson and crit come out to double helix um he didn't have

1216
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:43,400
good x-ray crystallography date he's working at the edge normative error then there are other

1217
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:51,080
things very famous non-normative error is people working out the size of the thymus gland of

1218
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:57,560
children it worked it out from cadavers in the early 20th century guess what people don't become

1219
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:04,040
cadavers at random poor people tend to become cadavers poor children tend to be undernourished

1220
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:08,760
undernourished children tend to have smaller thymus glands so when physicians started seeing

1221
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:15,240
children richer children coming in dying of sudden infant death syndrome and they examined

1222
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:21,000
them they go it's a big thymus gland well it was actually a normal thymus gland because their

1223
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:26,280
norms were from undernourished kids so let's irradiate these kids with big thymus glands

1224
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:31,560
and prevent sudden infant death syndrome and probably cause lots of cases of thyroid cancer

1225
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:38,440
because the thyroid and the thymus are very close to each other so that's an example of a non-normative

1226
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:44,200
error because even a hundred years ago any epidemiologist or statistician could have told you

1227
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:51,320
that is bad sampling and bad inference from bad sampling we need to make that distinction between

1228
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:55,800
normative and non-normative errors and a lot of the errors that we have in nutrition epidemiology

1229
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,760
today i don't think can be called normative errors anymore i think we have to say that was

1230
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:06,440
non-normative the misanalysis of the cluster randomized trials these are not normative any

1231
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:13,880
statistician knows how to do it people are either obfuscating or they're just woefully

1232
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:19,560
ignorant and not using professional statisticians when they need to people using food frequency

1233
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:24,520
questionnaires to draw causal inferences about some of these things we were discussed these are

1234
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:29,240
not normative errors people should know better then there's the stuff about this sort of more

1235
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:36,040
general public about believing things and how we how we promote our ideas and here's where i think

1236
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:42,360
i think our root is us in the scientific community that have to take responsibility for it but it

1237
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:48,920
branches out beyond us i think we need to be prepared to lose some battles in order to win

1238
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:55,720
the intellectual war and what i mean by that is we need to be prepared to not use all the

1239
02:05:55,720 --> 02:06:02,760
rhetorical tools at our disposal at any one point in time to convince somebody that x is true even

1240
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:07,880
when we're really worked up and think it's important we believe x is true we think it's

1241
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:11,960
important that others believe x is true right because we want them to eat what we think is good

1242
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:17,240
we want them to eat more broccoli and less ice cream we want them to take their vaccine wear their

1243
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:23,400
mask wear their seat belt stop smoking we may be right about all those things right maybe people

1244
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:27,080
should eat more broccoli and less ice cream and wear their seat belt get vaccinated and wear their

1245
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:34,120
mask and seat belt but if we use rhetorical devices such as if you and i are debating

1246
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:39,800
and i attack you on that hominin grounds or i exaggerate the strength of my evidence

1247
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:46,840
or i don't honestly say that i've shown an association and not causation then in fact i

1248
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:52,840
may win that battle that day on convincing people to eat broccoli instead of ice cream

1249
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:57,880
but i've lost the battle in helping people think through what good evidence is

1250
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:05,320
and elevating our level of dialogue and i think if we can get to the point where just as today we

1251
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:09,720
changed our dialogue we think about the things people would say think about what a late night

1252
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:17,400
comedian would have said 30 years ago in making jokes about wives and husbands and race and sex

1253
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:26,200
that would never be considered acceptable today we are able to change societal norms about dialogue

1254
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:34,040
can we elevate our societal norms of dialogue on epistemologic and empirical issues so that we can

1255
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:39,480
get people to you don't have to be a genius to say oh you're telling me you have a treatment for x

1256
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:46,440
was there a study was the study in humans was it a randomized study was it a study of the actual

1257
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:51,640
outcome you're making a claim about was it a study that was long enough for this to be a meaningful

1258
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:56,840
outcome was there a statistically significant result was the result big enough to matter was

1259
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:03,400
the dose a dose i might realistically take those are not all that difficult questions to train

1260
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:08,840
ourselves and each other to just reliably ask and if we just reliably ask those and reliably and

1261
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:13,480
honestly answer them you would go a long way yeah it's interesting i mean it's impossible to

1262
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:23,560
have this discussion without thinking about covet because covet has been such a polarizing

1263
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:33,400
scientific phenomenon in a way that i've i've become quite frustrated in watching it right

1264
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:42,200
i've and i'm trying to maintain a distance from it and ask myself the question is the reason that

1265
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:54,520
the head of the cdc makes assertions about masks or vaccines or mandates because she doesn't think

1266
02:08:54,520 --> 02:09:02,680
that the people to whom she's speaking are intelligent enough to appreciate nuance

1267
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:08,440
or is it because she doesn't actually appreciate the nuance herself you know and this gets to

1268
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:15,400
exactly the point you made a moment ago which is the high ground is being lost right i think the

1269
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:24,200
public's faith in science in the institution of science is eroding dramatically and i think covet

1270
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:30,440
has accelerated that in a way that i wouldn't have predicted i remember having a discussion

1271
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:45,160
with a friend in march of 2020 and i very very naively said to him i think that what we're about

1272
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:52,520
to see with respect to the speed with which medications and vaccines are going to be developed

1273
02:09:53,400 --> 02:10:00,920
is going to elevate the consciousness of science in the public's eye i think the public is going to

1274
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:11,160
look back in a year and say wow science is great you know just as in the 1960s the best and the

1275
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:18,680
brightest kids went into engineering because they were inspired by the space race i stupidly thought

1276
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:26,680
this might be the end of every smart kid becoming an investment banker and instead we might just see

1277
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:35,240
more kids enrolling in science how silly of me to not envision what was coming which was

1278
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:43,720
a world in which well-meaning public health officials simply failed to communicate the

1279
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:52,280
nuance of science and lost so much credibility yeah covet has been unique and and i think you

1280
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:58,280
know one of the things i was saying to to my wife recently is i hope i live at least another 20 years

1281
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:04,360
for many reasons but one of the reasons is that i really want to see what the historians say

1282
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:11,160
about the period of roughly 2016 to a year or two from now when hopefully

1283
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:14,360
we are somewhat out of this pandemic

1284
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:23,960
i can see it in the present i want to see it in the 2020 hindsight let me let me say two things

1285
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:35,160
about your points one is about motivations and the other is about trust the motivations issue i think

1286
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:39,960
is an interesting one you know i was having a conversation with a colleague many years ago

1287
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:46,760
and i was ranting about university accountants and how they're there you know they drive me crazy

1288
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:52,920
with little things and this friend of mine said to me he says think about you and your science he

1289
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:58,360
says you're so fastidious about it you're so passionate about it you're so committed to it

1290
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:05,960
one iota of bending the truth is not okay for you he says the accountant feels that way about

1291
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:11,480
the way the accounting is done and that's their domain different people have their different

1292
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:16,840
domains and if i were to say to you you know peter what are you professionally or you might say any

1293
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:20,520
or what are you just more generally you might say you might say i'm a father you might say i'm a

1294
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:25,240
physician i i'm a healer you might say i'm a scientist you might say a few other things

1295
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:30,920
when i came to iu i was at a big retreat and friend of mine was there and we started going

1296
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:35,240
around and introducing ourselves and i was sort of a new kid on the block and i said you know my

1297
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:39,960
name is david alson and i'm a scientist and i study blah blah blah and he said you know the first

1298
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:44,600
thing you said you're like you're the new dean here and the first thing you said is i'm a scientist

1299
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:49,000
you didn't say i'm the dean of the school of public health he says that shows how you think of yourself

1300
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:57,240
if i were to say if you were to say to me in your professional role what's the one thing

1301
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:06,360
you must never compromise truth what's my one sacred duty pursue and communicate truth to the

1302
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:12,280
best of my ability but if you said to some other people in my field who are equally good people

1303
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:17,960
maybe better people who knows and you said to them what's your one uncompromising duty

1304
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:27,400
some of them would say help people make their health better or enact justice

1305
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:33,880
can't say they're wrong that's their value and i think that's what comes out a lot in public

1306
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:39,560
health there are true believers who think they know the right answer they think eating this is

1307
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:44,520
better than eating that in many cases they're probably right they think not smoking is better

1308
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:52,120
than smoking i agree i think they're right and given those premises they say whatever it takes

1309
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:58,280
to convince people to eat a and not b to wear their seatbelt to not smoke i'm willing to say it

1310
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:04,120
that's my sacred duty is making better i think that's part of the problem what's our identity

1311
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:08,680
who's speaking and i think we need to be clear when we are speaking as scientists then we must

1312
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:13,640
not compromise truth and i think when we're speaking as advocates that's fine just say you're

1313
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:17,240
an advocate say i'm not being a scientist right now i'm just telling you what i want you to do and

1314
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:22,760
i'm going to say whatever i need to say to convince you i think that's important the other thing i want

1315
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:28,760
to pick up is this trust idea i hear a lot especially from people within science and academia

1316
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:34,120
especially from people who are somewhat on the left but not only on the left side of the

1317
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:41,640
political spectrum who say trust in science is really way down in the last few years

1318
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:47,480
and i'm not sure that's true in fact i don't think it is true depends what you mean by science

1319
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:55,720
if what you mean is science as a process of developing and finding knowledge i know of no

1320
02:14:55,720 --> 02:15:01,800
evidence that it's down and the the results of the pew uh charitable trust in their surveys for

1321
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:11,080
example suggest that it's not if what you mean by science is trust in individual elements of the

1322
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:18,600
scientific community then i'm not sure it's down either but it's spread around so some people think

1323
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:24,520
fauci is trustworthy and some people think weneth paltrow is trustworthy some people think david

1324
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:28,760
alison is and some people think peter it is and some people think we're corrupt and ignorant and

1325
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:35,800
confused and terrible um and i think the the challenge is that there are people who cannot

1326
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:43,160
distinguish between the the statements of a tony fauci and the extent to which they are or are not

1327
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:48,920
backed by evidence and the statements of a johnny anedes and this extent to which they are not back

1328
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:53,800
versus the statements of a gwyneth paltrow or somebody else and i think that's the challenge

1329
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:59,800
it's not that people don't trust science they don't know which voice to trust as a communicator

1330
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:07,000
of the science and therefore they don't trust individual elements of the canon of science

1331
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:14,840
and we see that very strongly in nutrition there's a nice summary on the pewchattable trust website

1332
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:23,960
now indicating that trust in science is high trust in dieticians is high trust in medical doctors

1333
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:30,520
who talk about nutrition in treating their patients is high but trust in nutrition scientists

1334
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:36,520
compared to dieticians and medical doctors who talk about nutrition and compared to other

1335
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:44,760
scientists is low so in nutrition we have met the enemy and it is us we have shot ourselves

1336
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:54,280
in the credibility foot with our obfuscation and our exaggeration and our hype and i think

1337
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:59,240
that pocket of trust is gone even though trust in science overall is not down

1338
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:06,840
david this was this was a fantastic discussion you are always so lucid in the way that you

1339
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:11,400
can talk about an idea including this very one i think this this this point that we're ending on

1340
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:16,920
is is really really spot on and i think that this the difference between science and advocacy can't

1341
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:23,880
be overstated and i think it would be amazing if people myself included all of us had the self

1342
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:30,280
awareness to speak and know which hat we were wearing i mean that think about the problems that

1343
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:37,000
could be solved if one you allowed people to wear both hats but they always had to have a hat on you

1344
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:41,160
you couldn't you couldn't you know blind the listener from which hat you're wearing

1345
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:48,120
and if you were wearing your scientist hat you would be delivering the nuanced hard truth

1346
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:56,600
as messy as it might be as unclear as it might be with no regard for how a person feels when

1347
02:17:56,600 --> 02:18:01,640
they hear it and what action they may or may not take as a result of it and of course if you're

1348
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:04,680
really just in the business of saying i want to change your behavior because i think it's in your

1349
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:10,120
best interest i'm going to put the different hat on i like this idea we we i think there's

1350
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:17,080
something here we we can come up with a two hat system and everybody gets to own two hats you know

1351
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:22,280
every one of us in our lives have to deal with this we're both fathers as fathers you face this

1352
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:29,480
all the time sometimes your kid says you can i do this and you say no and they could say why well

1353
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:33,880
because i think you might get hurt or it's a bad idea or something bad might happen or you won't

1354
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:37,960
get that good thing and they say do you know are you sure and they have a counter argument

1355
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:42,120
and everyone say i don't know and i'm not sure i have no randomized controlled trial that climbing

1356
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:48,120
that tree is too dangerous i'm just telling you i don't think it's a good idea but i have no i

1357
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:54,200
have no need to pretend that i did a scientific experiment i'm your dad and that tree looks

1358
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:58,760
dangerous to me and i'm telling you to get down from it right now and then there are other times

1359
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:03,080
i'm acting as a scientist and i say this is what would constitute adequate evidence and this is

1360
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:09,800
what we know just like confucius said know what you know know what you don't know brilliant thank

1361
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:15,080
you david it's been a pleasure sitting here with you today thank you my friend great to see you
