00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Peter Attia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia. The drive

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,000
is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,800
years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,200
this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,120
a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more

00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:41,880

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,120
In this podcast, I'm speaking with Dr. Ron Kraus. First and foremost, Ron is a very close

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,640
friend and an amazing mentor. I was introduced to Ron probably five years ago and have worked

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,360
with him closely in a number of capacities. And he's always served as one of the three

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,800
or four lipidologists that when I get stumped on a really difficult clinical case, he's

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,600
the person that I'm reaching out to along with a couple of these other folks that hopefully

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,600
will also have on the podcast at some point. So he is certainly recognized globally for

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,440
his research in lipidology. He wears a ton of hats. He's a clinician, obviously a lipidologist.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,160
His interest in nutrition, genetics, drug research is quite profound. He obtained, I

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,220
believe both his college degrees and medical degrees from Harvard. He's board certified

17
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,200
in internal medicine, endocrinology, and metabolism. And currently he's a senior scientist and

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,760
the director of atherosclerosis research at the Children's Hospital in Oakland. So in

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,560
this episode, we talk about a lot of stuff, but obviously we're really focusing on atherosclerosis

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,560
and cardiovascular disease. I was really excited to have this discussion with him because a

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,880
lot of these topics I've certainly covered in writing. As some of you may know, I have

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,640
that sort of nine part straight dope on cholesterol series on the blog that I probably wrote about

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
four or five years ago. Obviously some of that's a little bit outdated. And I also was

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
quite deliberate when I wrote that not to be prescriptive, meaning I don't really get

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,240
into this is the drug treatment you would do for this. And I largely avoided a lot of

26
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,800
that stuff. Whereas in this podcast, Ron and I get a little bit into this. This podcast was

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,200
pretty technical at times. So my hope is that both the curious patient will get a lot out of

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,640
that and hopefully the physician will get a lot out of this or the person that is also kind of on

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,320
the front lines of having to make decisions about how to treat dyslipidemia and reduce the risk of

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,340
atherosclerotic disease. I think a couple of really interesting things in this. I actually for the

31
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,700
first time learned about Ron's motivation for this, both his family history and the five

32
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,540
legendary articles that he read in the New England Journal of Medicine that largely shaped his career.

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,080
This is the stuff we talk about with Friedrichs and Levee and Lees who I've written about in the

34
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,420
cholesterol series because these guys are sort of the fathers of this space. We certainly get into

35
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,740
one of the age old debates about LDL particle size versus particle number. Lots of controversy here.

36
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,500
I don't represent that we've necessarily resolved it, but I think that's the beauty of talking with

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,580
really smart, sophisticated, nuanced people is they have the humility to say we don't know the

38
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,060
answer sometimes. We really dive deep into the whole statin discussion for reasons that aren't

39
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,380
entirely clear to me. This has become an increasingly controversial area and somehow it's turned into a

40
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:34,340
binary discussion. Statins are good or statins are bad. Very few things in life tend to be that binary.

41
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,900
I'm sort of surprised that it's turned into that. I don't remember if I even say this on the podcast,

42
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,380
but certainly people have probably heard me say this before and I say it to patients all the time,

43
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,220
statins are tools. The most important thing when you have a tool is knowing how to use it and knowing

44
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,220
when to use it. If you have a Phillips screwdriver, it's really important to know that it's very good

45
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,140
at putting Phillips screws into things. It's not good at putting nails into things. It's not good

46
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,460
at cleaning windows. I hope we can shed some light on that. We talk a little bit about the

47
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,060
really interesting and recent stuff around chronic inflammation and the role that that plays in

48
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,340
atherosclerosis, even independent of cholesterol levels. Perhaps for me personally, one of the most

49
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,660
interesting things we discussed was another very controversial topic, which is around niacin and

50
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,820
niacpan, which is a branded version of that. Those of you who follow this world will know that niacin

51
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,260
was basically kicked to the curb a couple of years ago. I think that Ron's insights into that

52
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,020
are incredibly interesting and actually have even made me re-question or re-evaluate, I guess, my

53
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,540
willingness to ever consider using it again. Ron does a great job explaining the HDL paradox,

54
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,060
meaning why is it that all the pharmacologic efforts to raise HDL seem to also raise heart

55
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,220
disease or at best make it know better. Finally, we end with a discussion of PCSK9 inhibitors,

56
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,420
which I suspect we'll have a completely dedicated podcast to this topic at some point. We touch on

57
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,680
LPa, though later on in the release of this podcast, we're going to have a dedicated discussion on

58
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,180
LPa. Okay. With all that said, you can find a ton more information, including a lot of links to the

59
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,340
papers that Ron has mentioned, more information about Ron in the show notes, which are at

60
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,760
peteratiamd.com forward slash podcast. So without further ado, here is my conversation with Dr. Ron

61
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:33,660
Krauss. Well, I'm here with Dr. Ron Krauss today. And this is a really exciting topic for me. People

62
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,580
know I've written about this a lot. I talk about this a lot clinically, but the genesis of this

63
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,900
discussion today is that about a month ago, I called Ron to have a discussion with him about

64
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,300
one of my patients in particular. It was a patient who had a pretty elevated calcium score,

65
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,340
if I recall, pretty significant LAD calcifications. That's the artery in the left side of the heart.

66
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,340
But he was very hesitant to do any treatment and he wanted a second opinion. So I thought we should

67
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,420
involve Ron. And Ron, I remember I was sitting in my kitchen, we spoke for probably half an hour.

68
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,700
And at the end of the conversation, I said, you know, Ron, I wish we recorded that conversation,

69
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,900
because this is exactly the kind of stuff that I think a lot of physicians and patients would

70
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,700
benefit from. And so I said, you know, why don't we do this again, more formally? And that brings us

71
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:28,060
here today. Let's start with a big question, but an important one for where we're going. And that's

72
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,820
basically the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. A very recent review article I read described it

73
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,780
quite eloquently as a smoldering inflammatory condition fueled by lipids. What does that mean?

74
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,900
Well, first of all, thank you, Peter, for asking me to talk with you today and address this topic,

75
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,620
which as you know, I have a deep and longstanding interest in. Hopefully I can address the issues

76
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:58,540
that you're also interested in and we'll have a good conversation. Well, atherosclerosis, of course,

77
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,460
is the underlying process that leads ultimately to vascular disease, particularly clinically

78
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,340
events, heart attack and stroke. It starts in childhood, is well known that there is early on

79
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,060
the buildup of cholesterol in the artery wall that forms what's called fatty streaks. And that's a

80
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,100
process that's actually a fairly normal condition, even in young people. And if it doesn't progress

81
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:32,020
any further than that, it's really not hazardous. It's a way that arterial tissue can put cholesterol

82
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,540
in its cells and some of that cholesterol is actually used for various purposes. So that's

83
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:43,180
not necessarily a pathologic process, but it can progress. And when it progresses, there is a

84
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,980
combination of factors that conspire to make that fatty streak into a much more toxic process. And

85
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,660
it is fueled by lipids, the same lipids that lead to the fatty streak. But under conditions that

86
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:04,180
many of us live under, there are changes in the lipoproteins that are taken up by the artery. And

87
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:11,420
we'll talk about those in more detail in a minute. In particular, susceptibility to oxidation and the

88
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,020
change in the properties that allows them to stick more tightly to the artery wall. And when that

89
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,900
happens, particularly the oxidative changes, it does trigger inflammation as a very early part of

90
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,660
this next phase of the disease process. And inflammation is defined in one way as the

91
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:37,020
accumulation of cells in the artery wall that deliver various inflammatory molecules, things

92
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:44,060
that ordinarily if one bruises oneself or has some sort of an injury, those inflammatory processes

93
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,860
cause redness and accumulation in some cases of clotting factors. When that happens in the artery,

94
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,460
that can convert this fatty streak into something that is much more malignant. And then there is a

95
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,740
process that kind of feeds on itself. And it does involve platelets and clotting factors in an

96
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,260
important way. And it involves a number of inflammatory molecules. And if there's continuing

97
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,700
input of these bad atherogenic, if you will, lipoprotein particles, that can actually change the

98
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:21,500
nature of the plaque, and inflammation comes into play in a very serious way, when that results in a

99
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,540
breakdown of the surface of the plaque, which ordinarily protects it from any kind of serious

100
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,380
consequences. So even fatty streak can develop, which can develop into a plaque. And a plaque in this

101
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,460
case is essentially a larger fatty streak. The plaque has a cholesterol, but it also has all these

102
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:44,340
other cells, it's a much more complex phenomenon. So that plaque is ordinarily under relatively benign

103
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,140
conditions, encapsulated by a fibrous layer. But inflammation in the release of various molecules can

104
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,140
cause that fibrous cap, that protective cap to weaken and ultimately potentially rupture. And when that

105
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,300
rupture occurs, that is the beginning of the end in terms of the process that we're talking about here. Most

106
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,660
cases of heart attack and stroke involve this type of acute rupture, and ultimately formation of a

107
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,740
clot that blocks the arterial flow. So starting from a relatively benign process, this can develop into

108
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,300
something that's much more serious.

109
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,540
Now, when I was in medical school, I remember in first year pathology lecture, the pathologist said, let's

110
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,180
see a show of hands, what is the most common first presentation of heart disease? And you know, everybody

111
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,820
puts up their hands and says, chest pain, left shoulder pain, shortness of breath. And he said, no, no, no, no, no,

112
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,340
it's sudden death. Yeah, that was a little over 20 years ago. Is that still true today?

113
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,660
Estimates I've heard and I think this this is arguable because these are really rough rule of the thumb

114
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,820
calculations, somewhere in the range of 30%, possibly upwards of 30%, which is still a huge number.

115
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,580
It's staggering. It means that one third of people's first brush with the knowledge that they have atherosclerosis

116
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,100
is death. And I have patients, and I'm sure you do as well, who have died and come back. And so there is this

117
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,140
process where there's an acute event that causes an irreversible change. But for some people, fortunately, we can

118
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,980
bring them back. But together, that represents really the basis for calling this disease the silent killer.

119
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,820
Because as you're saying, we don't in those patients have premonitory symptoms, sometimes in retrospect, they are

120
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,980
there. And I think that's the important reason for educating the public, as organizations like the American Heart

121
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,300
Association does, as to the first signs of heart disease, because it may be and probably is true, that a

122
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,380
significant component of that 30%.

123
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,540
Right upon further querying, there was some exercise intolerance.

124
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,220
Didn't recognize it. Yeah. And it's very hard sometimes. One of the things that we'll be talking about is ways of

125
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,620
assessing risk. And those are still imperfect. And we can't, with 100% certainty, use any kind of risk

126
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,300
predictor to know if somebody's destined to have a heart attack with certainty.

127
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,780
Yeah, you said something at the outset, which is this is a disease that begins in infancy. And I have very few

128
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,180
textbooks and or papers that I refer to so frequently that they actually sit on my desk in my office so that every

129
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,780
time I'm with a patient, I can pull them out. But one of them was a book that was given to me by one of my mentors, I

130
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,580
consider you a great mentor, Tom Dayspring, a great mentor, Alan Snyderman, a great mentor. And Alan gave me this

131
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:31,220
textbook of pathology, I think, I believe it's Starry is the the author. And while I believe the data represented, they

132
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:37,180
were somewhat dated, because it was largely based on the Vietnam cohort and in Korea. Yes, where obviously smoking

133
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:44,260
would have been a higher prevalence than today. Right. The fact remains that when you look at autopsies of young people

134
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:52,500
who died of unrelated reasons, homicides, accidents, etc. And you look at the histologic sections of their coronary

135
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,980
arteries, it's amazing how many of them have lesions that are type three or beyond type three, meaning, obviously a

136
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,220
typopathological region where you go beyond Fatty Street.

137
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,540
Yes, indeed. Yeah, that's right. So a subset of these youths will have more advanced lesions. And the studies that have been

138
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:17,340
done have linked all of the usual risk factors, smoking, certainly diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, all of

139
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:25,540
an lipid disorder, all of those have been associated with the more advanced lesions in those individuals. So as you're

140
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,980
pointing out, even even a more significant plaque development can occur in childhood.

141
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,460
I think the thing that's hard for people to understand, and I think it's true of most chronic diseases, but I don't think any

142
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,300
disease in any disease, it is as clear as it is with atherosclerosis, which is the compounding nature of the disease. You

143
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,900
know, another great example of one of those questions that the professor asks that gets everybody stumped, which is what's the

144
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:55,580
greatest risk for heart disease? You know, is it smoking? Nope. Is it high blood pressure? Nope. Is it dyslipidemia? Nope. It's

145
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:02,300
age. That's right. It's age. I mean, and why is it age? Because it's exposure, it's time, it's area under the curve.

146
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah, that's exactly true. You know, age, regrettably, is a risk factor that cuts across many of the diseases, chronic diseases that we have to deal with,

147
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:19,820
cancer, for example. And yeah, that's right. It's a cumulative process that can progress at various rates, depending the condition. So

148
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:27,700
people, as you know, when we talk about who have genetically elevated, severely elevated cholesterol levels, will have that process

149
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:35,980
accelerate and have the disease sort of clinically early on, sometimes with these severe genetic disorders and the teens, whereas others, most of the

150
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:45,540
population, fortunately, who do have risk factors, show a gradual increase in the manifestation of disease as a result of those risk factors as a

151
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,700
function of their age.

152
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:53,940
You know, at last check, and I can't remember if it was JAMA or another journal, but it was about a year ago, and they looked at some actuarial data for

153
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:02,260
people out through being past centenarians. And the only disease, once you normalised for a few things, the only disease that increased

154
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,220
monotonically by decade in risk was atherosclerosis.

155
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,860
From childhood.

156
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,460
Yeah, even cancer actually, you know, I think by the ninth decade, it started to come down.

157
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:20,820
I see. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know, it's definitely the latency period for cancer also is a factor there as well. So there's a sort of latency period where nothing

158
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,460
happens and all of a sudden, an older age, it pops up.

159
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,140
I'm sure a lot of people listening to this are going to say, OK, well, God, I'm really confused by half the terms you guys just used.

160
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,220
So let's unpack some of them, beginning with we use the term sometimes lipid cholesterol, lipoprotein.

161
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,460
We throw those terms around interchangeably, but I think it's probably important to give the average person a sense of an understanding.

162
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,380
So what is LDLC versus LDLP versus APOB and things like that?

163
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:55,700
Sure. The underlying concept that we are going to address is cholesterol, because that's really the compound.

164
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,580
It's the it's the molecule that winds up causing plaques.

165
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:08,900
So cholesterol is indeed an important component of the plaque and it gets into the plaque by uptake of cholesterol from lipoprotein particles.

166
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:16,740
And so lipoproteins are complex spherical macromolecules, big guys, which come in varying sizes

167
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,180
and are composed of cholesterol along with other lipids such as triglyceride.

168
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,900
And most importantly, perhaps for distinguishing the various types of lipoproteins, is their protein content.

169
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,940
So there's a variety of different proteins that form the package that actually a capsule around the lipid.

170
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
And so let me interrupt you for one second.

171
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,260
Is it just a point of clarification?

172
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:47,060
The reason we even need these lipoproteins is that cholesterol is hydrophobic.

173
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:55,940
It repels water. And so therefore to move cholesterol through the bloodstream, you have to package it in something that is hydrophilic or dissolves in water.

174
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,500
Is that correct?

175
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,900
Right. And for the techno files here, it's the cholesterol ester.

176
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,660
So there's two forms of cholesterol and it's the fatty form of cholesterol is cholesterol ester.

177
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,580
The other form is more waxy.

178
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,300
So the fatty form is transported right from one tissue to another.

179
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:26,580
And that is the purpose of lipoproteins, not just cholesterol, of course, but triglycerides, as I mentioned, even perhaps more importantly for many functions, energy metabolism and other compounds such as phospholipids, as well as passengers on the truck, certain vitamins, et cetera.

180
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,820
So these are packages that serve an important biologic function.

181
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,740
They're not here to cause heart attacks.

182
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
We divide them into various categories.

183
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:42,500
But the common parlance, sort of the most typical way that we think about cholesterol as a pathologic factor is when it's on LDL.

184
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,340
So that's called LDL cholesterol.

185
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,540
And that measures the amount of cholesterol on an LDL particle.

186
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,940
And LDL is low density lipoproteins.

187
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:56,740
So this is a form of lipoprotein that is characterized by size.

188
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:04,580
And it's also characterized by its density, which is related to its capacity to float because when there's fat in anything, it causes.

189
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,140
The thing to float and that's to varying degrees defines different classes of lipoproteins.

190
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,740
And it's the LDL that is the most strongly connected to cardiovascular disease risk.

191
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:31,220
And the cholesterol in LDL, which is measured commonly clinically as LDL cholesterol, is what has been most widely associated with cardiovascular risk and forms the basis for many of our recommendations for lowering risk.

192
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,860
But it's important to recognize that this is a tag on a much more complex substance, a particle.

193
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:45,380
And this will talk about, I think very shortly, particle is what causes the plaque to develop and it brings the cholesterol with it.

194
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:56,420
So the LDL particle, the low density lipoprotein itself, the spherical molecule or macromolecule, which carries around cholesterol,

195
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,740
phospholipid triglyceride, it has a signature on it, doesn't it?

196
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,820
Something called ApoB100.

197
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:14,340
That's right. The key protein that holds this particle together, that allows it to form a sphere and to encapsulate the lipid cargo, is called Apoprotein B.

198
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,140
There are two major forms of ApoB.

199
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,340
The one that's found in LDL particles is called ApoB100.

200
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:30,260
And oftentimes that is used as a surrogate for measuring LDL particle concentration, as we'll talk about.

201
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,100
And this is a big clinical distinction.

202
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:46,740
I think it is safe to say, at least in my relatively modest sampling of physicians, most physicians, let alone most patients, are not really clear on the distinction between the number when they say LDL is 100.

203
00:19:46,740 --> 00:20:00,900
They don't necessarily realize what they're saying is the LDL cholesterol is 100 milligrams per deciliter, meaning if you took all of the LDL particles in the body, smashed them apart, gathered the cholesterol ester, the mass per unit volume is 100.

204
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,940
And free cholesterol.

205
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,220
Yes. And that's very different from saying, how many of these particles do we have?

206
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,740
That's right. And that's important.

207
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:22,100
And so that observation really forms a very significant component of my history in this field, because I entered the field as a young fellow knowing about LDL cholesterol.

208
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,380
I was interested in diet effects and drug effects and heart disease.

209
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:36,100
But I learned about lipoproteins actually from a group of investigators in Berkeley, California, who were part of a team that initially identified lipoprotein particles.

210
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:51,700
And over the course of the next 10 or so years, I dug into that knowledge and discovered that there are subtypes of the various forms of LDL, as well as other lipoproteins, which we can talk about perhaps in a few minutes.

211
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:59,620
But focusing on the LDL, there can be variation in the amount of cholesterol that is carried on an LDL particle.

212
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,740
But there is only one April B per LDL.

213
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,340
So April B represents a pretty good signature for an LDL particle.

214
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,980
It is found on some other particles, but it's primarily on LDL.

215
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:19,540
But the amount of cholesterol attached to that April B as part of this particle can vary, as can other lipid components.

216
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,140
And that results in variation in both the size, as I mentioned, and the density.

217
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,260
So that some forms of LDL have less cholesterol and some have more cholesterol.

218
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:37,940
The ones that have less cholesterol are smaller, generally, and the ones that have more cholesterol are larger, but they all have one April protein B.

219
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:52,820
So there can be an important clinical consequence of focusing on LDL cholesterol to the exclusion of April B, because it's the particle that is really the agent of damage in the artery.

220
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:05,460
And measuring LDL cholesterol can under-represent the number of LDL particles compared with the measurement of April protein B, or April B, which is a much better measure of the number of particles.

221
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:18,740
And when individuals have smaller particles because of this variation in lipid content, they are actually at higher risk of heart disease because those particles have properties that render them more pathologic, more toxic.

222
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:28,180
So there's a double whammy. If you have small particles, first of all, clinical measurement of LDL cholesterol may under-represent the number of particles.

223
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:38,740
And furthermore, those particles themselves are considered by many, although there's still not total consensus on this point, to have greater pathologic properties.

224
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:54,740
So let's use a specific example. So if a patient has a blood cholesterol level, and let's just assume it's LDL calculate, measured directly, not even calculated, and the LDL cholesterol is 100 milligrams per deciliter.

225
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,700
At the Framingham population, that would place them at about the 20th percentile.

226
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:14,500
But let's say that patient has an LDL particle number of 1400 or 1300 nanomole per liter, and of course, in the units that tells you it's a number per unit volume, that places them at the 50th percentile.

227
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:24,820
Now, at least to me, the literature is very clear on, in the case of discordance, which of the two is driving risk.

228
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:38,820
I think both the Mesa population, the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, and the Framingham and Framingham offspring study, make it very clear that risk is tracking with the number of particles, not the cholesterol concentration.

229
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,980
Do you agree with that, or am I missing something?

230
00:23:40,980 --> 00:24:06,980
No, the data are out there. And just to take a step back, LDL cholesterol, that clinical measurement, has worked reasonably well for a significant subset of the population as a marker for LDL particles, because most individuals have particles somewhere in the middle of the LDL size and density range, and the cholesterol content in those particles is fairly proportional to the number of LDL particles.

231
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:25,980
So, as many things break down, is the increasing proportion of the population who have different LDL particle distributions, you need to consider that higher LDL particles with normal LDL cholesterol, which I will answer your question, yes, is associated with an increase in risk that's not reflected by LDL cholesterol.

232
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:41,980
So, that's the discordance we're talking about on the high end, and conversely, individuals who have high LDL cholesterol, but normal levels of ApoB will tend to have disproportionately less heart disease risk than would be predicted from the LDL cholesterol.

233
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:56,980
So, that's the discordance, which I think is pretty well demonstrated in a significant subset of the population at both ends. But underlying that, and again, there's some debate on this issue, it certainly reflects the numbers of particles, and that is the bottom line.

234
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:14,980
But it also reflects the types of those particles. So, there's really two features at both ends of that distribution, smaller cholesterol-depleted particles associated with discordance at the low cholesterol to Apo protein B ratio, and conversely, larger LDL particles associated with less risk at the other end.

235
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:33,980
And there may be systemic factors here at play, because there's some pretty, I think, pretty widely accepted data now. I think 10 years ago, this was a little more obscure, but one of the greatest drivers of the discordance in the wrong direction, meaning the LDL particle is disproportionately higher than the LDL cholesterol, is metabolic syndrome.

236
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:48,980
In fact, there's a very beautiful graph that I've written about at some point in my blog that talks about how, based on anywhere from zero to five of the characteristics that an individual has of metabolic syndrome, the proportion of discordance goes up.

237
00:25:48,980 --> 00:26:02,980
So, it also could be that as discordance rises, risk rises because of the other factors, such as hyperinsulinemia, which itself may contribute to intimal damage, inflammation, and other things. Is that possible?

238
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:27,980
It is absolutely possible and likely to be true. So, this brings up a pattern, a lipoprotein pattern, that I will take some credit for having to find in my own way about 27 years ago now, called the atherogenic dyslipidemia, or atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype, which is a constellation of lipid changes that includes higher triglyceride, lower HDL cholesterol.

239
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:43,980
So, that's the cholesterol in the protective form of lipoproteins being deficient, and a predominance of smaller LDL particles. And so, that triad, that lipid triad, is defined atherogenic dyslipidemia, and it folds right into the metabolic syndrome.

240
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:58,980
Right, two of those three make up two of your five criteria for metabolic syndrome, which for the listener would be low HDL cholesterol, high triglyceride, high fasting glucose, high blood pressure, and girth, basically obesing, drunkle obesity.

241
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,980
Yeah, yeah. So, I remember being part of the discussions where that metabolic syndrome was defined.

242
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,980
The syndrome X.

243
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:24,980
It's very interesting. Yeah, well, that started with insulin resistance as the centerpiece. You can put various molecules and various processes toward the center. They all contribute, and as you point out, hyperinsulinemia, associated with insulin resistance, is likely another marker of another process related to glucose metabolism and its consequences.

244
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:49,980
And then, the blood pressure connection is an intriguing one, but that's also part of it. But a lot of that is driven by increased girth. I mean, of the five conditions, the one that I think is the most prevalent underlying factor that leads to the development of metabolic syndrome is increased abdominal fat, which is associated with increased visceral fat around the internal organs.

245
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,980
And you can have metabolic syndrome without that, but the vast majority of people that...

246
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,980
Certainly Caucasians.

247
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Yeah. Yeah. And non-Caucasians, populations such as East Asians, who don't have increased waist, still can have increased fat internally as part of the syndrome. But it's probably acting on an underlying genetic predisposition, which is very common.

248
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:26,980
And there's many other factors that come into play as part of the syndrome. But I would say that dyslipidemia is probably, both clinically and pathologically, the one that I think has the most substance in terms of a direct, causal connection to cardiovascular disease.

249
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah. And I'll tell you, it's a very interesting historical footnote. Gary Taub's a mutual friend of ours. And I don't know if this actually was in any of his books, or I might have read this in one of the outtakes, but it was an interesting footnote, which was basically at the time of the Framingham study, which I'm talking about the very, very first Framingham study, which was really a two-part study, of course.

250
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:59,980
One of the things that came out of that study was that low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides was four times more predictive of atherosclerosis than elevated LDL cholesterol.

251
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:16,980
Now, that rings true with what we just said about metabolic syndrome. Nowhere in the five criteria of metabolic syndrome was high LDL-C. It's low HDL-C and high trig. But it's interesting that the LDL cholesterol story really took off, and at least Gary argued, I believe, if I'm remembering the earlier part,

252
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:30,980
that part of that had to do with the fact that the, God, I'm blanking on the name of the first trial, there was the LRCCP, but then there was the one before it had a funny name, like, improve it or something, but it wasn't.

253
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,980
No, it was a trial of, the Fibrate trial you were thinking of?

254
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
The Fibrate trial was LRCCP.

255
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:45,980
No, that was close to what I mean. So I think that's when you're thinking of it. I think you're thinking of the LRCC. So part of my training, yeah, that's where I got my training in the first trial.

256
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:55,980
That's where I got my training in lipids, before I came out to Berkeley, actually. That's where I got my first dose. And that study was going on at that time, and there was a lot of nail biting.

257
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Well, and the argument here was, look, we kind of spent, we lost a decade and a half between, say, 1980 and 1995, when we missed the role of insulin resistance, because we really went down this LDL cholesterol rabbit hole and didn't necessarily see the bigger picture.

258
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:27,980
And one of the things I hope we have time to talk about today, because it's actually something that I spend more time scratching my head about than anything else, is you look at a drug like niacin, which lowers APO-B, LDLC, and raises HDLC.

259
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:39,980
So in theory, it's doing everything in the right direction. And yet when it comes to outcomes, it's a very confusing picture. So maybe later on this afternoon, we can get to that, because I think that's, there's going to be some rich info in there.

260
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,980
If you put that on the table, I'll be happy to pick it up when you're ready, because I'm ready to launch into that anytime.

261
00:30:44,980 --> 00:31:08,980
I cannot wait. We're definitely going to do that. So, okay, let's talk a little bit about a paper that you were an author on this year. It was the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement. Now, you and I were joking about this a while ago, that you almost couldn't believe this paper needed to be written, but sometimes there's a benefit in writing it. And what was the conclusion of that paper? Or more to the point, consensus statement. It was more than just a paper. I mean, it was really a tour de force.

262
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:19,980
So this, this paper assembled multiple lines of evidence addressing the question, does LDL cause heart disease? Is LDL a causal factor for heart disease?

263
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:32,980
And just to be clear, the counter argument is, sure, people with high LDL are more likely to get heart disease. That can't be disputed. The epidemiology is clear. The counter argument is, but LDL is not a causal role.

264
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:49,980
That's right. And it's associated with that efforts to lower LDL cholesterol are not fully justified as a means of attacking the cause. I don't want to be responsible for having stated that incorrectly, because I still can't quite believe anybody would hold that opinion.

265
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:58,980
But that was my understanding that led to the group coming together to counteract that perception that lowering LDL was not beneficial.

266
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:11,980
But there are, there are many people, I mean, not that I spend terrible amounts of time on Twitter, but it's a pretty commonly held view, at least in the vocal minority that love to write about this and talk about this, that, hey, LDL cholesterol is a myth.

267
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
Like heart disease has nothing to do with this.

268
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:22,980
And the problem is, and it did come out in the paper to some extent, but I'll tell you, there is a second component to that effort that is still being written.

269
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:32,980
It was planned and will be a two part series. The first part is assembling all the evidence from epidemiology, clinical trials, genetics, etc. that speak to the causality.

270
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:51,980
And the second one was really relating all of this information to the role of LDL in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. And that paper is a work in progress, but it could be those two papers assemble just about all the evidence one needs to support the use of LDL cholesterol.

271
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,980
And when will that second paper be out? I can't tell you. It has taken longer than we thought.

272
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,980
Well, we'll certainly link to the first one in the show notes because that was published in early 2018.

273
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Yeah, we expected the next year or so. But one thing I do want to say, because there's a caveat and part of my life as a researcher, as well as a clinician, is recognizing the complexity of what we're dealing with.

274
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:22,980
In discussions such as this, it's important to keep the concepts straightforward and understandable to the best to be possible.

275
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:36,980
But the flip side of that is the risk of oversimplifying a complex situation. So when I just said that the evidence is that lowering LDL cholesterol is beneficial, that's not always true.

276
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:49,980
And so one can point, if one is so inclined, to the evidence that under certain conditions in certain populations with certain approaches, lowering LDL cholesterol does not result in reduced heart disease risk.

277
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:57,980
And to the extent that you consider that to be a fatal flaw in the argument, that can be, I think, very misleading because it's not.

278
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:11,980
The fact is that LDL is causal, but there are other circumstances that modify that causality to the extent that some forms of LDL under certain conditions, and this may not be uncommon, can be elevated without pathologic consequences.

279
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:22,980
And so lowering LDL in those cases may not give benefit. And we know there is heterogeneity in the clinical response when one looks at cardiovascular protection with LDL lowering treatment.

280
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:38,980
So I have to absolutely extend the simple notion of LDL causality to saying that one has to look very carefully at the arguments against LDL causality because they latch on to pieces of information that are really misleading.

281
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Just because lowering LDL cholesterol is not always beneficial doesn't mean that LDL is not pathological.

282
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:56,980
And the second component of that is the focus on LDL cholesterol. That goes back to our initial discussion here today as a marker for a causal mechanism, but it's the particles that are causal.

283
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,980
And LDL cholesterol, as we just talked about, does not always mirror the number of LDL particles.

284
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:24,980
Now, I don't think we should necessarily take the time to go through the paper in incredible detail, but it did touch on eight criteria for causality, plausibility, strength, biological gradient, the temporal sequence, the specificity, consistency, coherence, and then the relative risk reduction or risk reduction with an intervention.

285
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Among those, I found the Mendelian randomization to also be very compelling. So, you know, when I talk about this with people, I generally talk about the natural experiments, such as the people with PCSK9 mutations, both hypo function or gain-a-function loss-a-function PCSK9, the FH patients, the Mendelian randomization, and the intervention.

286
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:55,980
If you were going to bring up three points from the paper that you think probably are most relevant, what would they be?

287
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Well, you've just touched on probably the number one strongest argument, and it's really where we, those of us who have been in the field for decades, started with being impressed with the role of genetic elevations of LDL.

288
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:22,980
Very, very strong evidence. I would put that probably right at the top, and you talked about this condition, familial hypercholesterolemia, when there's two doses of an abnormal gene, the LDL levels can skyrocket.

289
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,980
I referred to that a little while ago as the condition that can lead to heart disease early in childhood. It's unequivocal.

290
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:43,980
In fact, the reason I got a little bit, I was a little bit taken aback by the need to do this more extensively, which I think, by the way, was quite a good exercise, both for those of us who did it and people hopefully who read it.

291
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:56,980
But all you have to do is look at an eight-year-old child with cholesterol levels that are eight or nine times normal, whose candidate for liver and heart transplant, to know that that's it. That's causal. But the genetic support is beyond that.

292
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,980
Right. Now, in those cases, the genetic defect is one in the LDL receptor, correct?

293
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
That's right.

294
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:13,980
So, closing the loop on how this works, right? The body makes cholesterol. The body, you know, so every cell in the body makes cholesterol, then cholesterol gets recirculated, ends up mostly back in the liver.

295
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:26,980
It gets secreted. Some of it in bile gets reabsorbed and this process continues. But it's this LDL clearance, mostly via LDL receptors in the liver, that seems to be where a lot of these genetic things go awry.

296
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:38,980
That's right. Yeah, the liver really is the factory as well as the disposal plant, if you will. Most of the cholesterol that winds up in the blood is released in terms of lipoproteins that are synthesized by the liver.

297
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:50,980
And then they come back to the liver ultimately after they've done their thing, so to speak, delivered their cargo or interacted with cells in various ways, and come back to the liver.

298
00:37:50,980 --> 00:38:05,980
And a large portion of that return is mediated by these receptors that latch onto APL-B. It's APL-B that is the kind of the key that binds to the lock that snaps up the LDL in the liver and degrades it and exweets it into bile.

299
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:27,980
And that's one of the ways we dispose of cholesterol. There are other mechanisms involving HDL, but the receptors are a key determinant and do represent a mechanism by which most of the drugs that we use to lower cholesterol act to increase LDL receptor-mediated disposal of LDL particles.

300
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:37,980
And I'm just going to connect that concept to something you brought up earlier, and that is the duration of exposure to, in this case, high levels of LDL.

301
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:47,980
We talked about it as a function of age. The longer the review is, the longer the exposure. But there's also a dynamic aspect to LDL metabolism that we just touched on.

302
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:56,980
That is, particles are produced actually precursors of LDL, which are called VLDL, which carry mostly triglyceride, and apoprotein B as well.

303
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Those particles are being actively secreted. They interact with peripheral tissues and receptors and other transporters that handle various lipids in various ways and enzymes, etc.

304
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,980
There's a lot of processing that goes on. And then what's left comes back to the liver through LDL receptors.

305
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:31,980
Now, if that process happens riskily, if there is a nice, fast turnover, if you will, of those particles, you can just see that there's less time for the arteries to be exposed to any of those pathologic forms of lipoproteins.

306
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:44,980
They can be scooped up. But what underlies, at least to me, a common concept, a common underlying factor that connects various lipid traits to heart disease risk is the extent to which they influence the heart.

307
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:55,980
They influence the circulation time. That is the length of time that a particle is circulating in the blood. So that particles are not being cleared by LDL receptors efficiently.

308
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,980
They will circulate longer and have more opportunities for mischief.

309
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:08,980
What is the typical half-life of a VLDL particle? So very low-density lipoprotein, IDL, intermediate density, and low density?

310
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,980
I'm probably going to get this wrong. And this is where I don't want to have to go back and look at the textbook and analyze it.

311
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,980
Well, directionally, though.

312
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:26,980
Yeah. So particularly for a larger VLDL triglyceride, the half-life is half an hour, an hour, two hours. It's pretty rapid because that particle is rapidly subject to enzymatic digestion.

313
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Well, let me just jump to the LDL. So the LDL that are formed from those precursors, you know, more like 12 to 24 hours or longer.

314
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:42,980
So it turns out that smaller particles have a longer residence time because they are less avidly removed by LDL receptors.

315
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,980
So there's a range of circulation times for LDL, in some cases, you know, days, actually. And then IDL are somewhere in the middle.

316
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:59,980
The intermediate density lipoproteins are IDL, is what you're referring to. That's the step between VLDL and LDL that is involved in their metabolism.

317
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:09,980
So it's these longer exposure times, and these intermediate particles can include and do include very pathologic forms as well.

318
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:38,980
And so there are disorders, and metabolic syndrome, coming back to that, is one of them, where the clearance of those intermediate particles, which also comprise what we call remnants, partial breakdown products of VLDL on the way to forming LDL, those intermediate particles can have much longer exposure times, and they can be subject to various pathologic effects involving oxidation, the acquisition of partial digestion products of various lipids that cause them to be more toxic.

319
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:45,980
And those particles can be damaging even with a shorter residence time because they're so toxic.

320
00:41:45,980 --> 00:42:01,980
So that gets into what I was referring to earlier, is somewhat a greater complexity of beyond thinking just about LDL cholesterol, thinking about LDL particles, thinking about the types of LDL particles in terms of the pathophysiology, and then also thinking about the role of these remnant lipoproteins.

321
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:12,980
They all participate in this potential risk, and it comes down, in my view, in the end, to the length of time that a particle with certain pathologic effects is circulating in the blood.

322
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:41,980
And this VLDL cholesterol, VLDL remnant problem is one that is unfortunately very often missed even by relatively astute clinicians. Your textbook case is these type 3s, these hypertriglyceridemias who have normal APOB, normal LDLC, you think they're relatively low risk, you sort of miss the fact that their VLDL cholesterol is 75 milligrams per deciliter, and they have these just devastating atherosclerotic plaques.

323
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:52,980
Yeah, and that was, again, one of my learning experiences when I was at the NIH at a time working with Drs. Frederiks and Leavy when the various...

324
00:42:52,980 --> 00:43:01,980
Just for the listener, it's important for them, I think, to understand the luminaries that you just described, right? Frederiks and Leavy and Leavy, I mean, let's put these guys in context, right?

325
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:16,980
You had people that figured out that there was this thing called cholesterol, but it was really those three that did the pioneering work in the 1970s that laid the groundwork for fractionating, figuring out all of the different subparticles.

326
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,980
Late 60s.

327
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,980
Late 60s, early 70s, yeah.

328
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:29,980
Late 60s. No, it was late 60s. I'll just give you a slight anecdote since you paused me on this. I've always been interested in heart disease because it runs in my family.

329
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:40,980
As a medical student, I read a series of five articles that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and I think you're referring to the three authors, Frederiks and Leavy and Lees, that completely transformed me.

330
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:58,980
It was an epiphany because those five articles describe lipid disorders in terms of genetic, subgenetic types, different lipoprotein profiles that had different metabolic effects, different consequences, and were influenced differently by various diets.

331
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,980
And I thought this was absolutely the most important lead I could imagine.

332
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:10,980
So I made up my business when it came to deciding what I was going to do after my medical training is to come back, is to come to NIH and work with those guys.

333
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,980
And I was fortunate enough to be able to do that.

334
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:20,980
And it was really in the era where what was called the Frederiks and Typing System identified these various forms.

335
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:39,980
And the one you just referred to, the genetic forms of lipids that we don't often always consider, it was called Type 3, and that was characterized by abnormalities in receptor-mediated clearance of these remnant particles through a mutation in apoprotein E, or variant of apoprotein.

336
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,980
And that also was fascinating.

337
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,980
And I happened to be in California when the ApoE's were discovered.

338
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,980
So I sort of feel like one of these characters that just shows up at the appropriate time.

339
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,980
It was called the Arjuric Peptide.

340
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:59,980
The history is just – we wrote a review actually of the early history of lipoprotein research, which I would commend to the audience.

341
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,980
Let's put that on the list here.

342
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,980
It was an journal of lipid research in 2016.

343
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:11,980
In fact, I just got a fan letter for that article because anybody that's seriously interested in this field should probably understand the origins.

344
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,980
In fact, I got a letter after that paper was published.

345
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,980
I got an email from Joe Goldstein, who is the other – one of the other icons in the field.

346
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,980
He said, everybody that goes into lipid research should read this paper.

347
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,980
So I'm going to – it's not a book.

348
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,980
I don't make any money off of it.

349
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,980
We're going to make sure that the people who want to get smart on this read it.

350
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Anyway, piggyback to these remnants, I think particle for particle, the remnants are probably the most pathologic particles of all because of this rampant atherosclerosis when there's elevation of remnants.

351
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,980
Fortunately, this condition of type 3 is fairly rare.

352
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,980
It's like one in 10,000.

353
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,980
But it does illustrate the symbology.

354
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,980
I've seen that.

355
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,980
I've seen several.

356
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,980
You've seen several.

357
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,980
Right.

358
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,980
So what I was starting to say – actually, initially what I was starting to say when I was at NIH in my training, I saw all these things.

359
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,980
All the types were there.

360
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,980
You collected them.

361
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,980
Yeah.

362
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,980
We had patients who had the type 3.

363
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,980
We had type 1, which was a serious elevation of triglyceride.

364
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,980
Type 2 was familiar hypercholesterionia.

365
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,980
It goes on and on.

366
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,980
So, yes.

367
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,980
And it's really striking.

368
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,980
I tell my students – I lecture on this to students at Berkeley.

369
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:20,980
And I show them pictures of what are called xanthomas, which are, you know, deposits of cholesterol and lipids and tissues.

370
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:28,980
And you have these very characteristic lesions that used to be rampant in patients before we had adequate recognition and treatment.

371
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:36,980
As a manifestation of the underlying pathology that also affects the arteries, the cholesterol that winds up in the arteries can also break into the skin.

372
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,980
And these are just very striking illustrations of the role of genetics.

373
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,980
So it gets back to your earlier question about causality.

374
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,980
There are so many situations where genetics helps in establishing causality.

375
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,980
And this certainly is one of them.

376
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,980
After that, you asked me, what are – you know, 1, 2, and 3, right?

377
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,980
You asked me how many – what my top three are.

378
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,980
Well, even before we leave –

379
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,980
I didn't answer that one.

380
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:08,980
And before we leave FH, I think the other nice thing about the PCSK9 mutation – you know, FH is only showing you the change in one direction.

381
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,980
Right.

382
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
But with PCSK9, you see both directions.

383
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,980
That's right.

384
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,980
I believe the hyperfunctioning were the first people identified, correct?

385
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,980
Yes.

386
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,980
So these people had an enzyme, PCSK9.

387
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
It hyperfunctioned.

388
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,980
Therefore, this enzyme's – one of its roles is to degrade the LDL receptor.

389
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
And so they had fewer LDL receptors.

390
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,980
They had more LDL.

391
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,980
They looked a lot like FH patients, correct?

392
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,980
Yeah.

393
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,980
Yeah.

394
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,980
And just to be – again, for the technical guru who was on the phone – oh, it's actually not – it's not an enzyme.

395
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,980
It kind of behaves like an enzyme, but it actually drives LDL receptors into the garbage disposal machinery in the cell called lysosomes.

396
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,980
And it causes the LDL receptors to be broken down.

397
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,980
But it's the same end result as you get less LDL receptors, higher LDL cholesterol.

398
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,980
And then the mutations in the other direction are the ones that led to the development of PCSK9.

399
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:06,980
The loss of function – antibodies to PCSK9 mimic the loss of function mutations, which lower LDL.

400
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:15,980
And that's one of my – you know, when I get to tell these stories one day, I'll look back and say that was my aha moment, because I think that paper came out in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

401
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:23,980
It was either 04 or 06, but I remember this well, which was the discovery of those families with the hypo-functioning PCSK9.

402
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,980
Right. Yes.

403
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,980
These people walked around with an LDL cholesterol between 10 and 20 milligrams per deciliter.

404
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Yeah.

405
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,980
Two things about them stood out.

406
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,980
The first, they never got heart disease.

407
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,980
The second, they didn't seem to suffer any other consequences that you might concern yourself with.

408
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,980
Right. Yeah.

409
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:56,980
One of those patients, classically, was I think a physical therapist, somebody that was very active, and had an LDL of in the teens, which is, you know, one sixth normal and is doing fine.

410
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:10,980
Yeah. So that's another use of genetics in a way to confirm that lowering of LDL, not necessarily using all the ways that LDL can be lowered, but at least certainly that form of LDL lowering is healthy.

411
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,980
And probably most forms of LDL lowering are healthy.

412
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,980
We have real evidence to the contrary.

413
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,980
Do you want to say anything about the Mendelian randomization?

414
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:24,980
It's, you know, I think it's not the most intuitive concept to people, but it is actually a very powerful concept.

415
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,980
Right.

416
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:37,980
So the principle of Mendelian randomization, first of all, Mendel, Gregor Mendel was a 19th century monk who discovered the principle of inheritance of traits and P's actually.

417
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,980
The idea is that these genetic variants are randomly distributed in the population.

418
00:49:42,980 --> 00:50:09,980
So that assumption underlies this concept of mainland randomization, because then you can say that the occurrence of a genetic variant in the population or a collection of variants, it's going to be either single or multiple variants, that are associated with a biomarker, such as LDL cholesterol, can be used to test the causality of LDL by looking at another relationship.

419
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:14,980
And that is the association of those genetic variants with the disease process.

420
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:21,980
So, for example, and so I'm going to give you the example because it's really a little bit abstract without an example.

421
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,980
And we'll talk about PCSK9.

422
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,980
So the PCSK9 loss of function mutation causes a lowering of LDL.

423
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,980
There is independent evidence that that mutation is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk.

424
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,980
Nothing to do with LDL, just the genetic association with outcomes.

425
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:46,980
That relationship parallels very closely the relationship of that variant to LDL cholesterol.

426
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:58,980
The difference is that the risk associated with a genetic variant, the risk of heart disease, is actually less than would be predicted from the LDL cholesterol using standard risk relationships, because this is lifelong exposure.

427
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,980
This gets back to the exposure issue.

428
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:20,980
So a genetic marker like this, the minimization model, tells you that lifelong exposure to a genetic variant that either raises or lowers risk has effects that can be attributed to LDL because the LDL change predicts that risk relationship.

429
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:29,980
Yeah, whereas a lot of the conventional risk models are basically looking at maybe a decade of risk or something like that, and they're always going to fall short, both under and overestimating long-term risk.

430
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:36,980
So in the paper that you referred to that came out of this European consensus, there was a heavy dose of meningar randomization.

431
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:58,980
Either the main author or one of the key authors did a very good job of showing how the genetic markers that are connected to LDL receptor levels, both PCSK9, others, they're associated with higher receptor activity as well, predict cardiovascular risk much more robustly

432
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:12,980
than do the results of clinical trials. Clinical trials only last four or five or six years. So that risk reduction, which is parallel but is displaced because the magnitude of that effect is blunted because it's not a lifelong exposure.

433
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,980
So it's very instructive.

434
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:27,980
Yeah. Let's go back to something else you said a few moments ago that I think is, I would say 10 years ago, I don't remember when Jim Otvose's analysis came out, but Jim, who's an incredibly thoughtful person in this field,

435
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:45,980
wrote a paper that basically said, once you normalize for the number of LDL particles, the size doesn't matter. Now a moment ago, you said that your intuition is that actually that's not correct, that particle for particle, a small particle is more atherogenic.

436
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,980
Is that a fair assessment of your thought?

437
00:52:48,980 --> 00:53:17,980
It is definitely an assessment of my thought. And unlike what we've just been talking about, we don't have a way showing incontrovertibly that that's true. So when tries to sort of dance around this question by using statistics, can you use statistics to factor out everything with which the particle size, and let me clarify one other thing before I go on, and that is, the reason particle size got on the map was that I wrote a paper, I think in the 80s actually, probably

438
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:31,980
30 plus years ago, in which the only test we had was particle size measurement, and we showed the particle size, small particle size is related to risk, but we also said it was associated with lower HDL and higher triglycerides. So that was the definition of this triad that we just talked about.

439
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:45,980
And we never said that the particle size was independent. We never actually said that. We never said it was related to independently to risk. It was a marker for this whole syndrome. The particle size context that I was referring to early on in our discussion today,

440
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:59,980
was not the size of the particles, but the numbers of particles of different sizes. That's a somewhat different concept. So there are techniques that measure the given number for whether most of the LDL in the blood is larger or smaller.

441
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,980
And they typically bifurcate this at something like 20.5 nanometers or something like that.

442
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:15,980
And the other thing I'm going to say, because this is, I'm going to say it because there's an opportunity to say it. If you measure those particle sizes correctly, the distribution in the population is bimodal.

443
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:32,980
That means there is a discrete subset of the population that has smaller LDL particles. Now that says nothing about their heart disease risk. That just, that says that there's something going on that tips in a quantum way towards the small LDL trait.

444
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:44,980
And that is the marker for the metabolic syndrome. So that's not about heart disease risk. That's a metabolic marker. The heart disease risk depends on the magnitude of that small LDL mode.

445
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:57,980
If you have a lot of, if you have a lot of LDL particles that are small, that's bad. Now the argument that Afos and others have made using statistics that, I will come back to in a minute as to why I think this is flawed approach,

446
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:08,980
is that if you knew certain statistical corrections for interrelationships of various particles with each other, there is a significant relationship to risk of larger LDL as well.

447
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,980
So that's not untrue. A larger LDL can be as large as...

448
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:22,980
I mean, if I recall, as long as something is less than 70 nanometers, it can enter the subendithelial space. So any small, any large or small LDL can enter the space.

449
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,980
So it gets back to resonance time.

450
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,980
Yes. How long do they stay? How likely do they retain?

451
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,980
So it turns out, so this is going to be a little bit complicated, but I'm going to try, maybe it can help you.

452
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,980
No, no, we have an audience that's willing to handle complicated.

453
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:49,980
Help me work through this with you because I know what I want to say and I just want to make sure that I say it clearly. Let's talk about larger LDL. So this in this large LDL mode, that signifies sort of the flip side of metabolic syndrome.

454
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:59,980
It generally identifies people who have not only larger LDL, but higher HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride. So that's a low risk syndrome.

455
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,980
And often low insulin.

456
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:17,980
That's right. And so quite apart from the question, are these particles better or worse, they signify a metabolic profile where there's a pretty brisk circulation of those particles and the exposure to the artery wall is very low.

457
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:22,980
Now, if you have an LDL receptor defect, it also causes large LDL. Large LDL accumulates.

458
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,980
Right. FH patients have large LDL particles.

459
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,980
So why is that bad? It's because of the resonance time is much higher.

460
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:38,980
Right. And so neither I, well, there's some people that have taken some of my own work and taken it to an extreme that I don't feel is justified.

461
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:45,980
And that is to say that large LDL are not atherogenic at all. They certainly can be. There's no question about that.

462
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:53,980
The question is, are they equally atherogenic to smaller particles or any other particles in the LDL spectrum?

463
00:56:53,980 --> 00:57:03,980
And I'll just say this, the work that you're referring to did not address that. All it said was that you can show that this large LDL are associated with risk.

464
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:13,980
And then the second thing is that if you adjust total LDL particles for the peak size of LDL, the peak size is not associated with risk.

465
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:23,980
So those are two different statistical manipulations. Neither of which neither of which disprove the hypothesis, the smaller LDL carry more atherogenic risk.

466
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:32,980
And we have an example of something I'm going to tell you again genetically, which may or may not be something that your audience is familiar with.

467
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:43,980
There's another genetic syndrome that involves a variant that affects a region of the genome, which is responsible for synthesizing a protein called sordal.

468
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:58,980
S-O-R-T-I-L-I-M. That genetic variant was discovered probably six or seven or eight years ago now and was associated with both high risk of cardiovascular disease and high LDL cholesterol.

469
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:10,980
And in fact, the association of that genetic variant with cardiovascular disease was as strong, if not slightly stronger, than the associations of genetic variants in the LDL receptor itself.

470
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:25,980
So this was a new player in the spectrum of causal factors, again relating a genetic mechanism that raises LDL to an effect on cardiovascular disease risk through a pathway that doesn't involve the LDL receptor.

471
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:43,980
This is not an LDL receptor story. What we published as part of the initial description of this variant and its relationship to cholesterol metabolism is that in two independent populations using two independent methods, it's specifically associated with small and very small LDL, not large LDL at all.

472
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,980
So here's a genetic variant that as far as we can tell affects...

473
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,980
So it's not affecting clearance?

474
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:57,980
Well, we don't know about clearance. I can't tell you about clearance. All I can say is it's not LDL receptor mediated clearance. There may be... We don't know. This is...

475
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,980
It could be Neiman-Pixie, one like one, for all we know.

476
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:14,980
So if you're going to ask me later on what one of the experiments that I would do if I had all the resources in the row that would relate to this mechanism, because the genetic association, it's not clear exactly what's being affected by the genetic variant.

477
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:30,980
It's not clear how it works, but what's definitely clear is that that variant is associated in terms of lipoprotein changes or anything else that we can measure in the usual risk factor range exclusively with small and very small.

478
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:36,980
It's even a subtype of small LDL, but it's that collection of smaller particles that is somehow affected by this variant.

479
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,980
Now, do those patients have elevated triglycerides or low HGLC?

480
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,980
No.

481
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:52,980
So that counters the argument that I would say, gosh, maybe these small particles ultimately are just a marker for an inflammatory metabolic dysregulation.

482
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,980
They largely are.

483
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,980
But this example...

484
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:08,980
This is a subtype. So this gets into what you might consider a new one. I'll tell you another anecdote. When I first kind of discovered that people had all these different forms of LDL, this is again in the 80s. I don't know how many. This is 35 years ago now.

485
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:17,980
I was invited to give a talk, a couple of talks actually, at various meetings, one of which was in San Diego actually, and others where I presented this data.

486
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:26,980
And it was using not the current methodologies, but a very elaborate procedure involving the ultracentrifuge, which separates these particles into various fractions.

487
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:35,980
And I have a picture of what I showed on the wall of my office because it's so emblematic of the existence of these discrete forms of LDL.

488
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:42,980
And I remember talking about this to very intelligent and experienced people in the field, and it was considered esoteric.

489
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,980
And for about 15 years, nobody paid any attention to it because it was felt...

490
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:53,980
Nobody else had methods to show what we had been showing in large populations.

491
01:00:53,980 --> 01:01:02,980
Fortunately, later on, that was remedied by more widely available methodologies that we were probably responsible for.

492
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:12,980
But the bottom line is that the recognition of these various forms of LDL, we tended to simplify to avoid having people think it was too esoteric.

493
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:16,980
So we talked about large and small as if there were only two forms, and these two modes, etc.

494
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:23,980
And all that's true. But within the small LDL mode, within both of those, but the small LDL, there's yet another subtype.

495
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,980
And it's this very small LDL.

496
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:40,980
So the garden variety small LDL that is generally measured by techniques that are being used, such as NMR and ion mobility method, largely measures the small LDL that you're talking about.

497
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:46,980
It's part of this generalized metabolic syndrome. But this very small guy looks like it's another pathway.

498
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:51,980
It's another pathway. And it's a pathway that has a strong genetic association with risk.

499
01:01:51,980 --> 01:02:01,980
And we are, I'll just say this to this audience, we are trying to do some studies, and this gets back to the studies I'd love to do, to test the hypothesis.

500
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:09,980
These particles may be secreted directly. So this might be a mechanism that spits out a pathologic form of LDL without going through the...

501
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,980
Through the VLDL pathway.

502
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,980
...the VLDL pathway. That's a hypothesis that we're now...

503
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,980
So it sounds like almost like an LP little A type issue.

504
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,980
Yeah, that's a good point. It's a particle that we don't know how to lower.

505
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,980
Like LP little A. Well, we were starting to learn how to lower up. That's another topic, I guess.

506
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,980
We're not going to get to LP little A today.

507
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:32,980
That's another topic. But yes, it's a genetic factor that is associated with risk that we don't yet know what to do with.

508
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:43,980
So let's go back to something that you've kind of touched on a little bit, which is can LDL cholesterol slash LDL particle slash APO B be too low?

509
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,980
And I'm referring specifically to a pharmacologic intervention.

510
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:55,980
So I think we've already established that the people so genetically blessed to have hypo-functioning PCSK9 seem to be completely fine.

511
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:05,980
But if someone came along and said, look, I'm walking around at the 30th percentile of the population, I want to walk around at the first percentile of the population.

512
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,980
I'm going to pharmacologically lower it. Is there a downside?

513
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:21,980
So I guess I'm hung up on genetics today because I think the best scenario to consider in evaluating the pros and cons of very low LDL, our genetic syndrome was associated with very low LDL.

514
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:27,980
We just talked about one of them. So PCSK9 loss of function mutations are an example of what you're asking.

515
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:33,980
Those individuals have lifelong exposure to very low LDL. And as far as we can tell, do fine.

516
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:43,980
There are people who have abnormalities in the APO B protein that results in impaired production of LDL, ultimately, and most people do very well.

517
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:52,980
Now we have less heart disease, they tend to live longer. So this is the genetic evidence for the safety and the benefit really of having very low LDL.

518
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:59,980
That doesn't imply that we can extrapolate those genetic observations to all treatments.

519
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:14,980
Now for the PCSK9 inhibitors, if we assume that the use of the antibodies, the lower PCSK9 therapeutically, mimic the genetic effect, then one would have the same confidence that this would not be hazardous.

520
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:20,980
We don't yet know that there are not other effects of these antibodies. It may not necessarily fully mimic the genetic effect.

521
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:33,980
But by and large, I think it is a vote of confidence that those treatments that lower that particular treatment with PCSK9 inhibition probably does not only lower risk but have no significant downsides related to the LDL lowering.

522
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:42,980
But we don't know, the clinical trials of any of the drugs that lower LDL have not been long enough to know what the lifelong effects might be.

523
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:48,980
So if you look at the most widely prescribed class of drugs for lipid lowering, it's obviously going to be statins.

524
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:56,980
And statins really do two things. You know, they have a direct effect, which is they inhibit the first committed step of cholesterol synthesis.

525
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:02,980
And so that directly lowers the burden of cholesterol, thereby lowering the burden of lipoprotein.

526
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:12,980
But in many ways, their indirect effect is at least as strong, which is the liver in response to this upregulates the LDL receptor and you get enhanced clearance.

527
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:26,980
Now, the latter, we certainly have a genetic model to look at. Do we, for the former, do we know of people who have deficient cholesterol synthesis outside of the extreme?

528
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:30,980
We know that there are certainly inborn areas of metabolism that are uniformly fatal.

529
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:41,980
But sort of outside of those people are the people walking around with low cholesterol where the defect is in cholesterol synthesis that would give us confidence that, hey, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis can't be that bad.

530
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:56,980
I'd have to say I don't know that there is such a genetic variant. There are genetic variants in the rate limiting enzyme, HMG-quarioductase, that is the target of statins that affect LDL levels in heart disease risk in the expected direction.

531
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:07,980
But those variants have a modest effect size. They are not big time players to knock down LDL to those same rate level.

532
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:23,980
That's what makes the PCS canine story so exceptional. There's just nothing quite like it. So the answer is, to my knowledge, no, we don't have that kind of evidence that would apply to very low LDLs that are induced by genetic factors.

533
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:38,980
And that's a scenario that I think I clinically struggle with. And I suspect there's going to be at least one other person listening to this that's going to share that struggle, which is I do get a little bit nervous when I have a patient whose risk of atherosclerosis is so high.

534
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:44,980
For example, a patient with a significant family history and a very elevated LPa, just as an example.

535
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:59,980
And you know I seem to collect these patients. So you've got these folks and they've got a clinical burden of disease. So their CT angiogram shows soft plaque, their calcium score shows that they've got calcifications, their LPa is through the roof.

536
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:06,980
And they're tolerating their statins, meaning they don't have the myalgias or CK elevations or any of those things.

537
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:18,980
But to get their LDL where it needs to be in a patient like that, I'm going to put to the fifth or 10th percentile. I have effectively by all means that I can measure almost shut off cholesterol synthesis.

538
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:32,980
In those patients I panic because of a couple of papers that I've seen that look at the opposite end of the spectrum, which is, you know, they look at markers of cholesterol synthesis in patients who are medicated and then the risk of dementia.

539
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:47,980
In particular, there's a paper that looked at desmosphylol levels and it found that if the level was below 0.5, which is, you know, generally very low on the scale we look at, and they use that as a cutoff on the receiver operating characteristic curve,

540
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:57,980
the area under that curve, which again can vary from somewhere between about 0.5 to 1, 0.5 meaning it's a useless test. It's a coin toss. 1 is a perfect test.

541
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:15,980
They're coming in with with AUCs of the ROC at 0.87, 0.89. That's quite suggestive of this. And certainly biochemically, there's a plausibility to this, right? We understand that every tissue in the body has the ability to borrow cholesterol from elsewhere.

542
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:21,980
That doesn't appear to be the case in the brain. The lipoproteins don't seem to be able to traffic across the blood-brain barrier.

543
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:35,980
So I guess that's just one area where I certainly don't know an answer, but I've become, I think, clinically much more quick to move people to PCSK9 inhibitors when I get uncomfortable with the degree of cholesterol synthesis.

544
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,980
Do you think I'm paranoid?

545
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:47,980
You've opened up a big topic all by itself, I think, that is the off-target effects of cholesterol. If we consider the target, that's not even the proper term.

546
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:58,980
It's the off-tissue target because it's the tissue targeting of statins to the liver, inhibiting HMG-caryboductase in the liver. That is the therapeutic goal.

547
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:02,980
That's right. That's actually all you're really trying to do.

548
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:03,980
That's right.

549
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,980
But we can't. We have to hit all of these peripheral tissues as well.

550
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:15,980
Well, that's right. So there's something called pharmacokinetics. So for the last 16 or 17 years, I have been leading a program and studying statin pharmacogenetics, which is...

551
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:22,980
I just want to explain this again because I know you and I are sitting here in this discussion and we understand this, but I want to make sure the listener understands the point you just made. It's so important.

552
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:42,980
In an ideal world, a statin would be a dream drug if it only inhibited cholesterol synthesis, meaning HMG-caryboductase activity in the liver such that the liver would upregulate and you wouldn't impact peripheral tissue metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, for example, in the brain and the muscles, et cetera.

553
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,980
Unfortunately, that's not the case. So I'll let you continue.

554
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:59,980
Right. So this has to do with me, with at least my exposure to this set of issues through the world of pharmacology. So I have been hanging out with pharmacologists for the last 15 years through this pharmacogenomics program.

555
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:09,980
It's obvious even without that experience that factors that affect the disposition of statins, like any other drug, are important determinants of clinical outcomes.

556
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:19,980
So the disposition, that term, refers to getting it to the tissue, to any of the tissues, but you want to get statins to the liver.

557
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:26,980
For the most part, statins are very efficiently removed by the liver. So fortunately, so that tends to offset some of the concerns that you have.

558
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:34,980
However, there is variation in the genes as well as other factors that affect a statin disposition.

559
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:47,980
The nature of the statin itself, its chemical composition, the presence or absence of certain genetic variants, one in particular that's been well studied, that affects the amount of statin in the blood that prevents it from getting it to the liver.

560
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:58,980
Under those conditions, there is a greater likelihood that the statin will wind up somewhere else. And that can be muscle, which is the most common symptom, but it can be all the other tissues.

561
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:14,980
And part of my research experience right now is delving in to all of these other effects that go beyond the desired inhibition of HMD-cory ductase in the liver that are actually, quote, on-target effects.

562
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:21,980
So I'm going to come back to the brain in a minute because I've been extremely interested in the issues that you describe, and I'll come back to that.

563
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:33,980
But there's a condition that's even more, I think, clearly connected to an unexpected effect of statin, and that is its tendency to increase blood sugar and increase the risk of diabetes.

564
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,980
That's been demonstrated now.

565
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,980
What's the relative risk?

566
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:47,980
It's about, you know, if you talk to cardiologists, they'll say the relative risk is small because the benefit is much greater. Well, that risk is about 10% on average.

567
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,980
We have published a paper.

568
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:50,980
Over what period of time?

569
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,980
Over, you know, duration of the clinical trials.

570
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:54,980
Probably about five years.

571
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,980
Yeah, up to six or seven years.

572
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:02,980
But we've published that that risk can be significantly higher in women than men, perhaps as high as 30% or plus.

573
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:08,980
And do we think that that effect is due to dysregulated glucose uptake in the muscle?

574
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:17,980
There is evidence, and we're deeply involved with these studies, of direct pathologic effects on muscle energy metabolism.

575
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:23,980
That's more closely connected, obviously, with muscle symptoms than with diabetes.

576
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:31,980
But insulin resistance is certainly another factor that could be involved, and the muscles could be involved, the liver could be involved.

577
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:37,980
So that's one situation where there may be on-target effects, even in the liver, that might contribute to this.

578
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,980
We think it's probably not liver.

579
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:49,980
We think there's probably effects, either beta cells that produce insulin and or the tissues that insulin acts on, such as...

580
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,980
Probably the muscle being the most important.

581
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,980
Yeah, right. So the reason I haven't been more specific than that is we really don't know.

582
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:01,980
There's a number of theories, all of which sort of collectively could be true in different individuals.

583
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,980
But the net effect is not trivial.

584
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,980
Is it dose-dependent?

585
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:11,980
Yes. Well, there are some evidence that it's just a glycemic effect that's dose-dependent.

586
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,980
In fact, this was very limited information on this, actually.

587
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,980
Are there some statins that seem to be...

588
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:24,980
So, for example, when you look at Simvastatin, it seems to have a much higher incidence of myalgias or CK elevation.

589
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:31,980
When we look at the entire suite of statins, do we see some that seem higher risk for diabetes, some that seem lower risk?

590
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:36,980
Yes. And again, this is sort of a collection of observations from various sources.

591
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:42,980
One of the statins that's most recently been introduced is something called Pitavistatin.

592
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:43,980
Livolo.

593
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:51,980
Yeah, Livolo. That group in France has shown pretty convincingly recently that this is not associated with diabetes risk.

594
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:57,980
This is kind of my go-to statin before I moved to a PCSK9 inhibitor. This is my last line statin.

595
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:58,980
Yeah.

596
01:13:58,980 --> 01:13:59,980
It's not that potent, as you know.

597
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:00,980
That's right.

598
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:01,980
It's a problem. You sort of...

599
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:02,980
That's right.

600
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:08,980
But once in a while, you'll save someone. You'll get a guy who can't tolerate anything, but he tolerates this and you're off to the races.

601
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:14,980
Same here, exactly. So it's probably the lower potency and it's probably its chemical characteristics.

602
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:22,980
Again, what I'm saying right now is still not established in a conclusive way, but it does suggest that there are differences in the statins,

603
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,980
and that being one that has less association with risk.

604
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:31,980
The one that's probably most commonly associated with risk, and we've seen this in studies that we've not yet even published all of them,

605
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,980
is a Torvistatin appears to be...

606
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,980
Lipitor by its...

607
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,980
Have a higher risk. So there's interesting...

608
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,980
And we don't think that that's just due to the fact that it's so ubiquitous.

609
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:41,980
No.

610
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:47,980
So would that be a reason? Because I got to tell you, I think when I'm confronting a patient for the first time with a statin,

611
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:53,980
I am generally almost tossing a coin between Crestor and Lipitor as a first line agent.

612
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:58,980
Very quick to flip between them if I see any CK bump or LFT bump.

613
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:06,980
But what you're saying would almost suggest that if it's a person who's not incredibly insulin sensitive, where none of this probably matters,

614
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:10,980
someone who's borderline, you'd lean towards Crestor over Lipitor?

615
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:15,980
Yeah, this is sort of putting on my clinical judgment hat rather than my scientist hat.

616
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:21,980
But unfortunately, like for many of us, we still...we have to make decisions.

617
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:27,980
You like to use evidence-based criteria, but this is actually one of the things that I struggle with with evidence-based criteria.

618
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:33,980
We don't have the evidence that allows me to give an answer to that other than saying, yes, I agree that that's what I would do.

619
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:42,980
And I'm also going to back up a little bit and make sure that I have not conveyed the impression that a Torvistatin is a diabetic drug.

620
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:47,980
It's still a minority of the population, and we think there's genetic factors that contribute to that.

621
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:52,980
And we can measure it. I mean, that's sort of the other thing that I sort of tell patients is that this isn't going to sneak up on us one day.

622
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:53,980
We wake up with diabetes.

623
01:15:53,980 --> 01:16:00,980
I use plenty of a Torvistatin, and I'm at the least bit concerned about it in the patient whose risk merits statin treatment.

624
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:09,980
And because as the cardiologists are quick to point out, the benefits of statin treatment with any of statin's cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes

625
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:13,980
far outweighs the risk of actually developing diabetes.

626
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,980
And there's even some evidence that the microvascular complications might be improved.

627
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:22,980
So we can argue that statins are not causing a damaging effect through this mechanism.

628
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:26,980
But it does raise just a little bit of a caution.

629
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:32,980
In fact, it's a caution, I think, that should lead to more widespread monitoring of glucose on statins,

630
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:36,980
just so that, like, one can detect those individuals who may have an adverse effect.

631
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:42,980
But it's still a minority of the population, and it's not something that should be considered a hazard of drug use. Far from it.

632
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:46,980
Yeah, I think for me, I am, I mean, I sort of, you know, talk to patients and I say, look,

633
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:52,980
I think there are short-term things that we're generally going to figure out in three months, which is myalgias plus or minus a CK elevation.

634
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:56,980
So either, you know, your muscles are going to get sore with or without an elevation in CK,

635
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:01,980
which is a way that we can measure the breakdown of muscle, and changes in your liver function test.

636
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:02,980
We look for those elevations.

637
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:07,980
I don't know about you, but I see a lot more LFT bumps when combined with Zetia than just statin alone.

638
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:12,980
I find a lot of patients I have that tolerate any dose of a statin, then you add a Zetia.

639
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:17,980
It seems to me like 20% of people just immediately have an LFT bump.

640
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:20,980
I haven't seen it that often, but I have seen it, yes.

641
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:25,980
And then I talk about the long-term stuff, which is actually, I think, in many ways, what we should be more concerned with,

642
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:28,980
because the short-term stuff, like, you figure that out in 10 seconds, right?

643
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:34,980
And the diabetes doesn't worry me as much for all the reasons you've said, which is it doesn't sneak up on you,

644
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,980
and you can measure the progress.

645
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:43,980
But maybe I'm being overly cautious, and I've had many an argument with many a cardiologist that I share patients with,

646
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:47,980
who, you know, will have a patient on a maximum dose of a statin.

647
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:48,980
I'll give you one example.

648
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,980
I've got a patient who came to me on 80 milligrams of Lipitor.

649
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,980
Still wasn't quite at goal.

650
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:55,980
We added the 10 of Zetia.

651
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,980
So then he was at goal.

652
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:03,980
And given his burden of disease, goal for this guy is about 700 nanomole per liter of LDL-P.

653
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,980
But, you know, he had no cholesterol synthesis that we could speak of.

654
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,980
So put him on a PCSK9 inhibitor.

655
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,980
That took his LDL down to like 200 nanomole per liter.

656
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,980
So I said, great, let's back off the Lipitor.

657
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:20,980
And his cardiologist just thought, like, this was malpractice.

658
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,980
And, you know, it took many a discussion to just even get that back to 40.

659
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:29,980
And my goal is to hopefully get him down to maybe 20 of Lipitor,

660
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,980
so that I can actually see some cholesterol synthesis come back.

661
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,980
That's interesting.

662
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,980
But again, now we're also a little outside of evidence-based medicine,

663
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,980
and we're, this is more the art than the science.

664
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:41,980
That's right.

665
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:46,980
And it's a fascinating issue to deal with, because we are conducting an experiment in the global population,

666
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,980
certainly in the U.S., that has never been done before.

667
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:55,980
And that is prescribing statins to millions of people as a lifelong treatment

668
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:01,980
without knowing what downstream effects are beyond the clinical trial data that we have,

669
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,980
which is limited.

670
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:12,980
And we can call in genetics, but it doesn't necessarily mimic the effects of using a statin drug for 40 years.

671
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:18,980
And so I'm just going to say very briefly that I don't want to open the lid on the discussion

672
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:23,980
that many of the naysayers have used to say that statins should be avoided,

673
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,980
because they can have long-term effects.

674
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:27,980
But I will say...

675
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:32,980
That's like saying driving should be avoided because driving has some negative effects.

676
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,980
Right.

677
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,980
But there are things that we don't know that certainly I would like to learn,

678
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:41,980
and hopefully our own research project will contribute to this,

679
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:46,980
as to what may be affecting certain subsets of the population with prolonged use

680
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:54,980
by understanding the mechanisms that might be operating in tissues like the muscle, pancreas, and the brain.

681
01:19:54,980 --> 01:20:00,980
And so that by understanding those mechanisms and perhaps developing markers for people

682
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:04,980
that may have increased likelihood of these undesirable effects

683
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,980
that we may be able to guide our treatment more effectively.

684
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,980
That's really the goal of this pharmacogenetic experiment.

685
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,980
Do we understand the mechanism of the myalgias?

686
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,980
I tend to give patients ubiquinol,

687
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,980
but honestly the trials are...

688
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,980
And I explained to them, I said, look, I use it as a practice,

689
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,980
but I can't point to amazing data.

690
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,980
What do we think is going on there?

691
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:28,980
We just talked earlier about the European Consensus Group that I was on.

692
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:31,980
Well, there was a second one that I was on, and it was...

693
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,980
Statin side effects.

694
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:33,980
Statin side effects.

695
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:39,980
And so the first paper in that series came out a year or so ago, and that was a myopathy.

696
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:46,980
The second paper is, I think, just out, and it describes the data related to diabetes,

697
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,980
cognitive function, et cetera.

698
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,980
The first paper attempted to address the question you asked, among other things,

699
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,980
and that is what's going on here.

700
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:57,980
And all we have is a diagram that has many points of attack,

701
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,980
where one of the things that we're actually working on,

702
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:05,980
one of my colleagues in my research program, is mitochondrial targeting of statins.

703
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,980
There may be on-target effects.

704
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:13,980
That is, a normal response to statins in some people,

705
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,980
or maybe in a significant percentage of the population,

706
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:21,980
may affect mitochondrial function in ways that generally are not clinically important,

707
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:27,980
but which in some people could be magnified and lead to changes in muscle function

708
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,980
and muscle number, muscle cell number.

709
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:37,980
That's a hypothesis, but what I'm speaking to now is the lack of a clear single mechanism

710
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,980
that we can point to.

711
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,980
That's just one of several possibilities.

712
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,980
The effects on a coenzyme Q, you can know what you mentioned,

713
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,980
and it's certainly been out there.

714
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,980
But as you say, very high placebo effect.

715
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,980
Can I reverse that?

716
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:51,980
That's right.

717
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:52,980
It has not been that successful.

718
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:56,980
One of my patients, I said, doctor, actually, I'll say this for whatever it's worth.

719
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:57,980
This is one of the sort of clinical pros.

720
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:03,980
I have a doctor who's really a very good observer who wind up getting a liquid form of coenzyme Q

721
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,980
as opposed to a capsule.

722
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,980
A capsule didn't work.

723
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:11,980
His muscle symptoms dramatically disappeared or improved for the liquid form.

724
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:14,980
So maybe there's issues of absorption or exposure.

725
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:15,980
Who knows?

726
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:16,980
Well, I do think there is actually.

727
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:17,980
I mean, we've just empirically used it.

728
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:23,980
We test CoQ10 levels in the blood, and I've noticed for what it's worth

729
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:27,980
that virtually every version doesn't show up.

730
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:31,980
The only one I have found, and just to be clear, I don't get paid by this company at all,

731
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:37,980
but there's a brand made by Jarrow, which Jarrow, I think, is probably the best supplement maker I've seen.

732
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:38,980
We've had some other stuff tested.

733
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:46,980
But Jarrow's ubiquinol is so readily absorbed because, you know, the clinical trials call for 600 milligrams.

734
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,980
I don't think I have a patient on more than 400.

735
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:56,980
In fact, most people at 200 milligrams of the Jarrow variant reach systemic levels that are above our on-stat and target.

736
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:57,980
Again, does that mean anything?

737
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:58,980
I actually have no clue.

738
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,980
That's right.

739
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,980
But for what it's worth, I've noticed that on most other versions and variants of ubiquinol,

740
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,980
we just do not measure it in the blood.

741
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,980
Yeah, I certainly don't have that experience.

742
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,980
It's very interesting to learn.

743
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,980
But again, how this...

744
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,980
How that's working is, yeah.

745
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:15,980
Right.

746
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:21,980
Another thing I just mentioned along those lines, and again, it deals with diving deeper into the biology of the system.

747
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:24,980
There's about 20 intermediates on the way to ubiquinol.

748
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:27,980
It's just as complicated a pathway as cholesterol synthesis.

749
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:31,980
And so we don't know whether there may be other targets in that pathway.

750
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,980
It just happens to be the end result.

751
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:39,980
So there's lots to learn about how statins impact biology in ways that could affect health.

752
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:44,980
And it's in part because we have such a large population who is doing this experiment, basically.

753
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:49,980
And it's also because of the centrality of mechanisms that statins affect.

754
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,980
So it's not just cholesterol synthesis.

755
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:54,980
It's precursors of steroid hormones that are in this pathway.

756
01:23:54,980 --> 01:24:00,980
And it's these other pathways that can affect intermediates like ubiquinol and other farnesyl.

757
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:07,980
There's lots of other downstream products that are affected by statins that may have biological effects

758
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:12,980
that tell us something about what the drug is doing in the physiological way,

759
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:15,980
but may also have pathologic consequences in some people.

760
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:21,980
What do you make of the evidence for and against the case that, and this is not a common argument,

761
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:26,980
but it is one that shows up enough, which is, okay, statins do reduce events,

762
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,980
but it's not by lowering LDL.

763
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:34,980
That's an unintended consequence or an intended consequence that is true, true, and unrelated.

764
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:43,980
But the benefits of statins actually come from the endothelial health and or inflammatory reduction.

765
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:44,980
Right.

766
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:53,980
So this is another deep topic, which is obviously clinically important that people understand what it is they're treating and why.

767
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,980
It gets back to a couple of issues.

768
01:24:55,980 --> 01:25:00,980
One is the causality of LDL, which we discussed a while ago.

769
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:04,980
LDL is causal. That's established beyond doubt.

770
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:12,980
So the benefits of drug-induced LDL lowering, let's say statins, have to be considered as operating in part through that mechanism.

771
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:13,980
Otherwise...

772
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,980
Right. Let's at least concede that in part, otherwise you're just ignoring reality.

773
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,980
Yeah, yeah.

774
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:22,980
So that's number one. Number two is, is it the most important factor or is it the only factor?

775
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,980
And the answer is, it's certainly not the only factor.

776
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:27,980
There's no doubt in my mind anyway.

777
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:30,980
I'm not sure how much of this is opinion versus evidence.

778
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,980
But, well, there's certainly anti-inflammatory effects.

779
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:38,980
And there's a lot of work that that good friend Paul Ricker has been involved with to help establish...

780
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:39,980
Paul Ricker's at NIH.

781
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:40,980
No, he's at...

782
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:41,980
Or he's at Brigham.

783
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:42,980
He's at Brigham.

784
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:43,980
Okay, yeah.

785
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:51,980
Early on establishing the importance of C-reactive protein as a marker for inflammatory risk, not just to heart disease, but...

786
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,980
And we should detour on that topic because it's so important, right?

787
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,980
There was a recent trial that looked at low dose of methotrexate, which is an...

788
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,980
No, it was an IL. It was an interleukin one.

789
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,980
Weren't there two? There was the IL-1 IL.

790
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:03,980
The methotrexate isn't out yet.

791
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:04,980
Oh, okay. Maybe I'm just...

792
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:05,980
It's the other one.

793
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:06,980
Okay. Okay.

794
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:09,980
The other one's out. Yeah. It used an interleukin one.

795
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,980
Was it with one or six? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:12,980
Yeah, one.

797
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,980
And so that was a very interesting trial, right?

798
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:15,980
That was his trial.

799
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:16,980
Yeah, that was... Okay, that's right.

800
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:20,980
So that was a trial that said, look, we can make no change to the lipoprotein.

801
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:21,980
Right.

802
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,980
We reduce inflammation in a subset of patients.

803
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:27,980
These patients had to have an elevated C-reactive protein, if I recall, and you reduced events.

804
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:28,980
Yeah.

805
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:32,980
And we may see the same thing with this methotrexate study, and I think that speaks to...

806
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:33,980
Or not.

807
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:34,980
Yeah, yeah.

808
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,980
Either way, it's an important finding.

809
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:36,980
Exactly.

810
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,980
Yeah.

811
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:40,980
So the reason I ask the question, among others, is...

812
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:41,980
Can you make the statins, right?

813
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:42,980
Yeah.

814
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:46,980
Okay. Because then you can say, well, what do statins do to this pathway?

815
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:51,980
Well, they do lower inflammatory signaling down the same pathway.

816
01:26:52,980 --> 01:27:00,980
And again, RIFKR was a pioneer in studies such as the JUPITER trial and earlier ones as well

817
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:07,980
that reanalyzed the predicted benefit or the associated benefit of LDL lowering against

818
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,980
CRP lowering as a marker for inflammation.

819
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,980
So this goes back to using CRP as a marker for inflammation.

820
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:19,980
And achieving a lower level of CRP and a higher level of LDL was associated with benefit.

821
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:22,980
So achieving a lower level of LDL with a higher CRP was benefit.

822
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,980
So they both contributed to risk.

823
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:30,980
And so targeting both LDL to less than 70, I think it was, and CRP less than, I think,

824
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:33,980
2 milligrams per deciliter, I think.

825
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:37,980
But targeting those two risk markers together gave the greatest benefit.

826
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:38,980
They each contributed.

827
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:43,980
And I think that model stands up pretty well, that it is a double whammy.

828
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:48,980
And one of the reasons statins are so effective is probably because of their unique ability

829
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:54,980
to hit inflammation as well as LDL metabolism and gets back to PCSK9 doesn't quite happen.

830
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:58,980
That's an inter, that's exactly where I was going to go, which is I've got a number of

831
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:03,980
patients that are coming to me saying, look, Peter, I don't care about the cost of the

832
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,980
PCSK9 inhibitor, get me off this statin.

833
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:11,980
I just want to be on a PCSK9 inhibitor to which I say the only issue I take with that

834
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:15,980
is, and I don't have a problem doing it in the patient who is completely statin intolerant,

835
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:19,980
there's a couple of these patients where they absolutely need to be on lipid lowering

836
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:22,980
therapy, and they absolutely can't even tolerate, you know, live a low.

837
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:25,980
So there we just do what we have to do.

838
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:31,980
But the trials don't actually tell us how well PCSK9 inhibitors work in isolation, right,

839
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:34,980
relative to non-treatment.

840
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:39,980
So that's just sort of the evidence-based reason for, hey, it would be ideal if we could

841
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:42,980
at least keep you on some modest amount of a statin.

842
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:46,980
Secondly, it's not clear the PCSK9 inhibitor attacks that other mechanism.

843
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,980
There's a mechanistic aspect to this.

844
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:52,980
And it's not just inflammation down the interleukin CRP pathway.

845
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:57,980
It's also there's nitric oxide synthesis, effects nitric oxide being a base of dilator.

846
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:03,980
So I think there is a good mechanistic case as well as the clinical evidence case for

847
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:08,980
not abandoning statins in favor of PCSK9, unless, of course, patients are statin intolerant.

848
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,980
Where do you think the effect?

849
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:14,980
So one of the things I sort of try to define this as men, women, primary, secondary prevention,

850
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,980
right, that's a nice two by two square.

851
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:21,980
I don't think there's any, I mean, again, I'm not talking about the blogosphere or Twitter,

852
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:26,980
but like if you actually look at evidence, is there any dispute in the efficacy of statins

853
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:28,980
in secondary prevention for men or women?

854
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:29,980
No.

855
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:30,980
There's no dispute.

856
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,980
So we won't even need to talk about that.

857
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:34,980
Let's talk about primary prevention.

858
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,980
The variability in clinical trials when you look at primary prevention, especially in

859
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,980
women, but I think for men to some extent as well, both in the NNT, so that means the

860
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:43,980
number needed to treat.

861
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:48,980
So the NNT, of course, being the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction.

862
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:53,980
So an NNT of 100 means you have a 1% risk reduction, you need to treat 100 people to

863
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:54,980
prevent an event.

864
01:29:54,980 --> 01:30:00,980
When you look at the summary data on this, it's amazing how all over the map it is.

865
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:04,980
So how would you rate the strength of the evidence?

866
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,980
Just a quick question, Ron.

867
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:08,980
I'll just give you 30 seconds to answer this.

868
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:13,980
The strength of the evidence in primary prevention of statins in either men or women.

869
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:14,980
Okay.

870
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:20,980
Well, let me start with women and let me also specify that you need to think about cardiovascular

871
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:23,980
events and then mortality from cardiovascular disease.

872
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:24,980
Right.

873
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:29,980
So we'll talk about major adverse cardiac events, so myocardial infarction, stroke versus death.

874
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:35,980
So there is evidence, again, importantly from the Jupiter trial, which had a very large

875
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:41,980
enrollment of women, but collectively in other trials as well, for the benefit of statins

876
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:45,980
for high risk primary prevention in women.

877
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:50,980
And the high risk caveat is really important here because it really speaks to this very

878
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:56,980
fine gradation between high risk primary prevention and secondary prevention because if you're

879
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:01,980
at a high enough risk and haven't had a heart attack, you may be five seconds away from

880
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:02,980
the heart attack.

881
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,980
Yeah, or you may have had a silent MI that was missed.

882
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,980
Or already, right.

883
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:11,980
So that distinction could be a little bit fuzzy, but technically at least the evidence is there

884
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:14,980
for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in women.

885
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,980
It's not really there, at least to my reading.

886
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:20,980
I may be wrong about this because I haven't gone back and double checked, but I haven't

887
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:26,980
seen evidence for benefit on mortality for primary prevention in women.

888
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:27,980
In women, yeah.

889
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:32,980
And in men, it's kind of weakish for mortality, but it's certainly present for events.

890
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:37,980
And is it also possible that one of the things I try to explain to, if I'm giving a lecture

891
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:44,980
or something to students, is you look at a paper and you see no statistical benefit.

892
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:49,980
The first question you must ask yourself was, was this study powered adequately to detect

893
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:50,980
a difference?

894
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:55,980
And it's very often the case that there could have been an effect, but it was too small to

895
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:57,980
see with the number of subjects.

896
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:02,980
I feel like in some of the primary prevention trials, duration might be the bigger issue.

897
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:07,980
If you're only looking at seven years, which is probably the outer limits of where these

898
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:15,980
trials look, it might simply be that when you're talking about a 1% absolute risk reduction

899
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,980
over seven years, it's not really that interesting.

900
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:24,980
Of course, a 1% risk reduction over seven years, over 30 years, is an enormous difference.

901
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:29,980
Alan Snyderman is actually working on a paper now that looks at 30-year risk, because of

902
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:33,980
course, all the risk calculators are based on 10-year risk, which I think has value,

903
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,980
but also has great limitation.

904
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:41,980
And I guess I think that's part of what I struggle with this clinically, which is we

905
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:46,980
never want to expose a patient to something unnecessarily, and there's no substance you're

906
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:51,980
going to put in your body, whether it's vitamin C versus a statin that comes with zero risk.

907
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,980
So how do you weigh that benefit?

908
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:55,980
Yeah.

909
01:32:55,980 --> 01:33:01,980
Well, this really speaks to need for much better markers that could help us predict

910
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:09,980
benefit versus adverse effects, so that we can identify not just the high-risk candidate

911
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:15,980
for statins based on conventional markers, but individuals in whom we have evidence for

912
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:20,980
mechanisms that would be benefited by statin treatment that would argue strongly for benefit.

913
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:26,980
And on the other side, markers ideally that could assess risk for adverse effects, not

914
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:29,980
just symptoms, but underlying pathology, for example.

915
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,980
And again, without...

916
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:36,980
I want to come back briefly to your question about cognitive function, because I sort of

917
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:40,980
escaped talking about that, because I feel this is...

918
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,980
Because you forgot, because you're cognitive function.

919
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:46,980
No, as a matter of fact, quite the opposite.

920
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:53,980
I put it in a part of my brain that has made me not forget that there can be effects that

921
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:57,980
are long-term that we simply can't assess easily.

922
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,980
And so one of them could be cognitive function.

923
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,980
But having said that, there's no evidence.

924
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:06,980
And in our consensus paper that just came out, statin and tolerance, no evidence really.

925
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,980
Well, at the population level, I would say it's the opposite.

926
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:12,980
At the population level, I think we see that the risk, if anything, goes down a little bit.

927
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,980
Yeah, and there's a cardiovascular...

928
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:15,980
There's a vascular...

929
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:16,980
Exactly right.

930
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:17,980
Right.

931
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:20,980
There's a vascular element that even contributes to classical Alzheimer's disease.

932
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,980
But again, the data are really not compelling.

933
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:24,980
They're not compelling in any other direction.

934
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:25,980
No, this is the challenge.

935
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:26,980
This is personalized medicine.

936
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:27,980
That's right.

937
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,980
It means at the end, I don't care about the population.

938
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:32,980
I care about the one person sitting in front of me at this moment when we have to make

939
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,980
a decision.

940
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,980
Exactly.

941
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,980
Exactly.

942
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:39,980
But what's intriguing and what your question opened up, and I have to be careful because

943
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:44,980
I don't want to go down the rabbit hole on this one, to the extent that statins influence

944
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:51,980
mechanisms that interact with cholesterol transport in the brain in apoprotein E, which

945
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:55,980
we mentioned is a variant that causes type 3 hyperlipidemia.

946
01:34:55,980 --> 01:35:01,980
Apoprotein E is a key protein that has another variant that increases the risk for Alzheimer's

947
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,980
disease.

948
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:06,980
Well, we're looking at ways that cholesterol metabolism intersects with that pathway.

949
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:12,980
And conceivably, that's just one example of a gene that could interact with statins and

950
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:17,980
if the statins are getting past the blood-brain barrier in some cases, and inflammation

951
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:20,980
might be a factor that could predispose to that.

952
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:26,980
You could start to have imagined effects that could go either way, but could perhaps potentiate

953
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:27,980
dysfunction.

954
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:30,980
That's just a completely out of...

955
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,980
No, no, look, I mean, that's exactly...

956
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:35,980
I mean, that's sort of the hand waving that I use, right?

957
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:41,980
So when I have patients that have one or two copies of an APO E4 gene, I am that much more

958
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:45,980
careful with them, with statin use, and until proven otherwise.

959
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,980
Yeah, and we don't know.

960
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:54,980
I mean, actually, there's a wonderful group of APO E4 carriers that has formed sort of

961
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:58,580
a support, very large, that I've interacted with.

962
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,780
They came to my lab.

963
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:06,180
There's about 30 members of this group that came and I gave a talk about apoprotein E

964
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,780
and nutrition, actually.

965
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:12,500
I had to sort of be careful because these people were just anxious for advice.

966
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,500
What do we do?

967
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,500
We've got this APO E4 variant.

968
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,500
What do I do with my diet?

969
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:22,780
We've done a lot of studies along these lines, but we don't know what the effect on disease

970
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:23,780
risk is.

971
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:27,660
But there's one other cumulative effect that I'm going to mention without, again, turning

972
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:32,500
the tables on the value of statins, and that is getting back to the muscle effect.

973
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:38,380
Because if there is an adverse effect on mitochondrial function, which we can show

974
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:44,260
that and others have shown that, and if there are individuals who, for one reason or another,

975
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:51,820
are at risk for muscle wasting, sarcopenia is muscle wasting, conceivably, that on-target

976
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:59,860
effective statins, the extent that it is affecting muscle tissue, could over decades conceivably

977
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:04,380
impact the rate at which this muscle wasting could occur.

978
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:08,220
There may be a time, and this is just, I'm turning this out at the, probably near the

979
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:14,380
end of this discussion, as a kind of just a thought, is it may argue for after a certain

980
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:19,140
age, not worrying so much about high dose statin treatment unless the patient is at

981
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:21,180
really high risk.

982
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:25,460
Because one may be adding in elderly individuals an exposure.

983
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:29,300
Yeah, you're creating a new risk in the presence of another risk reduction.

984
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:34,340
Right, and it's the experiment that we probably are never going to be able to do.

985
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,660
And so it just has to sort of be cognizant.

986
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:41,860
I've had patients, and again, I actually take care of a number of physicians, actually,

987
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:46,580
in my clinical work, who asked me, I've reached the age of 75 or 80, and I've done well, I've

988
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,340
had family history, but I'm going to be fine now.

989
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:53,380
And it's a difficult question to answer because we don't have the evidence base beyond age

990
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:54,380
75.

991
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:58,860
That was really where the cholesterol guidelines that came out a few years ago stopped because

992
01:37:58,860 --> 01:37:59,860
that's where the evidence stopped.

993
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:00,860
Yeah.

994
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,540
We do have benefit in older individuals who are at higher risk, but we don't know what

995
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,860
the trade-off is in terms of adverse effects that people don't really need to be taking

996
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:09,860
it any longer.

997
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:12,860
Now, you were involved in one of the ATP guidelines, correct?

998
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:17,940
Yeah, well, I was on the ATP for, on the last panel that handed it off to the American Heart

999
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,980
Association, American College of Cardiology.

1000
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:23,060
I was connected with it when it was part of the NIH guidelines.

1001
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,700
Now, you took issue with something, didn't you?

1002
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:32,020
Well, there were some concerns that I and others had regarding the scope of the effort.

1003
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:37,660
Originally, and this is my own personal experience with it, when I was brought on, I was expecting,

1004
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:42,820
and we originally talked about having a wide range of topics to discuss, not just LDL lowering,

1005
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:49,360
but how we manage triglycerides, the role of HDL, emerging risk factors, alpilolae.

1006
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:56,920
We had probably 15 or 16 high-priority questions, and I was intending to be involved heavily

1007
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:00,640
on the discussion of some of these other risk factors.

1008
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:06,920
I thought the LDL story was obviously important, and one had to address, should we update the

1009
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:07,920
guidelines?

1010
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:08,920
That's what it was really designed to be.

1011
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:14,960
And it turned out in the end that because of various changes in support of the whole

1012
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,400
exam, the number of questions was reduced down to just three, and they all had to do

1013
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:24,040
with LDL lowering and the evidence for it.

1014
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:30,800
And it was very heavily dependent on trials that were available to provide evidence-based

1015
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,800
conclusions.

1016
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:38,680
So that means that the effort was really limited to a very strict interpretation of evidence-based

1017
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:44,920
guidelines, and that led to an abandoning of the LDL targeting that we had.

1018
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:51,320
The LDL levels that had been used to guide management of risk were abandoned because

1019
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:56,920
there was no study that actually addressed specifically that question, that is, does reaching

1020
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,240
a certain target reduce risk?

1021
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:04,760
And I personally got rather discouraged at the limitation that we were under.

1022
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:09,120
Eventually, it sort of got a little bit softened, actually, after I left the committee.

1023
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:14,760
I think there was a little bit more tolerance of potential role, but basically, by being

1024
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:19,840
that narrow, we not only lost a lot of important questions in lipid management, they just weren't

1025
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,840
addressed.

1026
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,440
Triglyceride, et cetera, et cetera.

1027
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,880
Metabolic syndrome wasn't really touched on at all.

1028
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:27,320
So it was disappointing to me.

1029
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,920
And I felt my LPA, right.

1030
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,200
And so I felt my role on the LDL lowering side was sort of limited.

1031
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:37,720
I'd actually been involved with being consultants of companies that made LDL lowering drugs,

1032
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:40,160
so I had to actually excuse myself from even the decision process.

1033
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:44,000
So it was really a point where I just wasn't able to contribute the way I thought I could,

1034
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,720
so I decided to step off.

1035
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,080
I could continue this discussion probably for six more hours, but there is one other

1036
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:53,360
thing I want to go back to that we did talk about, and I think it's the niacin question.

1037
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,360
Right.

1038
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:55,360
You haven't forgotten that.

1039
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,040
No, I sure have not.

1040
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,200
So what does niacin do, right?

1041
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:02,000
So first of all, I don't think anybody actually really understands the mechanism by which

1042
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,440
niacin lowers APO-B. I mean, is that generally?

1043
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,120
Yeah, that's right.

1044
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,280
I would say that's a fair statement.

1045
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:13,660
But niacin is a drug that lowers LDL, particle cholesterol.

1046
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:16,380
It also raises HDL cholesterol quite significantly.

1047
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:20,340
In fact, I've seen it raise HDL cholesterol more than I've seen anything in those CTEP

1048
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,600
inhibitors.

1049
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,860
So it seems like the dream drug.

1050
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,340
It's doing everything right.

1051
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:29,200
Now, it does also create some insulin resistance, and it seems to do that at a higher level

1052
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:30,480
than even statins do.

1053
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:35,240
But do you think that that's the explanation for why the heart outcome data aren't there

1054
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:40,300
and why niacin has fallen so far out of favor that ... I actually called in niacin for a

1055
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,820
patient about a year ago.

1056
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:43,660
We were kind of doing an experiment.

1057
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:47,580
He couldn't tolerate a statin, couldn't afford a PCSK9 inhibitor.

1058
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:51,140
We were really reaching for straws, and we couldn't even get niacin for him.

1059
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:53,940
I mean, we literally couldn't even get his insurance company to pay for niacin.

1060
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:56,420
So it is persona non grata.

1061
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:57,580
Help me understand that.

1062
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:58,580
Okay.

1063
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:01,460
So my disclosure is I still use a lot of niacin.

1064
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:05,100
So why do I do that in the light of all these trials?

1065
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:11,500
So let me just back up then and say that the trials, the high profile trials that led

1066
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:17,540
to the dismissal of niacin as a therapeutic option, one was AIM high and the other was

1067
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,540
HPS2.

1068
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:19,540
It wasn't HPS2.

1069
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:20,540
Yeah, yeah.

1070
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:27,900
HPS2 both involved the following criterion, and that is niacin was tested as an HDL raising

1071
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:36,900
agent in the setting of LDL being at a low level as a result of intensive statin plus

1072
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:43,300
or minus Cetia to bring LDL cholesterol levels to a low enough level that it would be considered

1073
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:44,800
a non factor.

1074
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:50,540
That is that the niacin effect due to LDL would be minimized, whereas the HDL...

1075
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,540
Right.

1076
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:55,300
In other words, how do we assess the level of niacin exclusively on its HDL raising properties

1077
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,260
because we've maximized LDL lower?

1078
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,260
That's right.

1079
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:02,940
So they were designed to test whether the HDL increase with niacin is beneficial.

1080
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:08,220
And the answer is from those trials, I'd say unequivocally no.

1081
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:13,060
That is the HDL raising effect of niacin is not protective.

1082
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:15,420
That's the conclusion to take away.

1083
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:21,280
That in my view was beating, maybe not a dead horse, but a pretty sick one because I never

1084
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:26,740
really was totally convinced that raising HDL itself would be beneficial.

1085
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:31,220
Even though I was part of the earliest study that showed that if you genetically treat

1086
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:36,980
mice with a gene that raises HDL, you can reduce atherosclerosis.

1087
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:42,380
I mean, there is a protective effect, but I was of the opinion that the association

1088
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:49,140
of HDL cholesterol across the population with risk fell into the same category as the LDL

1089
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,220
small LDL story and triglyceride story.

1090
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:55,020
It's part of a interrelated metabolic syndrome.

1091
01:43:55,020 --> 01:44:00,360
And I felt that the most important pathologic features of that syndrome were not low HDL,

1092
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:04,120
but the high levels of small LDL and triglycerides.

1093
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:08,820
And both of those components have been not just the LDL, but the triglyceride related

1094
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:13,040
risk have been pretty clearly shown to be causal.

1095
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,300
And the HDL was a marker for that.

1096
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,800
That was actually my guess just based on my opinion.

1097
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,400
And there could be another issue here, right?

1098
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:27,940
Which is to raise, I mean, there are known HDL lipoproteinemia where very high HDL is

1099
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:32,840
actually atherogenic because they're so dysfunctional, they can't actually delipidate, right?

1100
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,840
Exactly.

1101
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,720
So the simple minded idea that raising HDL by any means would be beneficial, just like

1102
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:43,400
lowering LDL by any means would be beneficial, was disproven by those studies.

1103
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,320
Plus all of the C-TEP inhibitors.

1104
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,320
That's right.

1105
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,320
None of the C-TEP inhibitors.

1106
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:55,000
So there's something fundamentally pathologic about that effect on HDL that overrides any

1107
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,440
potential benefit that may be due to other factors.

1108
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:05,320
And in the case of the two major niacin trials, there was some lowering of LDL, but as you

1109
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:08,680
point out, the HDL increase was fairly substantial.

1110
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:12,960
And those particles are basically hung up in plasma.

1111
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,720
It gets back a little bit to this resonance time issue that I was talking about regarding

1112
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,720
LDL.

1113
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:21,840
Well, here's a situation for HDL, well, these particles are just sort of like the toilet

1114
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,840
is plugged.

1115
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,920
Yeah, you prevent them from doing their job.

1116
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:25,920
Right.

1117
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,560
So you're not delivering cholesterol sufficiently back to the liver for excretion, and those

1118
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:33,720
particles are hanging around long enough that who knows what properties they may be acquiring

1119
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:40,480
that might possibly override some of the benefits of the LDL lowering effect.

1120
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:43,800
So does that mean that niacin has no benefit?

1121
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:49,560
Well, there was a study that preceded those two studies that was carried out by Greg Brown

1122
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:54,520
and actually was one that led to the AMPI study being funded by the NIH, and that was

1123
01:45:54,520 --> 01:46:02,560
called HATs, H-D-L, H-D-L, atherosclerosis treatment study, HATS.

1124
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,560
And that was a...

1125
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:07,760
Almost as good as Mr. Fit, which I realize now is the one I was forgetting before the

1126
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,760
LRCP.

1127
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,480
Okay, that was a multi-factor risk management.

1128
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,480
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1129
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:12,480
So going back to HATs.

1130
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,480
Right.

1131
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:18,120
So HATs was a statin plus niacin, and there was other combination approach, which included

1132
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,440
niacin.

1133
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,800
And that study showed benefit to levels.

1134
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:27,440
One was the intended endpoint was quantitative angiographic progression, measuring the narrowing

1135
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,200
of the coronary vessels, which is now not used.

1136
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,880
We now realize it's not particularly helpful.

1137
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:33,680
It happened to be correlated with endpoints.

1138
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:38,160
And in fact, in that study, even though it was initially underpowered to detect the benefit

1139
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,120
on endpoints, it did...

1140
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:42,440
That intervention did reduce risk of events.

1141
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:44,640
It was a successful trial.

1142
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:49,680
We analyzed data from that study using four different methods to look at lipoprotein particles.

1143
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:53,840
So part of this was to see whether we could learn something more than the standard lipid

1144
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,240
measurements would tell us.

1145
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:01,600
And what it did tell us is that the small and very small LDL lowering achieved by niacin,

1146
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:06,320
which it does do, was associated with vascular benefit in that study.

1147
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:11,640
Whereas the HDL, to the extent that nothing else was explanatory, and that was independent

1148
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,280
of all the standard lipids.

1149
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,820
So we have this in the literature from just one study, and I wish we would have access

1150
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:23,400
to other types of data that could support this, but it spoke to a therapeutic effective

1151
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:31,480
niacin that would be lost in these larger trials because the statin hammer had lowered

1152
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,940
the LDL low enough.

1153
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:34,760
So that additional benefit is probably just lost.

1154
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,760
It's too small.

1155
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:36,760
It's underpowered.

1156
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:37,860
It's lost in the noise.

1157
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:42,460
So the failure of those trials speaks to the success of statins and the failure of

1158
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:43,460
HDL raising.

1159
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:45,620
Those are the two things that take away.

1160
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:50,260
But niacin, I think in the patients who have small LDL particles, I still use it, and I

1161
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:51,260
like to see...

1162
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:53,020
Well, that's what I want to ask you.

1163
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:56,420
Let's talk me through the perfect niacin patient.

1164
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:01,060
Well, the perfect patient with niacin is actually twofold.

1165
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:04,500
And we weren't going to talk about LPA, but you did bring it up earlier, and I'll mention

1166
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,500
it again.

1167
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:10,780
It's this genetic factor that is sort of the wild card in atherosclerosis that's certainly

1168
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:12,900
damaging and we like to lower it.

1169
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:18,060
So niacin can lower LPLA by up to 25% or so.

1170
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:26,540
And there is not conclusive, but to me clinically impressive evidence that if you have a combination

1171
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:32,100
of high LPA and small LDL, you're just a time bomb for atherosclerosis.

1172
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,620
So if you have high levels of small...

1173
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:39,820
High particle number of the small LDL type plus LPLA elevations.

1174
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:43,300
And there's always a strong family history of heart disease and the patients are going

1175
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:48,140
to be at higher risk at a young age because niacin lowers LPA and because niacin lowers

1176
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,500
the small LDL particles.

1177
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,980
So niacin, you think specifically targets smaller particles over larger particles?

1178
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:55,980
Yeah, preferentially.

1179
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:57,980
Sorry, yeah, that would be a better one.

1180
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:59,860
It lowers that pathway.

1181
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:02,900
It's not clear whether it's just that through the LDL pathway or not.

1182
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:03,900
Honestly, we don't know.

1183
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:07,740
It gets back to your earlier statement that we don't know the mechanism really as well.

1184
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,540
We just don't know the mechanism.

1185
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:13,100
But in that combination, that really is the patient that...

1186
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:15,260
And I've got patients like that who have...

1187
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:19,140
And you'd put that patient on that over a PCSK9 inhibitor if they could afford it?

1188
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:20,420
Well, there's another angle...

1189
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:24,060
Because you're going to get a 30% reduction on LPLA through the PCSK9?

1190
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:25,060
That's right.

1191
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:26,060
That's right.

1192
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,060
That's another angle.

1193
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:31,700
PCSK9 has a similar new developed LPA lowering effect, plus it has a gangbusters bigger effect

1194
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:34,620
than LDL particle, LDL levels.

1195
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:36,620
So no, I wouldn't use it over PCSK9.

1196
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:40,180
The argument there is largely financial honestly.

1197
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:46,140
And when insurance recovery, you can buy niacin at the local shop off the shelf, longer acting

1198
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:49,740
niacin in a relatively safe form for pennies.

1199
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:55,420
You're going to pay an eight or nine or $14,000 for a PCSK9.

1200
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:59,980
I've had patients like you who have been willing to do that, who have been willing

1201
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:00,980
to sort of...

1202
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:01,980
Just pay out of pocket.

1203
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:02,980
That's right.

1204
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:06,780
And that is the same category of patient, and I probably would consider that even more

1205
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:07,780
effective.

1206
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:14,100
Although, one other thing, a little tweak here, and that is that both statins and PCSK9

1207
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:20,140
inhibitors, because they work, as you said, by upregulating LDL receptors, as in the case

1208
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:21,820
of PCSK9, that's the mechanism.

1209
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:22,820
Exclusively, yeah.

1210
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:23,820
That's right for the statins.

1211
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:24,940
It's part of the mechanism.

1212
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:32,980
That effect primarily lowers medium and larger size LDL particles and has less of a therapeutic

1213
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:36,500
effect than smaller particles and none on the very small LDL.

1214
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:42,460
So there's a gradation of effect which relates to the structure of the LDL being more or

1215
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:46,140
less capable of interacting with LDL receptors.

1216
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:50,980
And the larger particles interact well, and so upregulating LDL receptors.

1217
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:57,060
This explains why we sometimes see a widening of the discordance in the statinized patient,

1218
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:59,380
because they're lowering...

1219
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:03,700
You're lowering LDL-C more than LDL-P because you're selecting out the larger, more cholesterol

1220
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,700
dose.

1221
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:05,700
That's right.

1222
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:08,600
And so that applies to any mechanism that operates the LDL receptors, which is what

1223
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,100
most of the drugs do, even as that of my...

1224
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,260
So what does that mean for niacin?

1225
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:17,780
Well, niacin lowers the small and very small LDL very nicely.

1226
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:20,220
So there's a complementarity there to statins.

1227
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:24,620
And I think that's part of what attracts me to using it.

1228
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:28,580
And again, I don't use it nowadays because of potency of the statins, the ability to

1229
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:33,380
get LDL down to target in such a high proportion of patients, the availability of PCSK9.

1230
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:37,100
I'd have to say there's fewer patients than I'm starting on niacin, but there's still

1231
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:43,300
candidates out there that I think would benefit from this hitting small LDL and hitting L-P

1232
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:46,060
relay in ways that complement the benefits of statins.

1233
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:52,420
The only patient I've put on niacin in the last four years is a really interesting case.

1234
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:55,020
He's a guy with...

1235
01:51:55,020 --> 01:52:01,620
He doesn't have FH, but he's clearly got some SNPs of FH because his LDL is incredibly high,

1236
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:06,180
but normal synthesis, normal triglycerides, and normal absorption markers.

1237
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:08,300
So his sterols are normal.

1238
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:11,180
This is a clearance problem.

1239
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:16,420
He's unable to tolerate a single statin, including one milligram of livoloe.

1240
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:21,580
So we went to Rapatha, and there was no effect.

1241
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:26,100
And we switched to Pralulant, no effect.

1242
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,100
So he's missing...

1243
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,700
There's an epitope that's just...

1244
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:31,620
I would like the DNA from that patient because...

1245
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,620
I would be happy to introduce you to him.

1246
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:35,740
I have a Candid genetic variant that might explain that actually.

1247
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:36,740
Okay.

1248
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:39,580
So you use niacin in that patient.

1249
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:42,380
I mean, it's basically going to be what?

1250
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:43,380
Niacin and apheresis.

1251
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:45,900
I mean, it's a really tough case.

1252
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,900
Yeah.

1253
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:51,100
Well, again, I think it's legitimate to say that there's probably less...

1254
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:56,660
If you were Candidacin niacin with the availability of this potential for using PCSK9, and certainly

1255
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:57,980
with incontinence with statins.

1256
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:02,060
But I would say the patients with moderately elevated triglycerides in the 150 to...

1257
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,980
Yeah, you give them a little phenofibrate?

1258
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:06,300
Yes, I do actually, despite...

1259
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,940
That's another subset question.

1260
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:13,460
That is a subset of patients who may benefit based on subset analysis, subgroup analysis

1261
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,020
of the clinical trials.

1262
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:18,940
But unfortunately, it's just not a very potent patient.

1263
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:25,060
But niacin, I will use as a alternative approach to lowering the triglyceride and lowering

1264
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:26,700
the small LDL.

1265
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:27,700
That's elegant.

1266
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,700
That's something...

1267
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:33,020
I mean, if just on a personal level, that's certainly an amazing and insightful pearl

1268
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:34,820
that I've gathered from our discussion today.

1269
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:36,420
Well, I appreciate your saying that.

1270
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:41,260
Well, and with that, Ron, I want to say, first of all, I consider you a great friend and

1271
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:42,700
an unbelievable mentor.

1272
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:49,180
I feel so fortunate to have benefited from your knowledge and peers of yours over the

1273
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:50,980
last decade.

1274
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:55,260
And your generosity is unparalleled in terms of...

1275
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:58,940
Anytime I can pick up the phone and call you and run a tough case by you, you're always

1276
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,940
there to do so.

1277
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:01,420
So I greatly appreciate that.

1278
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:06,380
I also think we need to do this again sometime because I literally have twice as many questions

1279
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:07,580
as we've got to.

1280
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:12,500
I wanted to get into saturated fat, fructose, ApoE.

1281
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:16,580
There's all these other things that I know you are just an expert on that I know people

1282
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:17,580
are going to want to hear about.

1283
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:22,380
So I'm going to have to come back to San Francisco and we'll have to continue this discussion,

1284
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,220
hopefully during the Warriors off season.

1285
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:25,900
Happy to do that, Peter.

1286
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,060
And thank you for your kind words.

1287
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:30,180
And it's been a pleasure talking with you.

1288
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:34,860
I think the opportunity to help people understand some of these complex issues is something

1289
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:35,860
you've been very good at.

1290
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:38,620
And I think we had to be able to contribute to that.

1291
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,620
Thank you so much, Ron.

1292
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:40,620
Okay.

1293
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:47,500
