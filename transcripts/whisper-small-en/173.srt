00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,840
Hello Peter. Hey Bob, how are you man?

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm doing well, how are you? I'm great. Okay, you ready for an AMA?

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,600
I am. I saw the agenda. It's very aggressive. Yeah. Yeah. Ambicious.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,480
Oh I like it. Yes. Yeah, to say the least. I don't know if we'll get through everything,

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:40,440
but we did get a lot of follow-up questions on CGM based on our previous, actually I think

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,840
it was the previous AMA where we talked about glucose. We talked about mean glucose, glucose

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,560
variability and glucose spikes. And then we also had that Sunday email on CGM and non diabetics.

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,400
It was related to a JAMA perspective talking about it. So there's a bunch of questions on that.

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:06,200
Okay. We also have a couple of questions on Aura, the sleep wearable, the Aura ring. We've got some

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,400
exercise related questions and we may work in one or two additional questions if we have time.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,480
How's that sound? I think it sounds like a good, good list. Okay. So Peter, since we have a lot of

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,040
CGM related questions, one of the things that I've heard you talk about is you have a framework for

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,640
interventions that I think will be really helpful in laying the foundation for how you think about

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,120
CGM and their use in different populations. So can you start off by telling us a little bit

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,840
about that framework? Yeah. So again, it doesn't pertain to CGM specifically. It pertains to

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,880
anything that comes across my plate. And the first time I actually contemplated this was

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,880
really when I started kind of trying to look critically at the data around meditation. So

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,320
this was probably about maybe eight to 10 years ago. But anyway, it basically asks a series of

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,240
questions. So the first question is what is the risk of harm from doing this thing? So that's a

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:15,520
direct question. So if you do X, how high is the probability of harm? The second question is

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,120
obviously the contrapositive of that. If you do X, what is the probability of benefit? And then

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,240
the third question, and by the way, before I go to the third question, those first two questions

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,040
are so obvious that they're almost not worth stating. And of course, that's mirrored in the

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,480
way the FDA organizes drug trials, right? So a drug trial is organized first by, well, after you

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,000
get through the preclinical data, the animal work, after the IND has been filed, your first trial in

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,280
humans, which is called a phase one trial, is looking at harm. I mean, it's typically a small

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:04,280
trial with dose escalation that is only trying to understand if as you escalate the dose, do you see

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,640
an increase in side effects? Very occasionally, you see some benefits in a phase one trial. And if

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,480
you do, that's interesting, but you generally can't take it to the bank because the study is

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,800
so small. And generally, it's quite homogeneous. So that's when you move on to phase two studies,

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,440
which are geared towards efficacy, i.e. is this thing doing good? And of course, if the phase two

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,280
trial is positive, you move to a much larger trial called a phase three trial, which really doubles

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,800
down on efficacy. Of course, both of these trials will continue to be able to pick up any signal of

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,960
harm. So you're always in the spirit of trying to capture that. But the real point here is you're

36
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,360
raising the bar, so to speak, for what you're demanding of this. So again, what's the risk of

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,800
harm? What's the probability of benefit are two obvious questions. I think the third question then

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,960
is what's the opportunity cost of this intervention? And I feel like I've talked about this on a

39
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:14,160
previous podcast before, and maybe it was even one of ours. But there was this device that you

40
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:24,320
would listen to, and it would supposedly put you in a trance. And the company that was proposing

41
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,640
this thing had all sorts of theoretical benefits from using it. If you listen to this device,

42
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,280
you are less likely to get breast cancer and all of these other things. So was there any

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,960
harm in this device? As far as I could tell, no. I really didn't think that listening to this

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:52,480
device was harmful in any way. Was there any benefit of this device? Certainly not to the extent that

45
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,920
they made claims. That said, I had tried the device because a friend of mine bought it for me. And I

46
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,240
have to admit, it was the most relaxing thing I'd ever done. In fact, virtually every time I tried

47
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,040
it, I fell asleep. So maybe there was some good in that, maybe there was some bad in that. If it

48
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,940
was a daytime nap and you could speak to the disadvantages of daytime napping. But there was

49
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,240
an opportunity cost to it. And I don't just mean financial. So the device was pretty expensive. I

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
want to say it was like a thousand bucks if you were going to buy the thing. A thousand bucks is

51
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,720
no trivial sum of money for anyone. So that's obviously something that has to be weighed

52
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,880
against what else could be done with an opportunity cost. But the other thing you have to keep in

53
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,680
mind is their prescription for use was two 20 minute sessions a day, much along the lines of

54
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,600
like transcendental meditation, which is similar, but has much better data. And that's where I kind

55
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,880
of thought, well, there's a problem because for most people who are super busy, 40 minutes a day

56
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:01,920
for very questionable benefit didn't make a lot of sense. If it came at the expense of other things

57
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,600
that undoubtedly had benefit, such as could that be 40 minutes a day of actual meditation? Could

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,280
that be 40 additional minutes a day of sleep? Could that be 40 minutes a day of exercise? All things

59
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,880
that I would point to as having far greater evidence in favor of. So I think anytime you're

60
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,760
thinking about doing something, you want to kind of go through that. And those are especially

61
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:36,400
important questions to be asking when the answer is not readily apparent from RCTs that have

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:45,640
generally already answered one and two. Now remember, many RCTs are the easiest RCTs to do

63
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,640
or the ones that are based on pharmacology. And they're generally addressing one and two,

64
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,360
but they're not really addressing three because there really isn't much of an opportunity cost

65
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,280
of taking a pill outside of the economic cost, but the time cost of it is relatively low. Of

66
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,720
course, when it comes to RCTs that are more intervention based, such as exercise, yes,

67
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,760
you want to be able to think about this. But as you look to something like CGM in the case

68
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,400
of non-diabetics, this framework to me is very helpful because at this time we don't have great

69
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,880
RCTs to point to that say in people who are not yet diabetic, there is a benefit to using CGM.

70
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,680
So again, as you go through that, you ask yourself the question, what is the risk of harm? And again,

71
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:40,400
when we talk about CGM specifically, I think the risk of harm is very low. If we were going to

72
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,720
sort of speculate what could be harmful about it, well, I think the most obvious thing that comes to

73
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,080
my mind is anxiety that it can stoke, right? It can create obsession in someone. And certainly I

74
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,400
can speak to that personally. I don't think personally I've found it harmful, but I could

75
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,320
absolutely understand it. And I frankly think we have some patients in whom I've never recommended

76
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,040
it. So for example, we have some patients who have a history of eating disorders. These are

77
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,120
patients I would not in any way, shape or form advocate the use of CGM. I think it's yet another

78
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:22,600
tool that can create a negative cycle around obsession. Is there any chance of it doing good?

79
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,880
Well, I mean, I think I've already made the case for that. I think there's ample chance for it

80
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,520
doing good on two fronts, right? The first front is what I call insight-based good, which is

81
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,640
teaching you what your carbohydrate tolerance is. That's what the tool is for. And then secondly,

82
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,400
what I would call behavioral good or behavior modification, which is effectively a strapped

83
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,680
on version of the Hawthorne effect. So when you're wearing a CGM, you're basically utilizing a tool

84
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,120
that is monitoring you. And there is no shortage of data to support the idea that when people are

85
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,720
asked to monitor food intake, they make changes in the right direction. So if I said to you, Bob,

86
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,320
I want you to record everything you eat for the next month and track it in a food diary,

87
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,040
are you going to make better food choices than you are making now? And the answer is unequivocally

88
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,800
yes. You are going to do that. Which is also, not to pile on, I guess this is the first time

89
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm mentioning observational epidemiology so far, at least for this episode, but that's one of the

90
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,440
challenges right there with food frequency questionnaires is that they start asking them

91
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,800
to ask them what foods they're eating or they ask them what foods they ate. And oftentimes,

92
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,240
just that by asking, they're changing their behavior. And so you're not really getting

93
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,600
an accurate representation of what they ate previously.

94
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,560
Right. So that's a problem that plagues epidemiology, but you can use that to your

95
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,200
advantage, right? And we do that stuff clinically, right? This is how you create accountability for

96
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,400
patients. You say, look, we're going to check in once a day and I just want you to tell me what

97
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,800
you ate. And even if you provide no other instruction, which is, oh, I want you to have

98
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,560
this many grams of protein and this many grams of carbs and this many grams of fat. No, no, even if

99
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,320
you don't go to that level, if you just say, I just want you to tell me what you ate, that level of

100
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,040
accountability immediately changes a person's behavior. And that's an example of how you can

101
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:35,800
use that to your benefit. So is that sort of a, I guess I'll get to the third point, which is

102
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,040
opportunity costs. So what's the opportunity cost of one of these devices? Well, I think hands down

103
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,800
the biggest opportunity cost is the economic cost. These things are not cheap. And if you are not

104
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,840
diabetic, you are not going to have your insurance company cover one of these devices. So there are

105
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,640
no shortage of companies out there that are repurposing and repackaging CGM. So there are

106
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:06,080
really three companies that make CGM's in the clinical grade. So there's Medtronic, Abbott and

107
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,520
Dexcom. And again, by way of full disclosure, I consult with Dexcom, not on their CGM business,

108
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,280
but actually on a part of their business that deals with other analytes. So other things that

109
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,680
you could measure. So actually don't really interact much on the CGM side. But those three

110
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,520
companies make CGM's. And then there are lots of companies like Levels and Super Sapiens that

111
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:38,200
people have heard of who are plugging in those CGM's into their apps to help users with their

112
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:45,800
goals, be it weight loss or otherwise. Well, they're not cheap. I'm trying to remember what

113
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,760
the cost is the monthly. I mean, I feel like the daily cost of CGM is about 10 bucks. And there's

114
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,000
probably cheaper ways to get it if you're buying your CGM on eBay or if it's a little bit expired,

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,960
but directionally speaking, it's about a $10 a day habit. And that adds up, right? Call it

116
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,720
$3,500 a year. That's a huge expense, assuming you need it every minute of every day. And I don't

117
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,840
think you do. I think you can gain a lot of insight using these things periodically. I don't

118
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,240
think this is something you need to be tethered to every minute of every day. There are some people

119
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,840
like me who enjoy that, not going to lie. I've been wearing CGM for almost six years. It never

120
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:32,000
gets old to me. I continue to find insights that just provide value. And more than anything else,

121
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,520
it's really the behavioral tool. And that might make me a mental midget. I might just be a guy

122
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,240
that is such a simple plebe that having that little CGM on my arm is what keeps me away from

123
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,040
the ice cream in the freezer and the cookies in the pantry. But if you saw my freezer and you saw

124
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,600
my pantry, you would certainly understand why I stand to benefit from using CGM.

125
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,920
Well, I think you mentioned this in the article or the Sunday post about how the percentages change

126
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,560
with when you talk about how much insight you're getting, say, in the first 30 days versus long

127
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,680
term, whether it's a motivational or behavioral tool and how those can shift. But I also want

128
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,240
to mention that when I was at UVM, I was getting my undergrad and I was studying nutrition that,

129
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,480
to your point about ice cream in the freezer, I remember for one of our courses that we were

130
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,480
taking, we started doing a food log or food diary. And I remember at the time I was eating,

131
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,200
I don't know why I got into this, but actually you probably will know why. I was eating a pint

132
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,280
of Ben and Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough just religiously. Like I would just-

133
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,080
Is a pint the one that's this big? Like the little one? Is that a pint?

134
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah, that's the 16 answer. Yeah. But I think that's the only thing that Ben and Jerry's comes in.

135
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
Okay. And you were eating one of those a day?

136
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,000
I was eating one of those a day after dinner and it was just like a, yeah, whatever kind of habit.

137
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,160
Then I was doing the food log and I had to keep a food log. And that's how I kicked that,

138
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,880
if you want to call it a habit, that's how I kicked the Ben and Jerry's habit. I said,

139
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
okay, I'm going to have to write for the, I think it's two days during the week and one

140
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,720
day during the weekend that I had to do it. And that's typically what they do for food diaries.

141
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,480
And you just log everything you eat, real time, over 24 hours for like a Monday and a Thursday

142
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,560
and a Saturday. And I remember I kicked that habit, but it reminds me of the stuff that

143
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,000
some of these things are behavioral tools may be in disguise. But I think you mentioned something

144
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,240
like 90, 10. Yeah, yeah. And that's sort of what I tell patients. Because look, a lot of our patients

145
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,920
are like, Hey, Peter, what do you think? I mean, do you think I should do this? And my answer for

146
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,480
most of them is, yeah, I think you should. I think everybody deserves a three month trial of CGM,

147
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,040
again, notwithstanding a handful of patients who I think have contraindications. And I typically

148
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,960
say, look, it's going to start out as about 90, 10, 90% of this is going to be insight. Like you're

149
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:59,040
going to be going, holy cow, I can't believe, fill in the blank. And only 10% of it is going to be

150
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,760
changing your behavior through this Hawthorne effect. I said, by the end of that 90 days,

151
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:11,360
that's going to flip. Again, it depends on how much insight you look to extract. But directionally,

152
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,840
within about three months, you're going to be like, you know what, I've sort of figured out the

153
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,960
effect of grapes. And the difference between like, you know, a grapefruit and a banana, like I've

154
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,320
kind of got that dialed. And I've also figured out that, you know, I can eat a ton of carbs after I

155
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,920
work out. But if I eat a ton of carbs before bed, totally different effect on my blood glucose

156
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:42,960
and overnight in the morning. But the shift is you start to gamify it a little bit. So yeah,

157
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,840
again, I guess that's sort of what I would say on my framework for how to think about these things.

158
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,760
Okay. So the related questions to CGM, I've got actually just mentioned grapes. So this person

159
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,080
says my glucose spikes when I eat some fruits, but not others. Do you know why this happens? And

160
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,000
does it mean that I should avoid fruits that spike my glucose? Thank you for listening to today's
