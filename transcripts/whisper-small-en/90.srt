00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,640
today's episode. I guess this week is Ryan Holiday. Ryan is the bestselling author of many

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,840
books, including Obstacle is the Way, Ego is the Enemy. His first book, Trust Me, I'm Lying,

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,560
which basically predicted the rise of fake news, The Conspiracy, and a number of other books about

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
marketing, culture, the human condition. His most recent book, Stillness is the Key, came out

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,000
recently. And while we talk about it quite a bit, it's actually not even the focus of our discussion.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,120
Instead, I think we talk more broadly about Ryan's influence, his work, the influence that

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,640
stoic philosophy has had in his thinking. And obviously, as it permeates into this book,

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,960
we talk about anger, we talk about just a number of things that I think factor into the way I try

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,960
to think about longevity more broadly than just living longer, but also this idea of suffering

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,880
less. And if there's anything I've learned from Ryan, and I've learned a lot from Ryan, because,

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,960
as I mentioned in the podcast, and I'll say it again, now, his daily newsletter, The Daily Stoic,

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
is one of the most important things that I look for in my inbox every morning. Being able to kind

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,360
of go into a little bit more detail on that, for me, was great. And I've been wanting to talk with

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,480
Ryan for probably about a year, and maybe six months ago, when we sort of realized, well,

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,520
the book was going to be coming out, we decided this would be as good a time as any to do so.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,960
The book is fantastic. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Ryan Holiday.

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,880
Ryan, thanks so much for making time and for coming out here today.

26
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,480
Of course.

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,520
Like I was saying to you a minute ago, I'm kind of bummed I didn't get to come to the farm.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Yeah. So the problem with the farm is it's very wonderful, except we've got like a weird animal

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,800
balance going right now. So it's like, what will happen is like a cow will come, and then the dogs

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,040
will bark, and then that will make another bark, dog bark. And then it can be this whole cycle that

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,720
takes many minutes to settle back down. So it's great for writing. It's great for learning. It's

32
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,400
not great for podcasts or interviews of any kind. Also, the internet's no good. Well, I guess we're

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,160
not doing this live to anything, but that's the other big problem.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,040
Talk to me about the joy of having lousy internet.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,440
Yeah, it's great. Weirdly, the crappier it is, the more expensive it is. Like I have fiber at my

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,040
place in town and it's like 50 bucks a month for the fastest internet you can possibly imagine.

37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:16,080
And then in the country, it's like 150 or 200 bucks a month for like barely Netflix streamable

38
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
speeds. And it goes out, you know, if it rains or it goes out all the time. But it's nice because

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,920
that's not what you're there for. And we have said this before, but we have like T-Mobile,

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,480
and it works great in Austin for cell phones. But out there, it sucks. And AT&T and Sprint both work

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,120
pretty good. But we purposely haven't switched just because you get less phone calls. Like if I have

42
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,600
it at the house, like because you pick it up off the Wi Fi, but if you walk too far from the house,

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,640
you basically lose cell service, which is good. 99.9% of the time, I'm sure there will be some

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,960
time when I cut off my leg with a chainsaw and I desperately need to call for help and I can't.

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,280
But otherwise, it creates a sort of an artificial silence, which is great.

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah, it's hard to believe that 20 years ago, the maybe a bit longer, but but directionally 20

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,520
years ago, the idea that we would have had cell phones with us 24 seven seemed kind of foreign,

48
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,800
certainly 30 years ago, completely a foreign idea. So from a relative, you know, standpoint

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,920
of our existence on this planet, this notion of being tethered to that type of device is

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,040
basically unbeknownst to our DNA. Yeah, or 20, 30 years ago, maybe you would have a cell phone,

51
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,760
but you weren't getting called on it all the time. So it was like, like, I remember when I got my

52
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,600
first, I got a Blackberry, when I got my first job in Hollywood. And it was great because now

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
I didn't feel like I had to rush home because there might be emails waiting for me. It gave

54
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,800
me some more freedom. And then increasingly, that freedom turned into now I all you know,

55
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,920
you know what I mean? Like, oh, yeah. So and I think about that with Twitter, I remember when

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,080
Twitter first came out and Facebook first came out. And all these things when I was using them

57
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,800
on the desktop, they were wonderful. But then when I was carrying them around in my pocket,

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,600
and I could always access them, they're always there. That's when it became much worse. So I

59
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,440
think we're trying to figure out how do we like just suddenly we want these things to go away.

60
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,480
Like when I hear someone they're like, I don't even have a smartphone, I go, well, what if you

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,480
get lost? Like how to use directions? You know, there's a lot of benefits to it. But how can you

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,720
how do we find a way just to turn back the clock a little bit? Because it was like, we almost had

63
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,360
the right amount. And now we have too much. That's right. Yeah, it's a min max problem that

64
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,480
just missed its optimization point, I think, at least if you were optimizing for our lack of

65
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,760
misery. Yeah, yes. We still have more to gain on the max if the objective is, you know, making

66
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,000
money for the companies and producers like that. Now, you know, I read something that you

67
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
wrote, and I got it said, you know, I've been following you for so long, Ryan, I've read so

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,440
much of your stuff that, at this point, I can no longer remember. Was this in a daily stoic one day?

69
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240
Was this in this newsletter? Was this in this book? So I apologize in advance that I'm not even

70
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,560
going to try to reference for the for the listener where this came up. But you talked about

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,760
the sort of harsh realities of living on a farm. And we don't live on a farm. But you know, we've

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,240
got our chickens, we've got our garden, we've got all that kind of stuff. And I remember the first

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,200
time one of our chickens got killed by what turned out to be a bobcat at the time we took it took me

74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,680
a while to figure out if I assumed it was a raccoon or a coyote. Man, it was super upsetting.

75
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,520
And more upsetting than you'd think you'd be upset over a chicken, right? Like you're like,

76
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,480
come on, they're chickens. They're, you know, how can you, you know, it's not like it's one of your

77
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,120
kids or something. Someone asked me, not that long ago, they were like, what is the strangest

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,880
or most surprising thing about a farm? And I was like, there's a lot of death, like just overall,

79
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,920
a lot of death. Chickens die, chickens are, I weirdly, I think chickens are the hardest animal

80
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,200
to have because they're the most defenseless and evolutionarily, like the most pointless.

81
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,600
And pretty much everything is a predator to chickens, like including other chickens.

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,640
We had chickens when we were more on the east side here in Austin. And I remember I met my

83
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,520
neighbor because I had to go over and say, hey, a raccoon grabs one of my chickens,

84
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,480
ripped its head off, and then left its carcass on your roof. You know, I need to go get this,

85
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,440
right? So it just familiarizes you with death in a way that I think human beings used to be a lot

86
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,680
more familiar with because like, your grandparents would die in your house, you know, or your wife

87
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,280
would die of childbirth in your house, or you would die being killed by Native Americans in your house,

88
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,600
you know, like, like, we were much more familiar with death, life was more brutal and violent,

89
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,960
but it was also more present, you know, when we first got our farm, we bought this goose and we

90
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
had this goose, it was super sweet and nice, it would follow you everywhere we played with it.

91
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,000
And I remember I was sitting in my office watching it and I watched it get attacked by

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,200
something in our lake, either a snake or I think maybe a snapping turtle or something in it. So

93
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,200
waddled back up onto the thing and it was like gutted. And we, you know, we hadn't lived that long.

94
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,600
And so we rushed to an emergency vet, we paid like $300 to get this goose, you know, that cost,

95
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,000
you know, eight bucks or whatever, that had no purpose for the farm whatsoever. But this is

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,800
what you do with pets. And so we had it all stitched up. And then, and then we had some other

97
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,720
goose, or geese, I guess, but nurse it back to health. And then, you know, a couple months later,

98
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,240
like a dog killed it, someone, one of the neighbor's dogs just like that gone. You're like, okay, one,

99
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,400
that was pretty ridiculous that we paid $300 to have this thing stitched back up. But I thought

100
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,360
it was also interesting, the other geese, like they didn't even care, like, like it was just like,

101
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,440
we're, what is it, a gaggle, we're a gaggle, and there were five of us, and now there's four of us.

102
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,760
Do you know what I mean? Like, it wasn't this like elaborate morning thing.

103
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,240
Well, my daughter asked about this, right after, because all the, all our chickens have names.

104
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,800
And I forget the first one that bit the dust, but we've lost a couple of them. But whatever the

105
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,040
first one was, I think it was GoGo was the first one. And I mean, and it was really sort of tender

106
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,440
to watch this, but you could tell like she was devastated, but she was also very sad for the

107
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,680
other ones. She was like, well, what do you think Sarah and Ginger and so and so think? Like, do you

108
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,720
think they're afraid at night now? And I was like, I mean, those are great questions, sweetie. I don't

109
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,720
know, but I don't think their brains are the same as ours. I'm not, I don't know, you know?

110
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,720
No, that's what's interesting. It's like, well, they're probably are afraid at night, but they've

111
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,280
always been afraid at night. That's that's why it's no fun to be a chicken. There's a D.H. Lawrence

112
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,280
poem where he says, you know, like, I've never seen an animal feeling sorry for itself. A bird

113
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,840
will drop dead of the cold before it feels sorry for itself or something like that. That's sort of

114
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,960
one of the lessons I've taken from living in a farm is that like, the animals are much more

115
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:58,880
present and focused, and not worried the way that humans are worried. And, and ironically,

116
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,600
they have way more to be worried about. Like, a mountain lion isn't going to come and attack me.

117
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,400
But if I'm a goat, like, there's a pretty reasonable chance that could happen. So

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,640
you can take some interesting lessons from it for sure. What do you think that that's robbed us of?

119
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,200
What do you think our sterile environment of not having the concerns you've described? Now,

120
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
that's not true, of course, for our species across the whole. There are plenty of interviewed, an

121
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,520
amazing doctor who is the only doctor that serves a million people in South Sudan, and they get

122
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,560
bombed by their government every couple of weeks or months. And every time it happens, people are

123
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,680
getting killed and he has to, you know, put bodies back together. But if you're living here in the

124
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,200
United States, for the most part, you've become insulated from that. There's lots of good that

125
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,560
has come from that. What do you think is the most negative aspect of that? You begin to assume that

126
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,040
you have unlimited amounts of time or that you're in control of your existence, right? So

127
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,920
you look at the actuary tables and it's like, oh, we're living longer on average, but we forget that

128
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,080
we're individuals, right? So the average means nothing to you, right? And even if it did, even

129
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,480
if you were given the genetics and you've taken care of yourself in such a way that you have the

130
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,640
chance, you know, you're likely to, let's say like, it's all preordained in the biological sense that

131
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,840
I'm going to be 78, you're going to be 112 or whatever it is. But like, I appreciate your

132
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,320
confidence. Of course, I could still get hit by a bus, a war could break out tomorrow, I could,

133
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,280
you know, I could still have an allergic reaction to something. So, so I think we have this sense of

134
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,680
unlimited time that we take from it. And we just believe we're much more in control of our

135
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,520
existences than we already are. So there's like a form of arrogance there. That's the biggest one.

136
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,560
You know, Seneca talks a lot about how we're really tight fisted over the things that don't

137
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,280
matter, which would be like money, property stuff, things you can get more of, and then time, we're

138
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,360
the most generous with. And I think that is rooted in the sense that all we think about are old

139
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,960
people, we don't even think about the people that died because they're not around. So you just assume,

140
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,880
like, I even think about this with like war, I think when we think about wars, we don't think

141
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,080
about the people we like, my grandfather fought in World War Two. So when I think about World War

142
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,400
Two, I think about it being really bad and horrible, but you come out the other side, right? I don't

143
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,320
think about the people who got shot before the boats, but as soon as they put down the door on

144
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,280
the landing craft, I don't think about that guy. And so there's this weird survivorship bias that

145
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,520
I think our lack of familiarity with death exposes us to. And that's why we're so shocked when it does

146
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,360
happen. Do you think it's even deeper than that, which is in addition to everything you've said,

147
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,360
let's assume that not only do you have the biologic track to get you to 78, but let's assume you are

148
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,760
guaranteed to get to 78. So somehow we've built a cocoon around you that no bus can hit you,

149
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,880
no peanut can get lodged in your throat or give you an allergy.

150
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:12,160
Isn't the other issue potentially that we are not in the moment that we're in anyway because we have

151
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,200
this view of infinite time? And so in other words, there's sort of a lack of quality in our life beyond

152
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,600
just quantity. Is that possible? Yeah, so there's two really good insights from the Stokes I love.

153
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,760
So one, Marcus Rioska is like, are you afraid of death because you won't be able to do this anymore?

154
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,720
He's like, you should ask yourself that question all the time. So much, we want to live for everyone,

155
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,120
we don't want to think about death, we don't want anything bad to happen, but we don't really

156
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,680
actually judge the quality of the existence that we have very much. I think there's a lot of people

157
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,200
who are alive, who are basically dead anyway, right? They're sleepwalking through life. So I think

158
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,240
that's one part of it. The other interesting way, and let's say, because I do think a lot of people

159
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,160
go through, they go, oh, the average person is 78, like lives to be 78 or whatever. That's when,

160
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,240
so they go like, okay, I'll start thinking about death at 60, right? They're like, I'm so far from

161
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,880
that. It's way off in the future. I'm not going to think about that. Just like when you're in

162
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,400
elementary school, you're not thinking about graduating from college. You're like, I got to

163
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,240
get through all this other crap first. The big flip for me, Seneca talks about we think that death

164
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,560
is something that lays off in the future. But actually death is something that's happening

165
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,520
right now. He was saying, so you don't think about it. In my case, I'm going to live to be 78. So that

166
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,600
means I have 40 years left. It should think about it instead that I've already died 30 odd years,

167
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,920
right? So he's like, the time that he's like, most of our time already belongs to death, the time that

168
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:50,160
has passed is dead. And I think that's a much more active, empowering, adaptive way to think about it.

169
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,000
It's like, oh, I'm dying all the time. And I'm every second that passes, you don't get back.

170
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,200
And then that allows you to decide how you're going to spend that time, or at least think about

171
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:08,080
that you're spending it. You were given a finite amount of time. Are you going to spend it on

172
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,760
whatever you're going to spend it on? And then I think the other part where this gets tricky is

173
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,400
people go, I have to do this, I have to do that, or this happens, this happens, totally agree. But

174
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,600
are you going to spend time on top of that being mad that that happened, or resenting that it

175
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,960
happened that way, or regretting that it so so people go, Oh, I spent this, you know, I'm mad

176
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,520
that I just spent an hour unnecessarily in traffic. Sure. But now you're spending an extra minute and

177
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,560
a half complaining about it. And which part of that do you control? So I think the death conversation

178
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,320
gives you some perspective and some urgency and I think some prioritization and perspective on

179
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,120
day to day reality that's really valuable. Now, I suspect the number of people listening here are

180
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,560
not going to be as familiar with stoic philosophy as you are probably very few are. But at least

181
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,640
I've had the luxury of I read your newsletter every single day or Monday through Friday, and

182
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,840
then there's a weekend summary, the daily stoic I can't I can't plug it enough. So thank you very

183
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,880
much for I mean, it literally is the single most important thing I subscribe to an email. So thank

184
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,320
you. Can we give people a little bit of stoic 101 here? Can we explain who Marcus Aurelius was,

185
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,040
who Seneca was, who Nero was at least enough to give people a context of the world in which these

186
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,840
people came from, how it shaped a philosophical field or bent? And more importantly, why should

187
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,040
anyone care about this today? Yeah. So it comes to be an Athens, the founder of stoicism is this

188
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,400
guy named Zeno. He was a Greek merchant who sort of suffers this terrible shipwreck, he loses

189
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,200
everything. And he gets exposed to philosophy, probably like a lot of people expected that

190
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,440
philosophy was abstract, that was academic was not things you use in real life. And he gets

191
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,400
introduced to Socrates and cynicism and ends up becoming instead a student of his own school,

192
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:58,560
which becomes stoicism. And then stoicism worms its way from these sort of interesting Greek figures

193
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,240
into Rome as Rome takes over the world. And so this is Cicero and Julius Caesar and Cato,

194
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:14,080
it sort of follows the rise of the Roman Empire, the fall of the Roman Republic. And then it's so

195
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,320
integral into Roman life that it becomes not just philosophy of ordinary people and senators even,

196
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,320
but you know, Marcus Aurelius is becomes the emperor of Rome. And he's this avid student of

197
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:33,360
philosophy. So it's fascinating, basically, in two generations, so Epictetus is this former slave,

198
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,640
philosophy is banned from Rome. So he's like sort of sent into exile. But this slave is writing

199
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,120
about philosophy writing about how to achieve freedom when you're literally in chains,

200
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,560
all of this. And then a generation later, Marcus Aurelius, the most powerful man in the world is a

201
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,280
student of the same philosophy. So it's this really sort of open ended flexible philosophy

202
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,720
for people in the real world doing real things, and sort of built around, depending on who I'm

203
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
explaining to, I sort of go one of two tracks, I'll do both. So that I would say the sort of

204
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,680
central precept of stoicism is basically this idea that we don't control the world around us,

205
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,800
but we control how we respond. That's like, that's the main if I had to give you one thing,

206
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,640
and just be like, you don't control other people, you control yourself, you don't control what

207
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
happens, you control your reactions. So that's like the core of it. If I was going to get a

208
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,200
little bit more nuanced, I'd say sort of stoicism is built around for virtues. And the virtuous life

209
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,840
is what they're aiming towards. And today, when we hear virtue, we think like, purity, chastity,

210
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,560
some sort of religious component to the stoics, the four virtues were courage, justice, temperance,

211
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:51,440
some moderation, and then in wisdom. So it's sort of truth, self control, doing the right thing,

212
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,720
having the stones to stand up for those things, right? Then that's sort of the, that to me is the

213
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,680
essence of this philosophy. Tim Ferriss sort of refers to as an operating system, I think that's

214
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,480
an interesting way to do it, although that might be a bit reductive. I think it's more of a way of

215
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,720
life than an operating system. We've learned a lot from the stoics. And I always find, I think one of

216
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
the things I appreciate about the way you write about them is they're still humans and they still

217
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,720
make mistakes. I mean, you, I think a couple of days ago, you were talking about, I mean,

218
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,200
Seneca is a great example, right? On the one hand, this remarkable example of stoic philosophy,

219
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,880
and yet in the end, probably a little bit of his desire to be approved by Nero, his desire to be in

220
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,440
his good grace has effectively cost him his life. Well, not just cost him his life, but it may well

221
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,520
have forced him to contradict all the things he believed in. And for people who have no idea.

222
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,960
Yeah, let's tell the story about that transition. Seneca is this fascinating figure in that he's a

223
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,200
Roman senator, he's a philosopher, he's a playwright, he's probably the smartest man in Rome at this

224
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,320
time. And he's sent into exile by an emperor, Claudius, who sort of doesn't like him, he sends

225
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,120
him in exile. And so there Seneca is, he's sort of on this rock in the middle of nowhere. And he's

226
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,440
writing this philosophy and it's sort of like for a philosophy all about adversity and perseverance,

227
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,240
it's like this sort of perfect opportunity. And then he gets this call or, you know, a letter,

228
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm sure it was a messenger, but he basically gets summoned back to Rome. They said, look,

229
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:28,080
you can come back, but your job is you have to be the tutor to this, this young boy. And that young

230
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,960
boy turned out to be Nero. And so Seneca has this complex, like Nero was this very promising student,

231
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,920
but was about to be dictator, essentially, at the same time, you know, just a couple generations

232
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,040
before this, the Stokes were the ones who were fighting to preserve the Roman Republic. And here

233
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,080
is this guy as a sort of emperor's guy behind the throne. And so there's a little contradiction

234
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,760
there. But really, this promising student also has a dark side. It's almost like the plot of

235
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,880
Breaking Bad, right? Like he starts good and towards the end, he's writing speeches that help

236
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,800
Nero justify why he murdered his mother. You know, it gets very dark, very quickly, Seneca becomes

237
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,800
extraordinarily wealthy for his association with Nero. Ultimately, he it's sort of like, you know,

238
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,640
there's some analogies, I think, to the Trump administration, where you're like, I don't like

239
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,280
the guy, but I feel called to serve, how can I mitigate the impulses, but it's, you know, it's a

240
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,160
tough balance, right? And you're suddenly morally compromised in a bunch of ways that if you had

241
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,640
your choice, you wouldn't be, but you also have the choice to leave at any time. And so ultimately,

242
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,920
Seneca decides to leave towards the end. And Nero's like, No, you don't get to leave, I decide when

243
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,400
you leave. And so he it's sort of this, he basically is caught up in this thing you can't get out of,

244
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,040
he ultimately sort of goes into a second exile. But he knows he traded his life for whatever he

245
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:02,160
got, you know, and at a certain eventually, you know, sort of Nero senses his goons to call in

246
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,480
the chit. And that's the end of Seneca. And it's interesting, because Seneca, of course, is ordered

247
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,920
to kill himself rather than being killed, which was the way that the time you can't help but wonder

248
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,440
what would Seneca go back and tell himself on the day that he was called to come and be the tutor

249
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,240
for this boy knowing what he knew at the end of his life? Yeah, it's endlessly complicated and

250
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,480
complex, because maybe he said yes, because he thought he could prevent this from happening.

251
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,920
Or maybe he thought, like I was again, I'm not being political, I think we just want to look

252
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,400
at analogies. But like, John Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff just gave these interesting

253
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,080
comments where he was like, look, when I left, I told Trump, like, you're going to be in trouble,

254
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,080
because there are other people who are not going to be able to tell you no the way that I can tell

255
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,120
you no. And it's going to be worse. He's like, you'll be impeached if I leave. And, you know,

256
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,920
he ended up leaving or Trump had him leave. But I think what Seneca probably told himself is like,

257
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,240
I don't think he was in any denial about who Nero was, right? But I think he told himself,

258
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,880
who will do a better job than me. It's interesting. It's a slippery slope.

259
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,200
It's very complicated. It begs broader questions, right? Which is what are our obligations? Do we

260
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
have a greater obligation to our own principles and our own personal beliefs? Do we have a greater

261
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,560
obligation to society to maximize the impact we can have on others? Again, through the lens you

262
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,280
just described, you could argue that Seneca did the best he could have, which was if, I mean,

263
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,720
Nero was obviously a complete dictator, were lives saved as a result of Seneca's association

264
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,240
with him. Yeah. And there's another few Stoics. He's not the only one. There's other Stoics who

265
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,400
did actively conspire to assassinate Nero, right? Which is ultimately what Nero accused Seneca of,

266
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,480
right? Yeah. This is the pretext that he uses. And I would say, you sort of go back and forth

267
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,400
on the evidence. The evidence is not conclusive that he did. In some ways it would be redeeming

268
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,280
if he had, but I'm actually writing about this right now for a set of biographies I'm doing, but

269
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,880
you only have to go back a generation or two with Julius Caesar to find that it's never as clear cut

270
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,360
as you think, right? Like Cato is the sort of Stoic philosopher resistance leader at the time.

271
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:24,240
He was so led by his principles that one read on it is that he drives Caesar to do what he did. Like

272
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,280
like Cato's inability to compromise his insistence on principle and perfect solutions

273
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,760
essentially grind the Roman political machine to a halt. And there's all like, there's this

274
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,160
interesting story where so Pompey returns from his conquests. This is before Julius Caesar and Pompey

275
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:51,360
and the lepidus have joined together in the triumvirate. But what happens is Pompey seeing Cato,

276
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,840
largely agreeing with Cato, says, well, we should come together. And in the way that one did back

277
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,800
then, he proposed that he would marry Cato's nieces or one of Cato's nieces. And Cato says, you know,

278
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,800
how dare you try to bribe me? He's like, I will not have my politics corrupted through sort of female

279
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,160
influence. What do you mean? I'm not going to create this alliance. So Pompey is surprised by this.

280
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,120
But he looks at his options, and he ends up aligning with Julius Caesar instead. And even at the time,

281
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,520
the historians noted this, they were like, because of his purity, his inability to sort of make things

282
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:37,360
work in a less than perfect scenario. Cato ends up bringing about exactly the thing that he was

283
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,920
trying to prevent, right? He instead of allying with the lesser of two evils, the two evils teamed

284
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,440
up and destroyed the thing that ultimately Cato gives his life for. And what I think is really

285
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:57,200
interesting is that then, not long after, another sort of inspired stoic character takes up to

286
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,280
assassinate Julius Caesar, thinking that this will be the end of it. And it's not the end of it,

287
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,960
it sends Rome into a second civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people die, and more

288
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:17,120
people are destroyed, and ultimately ensures that another emperor takes Caesar's place. So I think

289
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,520
one of the things you end up taking as you study philosophy and history,

290
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,600
it's just some humility about how complex these things are, and how rarely they are as black and

291
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,680
white as they seem. And that I think what stoicism is really about is a sort of a personal code

292
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,320
that lets you try to figure out what you should do in your individual situations and not be so

293
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,480
concerned about what other people did, or why, or how, or whether they were perfect. I wasn't even

294
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
planning to ask you about this because there's so many things I want to ask you about, but I can't

295
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,120
resist a slight detour in going down sort of your past and how you got here. I mean, you grew up in

296
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,600
Sacramento, you go to college in LA. I remember the first time I heard about you was somehow after

297
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,320
your time at American Apparel and how you'd done all this amazing stuff there. Can you pick up the

298
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,800
story there? Like what are you doing? And how at this point in time have you already acquired

299
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,480
a taste for stoic philosophy? Yeah, I think I got introduced to philosophy early on in college.

300
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,520
I'd read Epictetus, I read Marcus Aurelius. So sort of interested in it. It was definitely life

301
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,480
changing for me when I was exposed to it, but how much you're really getting at that age, you know,

302
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,280
it's hard to tell. So this is a detour from the conversation was a detour in my life. I basically

303
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,400
went and I was a research assistant for a really great writer. I did marketing for a couple other

304
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,120
writers. And then through sort of all those experiences somehow ended up as the director

305
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,080
of marketing in American Apparel, which was a, you know, a crazy dysfunctional, chaotic, but ultimately

306
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,880
really fascinating place to work for about six or seven years. What year did you start there? Oh,

307
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,640
seven, maybe oh, eight, something like that. So the company was already, you know, doing hundreds

308
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,320
of millions of dollars in sales, but was sort of still early on in what its next phase was,

309
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,720
which was as a retailer and a publicly traded company. And you know, it turns out a lot of

310
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,400
the same dynamics that have always been true and sort of upstart, ascendant sort of movements or

311
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,400
businesses. It was just a lot of money, a lot of temptations, a lot of conflict, a lot of politics,

312
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,920
a lot of the human condition out on display. But there was also just, it was a really interesting

313
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,920
creative learning opportunity. And then I, you know, I got to do all sorts of cool stuff from

314
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,320
a marketing perspective that got seen by millions and millions of people. And so I sort of learned

315
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,600
how this might be how you write stuff, but this is where the rubber meets the road where you sell it

316
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:47,600
to people. What was the most or set of insights that surprised you most as you made that transition?

317
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,160
I mean, obviously, you're an excellent writer, but I have no delusions that people are born

318
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,720
excellent writers. You've worked very hard at your craft. But how did you make that transition

319
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,960
from being able to write to being able to market? Because they're not really one in the same.

320
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,200
No, I mean, they're both in the ideas business, but they're very different ways of communicating

321
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,280
ideas. One of the things Dove was fond of talking about that I liked and it's from

322
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,560
Dove was the CEO. Yeah, this is actually from Robert Greene who wrote the 40 Laws of Power

323
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,320
and was on the board of directors and how I ended up working there. But there's a thing in the 40

324
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,680
Laws of Power. He says, never appeal to mercy or gratitude, always appeal to self-interest.

325
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,720
His premise was like, look, I want to build a company that's ethical. I want to build a company

326
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,360
that pays its workers fairly, that doesn't destroy the environment. But he's like, no one will buy

327
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,040
clothes for those reasons. They ultimately buy clothes because they look good in them or they

328
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,160
feel comfortable in them or they're the right price or whatever. And that it's this sort of tension

329
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,360
between this sort of pure expression and the realities of the market. And I think

330
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,640
one of the things I definitely took from that as a writer is like, first off, it's not just what you

331
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,160
want to say, it's where that overlaps with the market. The perfect book idea is like what you

332
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,160
can't stop thinking about and what people can't stop saying they need a book about. When those

333
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,640
overlap, you get something really powerful. But more, it's that you have to figure out where people

334
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,320
are. People are not thinking, I really care about those workers slaving away in sweatshops.

335
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,600
They're thinking, I need a t-shirt for tonight. So you can deliver them a t-shirt that solves

336
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,560
that first problem. But if all you're solving is the first problem, you're not going to be successful.

337
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,280
And so it's funny, people, because of my marketing career, they'll be like, oh, he's like a mercenary

338
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,600
or he's just in this for money or he's in this to get rich. And it's like, dude, of all the things

339
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,360
that I could apply my marketing skills to. It seems kind of preposterous that I would have chosen

340
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,040
an obscure school of ancient philosophy as like where I was going to cash in. So it's more like,

341
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm really interested in this stuff. This is what I find endlessly fascinating. I could nerd out with

342
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,160
you about stoicism all day. We're having dinner tomorrow night, so we're going to do just that.

343
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,200
But it's how can I find a way to channel that passion I have for this obscure,

344
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,880
boring, complicated thing and give it to people who are busy, tired, overwhelmed, don't like books,

345
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,840
don't like big ideas, can't pronounce any of the names. Do you know what I mean? So it's about

346
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:35,040
finding a way to take your idea and delivering it to people who are not interested in your idea.

347
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,000
I see this often. It's like, oh, you know, this is his pop philosophy or, you know, oh, this is,

348
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,480
he's simplifying. Oh, why don't you read the originals? And it's like, I would love for people

349
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,040
to read the originals, but guess what? They're not right. They were not doing it, right? The 1% of

350
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,120
people who are reading the originals. Sure. Don't read my books, right? That's not who I'm writing

351
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,800
these for. I'm trying to reach people who, who wake up in the morning and think philosophy. I

352
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,200
don't have time for that. And I think you learn that if you get out of the artistic side of your

353
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,080
profession a little bit at the outset of that, you explained sort of that Venn diagram of things that

354
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,760
are in your sweet spot, meaning you as the creator, the author are thinking about this constantly.

355
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,120
And if you're not doing that, you probably shouldn't be writing about it. And then secondly,

356
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,440
the market says, I want this. Those things rarely line up. Sometimes it's you're thinking about

357
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,800
this a lot, but you almost have to make a market. You almost have to create something that can be a

358
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,760
bit more timeless. And again, you've either spoken about or written about this idea, which is you

359
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,000
generally try to think about things that have a little bit, I don't want to say they're timeless

360
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,720
because maybe nothing is purely timeless, but they just have a longer tail to them. Was that

361
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,480
a conscious decision or is that some meaning it was that a conscious decision at the outset or is

362
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,400
that something that looking back now nine books into your career, you can say, no, that's actually,

363
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,440
I got lucky in that I was always doing the right thing that was sort of creating content that was

364
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,880
going to be relevant after a year after the book came out. Yeah. In publishing, like there's the

365
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,800
front list and the backlist and all anyone cares about is the front list, even though the backlist

366
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,280
is, it's not only where all the money is, is the only reason the industry can afford to buy front

367
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,480
list titles, right? Because the vast majority of books never end up selling. They buy a celebrity

368
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,200
cookbook for $2 million and it sells 20 copies, right? Or, or the, you know, this big book flops.

369
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,440
The reason this works is that the great Gatsby is selling all these copies and the greatest

370
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,520
selling all these copies in the four hour work week is selling all these copies into Kilimackingburg.

371
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:44,320
You know, it's the backlist, right? And so it was, I mean, it was certainly both convenient,

372
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:52,800
but also cultivated that I write about a philosophy that has endured about 2,500 years of

373
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,840
diverse human experiences. Like I think if you're sitting down and you're writing

374
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,800
something that you just made up the chances of it being relevant 2,500 years from now

375
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,680
are much slimmer. Like, I mean, it can happen. Maybe you're such a genius that you, you've nailed

376
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:16,480
it, but I'm not so convinced I have that ability. So I do think about that. I would say almost every

377
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:24,880
single one of my books is rooted in or inspired or in some way almost a ripoff of some very

378
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,160
brilliant, sometimes obscure, sometimes popular title from the past. So even my,

379
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,880
my first book was this book called Trust Me I'm Lying, which is sort of an expose of how the media

380
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:42,160
works. And it was... Which many people, by the way, have said in retrospect was sort of the canary

381
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,600
in the coal mine talking about what would become fake news and this idea that you sort of called

382
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,360
a shot on that one. Yeah. I mean, I wish subsequent events had proven me terribly wrong. That would

383
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,680
probably be a better world to live in. But yeah, I think I got some things right with that book. But

384
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,520
ironically, that book was as much as I'm talking about blogs and social media and tech and all

385
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,200
these sort of things that were even more new than. My main model for that book was a book that

386
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,960
Upton Sinclair published in 1913 called The Brass Check. And that book sold well when it came out.

387
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,000
It's still in print today. It sold quite well. And so the point is I'm less interested in doing,

388
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,720
although I do want to do things that haven't been done before, I'm still kind of thinking like,

389
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,920
how can I take some risk off the table by modeling it on something that has some proven staying power?

390
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,080
That's a really interesting way to think about it, actually. I never considered that the idea that

391
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,680
you can at least de-risk the market appetite for something. And again, you still have to do a good

392
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,080
job, but that's one fewer risk. Well, you think about Star Wars. Like on the one hand, you can

393
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,560
see Star Wars as this cutting edge sci-fi movie sort of inventing a new genre. It's using all

394
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,560
these expensive technologies. It's breaking, you know, it's introducing like robots and all this

395
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,560
sort of stuff and what it was. Or you can see it as a timeless story based on the hero's journey.

396
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,440
I mean, 40 years later, people are still watching the movie. I'm not sure it's because of the

397
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,880
cutting edge special effects. It's the story. And so I think when you root things in some arc or

398
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,000
story or deeper truth, you are taking some of that risk off the table. I just think that's a strategy

399
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,600
not employed enough. When did you first become aware of this idea that we all tell ourselves a

400
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:35,280
story? Well, I mean, I think narrative is one of the things that makes us human. We've been telling

401
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,680
stories in writing for 5,000 years. We've been telling sort of, we have an oral epic poem

402
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,040
tradition that's probably 10,000 years old. So it goes to the core of who we are. And I go back

403
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,560
and forth. Sometimes I think it's very powerful. Sometimes I think it's very dangerous. I sort of

404
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,560
written about it both ways. But at the end of the day, the core premise of my writing also ripped

405
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,760
off from someone. This is what I got from Robert Greene, which is like, you can tell people facts,

406
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,000
or you can tell them stories that leave them with the conclusions that are the same as the facts

407
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that you would have told them. Right. And so what I decided to do with with obstacle you go and now

408
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,960
still in this was not write a book that tells people what the stoics say, but give people books

409
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:26,080
that illustrate what the stoics said or believed through story. And ironically, this is also often

410
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,960
how the stoics told stories that are, you know, sort of made their points themselves. But it's

411
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,360
just, I think, a far more compelling medium. It's far more memorable, it's far more enjoyable,

412
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,120
and it's less preachy and condescending as well, I think. What do you think is the downside of the

413
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,400
story, the story we tell ourselves? Like, how does, again, you've written about both sides of that,

414
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,400
both ends of that book, what are the negative parts of this? So I think stories are a great

415
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,800
way to learn lessons about other people. Stories are a bad way to think about your own life. So I

416
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,400
just see lots of people who are very clearly believing that they live in a movie or a novel,

417
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,000
you know, and they are going through life as if they are performing for an imaginary audience.

418
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,520
And I think this is a very dangerous, egotistical and often misleading sort of tendency, right? So

419
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:24,560
I think this is honestly why social media has exploded in terms of like, why it's such a

420
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,600
valuable, lucrative, addictive business. It's that people want to, like, we all used to have

421
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,400
an imaginary audience. We thought people cared about us a lot more than they did. And what

422
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,520
Twitter allows you to do or Instagram allows you to do is like actually believe that your life is a

423
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,440
movie. So we get caught up in this sort of performance and this sort of comes at the expense

424
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,200
of actually living in that moment. I want to come back to talking about stillness and being present,

425
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,160
but I know that once we start there, we're not going to leave it. So there are a few other things

426
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,560
that we're talking about first. You alluded to it just briefly at the outside of what you said there,

427
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,360
this idea of having enough. You tell a story, again, I can't even recall where I know it's not in,

428
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,000
well, I shouldn't say that. Again, your worlds are all one to me now. But you tell the story about

429
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,040
Kurt Vonnegut at a party. Yeah, that's in stillness. Is that in stillness? I guess I had such an early

430
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,600
copy of it because the book only actually came out in about a month ago, right? Yeah, exactly a month

431
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,280
ago. But I think I got a copy like six months ago. Maybe that's why I don't realize it. Tell the

432
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,600
story about the party that Kurt Vonnegut was at and the discussion that ensued. So Kurt Vonnegut

433
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,880
was at a party with Joseph Heller. Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22, Kurt Vonnegut wrote Slaughterhouse

434
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,480
Five, two of the writers of the generation. And they're at the party of this billionaire.

435
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,160
And I'm sure you've been at events like this where you're the candy, you're like the status symbol,

436
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,320
like, look who I got to come to my party. I'm never that guy, but I can picture it.

437
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,960
I know that you've been that guy because you're like, why am I here? I have no business being

438
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,600
here. Right. And so they're sort of standing in this enormous mansion and Vonnegut is teasing

439
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,040
Heller and he says, how does it feel to know that he made more money this week than your book will

440
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,760
probably ever make in its life? And Heller said, well, I have something he doesn't have. And Vonnegut

441
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
said, what could that possibly be? And he said, I have enough, you know, I have a sense of what

442
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,560
enough is. And I just, that's a very powerful word. I think a lot of people see enough as the enemy.

443
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:23,280
Right. Like if I have enough, I won't be good at what I do. My lack of satisfaction is what's

444
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,560
propelled me to greatness. And this is certainly true is, I guess with athletes, especially where

445
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,680
it's like, your desire to always improve, to always get better, to never be satisfied with

446
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:42,240
your last performance is what compels you to keep going. And it can be responsible for a lot of

447
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,280
victories. It can also be responsible for why you fail to appreciate or enjoy any of those

448
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,560
victories. So when I talk about the book, when I'm interested in what I'm exploring myself, having,

449
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,880
you know, experienced some success and certainly accomplish more things than I thought I would

450
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,080
relatively early in my life, is this idea of like, and I think this is what Heller meant,

451
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:09,040
can you do what you're doing? Well, you'll get an elite level even from a place of fullness,

452
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,280
or does it have to come from a place of craving? Do you know what I mean? Like, is it?

453
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,080
Yes, very much so.

454
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Does it have to come from the, I'm going to prove them all wrong. I am going to beat anyone that

455
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,640
doubts me. I'm going to earn my father's approval. You know, whatever that motivation is, does it have

456
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:37,280
to be from there that's never good enough? Or can it come from a place of passion and appreciation

457
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,320
and gratitude and you know, what they call the sort of the love of a game? Like, is it possible

458
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,280
to do it the other way? Could you at least have a balance of the two? That's what I think about.

459
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,880
I mean, I have a lot of thoughts on this because it's a topic I've been interested in since I was

460
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,920
a teenager. But what is your take on that now? Do you think those states can coexist? Do you think

461
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:07,440
one can achieve the highest levels without, call it, a certain fire that is coming from a place of

462
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,120
more rather than enough?

463
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,280
Well, you know, it's hard to know because you're only speculating about other people and then

464
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,600
there's, it's sort of awkward to think about it with yourself.

465
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,400
But I suspect you've spoken with a lot of these people as well.

466
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,840
Yeah, yeah. I would say my opinion is probably the minority view, right? Like, I think you can do it

467
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,480
from a place of fullness, but you know, most coaches are like, oh, you got to, the guy's got

468
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,000
to have the hunger. He's got to have the, you know, my goal in my life is to be great at what I do,

469
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,280
but somehow be a normal person. Like that's for whatever reason, that's important to me, not to

470
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,560
not to have some semblance of a normal life, to not be so lopsided, to not be miserable, to actually

471
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,680
like what I'm doing. And, and I would like to think that I'm, I sort of know objectively in one sense,

472
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,640
like I'm performing at an elite level, like there's the results and there's the impact the

473
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,760
work has had and there's the sales and there's the financial success. So I go, oh, it's working,

474
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,680
right? Like you can, but then I also, then sometimes, you know, the doubts come in, you go,

475
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,080
oh, but what have I left on the tape? Like, could I have sold more copies? Could the books have more

476
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,440
impact? Could my speaking fee be higher? What, you know, blah, blah, blah. If maybe I was a little

477
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,760
hungrier. So again, I think these are complicated questions and I don't, I don't pretend to have the

478
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,640
definitive answer, but I do generally think fullness is better than craving and it's more

479
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:36,160
sustainable, right? Like how long can you exist in the, I'm going to shove it all in their faces.

480
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,320
That's what's driving me. How long can you operate on that fuel or does it eventually corrode the

481
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,920
engine? Especially with riding. I think about it as like, uh, I'm not in this to win in the

482
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,160
short term. I'm interested in to do, to do this for a long time. And so you've got to come up with a

483
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,160
sustainable process and a sustainable motivation because maybe it works in football or basketball

484
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,120
because your career, even if it's a great one is like 20 years max, but probably closer to two

485
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,440
years. I don't have a good answer, but I'd be curious to hear what you think. Well, I don't think

486
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,440
my thoughts are nearly as well thought out as yours, frankly, but I, I think the way I look at

487
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,440
it is it all comes down to these optimization problems and what you're optimizing for. So

488
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:25,920
if you're optimizing to have the most trophies or the most dollars or the most, whatever metric

489
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,880
it is by which we measure things. And by the way, those things generally have to be external and

490
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,680
quantifiable for this game to work, right? You have to be able to display it. It can't be ambiguous.

491
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:45,360
Right. And again, lots of things in our life do fit that criteria. If you are playing the pure max

492
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,840
game, so you're looking for the absolute maxima, the local, not versus the local maxima. My view

493
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:59,040
is it's probably difficult to achieve that without being myopically focused on that. But I also think

494
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,840
like when you talk about multivariate calculus, every time you go to a absolute maxima,

495
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,680
you're achieving local minima elsewhere. Or if you're going to be more accurate, you're very

496
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:20,240
likely not achieving local maxima in other areas. So if one of those other areas is some measure

497
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,360
of suffering or the inverse of supper suffering, I just think the likelihood. So again, it's all

498
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:33,360
stochastic, the likelihood you're going to hit an absolute maxima, not the local, the absolute

499
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:40,640
maxima of your quantifiable metric, money, likes, accept it, you know, whatever, trophies, whatever,

500
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,920
and that you could actually hit a local maxima of the inverse of suffering. I think that's

501
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,240
incredibly rare. I just don't see how that would happen. I think that would be, that's like, you

502
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:57,280
know, getting hit by lightning three times in terms of probabilistic. I think more likely if you choose

503
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,560
to select a local maxima around some measure of the inverse of suffering, you probably aren't going

504
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,120
to hit an absolute maxima on those other things. But as we were talking about even before we started

505
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:16,160
the podcast, who cares? Like, what game are we playing? And I just think if I'm only speaking

506
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:23,520
for myself, if I'm not thinking about or speculating on anybody else and only viewing this through the

507
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,640
lens of my own life, I think sometimes we suffer and we don't even know we're suffering. We've been

508
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,760
suffering so long. Yeah, it's like you eat carbs. You grew up not knowing anything about gluten or

509
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,920
carbohydrates. You know, you had a sandwich for lunch, then you had pizza for dinner, and then you

510
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,920
had cereal for breakfast. You cut all that out and you're like, well, I didn't even know I felt like

511
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,960
shit, but I felt like shit every day of my life. I was fascinated, so I wrote a lot about him, and

512
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,280
I'm fascinated with him now, someone like Tiger Woods, where, you know, that's what he said he

513
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,680
was like, I don't play because I love golf. He's like, I play for the hardware. He's like, he didn't

514
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,840
care even care about the money. He's like, I care about the trophies. And he even said this, like,

515
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:06,480
after even after all the shit happened, he said, winning is great, but beating someone is always

516
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,560
better. And there's no question that made him the greatest golfer of all time, maybe the greatest

517
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,520
run in the history of sports. I mean, he was the number one ranked golfer in the world. So the

518
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:23,680
number one ranked person in his sport with a lot of really good people in it for like 252 consecutive

519
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,040
weeks, you're just like, that's unprecedented. And he did it all on his own. It's not like, you know,

520
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,400
Tom Brady also has the benefit of Bill Belichick, right? Like, and an entire team of other people,

521
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,880
he did this all on his own. And yet, as you said, he's not just not achieving good results in other

522
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,520
areas. Those other areas are actually ticking time bombs that when they go off, those charges

523
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,280
take down the entire edifice that he'd spent so much time building and doing. And I don't know him,

524
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,360
I've never met him, I don't really even know anyone that knows him. But I would imagine these

525
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:03,200
last two victories, the US Open, and then the tournament that he just won. From what I can see,

526
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,400
maybe I'm projecting, but like, I bet those victories feel profoundly different. And I bet

527
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,640
they're coming from a different place. Because there's no if all he was motivated by was beating

528
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,360
other people, he would not have survived that 10 year drought. You know, that would have been

529
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:26,720
inhumanly difficult, he must have come to actually like golf in some like to, to love the process of

530
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,280
it in some way. Because why wouldn't he just walk away? I mean, he has unlimited amounts of monies,

531
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,400
you know, he hates the public side of things. So even playing in a tournament that he wins has some

532
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,000
cost to him, right? And yet he does it. I don't know. I also go like, look, you look at some of

533
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,880
these sort of tortured artists and actors, and then you go Tom Hanks looks like he's having a

534
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,360
good time. You know what I mean? And doing great work. So I'd like, I'd like to think that there

535
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:58,240
is some balance where you can be world class at what you do, not be a shitty human being like my

536
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,520
friend Austin Klee on who was an Austin, he said, he calls them art monsters, you know, like the

537
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,000
writer who's been married six times, there was just a baseball player got arrested for beating

538
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,520
the shit out of his daughter. It's like, there's got to be a way you can be world class at what

539
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,440
you do. And you don't have to trade that. And I think the reason for that balance is like,

540
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,960
and this, this is where we get back into the stoics, like Tiger Woods will be remembered

541
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,680
for many, many years after his death, right? Like maybe in 100 years, we'll still be talking about

542
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,800
Tiger Woods. But what good will that do Tiger Woods, right? And that Marcus really goes like

543
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,400
people who long for posthumous fame, forget first off that the people in the future are just as dumb

544
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,040
as the people who are alive right now. And second, you're not going to be around to appreciate it. So

545
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,120
what are you what are you trading now, like happiness now, for the fact that, you know,

546
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,520
Alexandria is still named after Alexander the Great, like doesn't do him any good.

547
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:00,480
I mean, this is why I think stoic philosophy is unbelievable to me not being a person who ever

548
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,480
studied philosophy. So I'm exactly the person that the philosophy snobs hate, right? Because

549
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,200
I just wasn't smart enough to study philosophy, right? I mean, I'd like to make the excuse and

550
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,200
say it was because I was taking all those math and engineering classes. But the reality of it is,

551
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,760
I wasn't smart enough. If I showed up to philosophy classes, I would have done I would

552
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,840
have been a very mediocre student. So now I'm just a poser who gets to go back as an adult and do it.

553
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,600
But to a point you made earlier, I wasn't ready to hear it then. I'd love to believe I could have

554
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,880
been caught sooner, but I don't know if I would have. I think it's very difficult for humans to

555
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,320
change without hitting a local minima. You have to have pain to change. And you know what, even

556
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,720
if that's not true, it's true of me. Even if it's not true broadly, it's absolutely true of Peter

557
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:53,920
Athea. He must hurt to change. This idea that it used to matter to me that I did something

558
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,520
that was going to be bigger than me. You would look at that at the first layer and say, oh,

559
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,040
that's nice. That's altruistic. Like you want to serve something that's larger than you. But I

560
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,400
actually don't think it was altruistic at all. I think it was really this sense of insecurity.

561
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,560
Like I want to do something that will be remembered after I go away. I want to advance

562
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,520
thinking in a way around a discipline of science or medicine or something like that. But as Marcus

563
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,240
Aurelius points out, who cares? You're not going to be there anyway. And furthermore, even though

564
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,200
this is to me the subtext of what he says, what does it cost you while you are alive?

565
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,440
Yes. And I think maybe this is evidence of my point that you can do important meaningful things

566
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,920
and not need to do it from that place of craving, which is what's interesting about Marcus Aurelius

567
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,880
is that we are talking about him right now, 2000 years. So unless he was lying or really didn't

568
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,840
mean what he was saying, and he really did just crave and care about his legacy and surviving

569
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,600
for thousands of years, which it seems like he would have taken more active steps. But somehow,

570
00:51:53,600 --> 00:52:00,080
the journal that he wrote to himself privately for his own self betterment and never wanted to

571
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,880
be published, somehow that that the purity of that experience and the lack of intentionality

572
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:15,120
in it and the true egolessness inside of it is what actually allowed him to create something

573
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,240
that has survived for thousands of years and doing trying to be a good person

574
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,640
as an emperor rather than trying to expand the empire or build enormous buildings in his own

575
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,800
honor, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, somehow managed to create an example or a sort of a different

576
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,320
story that's actually proved more enduring than I'm more people know who Marcus really says the

577
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:44,080
Nero, right? And one of them was trying and one of them wasn't. And so I think that's really interesting.

578
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:50,880
What role do you think ego plays in in this, you know, you've written about this idea that

579
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,120
there are just certain things where the harder you try and the more you want them, the further you

580
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,560
get from them. Yeah, I mean, I make a big distinction. I didn't do it as well. And he goes,

581
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,120
the enemy is I should have in retrospect, but now I'm able to be a bit more explicit about it. But a

582
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:10,080
big distinction between ego and confidence. Confidence is important, right? You got to know

583
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,280
what you're capable of, you got to have some evidence of it, you got to have some knowledge

584
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,200
of strength and weakness. I think the problem with ego is it's not any of that ego comes from some

585
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:31,040
third place, right? And I think at the core of ego is an association of our identity with results

586
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:38,960
or with external things. And so in some senses, it's, it can be helpful in terms of driving external

587
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,680
results. But we see just as often that ego undermines those results once we get them.

588
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,520
Yeah, I think you said that, again, it's a long tail game here, but in the long run, you're

589
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,560
probably coming out below than above. If you're driven exclusively from this place, how would you

590
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:05,200
explain that to the 15 year old version of you? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like historically,

591
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:14,480
it's like, are there any super egotistical people who died with their boots off surrounded by people

592
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:21,120
who loved them? Do you know what I mean? Or does the dictator tend to die like Saddam Hussein or

593
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,040
Julius Caesar or what? You know what I mean? Like, it very rarely ends well. Over a long enough

594
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:35,760
timeline, the ego eventually comes back to get you, you know? So I think the problem for young

595
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,840
people, and I think this is also true for people who are more sheltered, right, who have less sort

596
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:48,640
of life experiences or more sort of outsiders, it's very easy to confuse ego and confidence,

597
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,160
because you don't, you don't actually know, right? Like, I think there are people who go,

598
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,800
we need a president, I was getting trouble talking politics, but we need someone like Donald

599
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,480
Trump, you know, he knows what he's doing. He's someone like Putin is like, I can't wait to get

600
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,880
in a room with this person, I'm gonna fucking break this guy in half. Do you know what I mean?

601
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:17,120
Because he knows that Trump's simplified version of reality, and he can see all the weaknesses in

602
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,920
that ego and bluster. Do you know what I mean? I think the problem when you're 15 is you see Kanye

603
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,160
West, or you see you read a book about Steve Jobs, or you know, you see these athletes doing x, y,

604
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,400
or z, and you think that's what confidence looks like, because you're not, you haven't experienced

605
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:42,960
it enough to know what profound insecurities and weaknesses these strategies are compensating for,

606
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:51,200
and how vulnerable these guys are to slumps or mistakes, or you know, how often they

607
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,640
get in their own way. I think that's the other interesting thing we don't calculate when we

608
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,560
think about ego. We look at super successful people who have egos, and we go, oh, look at what they've

609
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,920
done. The graveyard is something we don't get to examine. We have no idea what the denominator looks

610
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,000
like for that field of observation. That's true, but look at Steve Jobs, right? He comes back,

611
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,480
he's the most successful CEO of probably the 21st century, blah, blah, blah. But like, what about

612
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,440
that loss period? Was that necessary? Did he actually have to get fired from Apple? So the

613
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,280
graveyard is we don't think about all the people who got fired from the company they started because

614
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,480
of ego and never came back, right? Like the Adam Neumanns of WeWork or whatever, we don't see

615
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:37,120
how many of them never even got that far. But let's say Travis Kalanick comes back and is the

616
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:43,680
CEO of Uber again, and he leads it to stratospheric success, he learned blah, blah, blah. What did he

617
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,160
lose? The thing about the time that he lost, the mistakes that he made. And yes, you of course,

618
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,440
we learned by experiences sometimes it's a touch the stove. But the point is, we're really bad at

619
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,840
calculating how much more successful a person could be if their ego wasn't getting in the way.

620
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,640
Anyone who's ever worked with or for or around other powerful people, like everyone knows,

621
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,840
do you know what I mean? I bet if you took every presidential candidate right now,

622
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:14,400
and you talk to the people on their staff, they could give you a list of five ways that person's

623
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,400
ego was hurting them in the campaign, right? So one of them is going to win. But that doesn't mean

624
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,680
those those traits were good. Yeah, that's right. You can be successful despite ego. And that's

625
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,280
different from saying you can be successful because of ego. Yes, we're really bad at calculating that

626
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,120
cost. And I think maybe you just have to see it enough times to know like, I mean, Dove ended up

627
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,360
getting fired from the company, company goes bankrupt twice, he lost everything, not only did

628
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,160
he lose everything, he lost shares, his shares were worth about $500 million. He now owes,

629
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,640
which you will never be able to pay about $20 million to the hedge fund that effectively

630
00:57:52,640 --> 00:58:00,400
destroyed the company in his plan to save it. And 10 12,000 people lost their jobs. Like,

631
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,720
it's not until you really see just how toxic and dysfunctional ego is, at the sort of malignant

632
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,560
level that you walk away and go, I don't want any of that in my life. So what's our checklist?

633
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,680
If we weren't sitting here on this podcast, and we're just sitting here talking about this,

634
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,560
and I'm saying, Ryan, I want to make sure that I have an internal audit. I want to catch my ego

635
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,320
when it is creeping up. What are some of the things you would teach me?

636
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,240
Yeah, I wish I had a magical checklist, but it's more just sort of ideas. And I think why we look

637
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,440
at stories from history as we go, oh, it's the pattern recognition of being a little bit like

638
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,640
this person here, I'm being a little bit like this person here. I think when you feel like it all

639
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,680
rests and falls on you, you know what I mean? Like when you're Atlas with the world on your shoulders,

640
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:53,760
you have profoundly inflated your importance in whatever situation you're in. So that it's like,

641
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:01,680
when you feel that like, Herculean, I'm the one, like, that is ego, right? The other one is like,

642
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,920
when you feel paranoia, like people are out to get me, they're fucking me, they're screwing me

643
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,600
over. I mean, held back, I usually find that's ego. Colin Powell talks about like, you know,

644
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,560
making sure your ego is not associated with your position, right? And so it's like, when your

645
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,440
identity and worth as a human being is tied up in what you have or what you've done, and this is

646
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,320
where that the story you're telling yourself can be so dangerous. When you have really started to

647
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,680
identify with what you've accomplished, when you're like, you know, I've hit this bestseller list,

648
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,800
my podcast has this many downloads, you know, I'm the I'm the best in the world at x, when you have

649
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:44,960
really locked in these sort of arbitrary ratings or, or rankings or status. To me, that's ego,

650
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,600
because now you're not present, you're thinking about how do you maintain and control and get

651
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,360
these things. The last one I would probably say is, is when you are comparing yourself to other

652
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,520
people. So like, if you're comparing yourself against other people versus comparing yourself

653
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,800
against your intention or your own standards, also probably a decent sign of ego. Those are actually

654
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:12,400
really great. One I might add to it that, that I find myself having to check is when I'm more

655
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:20,640
interested in being right than knowing what the truth is, which I find can happen in the stupidest

656
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:27,200
example. Like literally an argument with my wife could easily, if I'm going to be brutally honest,

657
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,880
turn into, wait, stop for a second, Peter. There's an internal dialogue. You're arguing with her

658
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:40,320
and because you're a better arguer, you can probably look like you are right here. There

659
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:45,920
are five other ways that this could be viewed. If you're really being brutally honest, you should

660
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,880
be stepping out of yourself and seeing them all of these other ways. That's a loving example,

661
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:57,840
because it's with a person you care about. Where you really see it, I think, is when you're having

662
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,960
a debate with someone like you don't care about, like someone on Twitter, right? Like some random

663
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,280
person on Twitter attacks you. For me at least, that's very powerful and that's certainly where

664
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,960
I catch my ego the most. Right. Because what you're doing means you're associating your identity with

665
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,960
a totally meaningless encounter or situation and you're like, I can't let this person be better

666
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,520
than me. Or my identity is that I'm the best. I win. I'm right. Not I just want to know what is

667
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,680
true or real or I want to have a conversation with this person. So yeah, I think that's ultimately

668
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,320
why you go so dangerous is that it just sucks us into bullshit that we don't need to be doing,

669
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:39,440
whether they're competitions or they're arguments or they're, you know, I think that the sort of

670
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,240
rise and fall of we work is such a great example of someone who is just like, what happens when

671
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:52,560
ego is just utterly unchecked and how it served him well up until the point it all came, you know,

672
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:58,160
there's a joke about gangsters that like everything is wonderful until the last 15 minutes and then

673
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:04,320
it's brutal and violent and pathetic, you know, and I think that tends to be, it goes and it often

674
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:12,000
goes much longer than anyone thought. And then when it crumbles, it crumbles very quickly.

675
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,920
Not only there's nothing left, but there's not a lot of mercy from other people.

676
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,040
Again, I always think about things in terms of math. So to me, like that's just an amazing

677
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:27,440
example of non-linearity in everything, non-linearity in time and non-linearity in response.

678
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,520
So that's an interesting thing. You can think of ego is an amplifier of those curves.

679
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,120
Yeah. Cyril Connell's line is that ego sucks us down like the law of gravity.

680
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,760
And so I think the way you think about it is like, look, if you're not ever getting up off the couch,

681
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,720
gravity is not a big problem for you. But if you know you're jumping between buildings or you're

682
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,920
doing something really hard, really high up there, the falls can be real painful.

683
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,080
What do you think are the antidotes to the negative effects of ego?

684
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:01,280
Well, it's very hard to be egotistical while you're learning something.

685
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:06,640
Ego can prevent you from learning something. But I think the philosophers mindset, the martial art

686
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:13,520
mindset of like, I am a student in a thing in which you never truly master is sort of

687
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,960
humility embodied. So Epictetus's line is you can't learn that what you think you already know.

688
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:24,320
John Wheeler, the physicist, he says, as your island of knowledge grows, so does the shoreline

689
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,160
of ignorance. And so if you think about it that way, it's like, oh, as I'm getting smarter,

690
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:35,440
I'm actually getting more aware of what I don't know. And to me, that's a much better way to get

691
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,760
through the world. There's people who as they get more successful, there's less and less you can

692
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,000
teach them and there's less and less that they want to hear. And then there are people who as they

693
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,960
get better, become more curious, more interested, more open, less rigid. I think that's where you

694
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,200
want to go. Bob Kaplan, who's my head of research, he says this eloquently, and I'm sure he's

695
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,400
paraphrasing it from somebody else, but the further and further you get from the shore,

696
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,720
the deeper and deeper the water gets. I mean, sometimes Bob and I, we talk almost every day,

697
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,520
and a lot of times I'm just lamenting how little we know. I'm like, God, Bob, does it ever just

698
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:15,040
bug the shit out of you that we spend so much time? We've got seven analysts, like we eat,

699
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:21,280
sleep and breathe this literature. And I think I know less than I knew three years ago on a relative

700
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,280
basis. That's absolutely true. On an absolute basis, it might not be true, but on a relative

701
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,640
basis, which is we perceive relative changes, not absolute changes, that is unquestionably correct.

702
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,680
It's also sort of like the second valley of the Dunning-Kruger curve, right? It's like once you,

703
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,360
oh, I think I know what's going on here. Nope, actually, I have no clue what's going on here.

704
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:46,080
I've written about this before where it's like, okay, let's say the Civil War. You learn about it

705
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,200
in elementary school, whether you live in the North or the South, it's very simple. It's like,

706
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,520
we went to war to free the slaves. It was a war of Northern aggression, right? You learn one of

707
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,680
two things. It's very simple. Then you read about it a little bit more and it's really complicated.

708
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,840
Now it's not so clear. It's like, hey, Lincoln said over and over again, he didn't really want

709
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:12,800
to free the slaves. And, oh, how can we say it's just a war of Northern aggression when the states

710
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:18,560
wrote all these constitutions that basically all they talk about is slavery. It becomes complicated.

711
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:24,000
And then there's really no good guys. There's really no bad guys. And then it, blah, blah, blah,

712
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,840
blah, blah. And all of a sudden you're in this morass and this is like, you heard it from a

713
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,320
teacher at simple. You've read one book, it's complex. You've read 10 books, it's complex.

714
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,800
And you read 20 books, you really study it. And then all of a sudden it's very simple again,

715
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,600
right? And like you go, oh, the Civil War was a hundred percent about slavery. It was only about

716
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:50,720
slavery. And it's very simple. Even though you've come to the same conclusion that you had before,

717
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:57,120
you're understanding it in a profoundly different way. One is sort of egotistical and one is

718
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,080
a humility because you're aware of all the threads that go into it. Do you know what I mean?

719
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,640
When I look at this trilogy, now I just finished it. Like when I look at obstacle,

720
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:15,280
in some ways it's the tightest of the books and it sells great. I hear from people how it's

721
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:21,040
resonated, but I don't know if I could write it again. I couldn't write it that way again because

722
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:26,000
I wouldn't, in having done two other books, having read more studied, more experienced more,

723
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:33,440
I don't think I would allow myself to be as simple as I was. Does that make sense?

724
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:39,200
It makes so much sense, Ryan, because I'm, which I wanted to ask you this tomorrow night over dinner,

725
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,640
but I think I'm going to ask you now, apologies to the listener if you don't care about the nuts

726
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,160
and bolts of writing a book. As I'm getting closer to that first submission, which is probably a month

727
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,000
away, in fact, by the time people listen to this, I will have already submitted it and it'll be,

728
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,240
you know, going through the editing process for so long, because I've been working on this book for

729
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,080
three years. All I wanted to do was get here. And now I'm like, Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to hand

730
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:06,160
it in because I'm still learning. And I know things today I didn't know three years ago. And

731
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,760
that means that on the day this book comes out, there's going to be things I know that aren't in

732
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,840
the book. And there's probably going to be things in this book I don't fully think are the most

733
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:20,400
accurate representation of knowledge. And I just, now that I've had this profound empathy for authors

734
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,360
now, which is how the hell do you do this? How do you take your hands off something, knowing that

735
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,800
knowledge isn't static? Yeah, it's really tough. Winston Churchill, who most people don't think of

736
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:36,160
as a writer, probably wrote more books than just about anyone in the 20th century. He says, at some

737
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,960
point, you have to like, kill the book and fling it to the public. And I think it's right, you do,

738
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,480
you have to you have to stop at some point. That's why the book has to be what you were capable of in

739
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,320
that moment. It has to be a closed thing. Like, the game is four quarters, and then it's over,

740
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:58,080
you don't replay the same game, you play again, the next night or the next season. Do you know

741
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:04,800
what I mean? And but my point was more like you, I look at the book, and it's just, I didn't know

742
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,560
what I didn't know. So there's a certainty to some of the things that in retrospect, I see of,

743
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:16,960
I see with more nuance now. And so in a way, each of the books is a balance, right? Because

744
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,960
you want the books to be tight, you want them to be straightforward, you want them to be compelling,

745
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,640
but also you have to be intellectually on it. So each one of the books has gotten a little bit

746
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,920
longer, because not because I feel like I'm droning on, but because what I was comfortable

747
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,280
saying in one short sentence before, I now have to qualify and you know what I mean? So it becomes

748
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,800
complicated. But you at a certain point, you have to go, this is the best I was capable of,

749
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:49,520
up through November 2019. And that's where I'm when I can when I look at it in the future,

750
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:56,000
I can't be comparing it to who I am now. I have to be asking, did I leave anything on the table in

751
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
November 2019? Did you learn that from Robert? Yeah, a little bit. You just learn it from the

752
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,520
process. I had a weird experience because so trust me, I'm like, how did you meet Robert Green?

753
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,720
Through another author who I was working for. And we had lunch. And then Robert was looking for a

754
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:16,640
research assistant. Yeah, it was just transformative. You describe him as one of the most important

755
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,600
mentors you've had with respect to writing and maybe beyond. Of course, yeah, as a person,

756
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:28,800
as a writer, as a professional, he's just fantastic. So with my first book, I wrote it in 2011,

757
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:34,240
came out in 2012. I did the paperback, which is an expanded edition with some extra stuffs and

758
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:40,480
changes in 2013. And then I wrote an updated edition after the 2016 election. So it's like,

759
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,360
I've had this weird interaction with the text where I had to go back and edit and change.

760
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:49,680
This is where the ego thing comes in. Mostly what I take from that and when I try to think

761
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:56,480
about on a regular basis, is that certainty is the enemy. Because certainty is what you regret

762
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,840
when you look back. It's not that you took a stand, or you thought this, or you said this,

763
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:09,040
it's the tone with which you did it, that you can come to regret. It was the pretension that of

764
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:14,400
course, I'm right. When in retrospect, it's like, how could you have thought that you knew this,

765
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:20,320
you'd only thought about it for 10 minutes. I'd like to think that as I go on as a writer, that

766
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:26,960
it's softer and more balanced and more nuanced. Because if that's not the direction you're going

767
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:33,280
in, I think you're going in the wrong direction. Stillness to me seems like a lonely thing,

768
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:39,520
but you say just the opposite, right? Yeah, well, I think that we confuse stillness. We think

769
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,880
stillness is synonymous with meditation, or we think it's like stillness is what the Dalai Lama

770
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,320
has, or some person on a 30-day silent meditation retreat. Or even outside of that, there still is

771
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,520
this connotation of solitude, right? Like we practice stillness by ourselves with our thoughts,

772
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,640
being present, etc. Well, that's the easiest way to get there, right? Do you know what I mean? Like,

773
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,240
if you were busy and overwhelmed and stressed and having trouble coming up with your thoughts,

774
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,920
you're finishing this book, the easiest way to break through that would be to travel to a place

775
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,360
you don't live, like go to a cabin in the woods and just work on it. And I'm not saying there's

776
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:23,600
not a place for that in life, but that's not sustainable. You can't do that every day if you

777
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,360
want to maximize for these other things we're talking about. So I'm interested in how do you

778
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:37,600
have stillness in the real world where you have bills to pay and a family and a house and

779
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,200
neighbors and you drive a car in traffic. Do you know what I mean? So how do you access stillness

780
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,960
in the course of normal, real life? I think solitude and silence are a big part of it, but

781
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:57,440
I'm thinking just the stillness of reducing the expectations, reducing or extracting the

782
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:02,800
unnecessary, locking into what you're doing, whatever it is, even if it's a minor thing.

783
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,880
So I'm interested in Kennedy and the missile crisis or Anne Frank and her sitting in front

784
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:14,080
of her diary or I'm thinking of the opposite of whatever tiger was his life was like. I'm thinking

785
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:20,400
about stillness for actual people in the real world. Stillness for Marcus Aurelius as the emperor.

786
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,520
So actually I want to talk about meditation because you specifically don't talk about it.

787
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,080
And I think that was a deliberate decision, right? Yeah. What was the basis of that decision?

788
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,840
Well, again, we were talking about, you know, how do you find people where they are?

789
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,560
I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming that people don't meditate, don't really want to

790
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,200
meditate. The evidence is equally overwhelming that it works, right? And that it's great,

791
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,720
but we have trouble getting there. And so when I'm talking about stillness, I didn't want to talk

792
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:53,600
about first off, I think it's problematic that people live chaotic, dysfunctional,

793
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:59,040
disorganized lives. And then they think going on a seven day silent meditation retreat is

794
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:04,960
magically going to solve all of that when they're just coming back to their same life right

795
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,480
afterwards. So it's like going on a juice cleanse or something. Do you know what I mean? It's not

796
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:16,160
really doing anything. And so the idea was there's lots of great stuff about meditation out there.

797
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,040
It's not really what I do anyway. So I'm not going to pretend I'm the expert on it.

798
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:28,960
But what I can talk about is a more comprehensive sort of philosophical approach to stillness.

799
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,920
And let's see if we can't start there. And then at the end of it, I think you're in a better place

800
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:42,400
to try some of those things. Let's start with journaling. Yeah. Stoics journaled. Yeah, we

801
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,880
wouldn't have any stoics. We wouldn't have Marcus Rheelius if the stoics didn't journal. And what I

802
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,440
think is so interesting about Marcus Rheelius, having now started to really study some of the

803
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:58,560
more obscure earlier stoics, is you realize even a lot of the stuff, like a good chunk of meditations

804
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,720
is like quotes from other people. But even a chunk of the stuff that's not quotes he didn't make up.

805
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:11,200
Like that he's almost running through like flashcards in this journal. He's like running through

806
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:17,760
exercises or thoughts or things that he's paraphrasing things that he was taught by his

807
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:25,840
teachers. And you realize that philosophy is actually an active word-based writing process,

808
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,320
not a book that you read one time and then you've magically absorbed the insights.

809
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,640
Let's talk about this process, because I think the way you describe meditation,

810
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,840
you know, the way I sort of explain it to patients is sort of similar, right? Which is

811
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:47,200
it's not about meditation. Meditation is a tool, it's a training platform, if you will,

812
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,720
that teaches you a skill that for me, and I think people more sophisticated than me will be able to

813
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,480
talk about much more nuance around this. Like they listen to Sam Harris talk about this, of course,

814
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:03,200
it's infinitely more enlightening. For me, it's simply gap awareness. That's literally all I care

815
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:11,120
about is the gap between stimulus and response. I want a bigger gap, and I do this goofy thing

816
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:17,440
every day, most days, this practice where I sit there and I, you know, focus on my breath and I

817
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:22,240
catch myself thinking and I come back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, because as

818
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,080
Jeff Warren, who's a great meditation teacher, describes it, that's just a bicep curl. I might

819
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,800
go into the gym and I'm doing curls or squats or whatever exercise I want to do so that when I

820
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,840
leave the gym and I go and pick up my bag of groceries or I go pick up my kid, I have some

821
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:42,080
muscle to do that. And with physical muscles, it's so easy. We're so wired to see that. I think with

822
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:49,600
some of these cognitive, emotional muscles, we don't have quite the same. So how do you think about

823
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,880
the exercise of bringing stillness in? I mean, you've talked a lot about it, and I think we

824
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,880
should talk about these in detail. What are the enemies of stillness, right? You know, jealousy

825
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,040
and things like that. Maybe we start there actually, and then we'll sort of, unless you

826
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,640
think it's better to talk about it in the, yeah, whichever. Let's start with what are the things,

827
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,360
what are the obstacles to stillness? I mean, overactivity certainly sort of committing to more than

828
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:17,840
you can conceivably handle. We talked about sort of enough, like an insatiable demand or need,

829
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:23,200
certainly one of them. I think noise is the enemy of stillness, like unnecessary noise,

830
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:29,920
and that can be internal noise or exterior noise. Bad habits, bad routines, certainly, I think people

831
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,800
can get to, you know, they can go on a wonderful vacation, and every day they go to this coffee

832
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,240
shop, and they sit around, and they hang out, it's wonderful. And then they go back to their

833
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:42,320
sort of life where they, they wake up five minutes before they're supposed to go to work, and then

834
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,720
they're sprinting around, you know what I mean? Like, or they have a couple days without their phone,

835
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:51,840
and then they get addicted to some new app. So it's sort of routine structure limits,

836
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:59,200
the lack thereof is, to me, a huge, you know, obstacle to stillness. I think deficiency in

837
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:07,680
terms of like hobbies or practices and the like. So I think meditation is not just the practice of

838
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:14,400
doing it, it's the having a practice period. So if you're like, my practice is that I cook dinner

839
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:22,160
every night. That could be your thing, like having a thing that you do that you control, that you can

840
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:28,320
access on demand is hugely important. So for me, it's running or swimming, and just having this,

841
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:34,400
this place I can go to when I'm stressed or overwhelmed, or when I'm struggling with some

842
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:41,520
big decision is a huge source of relief and reflection for me. How long does it take you to

843
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,120
finally look at your phone in the morning? My thing now is I like, so this morning it was about

844
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:52,640
two and a half hours. So what's your morning routine? So I wake up early. With or without an alarm?

845
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,760
I mean, I got a three year old, so and a four month old. So usually, it doesn't even matter if I have

846
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,520
an alarm. If I am using an alarm, it's by phone, but it's in the other room. Like it's not near the

847
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:09,040
bed. That's a huge minor thing, but can have a major impact is like, do not sleep with your phone

848
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:14,880
in the room. But so I wake up, you know, let's say six or seven, don't touch the phone. Have you

849
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:20,960
spar? The app spar? Nope. Basically, you do these challenges. So it's like, let's do 50 pushups a

850
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,720
day. You do the 50 pushups a day, but you have to like video yourself doing the thing on the app.

851
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,680
And so people can verify whether you did it or not. And then if you miss it charges you like five

852
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:37,040
bucks or 10 bucks, or I'm sure it could be $100. But it charges you each day that you miss,

853
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,520
and this goes into a pot. And then at the end of the challenge, the people who didn't miss split

854
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,120
the pot, which is awesome. I use that to start to happen, which is I'm not going to check my phone

855
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,400
for the first 10 minutes, then we worked our way up to 30 minutes and an hour. How do you videotape

856
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,320
that you only do it if you made it so like I woke up at six, 730 right now it's an hour and a half.

857
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,560
Awesome. And people go Oh, great job. You know, it's like there's a community thing. But so I

858
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:09,360
started I worked my way up to about an hour. But now it's just like, how long can I go? And it

859
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,800
really it's very helpful for me in terms of just starting the day, not from my back foot.

860
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,160
So what did you do with that two and a half hours you had that weren't cursed with the phone?

861
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:24,960
Yeah, so this morning, I took my son for a bike ride, like in a bike trailer. So that was, you

862
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,720
know, 45 minutes, then we had breakfast, then I worked, like I went, I went and sat with a journal

863
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,600
and then I went straight into the writing for the day. And I forget why I had to get a photo off my

864
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,480
phone for something I was doing. So it wasn't even like, oh, now, you know, now I'm gonna go respond

865
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:45,280
to text messages. It was just like, the phone is a value. I mean, like, you know, yesterday, it was

866
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,080
probably two, two and a half hours. But then I needed directions to somewhere I was going. So

867
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:55,280
I'm it's not that I don't want to ever use the phone. It's just like, I want to be using the

868
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:00,880
phone rather than be used by the phone, which is what I think most of the time our use of these

869
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,840
devices is we're being used by the technology. Now, I'm guessing many people listening to this

870
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,480
will think, what the hell is this guy talking about? I don't have that luxury, right? And there's

871
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,960
going to be a, and whether that's true or not, I don't know. Like, of course, I'm just thinking

872
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,440
about it through my lens, like, how long can I realistically go without the phone? You know, like

873
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,240
you, I sort of have the privilege of working for myself, I probably have more things that are

874
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,080
pinging me that may be time sensitive, you know, vis-a-vis a patient or something like that, or

875
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,320
someone on my team needs to get a hold of me. But, but in the end, I still live a pretty privileged

876
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,560
existence relative to someone who's at the bottom of their pyramid, whatever their organization is.

877
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,120
And they're at the, you know, they're beholden to somebody else. Yeah. And I went through that phase

878
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:48,720
in my life. And you're trading things to get where you want to get. So I'm totally not saying that

879
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:56,560
this is for everyone for right now. But if what usually people go, Oh, this is, I'm early in this

880
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:03,040
phase. What actually tends to happen though, is that you actually get less freedom, the more

881
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:09,680
successful you get, right? Which is precisely the wrong way for it to go. So I'm thinking it's, I

882
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:14,480
don't know though, it's weird. I think people actively like, Oh, like when you hear someone's

883
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,320
like, Oh, I don't even have a smartphone or anything. They go, Oh, I, you know, I have, I

884
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:23,760
meditate for an hour each day, or I do this. People immediately try to make up some story about why

885
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,120
that's their sort of privileged existence. And that could never work for me rather than thinking

886
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:35,600
about how can I have my version of that? And it's like, I am probably busier than most of the people

887
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,760
who are saying, Oh, you, how did you have two and a half hours without your phone? Do you know what I

888
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,640
mean? Like I've got people who work for me. I've got projects that are going on. I've got deadlines

889
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:51,840
I have to meet, but it's precisely because I have all of that going on. I'm not fucking sending

890
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:57,520
Snapchat DMS. Do you know what I mean? Like it's not, it's not that I wasn't working. I was at my

891
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:03,520
computer. I was connected, but what I wasn't doing is using a device. That's main purpose is to make

892
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:09,680
me use the device. When you're on the computer, what is your relationship with that? You know,

893
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:15,200
obviously email people who listen to this podcast. I feel, I feel like I must be spending way too much

894
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,760
time railing on email because I'm at the point now where the first time somebody meets me,

895
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:25,360
they usually say, I know how much you hate email, you know, I'm sorry for emailing you or whatever.

896
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:32,320
So for me, I like emails. My preferred medium in the sense that like, I want it all funneling

897
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:37,600
towards there so then I can have control over it. So like, that's one of my things is like,

898
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:43,440
you're not also DMing me on Twitter. You're not also, you know, sending me Facebook messages.

899
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,080
You're not also chatting on LinkedIn. Email is like a pretty good medium for me because it's

900
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:53,840
asynchronous. That's what I like about it. What I hate are fucking phone calls. That's what I want.

901
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,720
Want to have the least amount of in my life. Or God bless WhatsApp with the little timestamp of,

902
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,160
you know, when you actually saw the message versus I can't stand WhatsApp.

903
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,360
Or the, hey, let's get together for coffee. And we'll, you know, like these sort of things where

904
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,120
it's like a thing that could have been a phone call that could have been an email. Do you know

905
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,760
what I mean? That could have been nothing because you could have just Googled this, right? Email is

906
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,160
good for me. So I think people should figure out what's good for them. But email is good for me,

907
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:25,280
but I'm not writing and simultaneously checking my email every time that, you know, it doesn't.

908
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,800
So do you have rules around how often you check email?

909
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:34,960
Not really. My thing is like, since it's my main thing of like how people get a hold of me,

910
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,040
it's like I'm sort of peripherally checking it throughout the day. So it's, I can see if things

911
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:44,320
are happening. But what I'm, the way my morning is set up and the way my life is, is it's like,

912
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,800
I'm getting everything in the right headspace. So I can go right into whatever the main writing or

913
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:57,600
the main task that I have to do for the day is before I get sucked into the email, like reactive

914
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,880
response stuff for the day. So yesterday I had some articles to write and then I had a presentation

915
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,400
I had to make that probably took me through towards, you know, 12 30 or one. And then so it's

916
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:14,400
like after lunch, now I got to respond to all these things people want for me. So how does

917
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:19,120
jealousy factor into stillness? When we've talked about the relationship of jealousy and ego,

918
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,600
are these things synonymous? I mean, when you find something that is anti stillness,

919
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,320
is it pro ego or not necessarily? Well, I would find there's very few egotistical people who I

920
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:34,160
think we would define as still take the five or six most egotistical people that you can think of

921
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:40,160
historically, or that you know, personally, I would say you'd probably trade places with very few of

922
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:46,640
them, even if they are extraordinarily successful, right? I do find the ego and stillness are pretty

923
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:52,400
mutually exclusive. Why do you think that is? Let's pick an example of somebody, let's use someone

924
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,280
other than the president to throw it at somebody else. I mean, was Bill Clinton a still guy?

925
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:03,920
Bill and Hillary's ego has caused them a lot of problems, but it's in a less sort of day to day

926
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:10,560
misery sense of the word, I would think. Who's a good example? I mean, you look at a Kanye West,

927
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:16,960
right? Or you look at an Elizabeth Holmes, or you look at the guy that did fire fest, you know,

928
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,480
that's not, you don't want to be that person. And look at the fire fest guy, I think it was a great

929
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:27,040
example. Weirdly, he called me before he went to jail, he wanted to talk, we never ended up

930
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,760
connecting, but uh, that's because he called you, should have emailed you. Yes, what I found so

931
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,000
compelling about the documentary. So okay, he commits this massive, yeah, tell folks what fire

932
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,000
fest is. And yeah, so it was a concert organ. It was a basically a scam artist to put together this

933
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,600
thing called fire fest was just supposed to be this enormous concert on this island in the Caribbean.

934
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,560
And it ended up sort of blowing up all over his face. They made this fascinating documentary about

935
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,800
just like, what happened? But the point what I love, have you seen the documentary? I have not. I mean,

936
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,200
I'm familiar with the story. What's it called? They're both called fire fest or something. One's

937
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,640
on Netflix and one is on Hulu. You wouldn't think this would be worth two documentaries, but totally

938
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:11,760
is really. Yeah, it's fascinating. Okay. But so in one of the documentaries, I forget which one

939
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:17,040
he commits this massive fraud. It's kind of intentionally kind of unintentionally blows up

940
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:22,240
in his face. He's humiliated, it costs him all his money gets investigated. When he gets back,

941
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:28,640
instead of looking in the mirror and going, how did this happen? What change am I going to make

942
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:34,160
in my life? You know, he ends up starting this other scam. Like he starts trying to sell these

943
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:40,320
concert tickets. The point is like he couldn't stop himself. It becomes like a compulsion. And

944
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:45,280
I think I keep doing Trump, but when you look at Trump, people are like, why can't he just not tweet?

945
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,280
Because it's like, that would make sense. He could be a pretty good president, I think, in some ways

946
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:58,640
without doing it, but he can't. He's not in control. The ego is in control. And so you just see that

947
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:05,120
time and time again, it prevents one from being able to stop. And it goes so far beyond self

948
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:10,320
interest, right? Like it becomes actively self destructive. So I think what you were saying is,

949
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,240
well, you were asking me a specific question about stillness, how it pertained to stillness.

950
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,800
Well, and jealousy. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

951
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:22,480
Theodor Roosevelt's line was comparison is the thief of joy. I like Joseph Epstein's line. He

952
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:30,480
said, of all the seven deadly sins, envy is the only one that's no fun. And he's totally right.

953
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,800
Let me think about that for a second. Yeah. At least in the moment,

954
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,240
Gluttony is pretty fun. Sloth can feel okay in the moment.

955
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:46,240
It's the only one that primarily punishes the recipient. When you are envious, it is

956
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:53,520
always a negative feeling. You're only feeling bad about what you don't have. And you are

957
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:02,240
angry or resentful or hurt that someone else has it instead. Right. And so jealousy and envy are

958
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,960
just, you know, it's a zero sum way to go through the world. It's a negative way to go through the

959
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:17,520
world. It prevents you. I think that the irony of envy is often we are envious of people who are

960
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:24,320
envious of other people. In some cases, we don't know it, but secretly they're envious of us.

961
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:30,800
Right. Like, you know, it's like, think of all the people right now who are giving up everything and

962
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,600
working incredibly hard because they want to become famous. And then you think of all the famous people

963
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,280
who complain about being famous and would in some ways give everything to have their privacy back.

964
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,520
This is why the Stokes are saying we sort of question these things and we think about them

965
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:51,120
because under examination, they make a lot less sense that they do just sort of in the sway of

966
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:58,240
whatever that feeling is. You wrote that the call to stillness comes quietly, but the modern world

967
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:05,600
does not. And that creates a pretty negative pressure against stillness. Yeah. No one's beaten

968
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:11,120
on your door begging you to be still. Like all the incentives are lined up for the opposite.

969
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:17,920
How much of that do you think is sort of been a monotonically increasing function? In other words,

970
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:24,240
like if we could transport you back to, you know, just before the civil war, right? It's whatever

971
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:30,560
that would be 150 years ago, 140 years ago, I guess 150 years ago now. How still was the world then?

972
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,000
I think it's in pockets, right? Rome is a super noisy place. I mean, I opened the book with

973
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,720
just the incredible noise of the city that Seneca is trying to tune out as he's writing.

974
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,000
But one of my favorite quotes in the book, Blaise Pascal, in like, you know, mid 1500s,

975
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,920
he goes, all of humanity's problems stem from our inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

976
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,280
What do you think Pascal was getting at there? How much of that is about comfort within our own skin

977
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:03,520
versus the ability to silence our monkey mind versus the ability to distance yourself from all

978
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,280
of these other forms of suffering? I mean, Pascal has said some brilliant things about suffering.

979
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:12,320
Yeah, I think he means all of those. I think he means that also in the sense that all of our

980
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:18,320
suffering stems from the things we go out and do to try to alleviate that suffering

981
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,360
that ultimately create new forms of suffering. I think it was Pascal who actually said the

982
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,520
distraction is the greatest thing that we pursue to combat our misery. Of course, I'm paraphrasing,

983
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,400
yet it is in and of itself our greatest form of misery. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, there's this

984
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:35,600
famous story. It's now like a viral email, but it actually dates to around the same time as

985
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,920
Pascal and he may reference it, but there's that story, you know, it's like the rich CEOs on

986
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:46,160
vacation and he sees like a Vietnamese fisherman and he says, this is so beautiful. What's your

987
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,320
plan? The guy's like, oh, I fish a couple of hours a day. And the guy goes, oh, well, what you got to

988
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:56,640
do is buy another fishing boat. And then you buy it. He talks about this whole scale of like how to

989
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:01,360
expand and grow the business. And then the fisherman says, well, then what do I do? He's like,

990
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:06,800
well, then you sell it and you retire. And basically the point is it brings you right back

991
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:13,200
to research. But this story actually dates back like 600 plus years. It's the story of a minister

992
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:18,160
speaking to a king and the king is saying, well, you know, we have to invade Prussia and then after

993
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:23,040
Prussia, we have to invade Vienna, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, and then we can live in

994
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:28,320
peace, which is where they were. Right. And so that I think that's part of what Pascal is saying

995
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:34,000
is that like, if we could sit quietly in a room alone, we wouldn't go do these things that then

996
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,880
are prevent us from sitting quietly in a room alone. They've actually done some studies. Maybe

997
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,680
you know more about it than I do, but the study where they'll sit someone in a room and they will

998
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:48,960
say, I'm going to come back in 15 minutes. You have to wait here, or you can press this button,

999
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:54,240
which will give you an electrical shock. And then you can leave right now and people will take a

1000
01:31:54,240 --> 01:32:01,520
painful electrical shock than to sit quietly with themselves. So I Pascal was more right than I knew.

1001
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:04,640
You know, it's funny. I always interpret those studies as

1002
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:11,440
is the pain of the shock worth more than my time, you know, to leave. But, but, but I, I see that

1003
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,280
that's sort of interesting. I thought about that too. Yeah. What is 15 minutes of your life worth?

1004
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,520
But is that person going to, what are you going to do at home? Like you're going to sit there for

1005
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:24,000
15 minutes, right? So I, I don't remember. Maybe there's some reward in the study also, but the

1006
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,520
point is like, sometimes you feel this as a father, you're like, I got to rush home. I got to drive

1007
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,600
dangerous. I gotta get, I gotta see my kids. And then you see your kids and like two minutes later,

1008
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:37,840
you're like, I'm going to go to the other room and do my thing now. You know, like, like we have this

1009
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:44,960
good urge to do the right thing, to be there with people. But then are we actually doing it when

1010
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:53,200
we're there? That resonates a lot because I find, you know, my wife was recently away for four days.

1011
01:32:53,200 --> 01:33:00,000
So I was, that's the longest I'd been with all three kids for that period of time. It was awesome.

1012
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:06,240
I actually enjoyed virtually every second of it, infinitely harder than one can imagine. If you're

1013
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:13,440
me, who's not used to being there for throughout all of the interstitial parts of existence.

1014
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:20,080
And you sort of realize like how many times was I tempted to just get up and go do something that I

1015
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,480
couldn't go and do in that moment? Because in the, if my wife's there, I can just go and get up.

1016
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,680
You're handing them off between each other. Yeah, totally.

1017
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:34,160
I don't know. I just wonder like how did we get here? And I guess it's tempting to want to blame

1018
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:39,840
our electronic environment, but there was no electronics in Rome. So it's not like electronics

1019
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:44,800
are the cause of this. There's simply a convenient outlet for it. What is the cause of this?

1020
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,560
Well, I don't know, but I was thinking about this actually this morning because

1021
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,720
on Sunday I have to fly to Europe. And so there were two flight options and they were both,

1022
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:56,240
I'm not paying for either of them. They were both miles or something like that. But it was like,

1023
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:04,480
okay, there's a business class flight at 10 or there is a coach flight at two. It's a long flight.

1024
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:09,920
You know, it's like eight hours, but it was like, obviously I'd rather be comfortable, but am I going

1025
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,320
to, I've been gone so much. I've been on the road for this book. Four hours is a lot. Four hours on

1026
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,880
the Sunday is a lot of family time, right? You know, it's also like, you know, leaving at 10 is

1027
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,120
profoundly different than leaving at two because you know, you have the whole, you know, how much

1028
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:27,760
are they awake? What are you doing in the morning? Whatever. So I chose the coach flight again. This is

1029
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,960
a very privileged dilemma, but I took the coach flight and I was sort of proud of myself. They

1030
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:38,320
did the right thing, whatever. But then if there was something I wanted to do in town this week,

1031
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:43,120
I might be gone for four hours and not think anything of it. There's the subtlety with which

1032
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:49,520
that creeps in versus the distinct and stark contrast of the big decision. Yes. When it's a

1033
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:55,040
big black and white decision, we kind of know what the right thing is, but the drifting towards

1034
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:00,720
this or that where it's a little more gradual, it's harder. And so again, this is where that

1035
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:06,000
momentum more stuff comes in, which is like, don't think about it as you have an unlimited

1036
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,880
amount of this to choose from you. You got to always be coming back to it actually kind of is

1037
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,680
a black and white decision because you'll never get the time back. And so was it actually more

1038
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:21,360
important that you went and did X, Y, and Z? Maybe not. That's a great story because I see that

1039
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:27,840
example in my life all the time. I'm generally better at drawing boundaries when the asks are

1040
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,000
enormous. I'm really bad at drawing boundaries when the asks are subtle and tender and slight

1041
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,240
and barely noticeable. Yeah. But the integral of those, the area under the curve of that latter

1042
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:46,000
category often eclipses the former. Yeah. Well, there's just way more of them and they probably

1043
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,880
add up to be. So it's like, yeah, if you went away for two days, you'd feel like, oh, that's a huge

1044
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,880
deal. But if you went away for two days, but you were present a hundred percent of the time you're

1045
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,680
home, it'd be nothing. The problem is when you're home, you're also running around and doing this

1046
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:05,920
and that you're not actually there. Yeah. It's, it's tough. This is about living well, but you also

1047
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,480
say this is about dying well. What is, what does dying well mean? Well, I don't have a ton of

1048
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:18,480
experience with dying naturally, but it is the sort of the theme of momentum or the theme about death

1049
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:25,040
is this is where we're all going. Right. So Cicero and then through Montaigne, they say to philosophizes

1050
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:30,240
to learn how to die. It's maybe something we've lost, but that's sort of death as your last

1051
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:35,760
gesture as the final thing, the most important thing you do in life is, is maybe something that

1052
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:42,080
the ancients were much bigger believers in than we are today down, you know, in some cases it's

1053
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:47,440
these dramatic suicides. In other cases, it's just, you know, sort of what are you going to do in these

1054
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:52,640
final moments where the last things you're going to say, but I just, I like the idea that you're

1055
01:36:52,640 --> 01:37:00,160
training for that or that you're moving towards that as a reminder that this stuff matters, you

1056
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:06,160
know, these ideas, these things that you're training for something important. Expand on that a little

1057
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:11,120
bit because I think for many people that's counterintuitive, right? Which is, wait a minute,

1058
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:17,280
how could focusing on my death make my life any better? One of the things I left from Seneca is

1059
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:22,720
talking about is talking about these sort of old people that you see who can't, can't let go. He's

1060
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:28,480
like, you should look with pity on the aged lawyer who continues to plead in court for his clients.

1061
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:34,800
He's talking about the guy who can't accept that his moment is past and he has to pass the baton to

1062
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:40,480
the next generation, right? That's a person who, for whom despite all their success, all their fame,

1063
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:45,280
all their money, there's not enough. It's like they're going to be pleading in court until they

1064
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:50,240
drop dead on the spot. Now, what about the argument that says, but if that is their greatest source of

1065
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:54,400
joy, don't we want them doing that rather than sitting in a rocking chair is using the proverbial

1066
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,760
counter example? Yeah, I guess the question is, is this actually fun or is this a compulsion?

1067
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,240
There's this fascinating video you can watch of Joan Rivers where they're asking her, she's like,

1068
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:09,120
why are you still performing? Why are you doing this? Like, not in a judgmental way, but she

1069
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:13,920
brings out her calendar. She flash forwards a couple months and she goes, like, see these blank

1070
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:22,320
pages. She's like, if these pages stay blank, it means that I'm nothing, that I've fallen off,

1071
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:28,400
that my career was pointless. Like, she basically goes in, she reveals that sometimes you get those

1072
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:33,920
glimpses of people's internal monologue and you get a glimpse of her internal monologue. And on

1073
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,640
the one hand, it gives you a sense of how she managed to accomplish this credit. She built this

1074
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:43,680
incredible career. She was one of the first sort of huge female comics, how she persevered through

1075
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:48,880
all the bullshit she would have had to put up with. But I think it's impossible to watch that video

1076
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:55,360
and not feel very sad also, right? Like, that's craving verse fullness. It wasn't, see this blank

1077
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:59,600
calendar? What am I going to do? I'm going to sit around at home. I love being on the road. I love

1078
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,560
working, you know, I love being with an audience. Like, this is what I was put on the planet to do.

1079
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,920
That's a very different answer than, you know, these blank pages mean that I'm worthless as a

1080
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:18,880
human being, right? And so the idea of aging gracefully, of going out well, is it's not this

1081
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:24,800
separate thing. It is the culmination of these principles that we're talking about. Death isn't

1082
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:32,000
this separate random other thing. It is a process that we're already engaged in, whether we know it

1083
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,400
or not, right? Like you're dying now, and that you've already died however many years you've been

1084
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,720
alive and you're just doing it every day until you finally get to the last time that you do it.

1085
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:47,840
And maybe that's more of it. I find it clarifying. You're a father now twice. How has that changed

1086
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:53,520
your thinking about this? Because obviously you're a father as your, your first child was

1087
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,720
already born by the time you were writing this book. Your second child came along after you

1088
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:04,880
finished the book. How did the influence of them in your lives, I mean, you've written about the

1089
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:10,480
impact of being a father, but how does that help you think about this runway? One of the interesting

1090
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:16,640
things you experience, it was a shock for me. When you bring your kids home from the hospital for the

1091
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:23,280
first time, maybe people prepared me wrong, but I was prepared for like complete chaos, right? Like

1092
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:29,360
this sort of sleep deprived craziness. And that's certainly there, but actually it's like those like

1093
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:35,680
first couple weeks, you're not doing anything. Especially as the dad. Especially as, but you and

1094
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:40,960
your wife or you know, whatever your arrangement is, it was this rude, but also wonderful awakening

1095
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:46,320
that like, that's what being a parent is like. Being a parent is not like running around and

1096
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:53,520
taking them places and doing things. Like being a parent, it's just what your life is. The stillness

1097
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:59,840
of that period I still think of quite often because you're not supposed to be anywhere,

1098
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:04,800
right? You're not supposed to be doing anything. You don't have the ability or the energy to do

1099
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:11,200
anything. It's just like what we're doing is being very quiet while this person sleeps. Like that's

1100
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:19,120
what we're doing. You're not also mowing the lawn, right? Or, or, you know, renovating your bathrooms.

1101
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:23,680
Like you're not doing anything. You can't do anything. That's an energy I try to access

1102
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:31,600
quite often as well, which is like, like Saturday doesn't have to be this, you know, complicated,

1103
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:39,200
orchestrated event. It's not a choreographed dance. It's a, oh, are we just sitting out in the

1104
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,600
yard and, you know, digging holes for the next three hours? Is that what we're doing? And being

1105
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:53,440
okay with that. I think parenting and presence are very related because what is fascinating and

1106
01:41:53,440 --> 01:42:00,560
entertaining and stimulating for them to an adult is usually an incredibly boring thing. And so you

1107
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:08,480
almost are forced to adopt that, that childlike existence. And it's, I find it very refreshing.

1108
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:12,880
How do you feel about Saturdays in general? You've talked about this idea of what does your Saturday

1109
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:20,320
look like? And the paradox of those days that are hyper scheduled aren't necessarily very

1110
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:25,920
productive days when it comes to doing important work. When I talk to people about success, I sort

1111
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,840
of go, not like, what do you want to accomplish? What do you want to have? What do you want to have

1112
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:35,600
done? But like, what do you want? How do you want that to manifest itself into your life? Like, what

1113
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:41,600
do you want your life to look like? So, you know, if you're, if you're a basketball player, you want,

1114
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:46,000
you know, probably game days, your, you know, your dream life, you know, you got the routine,

1115
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:51,040
you go and then you're in the crowd, you're playing. For me, it's like, I like a day with

1116
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:56,960
almost no interruptions, exterior interruptions, I like a little time to write. I like not feeling

1117
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:02,560
pressure. I like time with family, like being outside, you know, like, and so when I think about

1118
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:08,080
what that dream day is, you know, it's like when you visit somewhere on vacation, and then you're

1119
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:12,720
like, wouldn't it be wonderful to live here? You know, it's like, I think when you have one of those

1120
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:18,800
perfect days, you should go like, how can my whole life be like this? And you have a lot of power over

1121
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:24,960
that. But then we go back to green shit we don't want to do. How much power do we have over that? I

1122
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,840
mean, again, the skeptic would say, well, Ryan, you're successful. Of course, you have control

1123
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:35,680
over that. But I have a nine to five job where I'm a single parent or, you know, how much control do I

1124
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:42,720
have over my ability to make every day my Saturday? Yeah, again, using Saturday as this sort of analogy.

1125
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:47,040
Yeah, yeah. And I think Saturday is hard for people because they think like, I don't work

1126
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:55,120
Saturdays, right? Like, my Saturday involves me doing what I do, right? But it wasn't free for me

1127
01:43:55,120 --> 01:44:02,560
to set up this life. There were real costs to it. I could live in New York and be on television more,

1128
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:07,360
you know, I could live in LA and have a bunch of different writing opportunities that I don't have,

1129
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:12,000
or I could spend more time in town and it would be better. But it's all relative because we do

1130
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,800
different things, we have different wants and needs and different, you know, sort of expectations for

1131
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:23,680
life. But the point is like, this life that I set up was not gifted to me, this this required a bunch

1132
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:30,560
of different compromises and a bunch of different, well thought out intentional decisions. You know,

1133
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,520
it was buying a house that was less than I could afford so that I didn't, I could actually enjoy it

1134
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:41,680
and not have to go be away from said house to pay for that house. It means saying no to things that

1135
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:47,760
would be awesome to do or cool to do or great stories to tell someday but don't want to.

1136
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,880
How do you navigate that?

1137
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:54,560
Well, I try to go, you know, is this getting me closer to that day or further from that day?

1138
01:44:54,560 --> 01:45:01,040
So this month had maybe one of those days, two of those days. So it's like, look, it's wonderful.

1139
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:05,280
The book has done well, the tour has been awesome, you know, the experience has been great, but like,

1140
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,200
I've got to figure out how to make this not happen as often.

1141
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:15,200
And how do you know how to juggle that? I mean, I've heard you, I think I read it in one of your

1142
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:20,080
blog posts. It's actually an old post you wrote a long time ago, I think about so you want to be

1143
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:27,280
an author. How long ago did you write that? Oh, that would have been 2013, maybe 2012, a while ago.

1144
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:34,480
Yeah. And I'm glad I read it because it also it gave me a great sort of warm up for what's to come

1145
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:38,240
because there's a part of me that's sort of thinking, Oh, look, once I write this book, I'm

1146
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:43,120
done. I never want to have to talk about it. I don't want to have to go on any podcasts. I,

1147
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:49,760
God forbid, don't want to have to go and do book tours or any of that stuff. And reading

1148
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:54,720
that post was a real kick in the groin in a wake up call. It's like, no, dude, like you got to work.

1149
01:45:54,720 --> 01:46:01,920
Yeah. I mean, I finished this book in December. So that's how long this process has been going on.

1150
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:08,080
The administrative, right? It's a nine month lead from the time you are fully done with this thing

1151
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:14,080
until it comes out. And, and, and there's lots to do. I guess my, my question really is, how do you

1152
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:18,080
know you're not just on a slippery slope where you're saying, well, it's because of the book that

1153
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:24,480
I'm going to only have one of those days for this month and this month. And how do you know that

1154
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,680
that doesn't ultimately just become the new norm? I don't know. I mean, I was just talking to my

1155
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,600
wife about this. It's like you tell yourself it'll go back to normal after a certain point,

1156
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:38,480
but it doesn't go back to normal. You have to put it back to normal, right? Like you have to,

1157
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:44,640
it's a stop. It's a draw line. Bringing this out of the world of just you and to the, the average

1158
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:49,200
person that's going to be listening to this. It's, it's really easy to rationalize. This is the

1159
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:54,080
season when I have to work extra hard. Yeah. People say it's going to be two years while I start this

1160
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:59,520
company. And then, and it's like, no, it's, that's not how this works. Right. And so that's why I'm

1161
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:06,320
much more interested in creating sustainable ways of doing, I'm not like for a launch, there is a

1162
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:11,840
little bit of a sprint element to it. It's a month, I think is a manageable amount of time.

1163
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,320
But I think when you start to get into these, like the next 10 years are going to be really hard,

1164
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:20,400
but then after that it's going to be like when that period starts to get more than a couple

1165
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:24,880
weeks or a couple months, like I think you're probably doing it wrong. You want to be thinking

1166
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:32,000
about how do you build something more sustainable and endurable? What do you think is with meditation?

1167
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,880
Again, one of the things that makes meditation nice is you're talking about the practice,

1168
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:42,000
not the state. In other words, meditation by itself is not particularly interesting. It's not

1169
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,960
even enjoyable half the time, but it's a practice. And once a person understands what that practice

1170
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:52,880
is, it allows them to function better outside of their meditative practice. Yeah. Conversely,

1171
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:58,400
you're writing about stillness, which is the desired outcome. And I've always found that to

1172
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:02,400
be a harder way to explain the things. I mean, it's a beautifully important way to do it, which is,

1173
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:08,560
this is the state you want versus this is the practice you do to get a state. So how do you

1174
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:14,480
think about the journey there and the tangible skills that one puts in place? Well, you know,

1175
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:17,600
it's interesting to say that because when I think about ego and when I think about this book,

1176
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:24,240
I think the title or the premise or the introduction is, okay, here are the costs of ego. Here's

1177
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:29,440
maybe what a better place to be in would be like. In this book, it's like, here's how busy and chaotic

1178
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,920
the world is. Here's maybe a better way to do it. But then when you actually look at the chapters,

1179
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:41,440
the chapters of both of those books are either examples or counter examples of processes or

1180
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:48,560
practices that allow that state to ensue. Because the problem with like what you get from meditation

1181
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:54,400
or what you get from stillness or whatever the opposite of ego is, is that there's an ineffability

1182
01:48:54,400 --> 01:49:01,360
to it. Like you can't really describe what it is because it's fleeting and ephemeral and also deeply

1183
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,560
unique to each person and each time you have it. So what I'm trying to do in the books is just

1184
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:14,080
give you a bunch of slices of approaches or ideas that if followed, if thought about,

1185
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:22,080
if sort of integrated into who you are, will hopefully ensue to that place. So I'm mostly

1186
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:26,720
only thinking about practice and I can't even give you a definition of what stillness is,

1187
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:33,360
let alone like a magical recipe, but I can give you some tools or strategies that tend to be

1188
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:39,520
correlated with achieving that outcome. What do you think are three of those that are, I don't

1189
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:45,680
actually want to say the easiest to enact, but I'd rather frame it as, let's say the most reliable.

1190
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:51,840
The most potent activators. I think walking is a huge one. Every day I walk. Not only do I try to

1191
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,400
go on walks just like to be outside and do nothing. Usually I take my son if we're not doing

1192
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:02,880
the bike thing, but just some sort of low impact physical exercise, but doing the exercise for the

1193
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,880
mental benefits, right? Just being outside. And you don't get this from your running and your

1194
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,600
swimming. I do, but it's separate. The running or swimming I'm doing for the physical benefits,

1195
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:17,440
primarily. The walking is just for the walking. It's where you think it's where you're outside.

1196
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:21,280
It's where you're looking around. When I'm running, I'm not like, Oh, look how wonderful this is. Do

1197
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:27,120
you run with music? I do, yeah. Swimming, I used to swim a bit. And one of the things people used

1198
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:31,200
to always ask me was, doesn't it drive you crazy that you don't have your phone with you ever?

1199
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:35,760
The whole point. Yeah. And of course nowadays they do have, and I was like, are you kidding?

1200
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:40,400
Like that's the greatest part of swimming is the sound of the water going against your ears.

1201
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:45,440
Or the fact that it's almost like a sensory deprivation tank. So many of the parts that are

1202
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:50,480
normally alive are turned off. And I think this is why the mind becomes more perceptive. And obviously

1203
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,720
you're walking without your phone, without music, without interruption. Are you being deliberate

1204
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,880
about anything? When you, for example, I don't mean to bring this back to meditation all the time,

1205
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:03,680
but one of the things I do enjoy is a walking meditation where you focus on the sensory

1206
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:09,440
experience of walking, both in terms of sound, feel, air moving past you. Are you doing anything

1207
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:14,800
sort of deliberately in that way? The only thing I'd be doing is if I find I'm getting caught up in

1208
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:21,200
something mentally, to just be like, come back to the experience. So that is kind of a meditation.

1209
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:27,600
Yeah. Okay. Walking would be a big one. I mean, I think journaling would be a huge one. We could

1210
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:32,240
talk about the exercise thing. I mean, to me, Austin is the most underrated swimming town in

1211
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:37,280
America. Like Barton Springs is incredible. Deep Eddie is incredible. Just like the nature you can

1212
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:43,520
get here is fantastic. Maybe the other one I would talk about is like a hobby of some kind.

1213
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:51,360
What do you do that's not work? I define some of these hobbies as hobbies where pure effort and

1214
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:57,600
anger or rage can make you accomplish a little bit more like running or lifting weights and hobbies

1215
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:04,240
like golf and archery, where that's the opposite and more effort does not, do you think it's the

1216
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:10,160
latter that are, and I'm biased because I love archery, but. Yeah, no, ideally it's not something

1217
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:16,320
you can win at. It's something. You know, not hobbies where effort equals outcome. Yeah. And

1218
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:22,800
willful will. It's not a willpower related endeavor. I think is painting. If you're an

1219
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,920
athlete, maybe writing is a hobby, right? For me, I can't also write as a hobby because it's my

1220
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:33,360
profession, but I could play sports, right? So having some sort of practice or activity that you

1221
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:38,880
do on a regular basis, for me, it's the farm. Like people go, oh, isn't it a lot of work? And it is a

1222
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:45,520
lot of work, but it's the opposite of my work. So it's restorative. And I think you find people

1223
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:53,200
that they're just, they basically sort of become monks in what they do. And that's a very unbalanced

1224
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:58,160
I think way to live. It's really easy to do this. And I feel like I could be the worst defender of

1225
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:07,600
this. It's tempting to optimize our life so much that there is no downtime. It's tempting to say,

1226
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:16,640
you know, all play is highly structured. There is no just doing nothing. And I guess that's really

1227
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:24,320
one of the beauties of kids as you alluded to is like my middle son who's five, he loves gardening

1228
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:32,560
so much. And he loves Home Depot. It's his favorite place in the world. So really, if you ask him,

1229
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:41,040
like, what is his perfect day? It's getting up, going to Home Depot, getting paint, getting buckets,

1230
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:48,720
getting flowers, coming back, planting them, fixing the hose, painting the fence, all of these things

1231
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:55,200
that one don't even seem like they're fun things to do. But they turn out to be pretty fun. When

1232
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:59,120
you're doing them through that lens, and it would be easy to outsource a lot of that stuff. Oh, come

1233
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:02,320
on, we're not gonna paint the fence. We can hire somebody to paint the fence. And they'll do it

1234
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:07,520
better job. I'm really bad at painting fences. It's funny, because you alluded to this idea that

1235
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:14,160
we expect them to bring a tornado to our lives. And yet, ironically, they can bring stillness,

1236
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:18,480
despite their movement. Yeah, totally. My son loves to get his hair cut. So we go and get hair

1237
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:25,200
cuts. It's a thing. But me getting a haircut by myself is in no way a pleasurable meditative

1238
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:30,960
experience. But when I'm getting with him, it's not the haircut that's the thing. It's the that

1239
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:35,520
we're doing this thing together. Or he wants to go get the mail. Like, you know, there's these

1240
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:40,480
little things that you end up doing. And you realize, that's all that you have to be doing.

1241
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:45,760
And then you're fully present in that thing. You know, like, oh, going and getting the mail is an

1242
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:51,360
activity for him. I think Alexandra Horowitz, she wrote that she wrote that book Inside of a Dog,

1243
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:56,640
about the oomwelt of the dog experience is really great. She wrote another book called I think,

1244
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:01,360
Ways of Seeing or On Looking or something like that. And I've told the story before, but and

1245
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:06,160
it's obviously in her book, so I'm not making it up. But she went on like seven walks with seven

1246
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:12,240
different people in different areas. So she went through on a walk with like a geologist in New York

1247
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:16,560
City. And he was like showing her all the different things you could learn about that. Or she went,

1248
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:21,680
you know, walked through a field with a biologist and different walks with different kinds of people,

1249
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:26,400
you know, a code inspector in a neighborhood. And just like what are they seeing that a normal

1250
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:31,440
person isn't seeing? That's what the premise of the book is. But on this one, she goes on a walk

1251
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,040
around the block where her apartment is with like a two or three year old or two or three year old

1252
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:42,160
son or daughter, I forget. But one of the things I think about that I took from that book,

1253
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:48,720
is she talks about how she thought the walk began when they left the building. But so she's like

1254
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:54,320
interviewing her kid after the kid thought the walk was from there. She's like, we're going on

1255
01:55:54,320 --> 01:56:01,360
a walk. And to the kid, the walk started when they left the apartment and walked to the elevator and

1256
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:07,760
then went down the elevator, and then across the lobby and then out the door. Do you see what I

1257
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:13,040
mean? And so to a kid, that actually is a far walk. That's the other part you don't realize you take

1258
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:19,520
for granted how easy things are for you. But just the idea that the definition of what the is

1259
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:26,400
is, is something kids bring to the table. And as a parent, like, oh, like, yeah, this is what we're

1260
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:31,280
doing. We're like, my son is like, I want to play dirt. Like, it just means he wants to play with

1261
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:34,960
dirt. And it's like, this is what we're doing. We have these expensive toys that could take you

1262
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:39,600
somewhere to do anything. But like, what we're doing is like, we're sitting here, and we're

1263
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:46,320
playing with dirt. And there's a purity to that. And a magic to that, I think that that is as much

1264
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:51,120
stillness as Kennedy in the Missile Crisis. And that I think they're accessing the same place.

1265
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:58,640
And what do you think it was about JFK in, you know, certainly three most stressful moments of

1266
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:04,000
the 20th century, certainly three of the most high stakes moment of the 20th century that could have

1267
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,200
truly altered the course of civilization? What do you think prepared him for that moment?

1268
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,640
In a way, he was like, not prepared. You almost set up to fail in that moment. I mean, like,

1269
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:20,320
if you compare the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy to the Missile Crisis, Kennedy, and then even the events

1270
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:25,040
in between, you're, you're not thinking that's how that's going to go. Had the Bay of Pigs not

1271
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:32,160
happened. So let's assume that when Kennedy comes into office in 61, the CIA has already decided the

1272
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:36,800
Bay of Pigs, you know, yeah, Johnson wanted to rather Eisenhower wanted to do this thing, but

1273
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:40,000
we think it's kind of a dumb idea. And he goes, yeah, yeah, that's a dumb idea. We're not doing

1274
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,680
it. So there's no Bay of Pigs. And yet all the events that unfold in the Cuban Missile Crisis

1275
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:50,080
unfold, does he behave differently? I don't know. I mean, I think it was a variety of factors. I

1276
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:55,040
think one of the biggest ones is that he had read Barbara Tuchman's book, The Guns of August, like he,

1277
01:57:55,600 --> 01:58:04,400
he had some understanding of how badly it could go if he wasn't aware of what was happening as it

1278
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:09,760
was happening, right? Like the idea that we kind of slept walked into this war that we didn't

1279
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:15,120
understand that a lot of people were making very short sighted decisions, decisions that made sense

1280
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:20,240
in the moment, but they weren't thinking about how that decision related to the other decisions,

1281
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:26,480
I think was hugely impactful for Kennedy. I think he'd had some humility to sort of getting his

1282
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:32,720
ass kicked by Khrushchev in some sort of diplomatic exchanges, had made him realize that the job was

1283
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:38,000
really hard and that you can't just go with your gut. You can't just listen to what people say,

1284
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:46,560
that it really required sort of deliberation and consultation and consideration. You know,

1285
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:51,040
his expression says we got to use time as a tool and not as a couch. Just even that the

1286
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:57,040
Missile Crisis takes 13 days, it's kind of impressive. Like you could imagine, let's not

1287
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:02,800
even say, you can imagine George W. Bush does not take 13 days to think that one through,

1288
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:10,800
because it's kind of obvious what you should do. Like our gravest military enemy has put nuclear

1289
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:18,720
missiles 90 miles from the shore of Florida. What you're supposed to do there is like very obvious,

1290
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:24,560
right? You blow the shit out of that, right? And you believe you're 100% justified in doing so,

1291
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:29,120
but it's more complicated than that. You can imagine Bill Clinton, you can imagine Lyndon

1292
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:34,560
Johnson gets called into the Situation Room and there, I don't know if it's the Situation Room

1293
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:40,240
then actually, but so he gets called in and he's like, we got to do it. There are other presidents

1294
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:47,520
who would not have taken 13 days to unwind that. What's also interesting is they all have different

1295
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,280
strengths and weaknesses. You know, I didn't grow up in this country, but I'm still incredibly

1296
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:56,640
fascinated by its history and I'm always impressed by the different character strengths

1297
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:02,400
of different presidents. Johnson being like the master politician, right? The master of

1298
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:06,800
relationships, but maybe in that moment too impatient. If you do move to Texas, you've got

1299
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:12,480
to read the Lyndon Johnson series or the Robert Caro series on Lyndon Johnson, but he talks about how

1300
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:20,880
Kennedy believed that civil rights were so obvious. And so it was such a morally superior position

1301
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:26,400
that all he had to do was say, this is what we're going to do. And of course that would happen.

1302
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:35,120
And Lyndon Johnson, I would say equally believed in that idea, but, or maybe actually believed in

1303
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:41,280
it less, but he knew politically it would be a lot more complicated. And ultimately he was the only

1304
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:47,760
one that was able to get it done. And actually some of Kennedy's sort of moral superiority and

1305
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:55,040
assurance made it harder than it needed to be, right? Like he sort of telegraphed his intentions.

1306
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,600
He basically said like, we are going to pass a civil rights bill. And then this sort of solid

1307
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:04,080
South was like, well, we're going to make that even harder for you now that you've told us what

1308
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:08,800
you're planning to do. Yeah, different strengths and weaknesses certainly, but if you could bottle

1309
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:14,720
whatever he was exhibiting there in that missile crisis, and there are very few leadership

1310
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:18,640
situations that would not be improved by that. It's not like this guy was perfect. It's not like

1311
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:23,920
this guy was without ego. It's not like this guy was the flawless character that you want to believe

1312
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,320
the first time you read a chapter on him in grade school. I mean, he cheated on his wife in the

1313
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:33,920
missile crisis, right? He's expecting that the world could end at any moment and he's spending

1314
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:40,320
that time not at home. So it's not great, but I think what's so fascinating to me about the

1315
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:44,560
missile crisis is it's not just that he slowed it down. He was also incredibly decisive, right?

1316
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:49,920
It's not like he, it was non-negotiable that those missiles were going to go. So it's not like he was

1317
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:55,120
waffling. You see that bad leadership can, that's what he means by a couch. You can use, you could

1318
02:01:55,120 --> 02:02:00,240
take 13 days just to think about it and go swing this way and that way. Kennedy was like, this is

1319
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:07,280
the outcome, but I am very open to a variety of ways to get there. And that's what he figures out

1320
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:12,320
over those 13 days. There's one last topic I want to get to, Ryan, and it's a sort of pivot away

1321
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:16,720
from this, but it's something you've written so extensively about and just on a personal level,

1322
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:23,840
something that has been very helpful to me, which is anger. Let's start with when it's helpful,

1323
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:30,240
when it's not helpful, what is it about anger that can be destructive? What do the Stoics think about

1324
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:36,000
anger? Let's say as a group, they're against it. I mean, Seneca writes a beautiful essay called

1325
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:43,120
Of Anger that's basically a warning to young Nero about the costs and the dangers of anger.

1326
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:50,000
It pops up over and over again in his letters as well. But I mean, anger is one of those things

1327
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,680
where like ego, we're really eager to make excuses for it, like to go, oh, it's part of who I am. It

1328
02:02:55,680 --> 02:03:00,560
helps me what I've done. It's great fuel. When I look at all the times I've lost my temper, I've

1329
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:06,320
been really angry about anything, I never think back going, I'm really glad. You know what I mean?

1330
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:13,360
Like that's different than sort of moral outrage about, like when I hear about something that's

1331
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:20,560
wrong and my immediate reaction is that's not okay, I'm upset that that's the status quo. To me,

1332
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:25,760
that's different than anger in the sort of the temper sense of the word. So maybe if we're making

1333
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:31,600
a distinction that Stoics are very anti-temper. But even Seneca talks about Seneca is like, look,

1334
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:38,160
like someone murdered your father, you'd still get vengeance. You don't want to do it from a place

1335
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:44,480
of anger. And I think he just means that like, there's an objective idea of justice. Not being

1336
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:53,040
angry doesn't mean you accept everything and that you wilt and you tolerate the gravest injustices.

1337
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:58,480
But it's that you're not being jerked around by those reactions. There might be people listening

1338
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:04,000
to this who can relate, but sometimes when we're angry, we actually break inanimate objects. You

1339
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,600
had some really interesting things to say about this recently. You wrote about this in one of the

1340
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:12,880
newsletters. Again, reading it is so funny because it's you write about it in a way that's light,

1341
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,760
but like I can't count the number of inanimate things I've smashed in my life. Not that long

1342
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:21,680
ago, I had, you know, I had, I couldn't find my AirPod. So I had like the regular iPod headphones

1343
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:26,480
and they weren't tank, they were all tangled. I was getting mad. And then it was like, I ripped,

1344
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:31,120
I ripped it apart. And it was like, well, I really punished these headphones. You know what I mean?

1345
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:34,880
And now it's like, I can't do the thing that I wanted to do. Yeah, I do think it's interesting.

1346
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:42,560
Anger can so get ahold of us that we will essentially be talking through our actions

1347
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:49,760
to a stove or a wall or a computer. Yeah, my desk has got, you know, crack in it from where I hit it

1348
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:54,160
because something was right. Yeah, we, I don't think the stokes were perfect. And I feel like

1349
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:58,080
if they were perfect, they wouldn't have talked about anger so much. I think they're talking

1350
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:04,320
about anger because it's a perpetual problem in their life. Think about Marcus Aurelius, like,

1351
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:09,760
have you seen the movie Lincoln? That's, you know, that scene where that sort of argue, I think it's

1352
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:13,600
one of the greatest scenes in all of movies where they're like telling him why he can't do this. And

1353
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:18,960
he's like, he pounds on the table. He's like, I am the president of the United States. He's like,

1354
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:25,120
I am clothed in immense power. That's impotence. Like he's angry at the impotence that he got this

1355
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:31,520
far. This thing is so obvious of passing the 13th amendment is profoundly, obviously the right thing

1356
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,240
to do. It's the only court can't even will it to happen in that moment. That's so much of where

1357
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:40,880
our anger comes from. But then when you even think about that situation, it's not the anger that's

1358
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:46,240
all said, it's that he then leaves that room and he's willing to, to basically do all sorts of

1359
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:52,320
complicated, even some cases, morally dubious things to get where he needs to go. So I thought

1360
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:56,160
about this a lot because I wrote this book about Peter Thiel and his sort of quest to destroy

1361
02:05:56,160 --> 02:06:03,120
Gawker. There's that expression that revenge is a dish best served cold. People think that means

1362
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:10,560
you want to enjoy the fruits of your victory. But it's no, it's a dish best served cold,

1363
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:15,680
which means what they're saying is you don't want to touch a hot plate. You don't want to do it out

1364
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:21,040
of anger because you get burned. Right. And so that's what I think about anger. I think

1365
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:27,360
politically, we've now confused anger and political change. We almost conflate purity

1366
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:32,880
or moral superiority with how angry you are. That's not how you solve any problems.

1367
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:36,080
Do you have a sense of where we are historically on our anger meter?

1368
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:40,880
There is so much moral outrage. It's easy to now lose sight of what,

1369
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:46,880
what's the root and what's the response? Yeah, it's really hard to tell. And I think what's

1370
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:52,080
interesting to me, like people are we on the verge of a civil war? A friend of mine was,

1371
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:56,480
works in DC. He was like, who the fuck's fighting in this civil war? He's like, none of these people

1372
02:06:56,480 --> 02:07:00,720
were. I think that's what's actually interesting about all the anger that we have is that it's

1373
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:08,960
primarily sort of verbal and social. It's not real. Is that because we're not willing to die

1374
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,640
for something anymore? I mean, I just don't like going back to stoic virtues.

1375
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:18,480
Yeah, I think, I think this is all a performance. I think this is largely a performance or it's

1376
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:23,760
almost therapeutic. Like it's a, it's in the way that we used to be really into music. We're now

1377
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:30,160
really just into being angry about political and social issues. Anyways, there are very few problems

1378
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:36,560
to which anger is the solution. And the most serious problems, the ones that are the most

1379
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:42,560
aggravating are the ones that require the most discipline and the least amount of anger. Like I

1380
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:47,840
think about that again, politically, it's like, okay, most of the wrong in the world is not being

1381
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,400
done deliberately. It's being done by people who don't know better, who are ignorant, who are being

1382
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:59,280
manipulated, or in some cases, think they're doing the right thing, right? So anger at those people

1383
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:04,800
is not going to make them change their mind, right? You're not going to yell at someone into waking

1384
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:10,640
up to the bad assumption they've taken in, right? And then there are real bad people in this world.

1385
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:18,160
There's evil and there's sociopaths and there's, there's real bad actors. Those people, you're

1386
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:23,520
certainly not going to yell at a sociopath into not being a sociopath, right? It's like precisely

1387
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:32,960
the most dangerous high stakes situations require our utmost cognitive and rational resources. So

1388
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:36,480
I'm not talking about anger from a place of someone who has no temper, who doesn't get angry

1389
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:43,600
about shit. I'm just stating the fact that less anger is better. The story you led with, or the

1390
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:48,880
example you led with, which you've written about as well, I think is, it's really humbling, which is

1391
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:55,200
go back in time, consider every time you've lost your marbles and ask, when did it accomplish what

1392
02:08:55,200 --> 02:09:02,240
you wanted? When did it actually make the situation better? And I can't say it's never happened,

1393
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:08,480
but it's, I can't remember when it did. Or Seneca talks about like, when you see other angry people,

1394
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:15,520
like just really, like I have some memories of Dove who had a bad anger problem. When I think

1395
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:22,880
about what he looked like angry and just how shockingly immature and childish and ridiculous

1396
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:28,080
and embarrassing it was, you know, you could see his neck and he felt like he was going to drop

1397
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:34,320
dead of a heart attack. I've never seen anything like it. But when we see other people get angry,

1398
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:40,240
we're like, what are you doing? But how he talks about Seneca just talks about looking in the mirror

1399
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:44,880
when you're in, he's like, have you ever actually seen yourself get angry? That was, I think,

1400
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:51,360
day four of the anger. Oh, yeah, sure. Program you put together. Like, did you see that photo in the

1401
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:57,680
March Madness from last year of Tom Izzo? He's the coach at Missouri. He ends up, some player

1402
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:02,560
messed up and he's yelling at him and he's so you got to just just look at this after when you

1403
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:07,600
get so angry. He's like clenches fists. He's clearly he's so angry. You know how at the end of

1404
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:13,280
it, it almost becomes physical, right? He's like trying to physically intimidate a child like,

1405
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:18,560
you know, an 18 year old basketball player. And he's in his face, he's yelling and he's trying to

1406
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:22,240
get his point across. He's it's like almost like a gorilla, you know, the gorilla is like trying to

1407
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:29,200
show don't mess with me. And he's the photo snaps him doing this as another student is another

1408
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:36,000
athlete is stepping in to separate the two like he a child is stepping in between a man yelling

1409
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,880
at another child, right? It ended up a lot of people under rationalize and this is what coaches

1410
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:46,640
do, blah, blah, blah, and there's like no evidence that yelling makes players better. But if we could

1411
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:53,600
get that photo of ourselves, though, whenever we were the most angry, I think it would cut it in

1412
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:59,360
half because you'd be like, I never want to do that again. I agree with that completely. And that was

1413
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:06,320
sort of the first thought I had, which was I need a picture of me like that in my pocket. As a

1414
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:12,800
reminder, as I'm getting worked up, like, don't go here, don't become the Incredible Hulk. Sometimes

1415
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:16,800
I think about like, you know, you have security cameras at your house or whatever I'm wondering,

1416
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:20,720
like, and I know they've caught it before, but I'm actually too scared to look at it. But like,

1417
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:26,560
what would watching an argument between you and your spouse look like, what would you actually

1418
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:30,960
take from that? Like, I almost know what I would take from it. That's why I don't want to watch it.

1419
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:35,200
Do you know what I mean? But like, in the same way, I'm sure you found this with your podcast,

1420
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:41,120
when you listened to your first episode with your you were like, fuck, that's how can anyone listen

1421
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:45,440
to this person? Do you know, like, when I hear my own audio books, I'm like, Oh, this is awful.

1422
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:51,840
I can imagine what looking at yourself in an argument with another person would be just

1423
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:57,520
utterly repugnant. Yeah. You know, and you would realize you do a lot of things that you don't

1424
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:03,440
realize you're doing. Ryan, this has been great. I've been wanting to speak with you for so long,

1425
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:08,080
long before stillness came out, but it just became a great reason to have more than one

1426
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:14,080
thing to talk about. Again, as I said to folks, if they don't already subscribe to the Daily Stoic,

1427
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:19,920
they should what's the best way that people can sort of get ahold of all of the this type of

1428
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:25,120
wisdom that you're you're very generously providing. So I'm at Ryan holiday, most platforms,

1429
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:32,240
rent holiday.net, do stoke calm, do you get the daily dad email? It's I don't and I realize I'm

1430
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:35,760
gonna have to I'm gonna have to bite the bullet and get another email. That's that's the one I

1431
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:39,360
like doing. I got to find some way to combine them or so. I know it's weird that it's two,

1432
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:44,400
but they feel very different to me. So dailydad.com is the other daily one I do each day.

1433
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:48,880
I know I said I would that was my questions. I do have one last question for you. How the hell can

1434
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:54,400
you be so prolific? It's my it's my job. I mean, like I have a practice, I follow the practice

1435
02:12:54,400 --> 02:13:02,160
every day, and it comes out the backside. It's unbelievable. I'm not jealous, nor am I envious,

1436
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:08,160
but incredibly respectful. I think that the process is where it comes from. I personally

1437
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:12,640
am incredibly grateful as a result of that process. And I know that I'm far from the only one. So

1438
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:17,680
thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.
