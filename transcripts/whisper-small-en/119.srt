Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,240
today's episode. My guest this week is author, speaker, and family therapist, Terry Reel. As a

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,320
family therapist and teacher for more than 25 years, Terry's the bestselling author of a number

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,920
of books, including I Don't Want to Talk About It, Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression,

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,000
How Can I Get Through to You?, Reconnecting Men and Women, and I believe his most recent book is

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,920
The New Rules of Marriage, What You Need to Know to Make Love Work. Terry also founded the

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Relational Love Institute, offering workshops for couples, individuals, and patients around

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,160
the country, along with a professional training program for clinicians. Now, if you've listened

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,880
to this podcast for a while, I think on at least three or four episodes, I have brought up Terry's

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,760
name and his book, I Don't Want to Talk About It, and I think I've even alluded to it as probably

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,600
one of the books I have gifted more than any other. I've wanted to interview Terry for quite

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,040
some time now, because I just think that the way he thinks about the relationship between anger

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:01,280
depression and inter-relational strife is so illuminating. I sheepishly worked up the nerve

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,400
to ask him at some point, hey, Terry, would it be okay if I interviewed you? I was just delighted

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,920
that he agreed to it, and he agreed to it on a very short notice, like in a matter of days.

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,600
In this episode, we talk about Terry's background. He grew up with an abusive father, and that has

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,240
turned out to be, well, an awful and unfortunate thing that happened to Terry, probably the greatest

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,440
gift that came to many of us who have been helped by Terry, because it was that relationship with

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,480
his father that really forged his path to become a therapist and to better understand

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,360
male depression and anger. We talk about how trauma during a child's upbringing can shape them

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,400
later in life and how it can be passed on for generations over and over again. We talk about

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,040
why people sometimes need to be in painful situations to have breakthroughs, what it means

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,000
to hit rock bottom, how to live a relational life, and the importance of living with healthy,

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,200
satisfying, rich, emotional connections. We talk a lot about narcissism and touch on

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,320
David Foster Wallace and the idea of how we don't truly know what someone is going through in life,

33
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,760
this idea of being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes. We talk about a lot of

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,680
other things, but I think in the end, I hope you'll just take my word for it that this is worth

35
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,400
investing the time in listening to. I enjoyed this discussion immensely, and I look forward

36
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,160
to sharing it. Without further delay, please enjoy my discussion with Terry Reel.

37
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,480
Terry, thank you so much for making time to speak with me. It's been a long time that I've wanted to,

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,920
I don't know, turn the tables a little bit and ask you the questions.

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,040
Yeah, well, it's a great pleasure to be here. I'm looking forward to an interesting conversation.

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,120
I think I just want to jump into some stuff. Maybe for the listener, I'll tell a little bit

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,240
of a story about how we were connected and then jump into you telling your story. So

42
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,120
about 18 months ago, a woman who I have yet to interview on the podcast, but certainly will,

43
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,480
Esther Perel, who I was working with at the time and still continue to work with, said,

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,600
Peter, you've got me and Laurie as these two amazing therapists in your life, but you don't

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,760
have a male therapist and you need one. And I'd already worked with two or three guys,

46
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,720
but I just didn't have that connection. And she said, I want you to read a book.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,000
And next week when we meet, I want you to tell me what you thought about the book and if the book

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,600
resonated with you. And if it did, I will introduce you to the author. And if it didn't, that's okay.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,280
We'll keep looking. And the book was, I don't want to talk about it. And so I went home, bought the

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:39,000
book, read the book and came back in a week and said, even if not one other person has read that

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,080
book, he wrote it for me and it was worth the effort he put into it. And the rest is sort of

52
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,080
history. So can you start with a little bit about your background, how you grew up?

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,680
Well, I mean, this is a little glib, but people always ask me how I became a family therapist.

54
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,160
And my stock answer is I started at about four. I grew up at Poore in Camden, New Jersey,

55
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,920
a little hanging on by your fingernails, middle-class enclave in a town that was rapidly becoming

56
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:18,680
a ghost town. My parents were under a lot of stress. My father was a loving, smart,

57
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:28,200
violent, emotionally brutal man. And I went to therapy school. I'd already spent four years in a

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,000
doctoral program of literature. And then I went to therapy school after that. And I had to go to

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,160
therapy school to get the skills I needed to talk to this man, to get him to open up to me. And I

60
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,280
needed to understand what the hell had happened to him. I needed to make sense out of my father

61
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,880
and his violence so that I would not repeat it. And I have.

62
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,560
Terry, you described him using three phrases. I might be paraphrasing a little bit, but I could

63
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,520
have sworn you said loving, smart, and brutally violent, or at least violent. Those people don't

64
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,400
think of those as going together. That seems like a contradiction in some way.

65
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah, it does to me to imagine what it felt like to a four-year-old. It's confusing, but real life

66
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,320
is confusing. There are many, many parents who are warm and nurturant when they're warm and

67
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,800
nurturant and they turn on you and they're brutal. That's not an uncommon pattern. And what that does

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:37,080
for a child is it's confusing. It's very confusing. And it breeds a great deal of mistrust because the

69
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,960
rug is always being pulled out from under you. When did that first occur to you that something

70
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,360
wasn't right? I mean, it sounds odd that a four-year-old could be even perceptive that anything

71
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,480
that they're experiencing is not the norm. We've glossed over this, but I do want to go back into

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,880
it. I mean, you weren't exactly the perfect child. You were kind of a bad kid growing up, if I recall,

73
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,800
right? Well, I became a bad kid. I didn't start off as a bad kid. I guess nobody does, right?

74
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah, I was invited to be a bad kid and I took the invitation. And then I was punished for it.

75
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,640
You know, I was the scapegoat child, Peter. You're three... It is an old 12-step. The hero child,

76
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,800
the good one, the achiever, the scapegoat child, the bad one, the rebel, and the lost child, the

77
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,640
one that nobody pays any attention to at all. And I was a scapegoat child. And scapegoat child, I'm

78
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,200
really happy. I feel it's a gift to have been the scapegoat child. The scapegoat child is the one

79
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,960
that wants to bring up to the surface all of the pathology and the truth that's being denied and

80
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,200
suppressed. And they usually do it through action rather than verbs, but they express the family

81
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,560
dysfunction or pathology or ill ease. And then they get punished for it. Or they tell the truth,

82
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,040
they literally tell the truth about the family. And their dad's an alcoholic. Only you would say

83
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,560
that. So I was a scapegoat and I was a truth teller. And now I'm a professional truth teller. And

84
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,320
it's what I do for a living. And instead of getting punished for it, I'm getting paid for it. So

85
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,680
there we are. So it's not a given that when you were sitting there in high school,

86
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,400
you were going to quote unquote make it. Tell me a little bit about that transition from high

87
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,200
school into college. There's a story in your book about, I think your dad even accompanied you off

88
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,160
to college, didn't he? That first trip. Yeah, they did. First of all, oh my gosh, let me go back of

89
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,200
my schooling. The whole thing really started in about second grade. I came home with bad report

90
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,600
card. And you never know what my dad was going to do. I was scared to death, but he looked at it and

91
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:49,880
he threw it on the floor and he laughed. And he said, it's just because those assholes are so

92
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,080
stupid and you're so bright, they don't know what to do with you. Okay. Now the technical term for

93
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,280
my father was doing just then it's called false empowerment. He was pumping me up. It was no

94
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,840
favor to a little boy. I didn't get good grades in school until I got to college. I went through

95
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:15,640
elementary, junior and high school. I figured out that if I showed up every other week, that would

96
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,160
be enough to get a D average. And that's what I did. And then I went to the boardwalk in Atlantic

97
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,320
city and I sat down at Woolworth and I'd spend the whole day writing and I would show up at school

98
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,520
once every 10 days to two weeks. I was going to go to Europe and be a writer, but I got a 1A in

99
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,720
the draft, which is a whole other story. I was scared to death. And I went to college to get out

100
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,960
of the draft and I had no grades. So the only college you would accept me was Atlantic community

101
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,400
college. And that's where I spent my first year and I needed to get out. And I got all A's because

102
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,080
I wanted to get out. And then I transferred from there to Rutgers. My mother and my father came to

103
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:04,520
visit me. They stood out like sore thumbs. I was completely embarrassed by their blatantly blue

104
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,960
collar out of placeness. The last word my father said before he left me was keep your nose to the

105
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,520
grindstone and your pecker dry, which to this day, I don't really quite know what the hell that was

106
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:27,880
supposed to mean. And my mother, who was six foot and obese, banged on the car that I was driving

107
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,720
off in with friends, banged on the car so that the guy jammed on his brakes and then she gave me a

108
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,320
little wave and I kissed goodbye. Were you the oldest of your siblings? No, no. And in true birth

109
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,600
order, the older one is more the hero child usually. And the second one is the scapegoat.

110
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,880
Older one goes to father. Second one goes to mother if you have two boys. So the story goes

111
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,080
anyway. That's what happened to me. I have a fraternal twin brother. He's six minutes older than

112
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,960
I am. And he's every inch the older brother and I'm every inch the younger brother. How much did you

113
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:11,880
know at the time of your father's pathology in his upbringing, what brought pain into his life?

114
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,640
Oh, nothing. He wouldn't talk to me. He wouldn't talk to me about anything of consequence,

115
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,560
let alone his own life. And it wasn't until I was in my late twenties and I'd already become a

116
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,800
therapist that I finally had enough skill to persist and be gentle enough to get through his

117
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,160
defenses. And finally, at about 28, 29 years old, he told me his story, which is a pretty horrific

118
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:46,440
story in its own right. Can you tell us some of that story? Sure. My father's mother died when he

119
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:56,040
was nine. It was during the depression in America. He had a younger brother. He was 11. His younger

120
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:03,400
brother was nine. His mother was dead. His father, who he describes as a passive loser of a man,

121
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,480
owned a little candy store and lost it. The family broke up and lived in various people's houses. And

122
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:19,560
one day in a fit of depression, my father's father tried to kill him and his brother and himself.

123
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,640
He tried to gas him in the garage by this car. My father remembers his father

124
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,360
cradling him in his arms and saying,

125
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,320
and at 11, my father knew there was something horribly wrong. And he began to fight. So the

126
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,320
story goes, and he kicked the window out of the car and that woke his father up. And he grabbed

127
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:50,520
his little brother and got out of the car. And according to my father, that was the last

128
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,920
real authentic contact he had with his father for the rest of his life.

129
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:03,160
So it's safe to probably assume that his father also inherited a legacy of pain that may have

130
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,200
gone beyond just the experiences he had and the loss of his wife. Yes, I think that's right. I

131
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,880
think depression runs up and down my family. I've struggled with depression in my day. I am

132
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,840
gratefully on antidepressants as we speak and happily so. I'm sure that my grandfather was

133
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,400
subject to depression and his circumstances were dire. So when you talk about your dad,

134
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,720
you said brutal, loving, smart, but you didn't say depressed. So how does depression fit into

135
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,880
what your father was experiencing and also lashing out? Well, there's a saying in A.A.,

136
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:51,080
they say, hurt people, hurt people. And as you know, central to my work on masculinity is the

137
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:59,320
translation of shame and the grandiosity of feeling less than inadequate, unlovable somehow,

138
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:06,200
to the one down of shame. And then you flip into the one up of grandiosity, superiority,

139
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:13,640
better than attack, avenging angel, righteous indignation. And this, I believe, is the dynamic

140
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:22,280
of abuse and most violence on this planet. And it's central to masculinity and traditional manhood,

141
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:31,720
the flip from the one down victim to the one up avenger. Anyway, what's devilish about shifting

142
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,880
from shame and the grandiosity from injury to attack is it works. It makes you feel better in

143
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,440
the short run. It just creates havoc in your life. And that's what happened with my father.

144
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,520
My father despised vulnerability because he despised his own father. He saw his father as weak

145
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:59,800
and he despised weakness ever since. And so when I was in his eyes, weak, precisely when I was

146
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,440
vulnerable is when he would attack. He was punishing his own father and punishing his

147
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:13,560
own vulnerability. It was a hyper masculine response to trauma. Does that make sense to you,

148
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,880
what I'm saying? It does. How prevalent do you think this is? I mean, it's possible. I think

149
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,280
if I just consider the sampling of my own population of male patients, which maybe males

150
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,600
make up two thirds of my patients, 60% say, I wonder just how prevalent this is in the lives

151
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:41,160
of people who haven't been maybe so literally abused the way your father was. Yeah. Well,

152
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,160
I wasn't, I mean, I was actually, my father did get physical, but there are many, look,

153
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:56,200
one of my great mentors, a woman named P.M.E.L.D.I. defined trauma or injury as any significantly

154
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,680
less than nurtured transaction between parent and child. Any significantly less than nurturing

155
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:10,120
transaction between parent and child injures the child. Now that's a whole range, of course,

156
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:17,080
and we're all imperfect. And it's exactly our parents imperfections and how we adapt to them

157
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,840
that shapes what most people would call our character. I call it our adaptive child itself,

158
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:30,520
but at any rate, we're all shaped by injuries. The question is, are they part of the imperfect

159
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,000
dealings of being a human being with other human beings? Is there repair? Is there accountability?

160
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,680
Is there something beyond the rupture or is it just injury and rupture? My model for relationships

161
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:54,120
comes from Ed Tronic, who was the pioneer of infant observational research. He actually stuck

162
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:01,240
a camera in front of mothers and babies and saw what they did. And Ed believes that the basic rhythm

163
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,560
of all relationships is harmony, disharmony, and repair. Closeness, disruption, and a return

164
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,400
to closeness. And in my dysfunctional family and in all the dysfunctional families I've treated

165
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:21,080
over the years, there's little to no repair. The repair process has gotten jammed up somehow. And

166
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:28,440
so there's just injury and then you live with it until the next injury. So it's not the disharmony

167
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,320
you're saying. It's not the harmony to disharmony that's the problem. It's the inability to go from

168
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,560
disharmony to repair. Right. At the upper levels, we all heard our kids, we're all imperfect.

169
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,680
I told a story about putting Justin's hockey shoes on the wrong feet. Why don't you tell that story

170
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:51,960
actually? I think it is a great illustration that any parent can relate to. Yeah. Well, we were

171
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,680
really rushed. Justin was a hockey player, which is sports in general is completely not my domain.

172
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:05,000
My kid is a total jock. He's been really disappointed in some ways that he doesn't have a Boston sports

173
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,720
dad. And I appreciate that. He says, I'm going to go to South boss Irish South Boston, and I'm

174
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,560
going to find a beer drinking Trump supporting real father, which has nothing but sports all day.

175
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,680
That ain't me. Anyway, we were playing hockey. I was already feeling a little overwhelmed because

176
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,080
it's not my domain. We were late. He was whiny. I was putting his shoes on. The parents were trying

177
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,080
to talk to me. I was trying to get them out on the ice. He goes out on the ice, comes back. He

178
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:41,080
must have been like, I don't know, eight or nine, comes back. 10 minutes later said, my feet hurt.

179
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,520
My boots are killing me. And they'll come on Justin. Just go out there and play.

180
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,600
I think he's got his skates on right now, you're saying.

181
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,480
Yeah, his skates. Yeah. And then he does, obedient little boy. And he plays this little

182
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,400
hard out. When I'm taking his skates off at the end of the game to my horror, there were two red

183
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,840
pre blisters on his feet. I had put the damn shoes on the wrong feet.

184
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,720
But here's what I say when I tell this story. If it had been justina instead of Justin,

185
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:23,160
would I have been so firm or would I have listened to my daughter? And I think the honest answer is,

186
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:31,560
I would have listened more. This is masculinity. In that moment, I was the voice of patriarchy

187
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:38,360
inflicting itself on my son. You've spoken about this patriarchal model that is, I mean,

188
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,920
it's really everything you rail against, isn't it? You're not a fan of this. Can you vent a little

189
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:49,320
bit more about this? Because for many men, it's all we've known. I mean, it is, you describe,

190
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,280
we're going to get to what relational living means, which is, I mean, I think prior to meeting

191
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,440
you, I didn't, I just couldn't have fathomed what you were talking about. So if you pause for a

192
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,360
moment, that's a hell of a sentence that just came out. Sure. That's a big sentence. And you speak

193
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:14,440
for an awful lot of men, most, many, many, many of the men that I see simply don't know what living in

194
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:23,800
healthy, satisfying, rich, emotional connection feels like. They just don't know what, what are

195
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,520
you talking, it's Greek. Yeah, it is a little bit abstract. And it's, if it hasn't been modeled for

196
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,880
you, which it's not generally, that's not a common model. I would, that's the less common model,

197
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,520
I guess I would say. I don't, can't speak to prevalence again, but say a little bit more

198
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,320
about this. What is it that you're talking about as the norm? Let's start with what this sort of

199
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,720
traditional model is. Sure. Well, there are a number of ways of saying it. The simplest

200
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,880
way of saying it is when I mean patriarchy, I'm talking about traditional gender roles

201
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,520
for men and women. And I mean, traditional pre-feminism, but still very much with us.

202
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,240
So the traditional role for women is everybody's written about for the last 50 years,

203
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,880
is to be accommodating and resentful, to lose their voice. Carol Gilligan wrote this back in the

204
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,240
80s in a different voice. And she wrote about the women's loss of voice, loss of authentic

205
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,720
connection about the edge of adolescence, 13, 14, they fall prey to what Carol calls the tyranny

206
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:32,440
of the nice and the kind. And they lose their voice, they stop telling the truth, they start being,

207
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,000
to be honest, manipulative. That's part of the traditional female role.

208
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:45,000
So traditionally what you've got is an accommodating resentful woman. And on the other side,

209
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,040
you have a shutdown driven, inwardly haunted, outwardly successful. One of the things I say,

210
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:59,800
Peter, maybe you'll be able to read this. One thing I say is an inwardly shame-based, outwardly

211
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:08,360
driven man, coupled with an inwardly resentful, outwardly accommodating woman. That's America's

212
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,080
power couple, man. You're a successful couple in the world. Well, it's a dangerous combination

213
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,960
because there's not enough inertia to question it or challenge it internally. That probably doesn't

214
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,280
make sense what I'm saying, but I think you know what I mean. It doesn't have enough of a forcing

215
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,480
mechanism to call into question, whereas at least if one of those two phenotypes is different,

216
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,720
there could be more tension that drives a change potentially. And then feminism hit and there was

217
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,480
tension that drove the change. And I'm going to say something and maybe some of your listeners

218
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:52,840
will push back on this, but I believe that in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, here's a question, Peter. What

219
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:01,640
value is shared by mainstream patriarchal culture and almost virtually all of the so-called

220
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,600
counterculture personal growth movements? What value is shared by mainstream and counterculture?

221
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,080
Probably some semblance of independence or freedom.

222
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,520
Yeah, you're close. The sanctity of individualism. Personal growth is personal growth.

223
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:30,680
Not relational growth. And so I summarized personal growth or personal empowerment

224
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,200
as I was weak, now I'm strong, go screw yourself. And it was big. I lived through that revolution

225
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,920
in the 70s and the 80s and women were mad at us guys and I was weak, now I'm strong. I'm going

226
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,360
to stand back and say it in the old way I want to and you best listen and like it. Okay, that's a

227
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,640
step in the right direction, but I think there's another step and if I can be so bold as to be a

228
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,720
male therapist, but I have been doing feminist family therapy for 40 years. Look, the next step

229
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:09,560
is loving voice. When women move from voicelessness and resentment to finally, I call it a stashing

230
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,560
blow, I see it all the time in my office. Finally, when women do speak, they often speak in ways that

231
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,720
are so aggressive that nobody in the right mind can listen to them. So relational empowerment

232
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,040
is the next step. Relational empowerment is I'm going to be strong and loving at the same time,

233
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,320
in the same breath. You see, I believe that under the patriarchal system,

234
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,400
there's a little bit abstract, but let me say it. Under the patriarchal system, one can either be

235
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:47,720
connected or powerful, but you can't be both at the same time. Let me say that again. Under

236
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,400
patriarchy, which is a system we're all in, we're fish and patriarchy is the water. Under the system

237
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,040
we're all in, you can either be connected, that's affiliative feminine, or you can be powerful,

238
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:06,360
that's independent masculine, but you can't be both at the same time. When women do become powerful

239
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:13,480
and when they did as a movement back in the 70s and 80s, it was a lot of the women in my office,

240
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,680
I say to them, after 50 years of feminism, you have earned the right to be as obnoxious as men

241
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:27,480
have always been. Congratulations. The next step is loving voice. That's true for both men and women.

242
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,120
That's standing up for yourself and cherishing the other person in the relationship in the same

243
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,880
breath. Honey, I love you to pieces. Could you please tone down the way you're speaking to me

244
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,800
right now so I can hear you versus I don't like how you're talking to me. Anyways, the same thing.

245
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:50,280
Yeah, you've talked a lot about this idea of enlightened self-interest. This might be one

246
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:58,600
example of it. Yeah, because under the patriarchy is linear, and there are two aspects of patriarchy

247
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,400
for men, the essence of traditional masculinity is twofold. One is the denial of vulnerability.

248
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,760
The more invulnerable you are as a man, the more manly you are, the more vulnerable, the more

249
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,920
girly you are. It's like physics. It's just straightforward. It's misogyny. It's my dad.

250
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:23,560
It's despising the vulnerable. And then the second issue is the delusion of dominance.

251
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:31,560
God gives Adam dominion over the earth, which is really a bad idea. The Greeks knew better. The

252
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,240
Greeks spoke about hubris. Placing yourself above nature was the tragic flaw in every Greek tragic

253
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,800
figure. They knew better. They knew about humility. The delusion of dominance, feeling that you are

254
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,480
over nature, that you have the right, the entitlement, and even the responsibility

255
00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:00,680
to be above nature is a core delusion that will kill us. If the nature that you're above is your

256
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:09,880
wife or your kids or your body or your own thinking, or it's the planet at large, Mother Nature,

257
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,480
don't worry about it. We'll cook up something in the lab and take care of it. We'll kill ourselves

258
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,480
if we don't come out of this delusion. That's the masculine part of the traditional gender role.

259
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:29,320
Cut off and false empowerment. You alluded to shame earlier. I want to go back to that because I think

260
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,280
it sets the stage for some of the other concepts that I want to explore. Can you explain the

261
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,480
difference between shame and guilt? Yeah. Well, this is Renee Brown. I used to say

262
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,040
healthy shame and unhealthy shame, but she kind of ruined that, made shame bad altogether. So,

263
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:52,360
for simplicity's sake, healthy self-esteem, let's start off with that. That's one of those things

264
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,240
that everybody talks about and who really defines it. What does it really mean, healthy self-esteem?

265
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,040
It means the capacity to cherish yourself, to esteem yourself, healthy self-esteem,

266
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:11,160
to esteem yourself in the face of your imperfections and screw-ups. What you do,

267
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,040
and I have to teach this to people in general, men in particular, what you do is just what we want

268
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:25,640
to do with our children when they screw up. You hold the person in warm regard. You cast a very

269
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,120
sober eye on the bad behavior. Feel bad about the bad behavior you've done, but don't take yourself

270
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,840
apart as a person. You're a good, flawed person who screwed up. You're fine. Learn from it,

271
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:47,320
make amends, and get on with it. Shame is I'm a bad person. Shame is I feel bad about the behavior.

272
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,840
I feel bad about who I am as a person. And it eats you up alive. It is, for many of us,

273
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,760
a constant companion. For those of us who are unloved or shamed as children, we contend with

274
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:09,400
that a lot. And shame is the feeling of unworthiness, impotence, helplessness, unloveability,

275
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,240
defectiveness. Why does it happen though, Terry? Is it something we are born? Is it the default

276
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,080
setting that we're born with? I don't believe so. I believe that we're shamed. We're shamed as

277
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:29,480
children by either being neglected and abandoned somehow and or by being mistreated and misaligned

278
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:37,320
somehow. And we take on that shame and we feel bad about ourselves usually.

279
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,920
Now guilt is feeling bad about the bad behavior. And one of the things that I teach, particularly

280
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:49,000
men, is when you go from some sort of acting out, some offensive behavior, when you're in doing that

281
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,920
offensive behavior, you're in a state of grandiosity. You're entitled. You're better than. You deserve

282
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:01,320
it. So you're in a state of grandiosity and you're in a state of self entitlement and self

283
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,640
preoccupation. When you go from that, when you go from inflation to deflation, from I deserve to

284
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,880
I'm a big shit, what I tell my guys is you go from one form of self preoccupation to guess what,

285
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,400
another form of self preoccupation just went from positive to negative. You know what? Here's what

286
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,280
I want you to do, Bill. I'm sitting with Bill and his wife and Bill just screwed up. Here's what I

287
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,560
want you to do. What I want you to do is what my kids tell me. I want you to get over yourself.

288
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,360
I want you to stop thinking about what a shit you are and start thinking about how you hurt your

289
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:42,120
wife. Pay attention to her. Feel bad for her. Make amends to her. Let the energy go out to her.

290
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,320
Now shame's really hard to get over. I understand that. I'm going to give you 60 seconds. Ready, go.

291
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,360
And they do. They come out of shame.

292
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,720
But do they need your permission? I mean, do you think that, and again, we could even use examples

293
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:04,440
of patients. Is there a sense of I feel guilty about what I've done? The right thing to do is to

294
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,160
dwell on it for a very long period of time and despise myself for it?

295
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,240
Yeah, right. For all the good it does.

296
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,400
For all the good it does. Well, notwithstanding the lack of productivity, but is that the underlying

297
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,360
sort of emotional logic behind shame, or at least in the example you gave of Bill?

298
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Oh, no, it goes way beyond that. Look, most shame starts in childhood,

299
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:38,840
and there are big forces at play. First of all, I was an exception. Most children,

300
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,200
if you mistreat them, if you're harsh to them, if you don't meet their needs, they will blame

301
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:53,560
themselves. And they will try to contort themselves into whatever the parent needs

302
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:02,280
in order to win that connection and love with love-seeking animals. And you blame yourself.

303
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:08,280
You try and get that parent back in the connection with you. You start reading them. This is the gift

304
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:15,560
of the drama of the gift of child, the gift. You read them. You blame yourself. And you see,

305
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,920
Peter, it's compassionate to blame yourself because you're feeling bad for your... When my father

306
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,960
would beat me, I would feel bad for him. That's a meshman. I would feel sorry for him. He was

307
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:32,200
pathetic to me. At what age, Terry, does that a four-year-old would experience that, or is that

308
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:40,280
a 10-year-old's experience? Five to six. The point being, for most children, it's safer to

309
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:48,520
blame yourself than to come to grips with a random hostile universe. It makes a lot more sense that

310
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,240
I brought this on myself. That means that if I do something different, I might be able to control it,

311
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,680
versus the people who are supposed to protect me from the world are inflicting me with the brutality

312
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,960
of the world, and I'm completely in their care and helpless. That is a scary thought.

313
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:13,560
So people do shame to protect themselves. And people also do shame because this is complicated.

314
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:22,840
It's a multi-generational legacy. My father beat his depression into me with a strap.

315
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:31,720
His father beat the depression into my father with gas. We pass this on from generation to

316
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,160
generation until somebody does something about it. One of the most profound things I remember you've

317
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,000
ever said to me, and again, I think I don't... Maybe you were paraphrasing, but I wrote it down

318
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and I see it often in my journal, is every man is a bridge spanning two legacies, the one he inherits

319
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,960
and the one he passes on. Did I get that about right?

320
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,640
You got that absolutely right. And let me give you another one. They say it's not

321
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,760
a pretension to quote yourself, but I do it in this one. I'll butcher it, but here it goes.

322
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:10,600
Family pathology rolls from generation to generation like a fire in the woods,

323
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:19,240
taking down everything in its path until one person in one generation has the courage to turn

324
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:26,840
and face the flames. That person brings peace to his ancestors and spares the children that

325
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,840
follow. That's what I'm about. I'm about facilitating that.

326
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,000
What's the natural history of not doing anything about this? I mean, is this literally

327
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,720
something where you could say, look, shame, will the laws of entropy basically dictate?

328
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:49,640
Shame will always propagate unless there is deliberate and active attention brought to halt it?

329
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,040
Yes, because even the best of parents will injure, will neglect. Oh, honey, I'm sorry,

330
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,320
you skinned your knee. Let me just... Oh, Doris, let me call you back. Okay. And you know what?

331
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,800
You should have hung up the phone and dealt with the knee on the spot. That's a little misalignment.

332
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,600
That's a little injury. That's normal. It's part of human development. It's okay. The child cries,

333
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,880
maybe in a very safe house, the child says, Mommy, why don't you just bang up the phone?

334
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, honey. And there's repair. And this is the kind of traffic that is part of

335
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,680
being human. That part's fine. But when you start going lower down on the spectrum, then things get

336
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:42,760
a lot less fine. How does one differentiate between preventing the propagation of shame or

337
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,680
trauma and the over coddling of kids? Because right now the pendulum has really swung the other

338
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,120
way in society where there are books about this entire topic of how we've coddled an entire

339
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,560
generation. And as a result of that, there's an entitlement and a whole bunch of other things

340
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,520
that are the result of it. Internally, I have my own litmus test, but I don't know that it's worth

341
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,760
much. I'm very curious as to how an expert thinks about this. I don't know that I have a

342
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,760
particular formula. I would say trust your gut and civilize the little creatures. The thing is

343
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,760
that you have to understand self-esteem. Like the California, no offense, the California drive for

344
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,360
self-esteem was so misguided. It just made me pull my hair out. What most people think of as

345
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,400
self-esteem is confidence and mastery. Okay, that's fine. That's what it is. But that ain't self-esteem.

346
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,360
Self-esteem is spiritual. It's ontological. You have worth and dignity as a human being because

347
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,840
you're here on this planet and your worth cannot be better or worse than the guy to the left and

348
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,840
the guy to the right of you. No matter what you say or do, it can't be attitude. It can't be

349
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,520
subtracted from. It's a spiritual fact. You know this as a doctor, Peter. This is part of the

350
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,920
Hippocratic oath. If one guy is pulled into the ER and he's a skid row bomb and the other one's

351
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:08,040
state senator, by the book at any rate is triage based on need because you don't triage based on

352
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:16,360
status. That's grotesque. Every person is equal. We know this in the abstract, but we don't live it

353
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,680
unless you do some of the work that I invite you to do. You don't live like that. You judge other

354
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,360
people as better than or less than and you judge yourself as better than or less than all day long.

355
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I have to tell you, I've been doing recovery work for 30, 40 years ever since I was a teenager.

356
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:43,560
At 69, I don't do that anymore inside my head. I don't go up and I don't go down.

357
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,440
Not much. That's not my baseline. And if I do nine out of ten times, I'll catch it.

358
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:56,760
It's a lot better living like this than it was living like that. I help men and women move from

359
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:03,480
that to this all day long. That's what I do for a living. Say more about the up and the down. You've

360
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:11,000
alluded to it already with the one up one down cycle, but say a little bit more about that.

361
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,680
I suspect that resonates for people when it's described in some detail. Yeah. The field of

362
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,920
psychotherapy and self-help and all that for 50 years has done a great job of figuring out how

363
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:30,120
people come up from the one down of shame. Hope will win for you. All this stuff has been great

364
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:36,840
in the trauma techniques and therapy. We've done a terrible job of the other self-esteem disorder,

365
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:43,240
helping people come down from the one up of grandiosity and their flip sides of the same

366
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:50,200
coin, one down, one up, inferiority, superiority. And it's our grandiosity that gets us into so

367
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,360
much trouble in our relationships. Shame is an implosion. Grandiosity is acting out or some kind

368
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,880
of explosion. The great secret that I run around the country telling therapists is this.

369
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:11,080
Shame feels bad. Grandiosity feels good. That's the open secret. It feels good to get drunk. It

370
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,320
feels good to get high. It feels good to make out with your secretary. It feels good to tell

371
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:21,080
your boss to shove his job. In the moment that you're being grandiose, it's like an intoxicant.

372
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:28,280
It feels good. So you have to think your way down from grandiosity. It takes a smarter person

373
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,560
and you think your way down. You come down from grandiosity, even though it feels good,

374
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,720
because it's in your interest to come down from it.

375
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,280
Are men more susceptible to grandiosity than women?

376
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:49,880
Well, men's grandiosity in this culture tends to be more overt. Men tend to lead from the one up

377
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:57,080
grandiose position and have covert shame. Tend to. There are tons of exceptions. Whereas women tend

378
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,440
to lead more from the victim one down position and have covert issues of grandiosity.

379
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:10,040
So we're complements for each other. Yeah, let's go over that a little bit more, because in the book,

380
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:17,080
I don't want to talk about it. You talk a lot about overt and covert depression, and it's the

381
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:23,880
opposite of that, as you said, the on average for what it's worth. Men tend to be more covert in

382
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,240
their depression. Women more overt. Explain that distinction. Well, when I first wrote,

383
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,240
I don't want to talk about it. Depression was seen as a woman's disease. This was the first

384
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,720
book that had ever been written about male depression. Nobody said that phrase. What year

385
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:46,200
was the first edition of that? Early nineties? Late 90s, 97, 98. And the idea was that women

386
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,560
were two to four times more prone to depression than men. The subtitle of my book I don't want

387
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:58,440
to talk about is the hidden epidemic of depression in men. And it's hidden for two reasons. The first

388
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,840
is that men are ashamed of it. It's not unwominably to be depressed. It is unmanly to be

389
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:12,120
overwhelmed by feelings and vulnerable. So women face the stigma of a mental disorder, but men

390
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:19,160
feel that very personally. It feels like they're unmanned by this disorder, and they're ashamed of

391
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,120
it, and they hide it. And the people around them will often collude with their hiding it. Family

392
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:32,120
physicians are the first line of defense in depression, and 70% of them do not diagnose

393
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:38,120
a patient with depression. The studies indicate. And I believe it's because we're afraid to

394
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,560
unmask that poor man and further shame him. Wives are like that. Kids are like that. Everybody gets

395
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:53,240
very protective. Some men do such a good job of hiding the depression that they hide it from

396
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,600
themselves. And this is what I call covert depression. And what you see is not the depression

397
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:05,720
so much, but the defenses the man is erected to defend against the depression. And you see acting

398
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:13,080
out. You see sexual acting out. You see porn addiction. You see self-medication. You see anger.

399
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:19,720
You see sudden isolation and withdrawal. I talked about the unholy triad of covert depression,

400
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:27,160
radical isolation, anger, and acting out. Sexual acting out. And of course,

401
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:34,040
the self-medication includes drinking and drugging. If you look at women and men, look at what I now

402
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:41,160
call overt depression, it's like two to four times more women than men. If you add into the grid

403
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,560
domestic violence and alcoholism and drugs, it comes right back up to equal.

404
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,800
And we know things like, for example, in areas where men lose their job, there's a dramatic

405
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,400
rise in domestic violence. And the missing billiard ball in the middle between those two

406
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:06,280
points is depression, low self-esteem. And what happens to men with covert depression is what

407
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,960
I've been talking about all evening, which is the transliteration or shame in the grandiosity

408
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:20,600
of helplessness into righteousness, of victimhood into attack. And that translation of shame into

409
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:28,680
grandiosity, helplessness into attack, is a central motif of traditional American masculinity.

410
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,360
Look at all the adventure of movies. I wrote about this and I don't want to talk about it.

411
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:40,120
Rambo. These guys are innocent guys who are pressed to the wall by bad guys.

412
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,560
And then finally, about halfway through the movie, they pick up an Uzi and start blowing people away.

413
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:52,760
And we cheer. We cheer. The move from shame to grandiosity feels like the swell of empowerment

414
00:43:53,320 --> 00:44:00,680
and we get drunk on it, but it's silent. It's emotionally violent. It's violent to the person

415
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,120
you're grandiose to and it does violence to your own soul.

416
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,200
And this comes back to the sort of patriarchal society which places a value on that strength.

417
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,880
I mean, what do you think biologically or socially accounts for that distinction?

418
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:23,000
We could wrestle around this one for a long, long. Most of the people in my field are not

419
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,720
saying, is it biological or is it cultural and social? That's not the question for almost anybody

420
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:36,040
anywhere. The question now is how do they interact? Because it's both. It's both. Of course it's both.

421
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,360
But just because something's biological doesn't necessarily mean that we should cede

422
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:49,080
to it. Aggression is biological. Freud said the first man to hurl an epithet instead of a rock

423
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:55,160
was the creator of civilization. We have all sorts of impulses that are biological, but that doesn't

424
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,840
necessarily mean we're supposed to go with them. The thing between our raw biological impulses

425
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:08,760
and our behavior is called civilization. Yeah. You've talked a little bit about this idea in the

426
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:15,080
past that you've written about it, that the steps to sort of fixing this. So if everything we've

427
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:23,080
talked about is recognizing this, how hard is that? How long does it take for you with a patient?

428
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,600
I know you work a lot with couples. Do you work individually with men and women equally

429
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,880
or disproportionately with one or the other? No, I work disproportionately with men. I'll see a

430
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,720
woman now and again, but I do mostly couples. You see, and I don't know, somebody may correct me on

431
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:47,800
this, but what I do is I teach people how to live relational lives, how to open their hearts, how to

432
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,800
open their voices, how to listen, how to respond without getting defensive and egotistical, how to

433
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,680
do this, how to live relationally. It's what we're born for. It's the only thing that really makes us

434
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:04,920
happy. And I do believe that the best way of teaching somebody how to live a relational life

435
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,880
is to get their partner and maybe their kids in and work on the relationship, but rather than do

436
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:17,640
it abstractly on the side. Do you find that most men need to be in crisis to hear what you're saying

437
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:25,960
right now? Yeah, I had a guy, an older gentleman, a very successful businessman, and we started

438
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,000
talking about men and grandiosity, and he got very resonant with it. And he came to me and he said,

439
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:40,280
I have a young colleague that I just, I have brought on to our team, and he's the most brilliant young

440
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,440
man I've ever met, but he's so narcissistic. It's impossible to work. What do I do? And I sadly said

441
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,760
to him, I think he's too young. I think that life hasn't roughed him up enough yet. You have to start

442
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:01,240
to get it that your old tricks are not working. And for some men, particularly if they're successful

443
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:07,960
and wealthy, they're shielded from those consequences, but it's not, it doesn't do them good. Yes, you

444
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:16,200
want a crisis. Look, the so-called midlife crisis in men is, this is my read on it. The midlife

445
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,320
crisis comes at whatever age when you've peaked, when you're at the top of your game, and you either

446
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:29,080
feel that the masculine agenda is something that you have failed. You have not caught the brass

447
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,840
ring. You're not rich enough. You're not smart enough. Or you feel that the agenda has failed you.

448
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,400
You have the brass ring. I deal a lot with high rollers. You have the brass ring. Guess what? You're

449
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,360
as miserable as you were before. So that's kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't realization

450
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:53,720
that seems to suggest, as you said, once you reach a point at which either you've reached or achieved

451
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:00,280
whatever success is supposed to be, if you deem it to be hollow, you're hosed. And if you haven't

452
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,720
achieved it, you're hosed because you're Willie Lohman or pick your favorite example, right?

453
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:11,240
Right. That's right. You fail or the agenda fails you. And that's a great opportunity.

454
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,320
I like crisis as a family therapist. The other crisis, of course, for men

455
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:21,720
is there are women who are, if they're gay, they're male partners. I like to say that most of the men

456
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:30,200
I treat are what I call wife mandated referrals. They've been sent or their marriage is in crisis

457
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,080
or they've already separated from their wife for 30 years and they're a wreck. But there's some

458
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:41,080
sort of crisis in their relationships is driving them deeper. In your book, you certainly, most of

459
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:45,640
the case studies fit that description, right? I'm trying to remember, is there an example of a man

460
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:52,520
in the book who just showed up on his own doing sort of self exploration and introspection?

461
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,640
Yeah, there are a few. There are a few and I love them dearly. There was a young fella, Kurt,

462
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:08,120
who came from the Midwest. He was the farmer's son. He came to me because he couldn't get girls.

463
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,920
He couldn't get past the first date. This is deconstructing patriarchy. So I said,

464
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:19,800
well, what do you do? Because he was a good looking guy and he was intelligent. He said, well, I just,

465
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:26,040
I tell them that I do this and I do that and I'm capable of this and I've won that award. And

466
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:32,520
I said, wait a minute, what are you doing? That's not a date. That's a resume. And he said to me,

467
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,960
I just figure I've only got one shot, so I better make it good.

468
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:45,800
It's funny, but it's sad. Well, it's patriarchy. Men are taught that just being who you are is not

469
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,960
enough. You have to earn connection through achievement and turn your back on relationship.

470
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,520
I call this the Icarus syndrome. You have to leave Harth and home, go fly into the sun to be worthy

471
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,800
of, guess what? Harth and home. You're the one that left to begin with. They're waiting for you.

472
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:10,280
This happens all the time. Guys go off and work 100 hours a week to be worthy of the white kids

473
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,160
who just want them to come home already. Where does that come from? Where is that drive coming

474
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,760
from? Where is this inferiority coming from? Does it all stem from this shame that you've talked

475
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:30,360
about, the seeds of which are sown in little boys? Yes. We're taught to supplement the lack of

476
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:39,320
inside out healthy self-esteem with outside in false self-esteem. And there's three, this is PIA.

477
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,200
There's three. There's performance-based esteem. I have worse because of what I can do. And that's

478
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:51,400
a big one for men. There's other-based esteem. I have worse because you think I do. And of course,

479
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,320
push to extreme, that's love addiction and that's big for women. And then you have, I have worse

480
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,600
because of what I have. I have big muscles. I have a beautiful wife. I have in Boston, I have a kid

481
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:08,440
at Harvard. That's the be all and end all. Attribute-based esteem is what our culture runs on.

482
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,800
If everybody woke up tomorrow with healthy self-esteem and full recovery, our economy would collapse.

483
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,120
The whole advertising industry is built on use this deodorant, be a special person.

484
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,600
What was the first one? The second one was other-based. The third one was attribute-based. What was

485
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,360
the first one? Interesting. You forgot it. Performance-based. I have worse because of what I can do.

486
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,080
Okay. Funny guy. It's ironic that I forget that. Yeah, that kind of is.

487
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:44,120
I have to be Freudian or anything. Well, while we're on the topic of deconstructing

488
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,400
people like me, let's talk about narcissism a little bit. You've already alluded to the Greek

489
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:58,360
gods. You write very eloquently about this. Yeah, thank you. Narcissism is largely misunderstood.

490
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:06,840
Narcissism is not a disorder of too much self-love, but too little. Narcissist is an addict.

491
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:15,080
If you remember the myth, he pisses off, I forget who Juno I think, doesn't fall for any of her nymphs.

492
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,400
And she curses him and says, you're going to fall in love with the first next thing you see,

493
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:26,600
wily curse. The next thing he sees is he bends over well to get some water, is the image of himself.

494
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:35,720
He is rooted from that moment to the well, bent over, endlessly sighing as he tries to grasp

495
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:42,200
the beautiful creature in the well. And every time he tries to touch it, it dissolves. The great

496
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:49,880
thing about narcissists is if a narcissist has had self-love, he could leave the well. He's rooted

497
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:58,840
to the well because he's addicted to his image, not the internal self, but the image, the constructed

498
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:04,920
self that comes when you have no internal self. That's what he's addicted to. And he dies.

499
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:15,640
He dies on that well. He stars to death. An echo, beautiful echo, is a place next to him. This is,

500
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,480
to me, the essence of heterosexual relationships, traditionally. Narcissist has bent over as well,

501
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:28,520
and echo has bent over narcissism. And narcissist has no motility and echo has no voice.

502
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:37,000
And narcissist endlessly sighs at his own beautiful reflection. And echo endlessly

503
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,880
repeats those sighs as she sighs for him. There we are. Is there any benefit in narcissism? Is it

504
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,720
always pathologic? No, there's healthy. We talk about healthy narcissism, healthy entitlement.

505
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,520
That's good. Does your healthy entitlement get strained through patriarchy? It goes back to what

506
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:04,760
the great anthropologist, William Eister, speaks of is the difference between power over and power

507
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:14,120
with. Is your narcissism about agency and assertiveness and power with? Fine. Is your

508
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:21,480
narcissism about superiority and contempt? Not so fine. These concepts, they resonate. I think you

509
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:27,240
and I, we've spoken about David Foster Wallace. I'm such a fan of the commencement speech he

510
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:34,120
delivered 2005 at Kenyon College. This is water. And so much of what he's talking about is this

511
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:41,480
grandiosity one-upmanship that he describes as being the root of so much misery. And that's

512
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:47,880
the interesting side of it, isn't it? Right? Which is in the short run, that grandiosity is an amazing

513
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:55,080
anesthetic, but it has a very bitter aftertaste. Well, it's like drinking three martinis. It really

514
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,480
would have been better with just one. And that third one makes you feel better in the moment,

515
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,920
but oh boy, do you pay for it. This is how I describe it to my, usually my guys and to

516
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,400
audiences. Bear with me. I'll meander a little bit. So Boston, I'm convinced, and I think

517
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:17,080
statistically as the worst drivers in the United States. I come from New Jersey. I've lived for

518
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:22,360
10 years in New York. In New York or Jersey, somebody will cut you off because they're kind

519
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:28,040
of a pig and they'll speed up and keep going. In Boston, somebody will cut you off and then they'll

520
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,320
drop down to 20 miles an hour because they're passive aggressive and they'll just stick their

521
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,200
fanny in your face and make you sit there. All right. So I got one of these guys pulls that

522
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:43,480
move on me, pulls out ahead of me and then slows down. I'm looking through the windscreen at that

523
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:49,800
fat little head in front of me. And I'm doing that Star Wars laser beam thing. You know, I'm like,

524
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:56,440
like exploding that fat little wind. And I'm way into grandiosity. I mean, this guy is a shit.

525
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:03,160
This guy is a moron. This guy is whatever. There barely deserves to breathe. In a funner day,

526
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,000
I would have pulled up, rolled down my window and let him have it.

527
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:13,560
Now, as I'm looking at that fat little head through the windscreen, I start breathing myself

528
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:22,840
down from my anger, from my indignation, from my superiority, from my contempt. And I say to myself,

529
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:31,800
as I look at that head, this isn't for you. This is for me. You may deserve to have somebody pull

530
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:39,160
next to you and blow you away, but I deserve to not be that person. And here's what I say, Peter.

531
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:46,200
I grew up in a contempt drenched family. I internalized that contempt and it became

532
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:52,040
depression. I've wrestled with for 40 years. I played out that contempt and I did damage to a

533
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:59,000
lot of nice relationships that way. You know what? Fat little head, not today. Not today.

534
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,480
I've had enough contempt in my life. I can do without it. So that's an interesting take.

535
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:11,160
That's the take that is coming out in a very self-interested way, which is just from a pure

536
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:18,680
self-preservation standpoint, there is no upside to you being upset about this. And to just preserve

537
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,280
your own sanity, you're saying, look, assume the worst about this person, which is to say they've

538
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,640
done this deliberately, or they've somehow done this to spite me and it's all about me. Even if

539
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:34,360
that were true, I'm not going to give into it. Now, the flip side to that, the thing that is,

540
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:40,520
you know, I work on and I think I'm batting 50% at this now, or I'm batting 500 to use baseball

541
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:45,880
terms, which is a hell of a lot better than what I used to bat, which was zero, just straight up zero,

542
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:52,680
is I go through that sort of Foster Wallace narrative of I don't know the story of what's

543
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:59,240
going on. I don't know that maybe that person that's as fast as they're able to drive. Maybe

544
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,680
there's something else going on in that person's life. Maybe that person's wife just left them

545
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:10,120
today, or maybe that person lost their kid and they're so distracted they can't. Driving around

546
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,880
or something as mundane as that is so trivial. And I actually want to share with you an interesting

547
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,200
story because I had a pretty interesting example of this a couple of months ago. I don't think I

548
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,800
told you this story, but we have this thing. It's a grocery delivery service. I'm blanking on the

549
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,760
name of it, but it's like Instacart, something like that. It's awesome. You've literally on your phone

550
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,680
pick up what the groceries are going to be and the groceries show up. This is a bit of an

551
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,560
embarrassing story, so bear with me. It's embarrassing in the sense that as I tell it, it highlights what

552
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:45,560
a grandiose prick I can be. So it's four o'clock and I pull out the Instacart and it says,

553
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:51,960
it'll be here in 90 minutes. And I think that's perfect because it'll be here at 5.30. It's a

554
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,000
Saturday. I got to make dinner and it's got to be ready by six. So it's perfectly timed. And to make

555
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,960
a very long story short, at every step of the way, Terry, this thing just keeps dragging it out. Sorry,

556
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,680
it's going to be 15 minutes late. The store is crowded. Sorry, it's going to be another 20

557
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:16,920
minutes late. The store is really crowded. Sorry. And I'm too stupid to put the phone down and go

558
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:23,240
and do something else. And I'm not making this up. I wish I was making this up. I actually pace

559
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:29,000
around the kitchen for about an hour just waiting for the updates because now I realize I've lost

560
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,600
my window to go and work out, which was what I was planning to do or something else. And so

561
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:43,800
it's now seven o'clock. It's a full three hours late. So I've blown my window to make dinner. I

562
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:50,760
sort of feel like I screwed up and whatever, whatever. And if I get one more text message

563
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:57,960
from this thing, giving me one more dumb excuse, like I'm going to lose my mind. And my wife,

564
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,880
who is now sort of hovering around me, has a real practical concern, which is this person

565
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:11,080
is going to come to the door and get blasted by me being the idiot that I am. And sure enough,

566
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:19,800
the doorbell rings and I beeline to the door with every intention of obliterating this person.

567
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,640
I have no idea what I'm actually going to say, by the way. It's not like I've rehearsed what I'm

568
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:29,800
going to say, but it's how does it take you? Yeah, I know what I'm capable of. Let's put it that way.

569
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:37,080
And Jill is on my heels basically thinking to herself, how am I going to mitigate this damage?

570
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,000
Because this person, even though they're an hour and a half late, does not deserve what's about to

571
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:52,760
come. And I open the door and it's this overweight woman who's sweating profusely.

572
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,680
And she's got the three, five whatever bags of groceries on the ground.

573
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:05,640
And she says, I'm sorry, I'm late. It was really crowded and I broke the eggs.

574
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:14,040
And I'm not kidding, Terry, I almost started crying. And I thought, my God, you asshole,

575
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:21,000
how could you have almost torn into this person? I don't know how to describe it. I just in that

576
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,200
moment, I couldn't get out of my own way. I invited her in. I said, oh, don't worry about

577
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,360
the eggs. I think I ordered them by accident. I don't even want eggs. We don't eat eggs. I hate

578
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:35,400
eggs. Come on in. Would you like a drink? I mean, I practically invited her to stay for dinner in

579
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:41,800
that moment because I felt so bad about how I had been thinking about her. Now to this day, I don't

580
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:48,760
know what changed in me and how I got lucky in that moment. But I thought to myself, if I could

581
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,880
reproduce this at every moment of my life, I would be a happy man. I wouldn't be the piece of

582
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:02,120
shit that I'm probably hardwired to be or at least softwired to be. You're not a piece of shit.

583
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:09,080
You're just the rest of us. Listen, that's a beautiful story, Peter. And what you had was a

584
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:17,080
moment of empathy, of compassion, of humanity. It's like what I teach sex addicts who stare at women

585
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,840
to remind themselves, this is somebody's daughter. This is somebody's mother. This is somebody's

586
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:30,440
sister. There's not a porn queen or a blow-up doll. There's the person. And that's what you did.

587
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:37,880
You got past your entitled indignation. The thing about it is it's case in point of what I've been

588
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:45,000
talking about. You felt helpless. You wanted the goddamn food and it was not going to get there

589
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,120
until it was ready to get there. And you had nothing to say about it. The more helpless you

590
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:56,520
felt, the more angry you got. That's how it works. The helplessness is one down in shame. The anger

591
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:03,160
is grandiosity and righteousness. And like a lot of men, the longer that food took, the more helpless

592
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,400
you got, the more angry you got. That's the formula. When you describe it that way, it seems so obvious

593
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:17,880
and so predictable. Does the knowledge of that in any way help us? I think it does. I think it does.

594
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:25,000
It's funny. Just before I started this, I spent all day with a couple and she was about to leave

595
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,600
them after 25 years of marriage, both in their 70s, and they have a wonderful time, except once or

596
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:39,800
twice a day, he'll scream at her or he'll yell with utter annoyance and content. He was raised

597
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:46,280
by two alcoholics. His father would talk to his mother this way all day long. It was a terrible,

598
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:52,680
terrible childhood growing up. And I told him that he had an adult child of alcoholics stamped on his

599
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:58,760
forehead and that the issue when you grow up with alcoholics is trust. Why would you trust

600
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,880
what is intimacy every time for you? And I know this from my own dysfunctional family. What happens

601
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:09,240
to him is he described that he was waiting for her and they were late to get to somewhere and he got

602
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:15,400
annoyed with her. And if she were responsible and if she were competent, and if she loved him, then

603
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:21,560
she wouldn't be dragging her feet like that. Well, we get to the details of his alcoholic parents and

604
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:27,080
guess what? They're not responsible or competent. But can I pause for a second and ask you a question,

605
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:33,080
Terry? When you're doing that type of work with a couple in that situation, does he actually

606
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:39,880
believe that or is that a subconscious thing that you have to extract that is part of the template

607
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:45,000
of his belief system? Wait, does he actually believe that his wife is incompetent and irresponsible?

608
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,880
Yes. Yes, he actually believes that. But he hired her because she is a little dizzy. We always marry

609
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,160
our unfinished business. So he gets triggered. That's not the issue. We all trigger each other.

610
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:02,440
We all pick people who will trigger us. That's all other conversation. I call that the mysticism of

611
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:08,760
marriage. That's not the point. The point is what happens then. And what happened then to him is he

612
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:16,840
would move into control. Now listen, what I said is I'll bet every time you get angry is a moment

613
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:21,640
when you feel you're dependent on her and she's not coming through for you because you're

614
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:27,880
anti-dependent. And the more dependent on her and the more she doesn't come through for you,

615
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,120
the more helpless you feel and the angrier you feel. And then it all comes out.

616
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:41,080
And he got it. He got it. And he started to cry. And I said, listen, I have a move. I have a way out.

617
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:51,240
I have a move you can make. Next time you feel that rush of annoyance, you memorize. And he is,

618
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:57,000
he's going to repeat this 10 times a day to himself. When I'm annoyed, it means that I'm

619
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,640
dependent and I don't like it or trust it. That's what this means. I'm feeling helpless. And I want

620
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:12,840
you to go to your wife and say one word to her, vulnerable. And honey, you're vulnerable. You stop

621
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,160
on a dime and you go give your husband a hug because he just did a good piece of work.

622
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:24,440
And she said fine. And he said fine. I honestly believe that after this day with me, he's not

623
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:29,000
going to yell at her anymore. And if he does, if he slips, she can touch him on the shoulder and

624
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:36,200
remind him vulnerable. Oh yeah, vulnerable. That's leading a couple out of patriarchy.

625
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:42,520
We talked about relational living. You once explained to me something. You used Dickens

626
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:47,400
as a way to describe it, which is the sort of the ghost of Christmas future,

627
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,600
the ghost of Christmas past and the ghost of Christmas present. And you did it in that order.

628
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,960
Do you remember this discussion? Oh yeah. And then when I tell my therapists, my students, this is

629
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:03,000
the best rendition of the work that I've created. I call it relational life therapy

630
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:09,400
for obvious reasons, I guess. The essence of that rhythm. Well, let me just say it this way.

631
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:15,240
Let me do it straight first. Relational therapy as I've created, it has three phases.

632
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:21,080
The first is loving confrontation. This is what you're doing, Peter, to blow your foot off. Take

633
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:27,160
a look at it and feel bad about it. You've been on cruise control. Wake up. The second phase is

634
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:32,120
family of origin work. Where did you learn this? Where did you learn this growing up? Who did you

635
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:37,960
see do it? Or who did it to you? Or who did you do it to? And nobody stopped you and corrected you.

636
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:45,160
Where did this come from? And I'll do trauma work, deep family of origin, inner child work,

637
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,960
in the presence of the other partner sitting there. That's the second phase. And then the

638
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:54,920
third phase is teaching. This is how you do it right. This is how you stand up for yourself

639
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,800
in a loving voice, not a large one. This is how you listen to your partner's complaints

640
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:04,280
and don't get defensive, but enter into their experience and be compassionate,

641
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:09,560
like you did with that woman. These are skills. So the third phase is skills. So to go back to

642
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:16,360
Dickens, I said the best rendition of RLT, relational life therapy, is a Christmas story.

643
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:23,320
You've got Scrooge, who's anti-relational, and self-medicating with attribute-based esteem.

644
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:29,000
The more money he has, the more self-esteem he feels he has. And he's visited by three ghosts.

645
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,200
I don't know Dickens' order, but I'll do it mine. The first is the ghost of Christmas future.

646
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,120
And he takes Scrooge to his own funeral, and everybody's delighted that he's dead.

647
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:46,280
That's the negative consequence. That's the confrontation. Then he goes back into his past,

648
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,960
and he had a miserable child, and a miserable sad child. That goes back to the family of origin,

649
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,760
and where all this comes from. And then he goes to Bob Cratchit's house,

650
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:02,680
a tiny Tim, where he sees what a functional family looks like, and he learns what connection

651
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:08,360
looks like. Then he goes by a whole bunch of turkeys, and he's a transformed human being.

652
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,600
What is the transformation? He's relational. He's in connection.

653
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:18,600
It seems that that order is necessary. It doesn't always occur in that order, but

654
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,640
it goes back to a question I asked you earlier, which was,

655
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:29,480
how do you get somebody to do this if they're not in crisis? And my own personal experience in that

656
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,200
of the people that I've known is, everything you're talking about, Terry, is really hard.

657
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,800
It's harder than anything I've ever described or tried to do. If you said to me, Peter,

658
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,520
just go run a marathon. I'd be like, okay, I know how to do that. You put one foot in front of the

659
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,000
other, and you just keep doing it until you're done. And you'll get blisters, and it won't matter.

660
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:56,920
But at least for me, the type of work that you describe is so challenging that the activation

661
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:03,080
energy to get there, the barrier to overcome that, you have to be in incredible pain. You have to be

662
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,240
incredibly miserable, incredibly depressed, incredibly angry, or see incredible pain in

663
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:14,120
others that you've caused. I mean, it's some combination of these things. And that's why

664
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:18,600
I do like the way that that story, the way you tell that story. But I mean-

665
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:25,640
Let me tell you another story, which I think illustrates the work. It sort of dickens in the

666
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:33,240
flesh. May I, can I tell you a story of Harry? Absolutely. So Harry comes to me, his marriage

667
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:37,560
is in crisis. You're absolutely right about that. His wife is about to leave him. I see

668
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:45,160
them as a couple. And it's a typical he said, she said, a couple never presents with a presenting

669
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,640
problem. There are always two, his and hers, or his and his and hers and hers. Anyway,

670
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:56,840
his problem with her was that she was a dis, quote unquote. Okay. And her problem with him

671
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:04,280
was that he was brutal, quote unquote. Okay. Harry, give me some examples of Shirley being a dis.

672
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,120
Well, she's often 10, 15, sometimes even 20 minutes late. She never apologizes.

673
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:15,480
Send her to the store for five things. She'll come back before. And she's just a dis. Okay.

674
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:22,360
Shirley, tell me about Harry's being a brute. Well, in just the last two weeks, he called me

675
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:29,320
the C word. He stood in the doorway and physically barred me from leaving. And he spit on my windshield.

676
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:35,800
This is absolutely true. I go to Harry. I say to him, I picked the most egregious one. I say,

677
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:43,320
you spit on her windshield. Well, yeah, first of all, let me pause and say in the work that I do,

678
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,760
I take sides. We're taught as a couple therapists to never take sides and always be even

679
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:55,320
bullshit. This is a problem. This is not Shirley's problem. It's Harry. We name names and we tell it

680
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:02,360
like it is in this work. Anyway, Harry, you spit on her windshield. Oh yeah. Well, yeah,

681
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,360
but you should have heard what she was saying. You don't expect me to take that kind of bullshit and

682
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:15,240
just, so I look at him for a little bit. Beat, beat, beat, beat. And I say to him, Harry,

683
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,880
I don't know. I barely know you, but it occurs to me. You don't know the difference between

684
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,760
standing up for yourself and attacking somebody. That stopped him a little bit. Now listen,

685
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,000
where did you get this from? Who was the angry person in your family growing up?

686
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:36,440
He says, my father said, tell me about it. He was, he was horrible. He would come home and man,

687
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:42,280
you scattered, you get in his way. You wish you had. In fact, my mother was never around. She

688
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:48,600
worked three jobs. So she was nobody to count on. I took care of my little sister. What did you do?

689
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:54,680
I protected her. I kept her out of my father's way. I locked her in the basement. He said,

690
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:00,040
no, don't get me wrong. This is a finished basement with TVs and videos and comic books

691
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:05,640
and all that. But I would lock the door. So dad couldn't get her. I said, how old was she?

692
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:15,320
Three. How old were you? Five. True story. I said, I don't know, Harry, I wasn't there, but

693
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:21,480
pardon my French, but I imagine there was some five year old version of looking at your father

694
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:26,200
and saying to yourself something like, you lay a fucking hand on my sister and I'll kill you.

695
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,480
He said, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly what it was. I said, Harry,

696
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:39,800
how did I know that? Okay. I'll bite. How did you know that? I said, because you defend yourself

697
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:47,880
like an angry five year old, will you let me teach you how to do this in a more civilized way?

698
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:54,520
And he looked at me, this is not a sensitive new age guy. He looked at me and he said,

699
01:13:54,520 --> 01:14:00,120
I think you better. And we did. That's how this works.

700
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:07,400
So in that situation, I'm amazed by at least one element of that, which is maybe you just glossed

701
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:14,600
over it, but what was the pain point that got him to so easily be willing to put, I mean, I'm going

702
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,400
to come back to the language of wounded children and adaptive children and maladaptive adults in

703
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:26,520
a moment. But in that parlance, you very quickly got him to at least agree to put the adaptive

704
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,920
child in another chair. And we'll come back to that in your child stuff, because I really want

705
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:37,080
to dig on it. But I mean, is that normal that in such a short period of time you can, you can get

706
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:43,880
in particular an angry man to accept the error of his ways? Yes, I call it waking up the client.

707
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:51,240
You know, wake him up. And is that in part just because you took sides, named names,

708
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:58,280
and didn't mess around? Yes, in large part. I run around the country, Peter, telling therapists

709
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:04,600
that there's some serious design flaws in therapy. And the biggest design flaw is that we're all

710
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:11,960
taught to be terminally nice to our clients. And people don't tell the truth. I tell therapists,

711
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:17,000
when you tell each other at the water cooler after the session, oh, I can't believe what a

712
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,560
bitch you are. I can't believe what a milk dose is guided. That's what you should be saying in

713
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:27,320
the section. Find a responsible way to say it there, because that's the damn issue. But we

714
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,680
therapists are taught to hold back. And I think it's a great, great disservice to everyone.

715
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:39,320
So let's go back to Harry. So you got a pretty quick pass on the goes to Christmas future.

716
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:44,840
You talk straight to him. Some people, certainly me, need a lot more than that. I needed to

717
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,800
literally go to some funerals before I could get my head out of my ass.

718
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,880
And then you go back and you do the family of origin and the trauma work.

719
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,720
You posed a series of questions. Can you repeat them? Yeah. Who did this to you?

720
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:07,720
Or who did you see do it? Or who did you do it to and no one stopped you?

721
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:14,520
And basically, I mean, I've thought about this so much, Terry, it's hard for me to come up with

722
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,480
too many examples of behaviors that don't have at least one of those three types of mirroring.

723
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:24,680
This is how this stuff gets transmitted from one generation to the next.

724
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,480
This is exactly how it's done.

725
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:34,600
So Harry was, I mean, that's just an awful example of how wounded he was as a kid. Fortunately,

726
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:41,160
most kids don't need to go through something that extreme. How did Harry respond to that? How

727
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:46,360
would you take, use this language now of what was his adaptation to that? And then what's that

728
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:53,320
little adaptation serving him today? Well, I have a saying adaptive then maladaptive now. I mean,

729
01:16:54,280 --> 01:17:01,720
I always teach my students to have great respect for that adaptive child part of the person,

730
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:07,960
the adaptive child part of you. When people do trauma work, we always think of the young wounded

731
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:13,720
child, the one that was on the receiving end of the abuse or neglect. But between that child and

732
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:20,680
the functional adult, there stands an older child part of us, older children, but I can

733
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:28,280
collaborate them. And that's how you adapt it. So for example, I have an intrusive mother say,

734
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:34,360
okay, my adaptation is I defend myself from her intrusion by coming behind thick walls.

735
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:41,640
I erect thick walls. Interestingly, not all that unlike my father's. And when he deals with my

736
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:50,280
mother, I marry a woman who, of course, is highly emotional, just like my mother. And when she gets

737
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:56,840
highly emotional with me, guess what you think I do? I put up a wall. So she's my intrusive mother.

738
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:03,320
I'm that little boy and I'm using the same adaptation that I used when I was four. Now at 45,

739
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:10,840
it was exactly what I needed to do it for is getting me into a world of trouble at 45.

740
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:16,520
When we do that inner child work, I think that what you just said is an important part of it

741
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,720
that sometimes maybe if you're on the outside, you miss this distinction, which is sort of one

742
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:27,000
of the first things you do is you thank the adaptive child, right? Yes, you saved my ass.

743
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:33,800
I have an exercise and your listeners can do this exercise if they want. When I do a workshop,

744
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,640
I do a two day workshop for the general public on basic skills. And I give people a homework

745
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:45,480
assignment on the first day and I'm giving away my secrets here. But this is what I tell you to do.

746
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,720
And everybody does it. I want you to take at least an hour on them.

747
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:58,200
I want you to write a letter to your adaptive child. Dear little Peter, dear Petey or whatever

748
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:05,640
you call them. First, I want to thank you. You really saved my ass. You protected my autonomy.

749
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:12,120
You preserved me from you taught me this. You get okay. This is what you did for me. Thank you.

750
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:20,120
This is what you gave to me. You gave me drive. You gave me intelligence. You gave me discernment.

751
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:28,040
You gave me ambition. You gave me goals. This is what you cost me. You cost me me.

752
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:36,760
You cost me connection. You cost me love. You cost me being honest with myself. You cost me

753
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:45,960
getting comfort from anybody else. And then the last one, I'm here now, the adult, the inner adult,

754
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,200
and I can take care of both of us. And from now on, what that's going to look like is

755
01:19:54,120 --> 01:20:02,120
any sign of love, Peter. That's the assignment. This type of work is very emotional. Yeah.

756
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:12,680
Does one heal enough from sort of inflicted wounds to ever, does the adaptive child ever vanish?

757
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:18,360
No, it never vanishes. And we're always, we often mistake our adaptive child for an

758
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:24,200
functional adult. But let me just say the functional adult has nuance. The functional

759
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:31,720
adult is forgiving. The functional adult is warm and supple. The adaptive child is rigid and harsh

760
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:38,040
and black and white. And it's a kid's version of a grown-up. Anyway, no, they're always with us. I

761
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:43,560
don't believe, some trauma people say they're gone forever, but I think we contend with these little

762
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:51,880
parts of us. The difference is as you move into deeper and deeper recovery, the baseline is not

763
01:20:51,880 --> 01:21:00,520
this little boy. The baseline is my adult. And the little boy takes over episodically. And as your

764
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:06,760
recovery work deepens less frequently and you catch it earlier and you bring yourself down from

765
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:13,560
that one up or up from that one down. So that the net net is you're spending, it was that health was

766
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:20,840
the island and peaks of grandiosity and shame, for example, were the norm. And over time, as you

767
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:29,160
attain those peaks and spend more time in health, that becomes your life and up and down become

768
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:36,360
episodes. So too with fighting and the couple, so too with any of it. You start off all over the place

769
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,960
and then, you know what it's like? It's like physical training. It's like core work. This is core

770
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:51,960
work. And the stronger your core, the more you spend your time in health and the more ill health

771
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:58,680
becomes the exception. That's how it works. I mean, this might be kind of a dumb question, but

772
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:05,800
how long do you think it really takes to go from a state of pathology? So you're a person who is

773
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:13,240
really quite dysfunctional. You've really reached a nadir in terms of your misery and the misery

774
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:19,640
you inflict on others. But you've gone through the first two stages, meaning you've confronted

775
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:25,320
what the world in your continued state is going to look like. And you've gone back and looked at

776
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:32,200
the family of origin. You've gone through the inner child work as appropriate or as necessary.

777
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:39,000
And you're now at the teaching skill development stage, which strikes me as the most difficult

778
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:45,640
stage and the one that takes the longest. Is this a journey of years? Yes, but it doesn't mean you

779
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:51,800
have to be in therapy for years. Look, it's like once we get to the skill phase, it's mastering

780
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:58,040
what I call a relational technology. It's a technology. And it's like any adult mastering

781
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:03,640
a new skill set. It's like learning to ski in your 40s or learning to play the piano or learning

782
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:07,720
how to speak French. And it takes about the same amount of time. If you're assiduous at it, it

783
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:11,800
takes about three to five years. You don't need to be in therapy all that time, but it takes about

784
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,760
three to five years of practice until you're really pretty fluent. I remember we had an interview

785
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:23,080
once and I said that relationality was my second language. My first language is selfishness, which

786
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:28,920
is true. I thought it was great, but I feel pretty fluent in relationality. I've lived in the world

787
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:35,480
of relationality for decades and I speak it pretty well. Is it my native language? Deeply, deeply,

788
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:41,000
deeply, but in terms of what hits the surface, it's my second language, but it's the country I'm in.

789
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,360
That's actually a really great analogy because I think most people who have tried to learn another

790
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:52,600
language can appreciate that it's doable. It's not just something you can decide you want to do

791
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,760
without practicing it. It's one thing to say, oh god, I'm going to Italy this summer. I can't

792
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,720
wait to learn Italian. Oh great, did you hire an Italian teacher? No. Oh, did you download one of

793
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:07,800
those Italian teaching apps? No. Did you buy a book about it? No. Well, exactly how do you hope

794
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:13,240
to learn Italian? I mean, there's truth by fire. You could just simply go to Italy, immerse yourself

795
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:18,280
in it and not allow yourself to speak English. And eventually, I suppose you'll learn Italian, but

796
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:23,160
for most people, a little bit of structure can help that, but you'll probably never speak it

797
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:28,440
without an accent and that doesn't mean you're not functional, but yeah, I think that analogy is a

798
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:35,720
great one. So let me say it takes about three to five years before you're really pretty comfortable

799
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:43,000
speaking this new language of relationality. Having said that, this way of thinking ecologically

800
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,200
instead of linearly, you're in the system, you're not above the system, you want power with,

801
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:54,920
not power over. These ways of handling yourself are so different from the defaults that you were

802
01:24:54,920 --> 01:25:01,640
raised with and the culture at large and they work so much better that doing them poorly will

803
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:07,240
transform your life and your relationship and you can start doing them poorly right away.

804
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:12,280
That is probably, again, there's probably an analogy there within language, which is,

805
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:17,320
if you even spent a couple of months practicing a language, you could certainly get to the point

806
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:22,040
where the people in the restaurants and the taxis would appreciate your efforts and make every

807
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:28,440
effort to help you. Yeah, I think that's right. And you know what, in terms of how long it takes,

808
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:34,280
it's really simple, it depends on the sincerity of the person. I'm not blown away by diagnoses,

809
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:41,720
I'm not blown away by character disorders. Look, I had a couple, they would be called in a

810
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:47,960
psychiatry borderline personality disorders, bad people, tough, tough people. I mean, yelling,

811
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:54,120
screaming, throwing things, he goes to the hotel, she goes after him, she's banging on the door,

812
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:59,160
she's dragged off by the police. This is true, this actually happened. But here's the thing,

813
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:05,800
she got pregnant and she was determined that she was not going to do to her kid

814
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:13,000
what was done to her and he came on board. And with my help, these people cleaned up in about

815
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,840
six months. I've dealt with neurotics who have attitude and I can't get to them for two years.

816
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,200
These people were different people within a matter of months. She went on and became a therapist and

817
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:30,440
she studied. She's now a relational life therapist and a good one. So I don't care how far back you

818
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:36,280
are. I just want to know if you have heart. Do you ever find in couples therapy that you

819
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:42,760
have to recommend to the couple a separation or just a divorce where you realize one person is

820
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:46,840
really in this to change and the other is not? Is that usually what a breaking point comes down to?

821
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:53,960
Well, it depends on what change we're talking about. I mean, if one person just wants to be

822
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:59,320
neater and the other one doesn't, that's survivable. If one person wants to be monogamous and the other

823
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,760
one doesn't, that's more of a serious problem. It depends on what's going on. But there are some

824
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:10,520
deal breakers. I wrote a piece. You can get it off my website, which I would love people to come

825
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,960
and check out. Yeah. Your website is your name. Is it Terry or Terrence is the website?

826
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:22,200
T-R-R-Y-R-E-A-L. Just Google me and it'll take you there. You know, what do you worry about?

827
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:27,480
You said you wrote an article. Oh yeah. Called Rowing to Nowhere. You can get it off my website.

828
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:33,320
And it's about, it's for couples therapists, but it's about when to break somebody up and what we

829
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:39,240
put ourselves through when we do that. But they're deal breakers. If somebody has a drinking or drug

830
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,760
problem, they don't want to do anything about it. If somebody doesn't want to be monogamous and the

831
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:48,840
other one does, here's an interesting one, which I think is what you were talking about. If there's

832
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:56,040
a serious discrepancy in the level of maturity between the two people, level of health,

833
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:02,200
if one of them gets healthy and the other one doesn't, then eventually the pathology of the

834
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:08,360
unhealthy one is too hard for the other one to stomach and they leave. So they're deal breakers.

835
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:16,360
Obviously, violence is a deal breaker. Not every couple is safe. And in terms of, I often always

836
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:21,320
recommend a physical separation if there's yelling and screaming in the house and their children in

837
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:28,440
the house. I universally just tell the people about what's called witness abuse. Children are

838
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:35,240
boundaryless. They're wide open. If your child is listening to you scream at your wife, it goes into

839
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:41,400
them as if you were screaming at them. There's no difference. And so since you're screaming and

840
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:46,760
yelling at each other and your children are there, I give you 30 days to clean up. I do this almost

841
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:51,720
every time. If you're still yelling and screaming each other 30 days from now, one of you leaves,

842
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:58,280
which one should it be? That's an interesting point you alluded to earlier, which is up until

843
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:06,840
a certain age, a child is incapable of differentiating between being screamed at directly versus just

844
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:14,440
being a bystander. How long does that affect persist? Forever. It persists as long as if it's

845
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:18,120
exactly the same as if you were standing there and your parent was screaming at you.

846
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,600
It persists until, frankly, until you do some trauma work and metabolize it.

847
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:30,200
How long are kids susceptible to that? What's the window in which, obviously, I can see that being

848
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,800
the case for a five-year-old. Is that the case for a 12-year-old as well?

849
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,520
Absolutely the case for a 12-year-old.

850
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:42,520
That's really sobering, especially for someone like me for whom anger is such an easy default.

851
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:50,280
Yeah, that's right. That's right. You can go to my website. I did a piece for 2020 with a

852
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:57,960
raging woman and her passive-aggressive husband. I said to her, do you have pictures of your kids?

853
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:05,400
And she did. She had beautiful, golden-yew Latino kids. They were gorgeous. And I said,

854
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,880
this is what I want you to do. Before you rage at your husband, I want you to take the pictures out

855
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,920
of your children. I want you to look in my eyes and I want you to say, I know that what I'm about

856
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:21,080
to do is going to cause you harm. But right now, my anger is more important to me than you are.

857
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:27,240
So screw you. And I said, shall we try that? This is on TV. You can see it. And I put my arm around

858
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:33,080
her. I hold up the pictures. Right now, I'm thinking about, and she sobs, and she puts down

859
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:42,520
the pictures and she says, I will never yell at my husband again. And that was about 17 years ago.

860
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:50,600
And she is true to her word. They're divorced. She got rid of them and whatever on that. But no more

861
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:57,160
rage after that session. People routinely, there's a thing about three to five years of learning.

862
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:03,800
Let me do the other side. People routinely sit on my couch, swear off behavior they've engaged in

863
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:10,760
their entire lives, get up and it's gone permanently. Gone. That's what happened today with this man.

864
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:18,440
He realized every time he was quote unquote annoyed with his wife, that the contempt coming out of him

865
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:25,000
was 10 times greater than what he experienced it being because he grew up with so much contempt.

866
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:32,200
He thinks it's just a love tap and she's flat on the floor. And when he got it, when he really got it,

867
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:38,760
he turned to her. This has just happened before we started our call. He turned to her with tears in

868
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:44,680
his eyes and he said, you are the most delicate, precious thing in the world to me. Why in the

869
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:51,960
world have I been punching you? And he says, never again, never again, never again.

870
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:59,240
Terry, do you find that that type of transformation can also exist when there's an actual chemical

871
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:03,960
addiction involved as well? I mean, you sort of very loosely, we sort of glossed over it quickly

872
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:10,440
about the substance addiction, sex addiction, process addiction, other sort of real numbing

873
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:17,240
medications out there. Is it just as easy to get somebody to stop gambling or stop a sex

874
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:23,400
addiction or an alcohol addiction? Absolutely not. They need treatment and they need probably

875
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:30,120
intensive treatment. But why is anger different? I mean, anger strikes me as very similar. I mean,

876
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:37,000
dopamine producing, it has all of the same, you know, grandiosity, anger, shame. Doesn't that have

877
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:45,240
all of the same attributes as alcohol addiction? Yes. And you know, Peter, I don't know the answer

878
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:52,840
to this one because you're right. There are many behaviors that will kick out endogenous chemicals

879
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:59,320
that mimic the substances that you ingest. And why do you have to go to a 12 step program for your

880
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:04,840
anger? I do send people to 12 step programs for their anger. Sometimes. I don't know the answer

881
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:12,360
to that. What I look for with substance abuse is you wake up and you say, okay, I'll go to rehab.

882
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:18,840
You wake up and you go, okay, I'll go to 12 step. I go to 90 days, 90 meetings. So you get committed

883
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:24,520
to recovery. And that's the transformation. But the recovery takes a long time and a lot of help.

884
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:31,080
So does the rest of it. Look, I'm recounting these marvelous one session turnaround. But let's be

885
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:37,960
clear. When I'm done with people, I send them back for ongoing therapy 99 out of 100 times. Yes,

886
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:42,920
you've made the turnaround now in order to keep it. You're going to have to have ongoing support

887
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:48,520
for a while. The transformation needs to be digested and made real. Terry, you talked about

888
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:55,640
at the outset that the whole reason you turned your life around, got into therapy was to fix

889
01:33:55,640 --> 01:34:02,680
yourself and somehow reconcile your relationship with your dad. How did that end? Sadly, and as

890
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:11,160
well as can be expected, I'll tell you two little stories. My dad died of ALS, which is a great

891
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:21,480
metaphor. He lost his arms and his legs and finally his lungs and he died. When he had ALS before he

892
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:27,240
died, he was paralyzed and my mom was a nurse was taking care of him. I asked for his blessing.

893
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:34,120
And it was very funny because my mom was holding up the phone and he was going to give me my blessing.

894
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:40,760
And my mom dropped the phone and my dad started screaming at her. Ollie, I can't believe it. And

895
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:47,240
then she starts yelling at me. Guys, guys, guys, can you stop? Guys. Oh yeah, sorry. Can I have

896
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:55,480
my blessing now? Okay, okay. That's my family. Anyway. It's so sad and so funny, Terry. Yeah.

897
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:04,120
But my father gave me a beautiful blessing. He said, I remember this, he said, may nothing I've

898
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:11,720
said or done in your life prevent you in any way from achieving your greatest potential.

899
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:20,120
And may your work with man be blessed. And he was a stony. Yeah. May your work with man be blessed.

900
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:26,920
That's a nice blessing. And on his deathbed, as I wrote about, and I don't want to talk about it,

901
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:34,840
he looked at my brother and me and he said, listen, I'm really sorry. And he apologized for

902
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:40,680
the way he'd been with us. And he said, I got to tell you, when you're looking at this, the way

903
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:47,320
I'm looking at this right now in this hospital bed, it's only about love. He said, it's only about

904
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:53,160
everything else, which is fucking bullshit. That's probably the last conversation I had with him.

905
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,920
I mean, I didn't think you could say it any better. Could you?

906
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:01,000
No. No, that's the bottom line.

907
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:07,240
Well, Terry, I promised you we'd wrap this up at a certain time and we are to the minute at that

908
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:14,360
time. So I want to thank you very much for making the time, especially on a short notice. If I've

909
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:20,520
been wanting to have a discussion like this with you publicly, almost from the day I read your book,

910
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,080
which was even before we started working together, I want to just thank you for everything personally

911
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:30,520
and otherwise. Thank you, Peter. I want to thank you for the service of this podcast that you do.

912
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:37,400
I want to acknowledge if I may, that it's been very moving for me to watch you change

913
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:44,360
in our work together. And the changes, as I'm sure you speak about at times, have been truly

914
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:49,960
transformational. You are one of those people we've been talking about tonight and I'm very,

915
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,640
very proud of you if I can say that. Thank you very much.
