00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Hey, everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,760
The Drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,720
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,800
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,560
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,120
This podcast episode, I'm speaking with my friend, Dr. Brett Cotless. Brett is a New

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,800
York City based, high and facial plastic surgeon who specializes in cosmetic and reconstructive

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,600
surgery of the face, but particularly specializing around things to do with everything with the

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,280
eyes, including the skin around the eyes. He's trained both in general oculoplastic surgery

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,560
and general cosmetic surgery. I met Brett about three years ago. And I still remember our first

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,280
meeting we met for the first time when he just came by my office at some point. And we sat around

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,440
having coffee. And as he walked me through not just his training, which is actually quite unique,

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,480
but also his particular approach, I realized we were kind of kindred spirits in our appreciation

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,720
for nuance. As you'll learn in this episode, I know pretty much nothing about looking good and

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,440
skin and eyes and all that stuff. And in many ways, to spend time with Brett is to spend time with

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:52,480
someone who thinks a lot about how to make small and subtle changes over time that lead to long

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,280
lasting effects. And I think the reason that resonated so much with me is my belief in longevity,

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,160
of course, is that it's a compounding issue and therefore making small but consistent changes

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,880
that lead to seemingly small improvements over the short run is actually what leads to amazing

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,960
results over the long run with respect to the reduction of risk of disease, etc. Brett's approach

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,600
to Cosmesis is the same way. And I suspect that my bias is probably what has me thinking that

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,160
that's really the right way to do it. And once I got to know Brett better, and we started to

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,880
collaborate and work together, and I've sent a number of patients to Brett, I was always amazed

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,440
by the responses because to me, the right way to, for example, do Botox is to be able to look at a

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,080
patient after the procedure and say, I didn't know you had Botox. And so things that we talk

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,440
about here are a bunch of things that you can do to make a huge impact on the health and vitality

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,800
of your skin. And he does get into a number of these things specifically around Botox. He also

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
gets into a growing list of sort of all the facial treatments and cosmetic procedures that are out

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,880
there, lasers, peels, all of these sorts of things. And most importantly, I think he also helps you

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,880
as the listener think about how to pick someone because again, you know, many of you listening

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,560
to this might find this stuff interesting. And sure, if you happen to be in New York and you

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,880
want to meet Brett, that's great. But most likely you're not. And so the more important question

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,360
is how do you sort of separate the good from the great or even the great from the not so great

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,160
in this space. So again, like I said, I don't think a lot about this personally, I realize I

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,480
should probably think about it more when I look at pictures of myself today versus pictures of

38
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,640
myself. When I was 30, I am sort of surprised at how much I feel like I look like I've aged.

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,240
And I guess part of this was a bit of a wake up call for me that I might need to pay a little

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,120
more attention to that. If for no other reason than just to have the optionality to look a little

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,600
better when I'm 80, then I'm probably on the course to looking. Brett does a great job here

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,960
explaining why our faces change over time, what he considers the three most important tools for

43
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,080
skincare and rejuvenation. He gets into all the procedures, as I mentioned, the lasers, the peels,

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,040
the needles, the devices. I really enjoyed his discussion of the right way to do Botox because

45
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,040
I'd heard this before because of course Brett and I had discussed this a lot, but I'm glad we were

46
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
able to sort of revisit that for people here. And he also talks a little bit about the current

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,640
trends and future trends of cosmetic and plastic surgery. You can follow Brett on Instagram. He's

48
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,480
Dr. Kotlis, D-R-K-O-T-L-U-S, where he puts up lots of before and after photos, especially around

49
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,280
the eyes, which I find particularly interesting. That's something about myself that I've always been

50
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,080
curious about making better. And his website has the same URL. Lastly, you can see some stuff in

51
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,000
the show notes here. I asked for Brett to give us kind of his recommendations on products that he

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,400
suggests that his patients get that if anyone is interested in, they'll at least be able to sort

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,840
of get that. And you can see that at peteratea.md.com forward slash podcast. So without further delay,

54
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
here's my conversation with Dr. Brett Kotlis.

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Well, I'd like to welcome to the show today, Dr. Brett Kotlis, who is an oculoplastic guru

56
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,840
and also a close friend of mine. Brett, we met what, about three years ago?

57
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,160
I would say maybe it's two. Okay. Yeah, it just seems like we've known each other a long time.

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,200
The first time we met, I remember being really impressed by kind of the nuance of your training.

59
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,760
I tend to think and talk a lot about longevity, but I don't tend to think

60
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,920
and talk a lot about or know anything about looking younger. And you have learned an awful

61
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,560
lot about that. So remind me, how did you train? What was your medical training?

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,200
When I was in medical school, I was drawn to this specialized field that was sort of a cross

63
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,560
between ophthalmology and plastic surgery. And it's called oculoplastic surgery. I was

64
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,480
watching this doctor do an orbital tumor resection. And so I decided this is what I want to do.

65
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,600
And I learned that I needed to do a residency in ophthalmology before I can do a fellowship

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,640
in oculoplastic surgery, which the field basically revolves around the eyes and the face

67
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,120
and plastic procedures related to that. So I found out that I had to do an ophthalmology

68
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,320
residency first. So I did that. And then I matched in this training program,

69
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,320
the match process is sort of like the medical matchmakers and you are assigned to a program

70
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,040
based on a ranking system, which you've been through that as well. And I matched with this

71
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,320
doctor in Tucson who happened to have transitioned his practice into cosmetic surgery. And so when

72
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,440
I arrived, I thought I was going to be doing mostly orbital tumors and tear duct surgery and

73
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,760
eyelid reconstruction. And that was part of what we did. But we were also doing a lot of facelifts

74
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:05,280
and fat grafting and liposuction and lasers. And so my fellowship training qualified for two

75
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,360
different organizations, the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery,

76
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,760
and then also the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery. So when I finished my fellowship,

77
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,520
I ended up working in this practice in Michigan. That was the largest medical spa in the Midwest.

78
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,840
And it was an exposure to even more lasers and more technology that was on the cutting edge of

79
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,240
what doctors are doing for our appearance. I remember one of the things that really surprised

80
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,720
me when we spoke was just understanding that basically anybody with an MD can hang a shingle

81
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,520
and do kind of whatever the heck they want with respect to facial plastic stuff. I mean,

82
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
anybody can be injecting Botox and fillers and all of these things. And of course, not everybody's

83
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,840
doing this stuff well. And not everybody's doing this stuff with the eye towards how will this

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,400
look down the road. And I think your approach seemed very nuanced and sophisticated. So I hope

85
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,760
to certainly touch on that today. But I kind of want to start with some just fundamentals. So

86
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,680
I saw a picture of myself 20 years ago, meaning I recently saw a picture of myself from 20 years

87
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,320
ago. And I was like, God, you were like a better looking dude back then. Why is it that at 25,

88
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:31,520
I looked better than 45? And part of it I think is just my skin looked so much better. So

89
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,720
even though by most people standards, I'm not an old guy today. Clearly, my skin doesn't look

90
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,120
like it used to. What has changed? It's interesting because there does happen to be a double standard

91
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,760
for men and women. And we have the benefit of looking more distinguished as we age. So it's,

92
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,160
I don't think all men feel that way that we're looking worse as we age, but we certainly were

93
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,600
faces are changing. And there are some aging changes that are intrinsic and some that are

94
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,480
extrinsic, right? So your genetics, your programmed to have certain changes over your lifespan,

95
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:16,000
right? You're, we lose bone as we age, which happens in our faces. We are losing facial fat

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,760
as we age. And in some ways, we're losing it in maybe the wrong places. And the sun that we're

97
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,040
exposed to over many, many years causes something called solar elastosis. So we are losing collagen

98
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:40,000
elastin. The thickness of our skin is decreasing in many areas. And we're also gaining small blood

99
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,400
vessels, the telenjectages, and we are gaining brown spots and the combination of these things on

100
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,800
every layer, your skin, your fat, your muscle, your bone, the ligaments that connect the interplay

101
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,360
between these layers are all losing support. And they're getting thinner and they're degrading.

102
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,960
So from the time that you're born until now, you started off with really chubby round cheeks.

103
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,800
So you look at your one year old son and it's all downhill from there.

104
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,960
Now, there seems to be something about the face in particular. So I used to swim a lot and I used

105
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,960
to swim outdoors, obviously. So I'd spend sometimes six or eight hours just swimming in the out in the

106
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,760
ocean. And I didn't even bother putting sunscreen on because, you know, I have dark skin, I have olive

107
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
skin, I never get sunburned. So I'm pretty used to being the guy that's getting a ton of sun. And

108
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,080
while I accept that that's probably caused some damage to my face, why does it not seem to have

109
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,440
caused that same damage to, say, my back, which was even more exposed to the sun when, you know,

110
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm swimming in a prone position? Well, if you think about the tension at play based on your face

111
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,760
and your back, I mean, they're different. So your face has more movement, but there's also

112
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,880
because you need to move in certain ways, there's also more areas of laxity. Whereas your back,

113
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,800
the skin is stretched and it's taut. Even though you can certainly get brown spots and wrinkles on

114
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,800
your back, think about scars on the back tend to spread. They look wide and stretched and

115
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,760
they don't heal well because it's under constant tension. But I think that tension makes the back

116
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,640
skin look different than the facial skin. But you also have different oil glands in different

117
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,280
parts of your body. So you have a higher density of sebaceous glands in your face.

118
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,960
And the muscular expression, I think it affects the way that you age more than it does in other

119
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:43,360
areas. Now, I read once that by about the age of 35, you'll lose about 10% of the fat in your face,

120
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,200
which is kind of amazing to me, given that by the age of 35, I probably gained 10% of the fat

121
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,000
in my body. What is it about the face that doesn't do what the rest of the body does,

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,960
which is accumulate fat? Yeah, well, I think there's probably local hormone effects that are

123
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,280
making you accumulate in other areas. And in the face, we have the fat cells come from different

124
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,800
embryologic origins. And for some reason, that's what's happening there. And we're talking about

125
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,680
very small amounts of fat. So you'll see those small differences. But think about your facial fat

126
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,680
as insulation. And as you lose that insulation, you start to see the structures that are underlying

127
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,480
the surface. And so you can see where the ligaments are tethered. And you can see the

128
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,680
places where they're not tethered, which would be an outpouching. And so all of those tight areas

129
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,400
opposed and just directly next to the areas that are not tightly attached, you see these contours.

130
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,400
And so as you age and you deflate, and you have gravity pulling down, I mean, the effect of gravity

131
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:53,520
is real. Have you ever seen a like a slow motion video of a runner? And you see their face and the

132
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,480
way that the face bounces up and down. And there's so much force on those facial ligaments. And so

133
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,480
you can imagine what happens as you're just walking and running up and down the stairs and over and

134
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
you're smiling and you're doing all these things with your face. So there's wear and tear, just like

135
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,560
it happens on our joints, it happens on our facial ligaments. Have you ever lied down on your back

136
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,160
and take a picture and then stand up and take a photo? That lying down image, that eliminates the

137
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,760
effect of gravity on your face. And that shows you what is gravity doing in combination with

138
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,360
the deflation. So that's how you take a selfie is when you're lying down. Take a lying down selfie.

139
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,200
There's tip number one guys. It's called the anti-gravity selfie. In longevity, I used to,

140
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,760
used to, I still do and I certainly don't, don't deserve credit for the smarter people than me

141
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,680
have said this first. But the joke is the most important thing you can do to live longer is

142
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,200
choose the right parents. So there are lots of things that you can do to live longer, but genes

143
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,600
really play a role. Now in the longevity space, we have a pretty good sense of what those genes

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,960
are. There are somewhere between about eight and 12 genes that offer pretty remarkable protection

145
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,320
in delaying the onset of chronic disease. And therefore, centenarians, people who live to be

146
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,240
a hundred or longer tend to be bestowed with a greater proportion of those genes. But you mentioned

147
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,560
a second ago that genetic factors can also influence these sort of intrinsic changes that

148
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,480
occur. Do we have a sense of what those genetic factors are? Clearly, there are people who just

149
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,400
have remarkable skin and they age with remarkable skin. And you know, you'll see a woman who's 40

150
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,960
who looks like she's 20 and her mom is 65 and she looks like she's 45. Well, we know that there are

151
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,520
some correlations between certain genetic types and certain traits and the way we age. I mean,

152
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,000
if I see a lot of people for under eye bags, and it's almost everybody says, Hey, this is,

153
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
this is genetic. Well, yes, I know it's genetic. I mean, your parents have it. You came in with

154
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,920
your mom and she has it too. So the structure of your face obviously comes from your parents.

155
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,000
But when we talk about skin types and the skin color, darker skin types tend to have

156
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,760
more connective tissue or denser connective tissue and tend to look better as they age.

157
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,880
So maybe it's a generalization, but a lot of the Asians in my practice tend to look better,

158
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,480
longer, darker skin individuals, the same thing. And so the darker pigment in skin does give you

159
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,680
some UV protection. Doesn't mean that you don't have to wear sunscreen, but it offers photo

160
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,600
protection. And I theorize that UV exposure from sunlight causes fat atrophy over many,

161
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,800
many years. Wow. What do you base that hypothesis on? We use heat and we use laser procedures

162
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,560
in a very highly focused way. And we know that it destroys fat cells. So these externally applied

163
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,320
devices that are available now, they effectively remove subcutaneous fat. And I believe that UV

164
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,240
radiation does the same thing over a long period of time. And if you've seen people that have always

165
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,640
protected themselves from the sun, they look like they have white porcelain skin. They have less

166
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,280
wrinkles and they have younger looking faces. I know we're moving away from the genetic question

167
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,480
you're asking me, but I think you can often overcome many of the genetic things just like

168
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,200
with chronic diseases or with your lifestyle modifications. But I think that there is also

169
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,080
an internal drive that we have to perpetuate our gene pool. We each have our own internal

170
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,320
motivation to do that. That's just our evolutionary goals. And I think some of the more favorable

171
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,000
genes become selected over time. And so I think there's a genetic motivation for people to want

172
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,920
to look good because they want to present themselves in their best possible way to a possible mate.

173
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,840
Kind of like a peacock. No, we don't have feathers. So one of the things that I'm sure

174
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,120
anybody listening to this and certainly I've always found a little bit, I don't know, worrisome is

175
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,880
God, if I had a dollar for every time I saw someone walking down the street and who'd looked

176
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,520
like they'd had a million procedures done and you just feel bad for them, you feel like,

177
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,760
God, something went wrong there. You don't look natural or normal. And I think for many people

178
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,560
it becomes off-putting and they think, well, gosh, I don't want to do anything.

179
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:35,840
So it begs the question, are there strategies that one should take to consider gracefully aging

180
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,520
in as much as one cares? I mean, look, I think in the end, some people are going to say,

181
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
I don't care about any of this stuff. But presumably if someone is still listening to

182
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,680
us talking now a few minutes into this, they probably care. How do you think about this? And

183
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,120
maybe how does that differ from what other docs think or what would be a traditional point of view?

184
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,240
Think about all the people that are walking by you on the street that have had

185
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,120
worked on and you don't notice it because it's done well. So I think you're seeing that every day,

186
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,080
but you just don't know it. Yeah, I only see the numerator. I don't see the denominator.

187
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,600
And what are the reasons for the unnatural appearance? Why do people get to that point?

188
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,360
I think in some cases, maybe it's unlimited access or unlimited resources. I think there are

189
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,560
forces that push people in that direction. Your appearance is a very emotional subject.

190
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,600
And I think we tie ourselves to that maybe an age that we feel like that was our best age.

191
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,520
Think about the actress that everyone knows for the role that they played when they were 20 years

192
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,000
old. And in our minds, we think of them as that person. And it's almost hard for us to imagine

193
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320
them aging and you see them and you're like, oh, look how old they look. And I think it's

194
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,760
a natural tendency to think that because you're remembering that favorite movie that you saw

195
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,120
them in. But think about the pressure they feel in that situation. My career is based on my image.

196
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,600
And so if you try to hold on to that 20-year-old version of yourself,

197
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,640
at some point, you're going to cross the line into a natural distorted look. So

198
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,560
there's probably a rough guideline. Your goal should, you know, if you want to look your best,

199
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,120
maybe I'd like to be, look a little like seven years younger than where I am now,

200
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,280
or 10 years. But if you go beyond that, it's a little too much. That's one part of it. I think

201
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,280
the images that we see around us, if you look at some of the, this is part of what I call the

202
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,600
Instagram effect where you're scrolling through and you see these photos of celebrities that have

203
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,440
blown up their lips and their cheeks are over the top or whatever it is. And some of it is

204
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,120
Photoshop, but some of it is from medical augmentation. You start to think that that's the

205
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,520
new normal, but it's overdone. And that exaggerated appearance, people around you in your circles

206
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,680
might be doing some of these procedures. And so you all see each other like that. And then you

207
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,400
want to get a little bigger and just push it a little more. And then before you know it,

208
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,240
you've gone too far and it can be a slippery slope. So I think people start to lose sight of

209
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
where they started and what their goals were. Your goals maybe change. And maybe you've found a

210
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,440
provider. There's a doctor or a nurse injector that said, okay, you know, let's take this a little

211
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,960
further, a little further. And then they say, you know, I think you're good here. Let's stop it.

212
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
But you want to go further. So you'll find somebody. And so you'll, you'll get to another

213
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,400
provider and they'll do it. I personally feel this way. If someone comes into my office

214
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,960
and they've had something done, I think I can fix them. But maybe you can't or maybe it's time to

215
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,320
say, okay, let's put the brakes on. So I think there's different reasons why people get to that

216
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,800
point. But the technical reason that someone looks unnatural is when you either try to enlarge

217
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,080
something beyond its natural dimensions, there's only a certain point is how far the skin will

218
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,040
stretch before you start to lose the contours. And we say like, you can't have light without dark.

219
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,160
So the goal of your face, the goal of a natural looking face is not to be totally smooth and to

220
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,200
have no curves and no shadows and no lines. When you smile, you're supposed to, you see my brow

221
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,640
elevate and you see some lines in my forehead, you know, I'm, I'm conveying expression, I'm conveying

222
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,760
a message to you that I'm surprised or that I'm angry. And so if you lose those expressions,

223
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,080
if you lose the shape of your lip, you have a cupid's bow where it looks like it dips down in

224
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,600
the middle, or you have two pillows in the lower lip. And if you distort that by just blowing past

225
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,560
all of that and filling it up. And so you have a sausage now for your lower lip. I mean, your eye

226
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,920
will pick up on that very quickly, that that's not natural. You might not know how to describe

227
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,920
what is natural, but you know what isn't. And so you distort the natural dimensions and pulling

228
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,000
will achieve the same type of distortion if you go too far. Facelifts when they're pulled back too

229
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,400
tight, because someone is being too aggressive on the surface of the skin, you see the windswept

230
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,080
look, those type of things where, you know, you see it in older actresses or even actors,

231
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,080
maybe they feel like, okay, I can spend this much money to look like this person of myself. Well,

232
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,840
there's no amount of money that will make you look naturally 30 years younger than where you are.

233
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,200
You know, if you compare, I think people's bodies today to people's bodies 30 years ago,

234
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,520
based on augmentation, there are some inevitable trends. Now, I don't have any data to back this

235
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,000
up, but I can only imagine that breast size is larger today. I think breast augmentation must

236
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,200
be more common than it was 30 years ago. When it comes to facial augmentation, what are the trends?

237
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,320
And I'm not talking about the just the extremes where people have like gone too far, but it would

238
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,960
seem to me that people tend to have fuller lips these days. Is that, would that be true?

239
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:59,040
I would say yes. And for good and bad reasons, I think we recognize now more and more that global

240
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,320
volume loss is something that's happening to our faces as we age. And that includes the lips. So

241
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,320
lips can be reinflated because they've lost volume in a natural looking way that you wouldn't know

242
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,640
about. I think that there is a tendency now to focus on these areas. So look when you come to

243
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,960
my office and you say, Hey, look at my face. What should I do? I'm probably not going to just say,

244
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,640
like, okay, you should do this, this and this. I'm going to focus on what you're seeing. But I might

245
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,360
point out certain things like, you know, you've lost a lot of volume in this part of your face.

246
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,440
And I know you're focusing on your, your brows for some of me, let's say, but, but I see, you know,

247
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,120
I want to maintain a balance. So it's been, you know, popular to fill these nasolabial lines

248
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,960
next to the lips, you know, the lines that go from the corner of your nose to the outer corner of your

249
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,680
mouth or to inflate the cheeks. But we have to look at the neighboring areas like you're a car guy,

250
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,600
and you get a scratch on your car. Well, you have to paint the panels next to it in order to make

251
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,800
it look good. And so a good provider, a good physician will look at you and say, okay, your

252
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:11,040
concern is your, your nasolabial lines. But I think we should also just at least consider your lips,

253
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,320
because let's look back at your photo from 10 years ago and look what your volume status was

254
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,120
then. And let's look at it now. So I think in a good way, people are focusing on lips,

255
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,760
but also I think the negative is that there's always going to be some people that are over the

256
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,040
top. And I see it a lot when, you know, when you have a lip injection, you know, typically we're

257
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,640
using hyaluronic acid fillers, which is something that's a constituent of our skin to begin with.

258
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,320
So these are very safe in terms of that they're not, they're biocompatible. There's no allergic

259
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,040
reactions to them in general. And they're reversible. So we have an enzyme that can take them back

260
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,960
if there's something that doesn't look right, or there's an issue. But with these gel fillers,

261
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,840
they tend to be hydrophilic, meaning that they absorb water. And for the first two or three

262
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,000
days after you do it, your lips look like that person that you're trying to not look like,

263
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,000
they get pretty big. So most people for about two days, they're sort of like

264
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,720
homebound or they're freaking out. They're wondering if they overdid it. Yes. But

265
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
it's almost a hundred percent of the time, the first time someone does lip filler and they come

266
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,080
back. And I said, okay, you were pretty swollen, I bet for the first two days. And they say, yeah,

267
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,680
but I sort of miss some of that swelling. And so the next time around, we do a little bit more.

268
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,200
And that's sort of like where you have to determine. And that's a personality thing.

269
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,520
It's a personal decision in terms of what is good. And it's a discussion between myself and my

270
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,040
patient. And we don't always agree. My patient might say, I hear what you're saying. You're

271
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,520
telling me this is natural. I want to go a little further. And I'm open to that.

272
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,440
Now, that's something that doesn't like a facelift. Once you get a facelift,

273
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,160
you're kind of stuck with it, right? I mean, a redo procedure there is going to be cumbersome.

274
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,200
It depends on what the reason is for redoing. There's a big, I think, role for revision facelift

275
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,400
surgery. But you're right, when you take something out, right, or you overreduce a nose or you

276
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,040
overstretch someone, that can be very difficult to repair. But obviously, the hyaluronic acid

277
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,120
doesn't last forever, right? Right. So if someone is doing, whether it's an extreme or incremental

278
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,920
strategy of filling, how often do they have to do that?

279
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,880
It depends on the area. So, you know, lips tend to not last as long as other parts of the face.

280
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,160
I do a lot of under eye filler. Under your eyes, you don't have a lot of movement there. Even

281
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,040
though you're blinking, under eye filler lasts a year or two years. I've seen it last four or five

282
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,840
years in some people. Whereas the lips, you're always talking and piercing your lips and eating

283
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,880
maybe six to eight months. Now, you have a very interesting technique of doing the under eye

284
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,200
filler, which I've sent a number of patients to you because I've been so impressed by just

285
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,200
how amazing it looks and how minimally invasive it is. What do you do different there?

286
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,240
So this has sort of become my niche in my practice. And I probably do that one procedure more than

287
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,240
anything else. And it wasn't by design. I didn't plan for this to happen. But it was definitely

288
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,720
an interest of mine. And, you know, when you look at someone's face, the first thing

289
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,480
that starts to age would be the eyes because that's where we have so much movement. We're

290
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,920
blinking all the time and we have the thinnest skin in our body. And combine that with the fat

291
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,240
pads under your eyes, which can enlarge with time because they have a different embryologic origin.

292
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
And we're losing fat in our cheeks and the upper part of our cheek,

293
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,840
which that groove where you get that shadow is called the tear trough,

294
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,120
which I don't really like that term. It makes me think of like pigs eating at a trough. But

295
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,440
that trough would be, if you were to cry, would sort of spill down that kind of slide in the

296
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
inner corner of your eye. This is what makes people look like they have almost a black eye.

297
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,960
So right from the shadow. Right. And people think, you know, that everyone says I'm tired,

298
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,720
but I'm not. And so when you combine the puffy under eyes with the tear trough area,

299
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,720
you look tired and you might not be, or maybe you are, but you just don't want people to know it.

300
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,800
So what I do with fillers, I use a hyaluronic gel filler and I inject it there, but with a

301
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,720
cannula. So a cannula. So what's a cannula for people who don't know? It's like a needle,

302
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,880
but the tip is dull. It's a blunt tips needle. So what I do is I approach that area from the cheek.

303
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,840
We make a little needle hole in the cheek and then I introduce this cannula through that little

304
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,920
needle hole. So you have no needles under your eye and I can use that cannula in a very accurate way.

305
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,320
And at this point, I know exactly where my tip is all the time. Even though I don't always see

306
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,080
the tip, I know where it is. And when I'm doing this, I'm imagining the surgical procedures that

307
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,760
I do very frequently, which is blepharoplasty. And so because I know the eye, so that's,

308
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,600
blepharoplasty just means that modification of the eyelids through surgery. And so cosmetic

309
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,200
blepharoplasty is often either removing the fat pads, the bags, removing skin from the upper lids

310
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,760
or shifting the fat, whatever I have to do to make your eyes look younger or the way that they

311
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,920
used to look. So I do a lot of blepharoplasty and because of that, I know what it looks like inside.

312
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,080
And so I imagine that in my mind when I'm placing the filler, and I'm placing this gel that takes

313
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,200
up space, and it's replacing the fat that you've lost, or it's also disguising the fat pad that

314
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,920
might be bulging. And so by putting it in the right place and using the right filler, because

315
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,320
there's certainly, there are hyaluronic gel fillers that are incorrect for that area because they

316
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,880
just have the wrong properties, the wrong stiffness, the wrong amount of water attraction,

317
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,560
but placing it in the right area and the right amount.

318
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,200
Is Restylane a hyaluronic acid paste filler?

319
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,160
That's one of the fillers that I use. And it's also amount of, it's having restraint. So

320
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,400
I understand at which point that this will become puffy or look unnatural. And that's where we stop.

321
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,720
And sometimes we stage it, but this procedure will brighten up people's faces who look like

322
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,360
they have bags and look like they're tired. And it's really gratifying to see, you know,

323
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,720
people's reactions to this when they look in the mirror, especially when you do one side,

324
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,480
and you look in the mirror and then you see the difference. It's pretty remarkable.

325
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,200
And so it's one of the things I really enjoy doing. And I think that there's a lot of doctors that

326
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,480
sort of stray away from it either because they're not comfortable with the idea of injecting under

327
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,920
the eyes. There's risks with everything we do. To me, that's not a high risk procedure,

328
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,040
but I think it's perceived as one. I think part of it too is this gets back to your unique

329
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,160
training. I mean, you trained first as an ophthalmologist, which, you know, if I think about

330
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,920
it, like I trained in general surgery, like my scope of what I needed to know was so broad.

331
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,040
But when you look at someone who's training in ophthalmology, like you get to focus five years

332
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,520
on like two inches of a person's body, so your knowledge of that anatomy is unparalleled.

333
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,680
Right. I was narrow to begin with, and then I became even more.

334
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,280
And then you become even more narrower. So it seems to me that the advantage that you have,

335
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,120
and this is certainly why I've always felt very comfortable sending people to you,

336
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,120
is I know that people who understand the anatomy because they've operated,

337
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,360
they've actually been beneath the surface, can do exactly what you describe, which is they're

338
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,440
sort of, they know what the art is. Put it this way, when I was in residency, there was never

339
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,880
any confusion that I would go into plastic surgery when I was in medical school. Like,

340
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,520
I just don't have that artistic capacity. But I would say, you know, at the same time,

341
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,120
you know, I like to talk about my skills, but I don't, I think there's like a political part

342
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,120
of this conversation where the question is like, who do you go to and who's the right kind of

343
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,960
provider? If you want to do something like this, I don't think it has to be a certain person or

344
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,200
a certain kind of person. I think that there are good injectors and bad injectors. I think

345
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,520
there's good doctors. How can people distinguish? So if you're, if someone's listening to this

346
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,560
podcast and they're saying, well, you know what, these bags under my eyes are driving me crazy,

347
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,840
let's say they don't live in New York, so that you're coming to see you wouldn't even be an option.

348
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,640
Well, people come from other places or countries to see me, but I think when you're looking for a

349
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,440
provider for anything, obviously everyone, everyone says, oh, I did my research. Put it this way,

350
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,240
if your wife needed a procedure and you decided, you know what, I don't want to be the one to do it

351
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,400
because there's an emotional connection to this person. And how would you pick the person that

352
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,760
would do this to your wife or your mom? I think you have to find out first, what are the organizations

353
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,760
that certify people? From my field in, let's say, talking about blepharoplasty, I think there's a

354
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,000
handful of specialists that would be competent. You could be a plastic surgeon, a facial plastic

355
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,400
surgeon, an oculoplastic surgeon. I am biased towards oculoplastic surgeons because that's

356
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,720
a big part of what we do. I would look at that first. References like referrals from other

357
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,000
people, obviously, you know, look, if you wanted to find out the best surgeon in the hospital,

358
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,120
you'd probably ask the nurses or the scrub techs and say, tell me, or the anesthesiologists,

359
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,600
because they have firsthand knowledge. So I think referrals go a very long way. And if you know

360
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,400
somebody that had a great result or you know someone who's done something, but you have to

361
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,400
meet with a few people because you might have the best surgeon or the best under eye injector or

362
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,800
lip filler person. And that person could also be a physician assistant. It could be a nurse. I mean,

363
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,840
I've seen some amazing physician assistant injectors that I would have inject myself, you know,

364
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,440
without hesitation. But it's like, do you have a good rapport with that person? Do you think

365
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,960
you're on the same page? Do you have the same goals and style? So it's almost like an interview

366
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
when you go for a consultation, sometimes you have to pay for a consultation fee.

367
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,560
But I think it's worth doing that, at least for two or three or four doctors to meet with someone

368
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,240
and say, I get the wrong feeling here, or this office seems frantic, or the doctor just didn't

369
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,560
even really look at me or listen to me. I mean, those things I think are all really important.

370
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,520
So I know doctors that are family practice doctors that are exquisite Botox injectors.

371
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,680
And so I think it's wrong to fall into the political trap of you have to have this label

372
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,280
next to your name, or you have to be this kind of like training. I think that a lot of the training

373
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,960
that I've done was post post your formal training. And some of the training is there are things that

374
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,320
I developed on my own. But for blepharoplasty or eye procedures, I recommend looking at the

375
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,000
oculoplastic organization. But for things in general, I think you should look you look at photos of

376
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,360
people who have their galleries online, they're going to show you their best work. So you look at

377
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,560
those pictures and you say, Oh, those look good. Or some I look at some well known doctors and

378
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,280
surgeons and I look at their photos. And I think this does not look good to me at all. I don't

379
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,680
think this is natural. And they're promoting it as their best work. There are a lot of things that

380
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,560
I see around the eyes where, you know, I preserve fat. And sometimes I'm often adding fat, which

381
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,400
a lot of people don't like to do, because they don't maybe have the same philosophy that I do.

382
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,000
But I see hollowed out eyes and people are pushing that putting that forward is that

383
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,480
this is my best blepharoplasty. Maybe for someone that is, maybe that's the look they're going for.

384
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,160
You should want to ask how many procedures the person has done. Is there a certain

385
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,480
number above which you sort of hit that threshold of, okay, now I've really

386
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,320
You should ask all of these questions, like how many procedures? I mean, look,

387
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,240
I've done well over 1000, 2000 of under eye fillers, blepharoplasty is like, it's 1000. So,

388
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,960
but in early in my career, I did lots of procedures and was probably hundreds. So

389
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,840
you should ask and your doctor shouldn't be defensive about those questions. You can say,

390
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,240
hey, can I talk to somebody who's had this with you? And we do that all the time. We connect

391
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,040
patients with previous patients who are who are open about it and say, Hey, what was your

392
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,920
experience? Or can you say, well, tell me about the complications you've had. And if I get one of

393
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,360
those, what are you going to do for me? How do you, how do I manage that? Do I have to pay

394
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,920
to fix the complication? Those are questions you should be asking.

395
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,560
That's such an important thing in medicine in general. It's amazing how easy it is

396
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,440
to gloss over consent forms. And you just sort of list a whole bunch of generic

397
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,720
complications, but you don't actually talk about what probabilistically or expected

398
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,440
complications could look like. And to your point, what are the next steps? So for example,

399
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,360
you know, with breast augmentation, I know a woman who had these really horrible contractures

400
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,160
develop. And I was like, God, I'd never even heard of that. You know, I didn't even realize

401
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,440
that was a complication. Obviously, I'm not in the loop in that space.

402
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,960
It's actually a common complication. Yeah, it's about 3% I've learned.

403
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
I think it could be even higher depending on the type of implant and the placement. So

404
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,240
those are things that surgeons should be saying to every patient that 3% is a,

405
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,880
you know, relatively high rate. Yeah. And you're right. It could be, I mean,

406
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,120
it depends on the implant. So if you're using the different textured implants, it could be as high

407
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:58,640
as 5%. I mean, 5% complication is really high, right? One in 20 people who do this is going to

408
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,960
have this. And a lot of times on redoes, it still happens, which is not to say one shouldn't

409
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,640
have an augmentation, but boy, I'd be very upset if someone I cared about had that procedure,

410
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,480
wasn't told about that complication and then developed it, especially if they required redo

411
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,880
redo. Of course. And so that going into it, you know, let's say this busy surgeon's doing 20

412
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,720
breast augs a week. And so one, one patient every week is going to have potential re-operation.

413
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,560
So going in, you should know, hey, I might have to do something else. And that's with,

414
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,160
I think any procedure, the risk is relatively low with many of these things. Sometimes we're

415
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,960
talking about one, certain complications might be one in a million. And so you don't have to put

416
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,360
that as like, this is likely for you to have, but yes, that's part of the discussion.

417
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,600
So let's go back to Botox for a second. I think about like six years ago,

418
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,000
one of my good buddies from residency, who's a plastic surgeon, I was just hanging out with them.

419
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,760
We were just sort of playing patty cakes one day. And he was like, Hey, dude, why don't I throw some

420
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,880
Botox on your wrinkly forehead? And I was like, All right, fine. So I like sat down in his little

421
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,400
chair and he whipped out some Botox and put like what felt like 3000 injections into my forehead.

422
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,760
And you know, put an ice pack on it, went home. Classic mistake, though, I think is what you're

423
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,560
starting to describe is treating your forehead directly. Well, let me tell you, oh my God,

424
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,840
I don't remember how long it took to wear off. I think it was about two to three months.

425
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,120
The most miserable two to three months of my life, because this was at a time when I was

426
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,280
a very active cyclist. And I didn't realize it until of course, I lost the ability to do so,

427
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,280
but not being able to lift my brow meant I had absolutely no way to keep the sweat out of my

428
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,600
eyes, even when I was wearing my kind of do rag under my helmet. So I couldn't believe how miserable

429
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,120
I was not being able to lift my eyebrows. So it's uncomfortable. And then it's also a dead

430
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,080
giveaway. So when you look around, let's say you're watching the Oscars on TV or something,

431
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:01,680
and you want to know which people have had poorly done Botox and it's a lot. It's when the

432
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,200
frontalis muscle, right, which is the only. So where is that for the people who are listening?

433
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,160
That's the forehead muscle, right? Okay. Between the eyebrows and your hairline.

434
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,440
Okay. Okay. So for some of us further back than others. But the frontalis muscle is the only

435
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,280
muscle that raises your eyebrows. So you get those transverse, those horizontal lines across

436
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,440
your forehead and your instinct is like, Oh, I should do Botox to get rid of these. Well,

437
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,360
if you inject the frontalis to the degree where you smooth those lines, because, you know, those

438
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,640
lines are formed by the muscle contraction. So your muscles don't contract anymore. And I said,

439
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,760
they're the only muscles that raise the brows. So now you can't raise your brows. In fact,

440
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,160
they drop, but your forehead will be shiny, smooth. So if you see somebody and they can't

441
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,760
raise their brows at all, you just see smoothness. They were over Botox and their forehead. And we

442
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,520
say Botox as a generic term. It's actually, that's a trade name. And there is the AMGEN product,

443
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,560
right? That one is Allergan. Both Allergan. Okay. Currently FDA approved his Botox,

444
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,200
Xiamin and Disport. So those are all types of botulinum toxin type A. There's slight differences

445
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,360
in the molecules, but they all have the same effect. So the mistake that was made for you

446
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,680
was going after the horizontal forehead lines. And in fact, what,

447
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,960
which seems like a common mistake given on the frequency with which we see this.

448
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,560
Yeah, I think people know a little bit more about it now, but still, I think they use too

449
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,360
many units up there. So the unit is the strength of how much is being injected. But what would

450
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,880
have been better would be to inject the corrugator and proseris muscles, which are the ones that

451
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,760
are just at the top of your nose, but the ones that furrow your brow, you treat that and then

452
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,120
just a light sprinkling in the forehead. So you can still elevate your brows,

453
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,880
but you weaken that muscle contraction. Then over time, if you do it a couple,

454
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,800
it'll last you by four months. And then over time, as you repeat it,

455
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,120
then those lines will soften because you're not making as much of that contraction.

456
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,880
So if somebody comes to you and says, Brett, when should I start doing this stuff? Let's say

457
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,200
someone takes the long view, right? Someone says, look, I'm, you know, whatever, I'm 40,

458
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm 30, I don't know what the age is, but I want to know that when I'm 70, I look more like I would,

459
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,360
otherwise when I'm 50, they want to take that view, which is, I'm not trying to look like I did

460
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:17,840
when I was 16, but I want to really take a long view of plenty of iterative interactions.

461
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,840
Are you looking at a magnitude of wrinkling or are you saying, you know, we start with very,

462
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,840
very small, for example, just looking at that area that furrows the brows, but not touching

463
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,680
anything on the frontalis muscle above it? I mean, how do you think about this from that

464
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,320
I think we have to think from the beginning that you don't have to do anything, right?

465
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:43,360
Nobody has to do Botox. Nobody has to even spend this much time thinking about their appearance,

466
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,400
right? People do it because it's important to them. And what's important to you might not be

467
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,480
important to someone else. So with that aside, let's say your goal is to look your best as long

468
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,600
as you can. You should probably first start focusing on the preventive things, which can

469
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,680
include neurotoxins like Botox, but it should start with sun avoidance at a young age.

470
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,520
You should do Botox or something like that before you start to get etched lines.

471
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,160
Is an etched line one that means when your forehead is relaxed, the line still shows?

472
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,680
Right. And I think it's okay. You know, I have some etched lines and horizontal

473
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,160
etched lines in my forehead and I think it's acceptable for me and I'm okay with it. I mean,

474
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,240
look, there's a range of what's acceptable. I used to look at Bill Clinton on TV all the time and

475
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,600
I'd see his big eye bags. And when I was in my training, I'm thinking, I would just die to be

476
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,880
able to take out those nice juicy fat pads, but he doesn't care about them at all. Right. And so

477
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,280
it's meaningless to him or maybe he thought about it, but you know, he obviously didn't pursue it.

478
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,680
So it doesn't really matter if it doesn't matter to you. And I think, you know,

479
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,480
it's interesting at the root of all of this is, you know, why do we do cosmetic procedures and

480
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,720
why do some people think it's so important? Why do people think it's nonsense? It's about your

481
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,960
confidence. It's about how you feel about yourself, your self image. And I think that there are some

482
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,560
people that will chase after confidence and may never be able to achieve it. And it's because of

483
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,680
what happened to us in our childhood, our upbringing, the, I guess, the stability that we

484
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,960
had when we were growing up, and it's being able to experience love in your family, experience

485
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,240
acceptance, people that were proud of you. People can say that they love you, but if you didn't

486
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,360
experience that, it's much harder to be self confident and to have a good self image. And so I

487
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:41,600
think it all goes back to that. I think there's a healthy way to do it. And I think it's not

488
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,280
something that we should frown upon. I think it's becoming more accepted in our society to

489
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,880
have a focus on how we look and how we project ourselves. And I think the best way to do that

490
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,760
is to have a healthy attitude about it in terms of, look, I'm doing this for me.

491
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,320
I'm not trying to impress somebody. I'm not trying to fit in with somebody. And what's amazing

492
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,240
is sometimes a little tiny thing that you wouldn't even know you wouldn't notice it,

493
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,280
but I see people walk out of the office with a different gate or they're smiling when they

494
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:16,640
weren't before. And we barely even did anything, but it's a little shift in the way that they

495
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,080
were thinking about themselves. And so it's not so much exactly what you do, but how you

496
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,200
help somebody to feel better. So in terms of doing like a neurotoxin, like doing your first

497
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,960
Botox injection, if you're looking at your parents and you see these lines and you think,

498
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,040
I don't really want those lines. So you do it before they start to become fixed lines,

499
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,560
those etched creases, you do it before you get that. So there's not really an age. I mean,

500
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,640
I've injected people in their twenties. I've injected people in their eighties. I think it's

501
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,360
never too late, but there's certainly times where it can be too early. Now, have you ever found

502
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,680
yourself in a situation where you felt it was unethical to participate in the care of a patient

503
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,800
because you felt that they were just being too neurotic or they were asking for something that

504
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,320
you felt was too much? I mean, did you find yourself in that situation? All the time,

505
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,160
all the time. I think that's the nature of what I do. It goes along with it. And so

506
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,440
the way that you look is tied in very closely to your emotions. And when you, especially when

507
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,480
it's your eyes, and I see people all the time that have had poorly done procedures and they're

508
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,640
tearful when they're talking to me. And I see people, I think they're unrealistic. And I try to

509
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:34,400
guide them. My goal is to be on their side all the time. So in order to sort of focus on overall

510
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,200
wellness, not just appearance, but, but there is, I think there's a connection between appearance

511
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,120
and wellness. And if you seem to me like, you know, there's something else going on here,

512
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,680
why are you chasing after this, this one line when you look, anyone who would look at you

513
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,800
objectively would say, oh, yes, you look younger, you look more relaxed, you look refreshed, like,

514
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,040
what are we really talking about here? Well, maybe there's something else to talk about.

515
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,960
So you're almost having to try to be a psychologist, psychiatrist at the same time.

516
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,120
In a way, I mean, maybe it's also my, my wife is a therapist. And so some of that probably

517
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:15,440
has brushed off on me in terms of how important it is, having somebody to talk to that's outside of

518
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,680
judgment. And so I think sometimes people need to, maybe it's not just one thing, it's both, it's

519
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,440
having someone to talk to, maybe there's some other issues going on. And, you know, what is your

520
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,360
goal in doing this? Let's go back a little bit further. Let's say someone's listening to this,

521
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,840
and maybe this is a lot of people and they think, look, it's really good to know that there are

522
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:46,400
people out there like you who can do the most nuanced, complicated grafting, injecting techniques

523
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,720
above, below the eye, the forehead, etc. But what if they say, look, I don't want to do anything that

524
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,200
I can't do as the patient myself, meaning lotions, potions, behavioral changes.

525
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,760
Let's start, you alluded to sun, let's start there. I get asked all the time, and I'm kind of

526
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,320
embarrassed because I just don't know the answer. And I have to say, I have no clue. I get asked

527
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,800
all the time, Peter, what sunscreen should I be wearing? Like, I feel like it's easier for me to

528
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,880
answer like, how would you solve the Iran nuclear missile crisis? Or, you know, before like, I don't

529
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,720
have a clue what sunscreen to wear. It's a complex marketplace, let's say, because the way that

530
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,520
sunscreens are marketed, the way that the labeling is done, can be a little bit confusing. And there

531
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,800
are technologies that are being employed now that are newer that we don't fully understand.

532
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,040
So let's start with the first question, which is, there are some people out there who say sunscreen

533
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,480
is horrible, you should never wear it. I'm assuming you don't think that that's the right approach?

534
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,080
It's absolutely untrue. I mean, I can't feel strongly enough about, look, I see a lot of skin

535
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:58,960
cancer, and I treat skin cancer, and it's, it's obvious, and it's been well scientifically proven

536
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,040
that there's a correlation between UV radiation and skin cancer, right? So I have to reconstruct

537
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,720
people's eyelids, their faces, their noses, because they've had basal cells, which basal cell

538
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,560
carcinoma, which is related to sun exposure. My wife has had several Mohs procedures where,

539
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,240
which means a dermatologist with special surgical training has to remove pieces of skin,

540
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,720
and then that has to be reconstructed. And you know, I don't think anybody wants to go through that.

541
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,400
Look, the recommendations, the American Academy of Dermatology is to protect children from sun,

542
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,480
and there's recommendations about levels of sunscreen. So you can get your vitamin D,

543
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,600
even if you're using sunscreen. So when we talk about UV, they talk about UVA and UVB,

544
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,840
and you'll see these things on sunscreen. Can you explain what UVA and BR? Traditionally, UV,

545
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,120
you can think about it as UVA, the A might stand for aging, and the UVB is for burning.

546
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,440
UVB is what's responsible for your skin turning red. Okay, they're just different wavelengths

547
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,760
of ultraviolet light. And when you're looking at SPF, they're talking about UVB. The way that

548
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,600
they determine SPF is they will take a subject, they'll do it probably, I think you'd have 10

549
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,560
subjects, this is just done on a person is not like a laboratory test that works well for this,

550
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,320
they still use it on people. So they would put you under a light in a laboratory with UVB,

551
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:31,760
and they would wait and see how long it takes for you to turn red. And then an SPF, so that's

552
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:40,080
UVB radiation. SPF 15 means what do we need to put on you that will make you turn red 15 times

553
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:48,160
longer. It'll take 15 times longer to turn red. And 30. And this is messy, silly question, but

554
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,440
is there an objective metric for what redness is? Like there's a color, you know, how like you can

555
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,280
define colors by the percent red. You can measure the color. Got it. So it's a purely objective

556
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:05,280
measurement. So it's interesting, SP 15, which seems like very mild sunscreen, still gives you

557
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,040
15 more times. So if it takes you 10 minutes, this is going to take you to, you know, what 150

558
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,320
minutes is like two, two and a half hours, basically. If you look at the difference between SPF 30

559
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:24,880
and SPF 50, you're getting a difference of, I think it's like a 96 or 96% protection against

560
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,880
UV during that time versus 98% protection. So it's, it actually becomes less of a difference

561
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,560
in protection from those rays as you go up higher. So over 30, you don't get that much more benefit.

562
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,880
So, but you should be using at least a 30, but that's talking about UVB. If you want to protect

563
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,640
yourself from UVA and UVB, which you should, you should be using a sunscreen that says broad

564
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,160
spectrum. Okay. And it's still the same SPF system? Well, no, SPF does not apply to UVA. It

565
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,640
doesn't measure UVA. In fact, there's no measurement of UVA. So if you buy a broad spectrum sunscreen,

566
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,240
it will not have an SPF number on it. Or if it has an SPF, but it relates to UVB. Okay, got it.

567
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,640
Because UVA doesn't cause redness. So you can use that test. Which of the two is more responsible

568
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,320
for vitamin D synthesis? That's a good question. I don't have the answer for you.

569
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,000
All right, we will, we will find out the answer to that question at some point. That should be

570
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:32,080
known. My, my intuition is it's UVA, but I, I, I don't know. But both are responsible for skin

571
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:38,320
cancer. Got it. So UVA is can, can lead to melanoma. Now, I remember reading that, you know, I mean,

572
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,760
I've read so many things like you should always have zinc in your sunscreen. You should never have

573
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,440
zinc in your sunscreen. So there's other divisions of sunscreen types. And so there's something called

574
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:57,440
organic and inorganic, which we also more commonly is termed chemical versus physical. So the inorganic

575
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,480
sunscreens are physical. And those typically use zinc or titanium, which are metals,

576
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:08,800
as a reflective agent, and it just reflects the rays of sun. So those are the ones that you think

577
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,360
of like Baywatch and you have like the white under your eyes, but they don't look like that anymore,

578
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,080
because now they have micronized versions of those inks and they have nanoparticle.

579
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,720
All right, so smaller particles mean that it looks clearer. You still get a little bit of that

580
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,080
lightish. I gave you one of my sunscreens before. You get a little bit of a whitish hue, but it's

581
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,840
not like a pasty white. Those are the ones I recommend because it reflects the light. Now,

582
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,320
there are some newer chemical sunscreens that are thought to be safe, but there are some issues

583
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,880
so the way the chemical sunscreens work, which are considered the organic sunscreens,

584
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,280
they absorb the UV light and they convert them into heat, which disperses locally in your skin.

585
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,840
So if you have melasma, those type of sunscreens could potentially worsen your melasma.

586
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,360
Tell us what melasma is. Oh, sorry. So it's also termed like the mask of pregnancy. You see darkness

587
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:06,000
or hyperpigmentation on the cheeks, the upper lip, the forehead. Any dyschromia or brown spots can be

588
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,320
made worse by heat, which is why I recommend against some of the chemical sunscreens. I wouldn't

589
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:19,040
say it's a blanket statement. Some of the chemical sunscreens also have hormonal disruptive effects,

590
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,920
which is why they're not recommended for children, but I wouldn't recommend it for myself either.

591
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,360
So what are some, maybe what we'll do in the show notes, we'll link to like brands that you really,

592
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,920
really like versus brands that people should really avoid. If you're sitting there at the

593
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,400
CVS and you're trying to get some sunscreen before you go to the beach, are there any ingredients

594
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,120
that are red flags that you should avoid? So I don't like octanoxate, which is a hormonal

595
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:49,520
disruptor. I think it's debated and how much dose do you need in order to really disrupt hormones,

596
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,480
but I don't really need that at all. If I just would look for physical sunscreen that has broad

597
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,520
spectrum and at least an SPF 30, that's pretty simple. Some of them say they're waterproof versus

598
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,600
not waterproof. Is that a gimmick or is that the real deal? It's hard to measure the waterproof

599
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,360
effect, but they do that the same test, but they're spraying it down with water

600
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:12,320
in the lab and then they're waiting to see how long you turn red. I think the key is that you

601
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,720
have to apply enough. Most people don't put enough sunscreen on. I'm guilty of that as well. I mean,

602
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,720
I was in Florida a month ago and I'm still sort of tan and I was wearing a wide brim hat and I'm

603
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,520
applying sunscreen, but it obviously wasn't enough. So and you apply every couple hours. I mean,

604
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,520
every two hours you should probably reapply. Interesting. I know people, we don't do it.

605
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,280
I don't do that either. But if you care about how your face looks,

606
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,120
then at least focus on that and maybe your hands too and maybe your chat, what we call the declotage

607
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,360
like your chest. Those are the areas that are going to be exposed. And if you want to look

608
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:52,000
your best, don't forget about your hands because when you're 70, you'll have brown spots and you'll

609
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,480
have wrinkly skin on your hands. If you don't protect yourself, your face, you don't want to get

610
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,400
wrinkles. So put on sunscreen, wear a hat that has a wide brim. And then particularly for women,

611
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,120
or if you wear a low-cut shirt or you're wearing a v-neck t-shirt, then put it on your chest.

612
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,880
Are there certain moisturizing creams that people can apply that have sunscreen in them,

613
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,560
but they're primarily like, they're not necessarily sunscreen per se. Like

614
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,760
CeraVee is a product that I have used from time to time. It's not a very high SPF. It might be a

615
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,640
15, but I really like it because it's odorless. I think part of the thing I hate about sunscreen

616
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,880
is I can't stand the smell of it and the greasiness of it. But the CeraVee, I'm like, yeah, I can

617
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,240
actually wear this. Yeah, I think 15 is probably low. Look, if we're here in New York City and you're

618
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,640
walking from your home to your office and you're probably getting a blast of sun on your face,

619
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,080
I put on a 30 in the morning. You can do a trial and you go to your cosmetic store,

620
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,560
you go to your dermatologist's office, and you ask to try a couple of them and you feel in your

621
00:55:52,560 --> 00:56:00,080
skin. I mean, the technology is getting better and the scents are, I think, have a wide range

622
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,800
to appeal to a wide range of people. You'll find something that will suit you if you look for it.

623
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,560
What brands do you like? I don't necessarily want to promote a specific brand because I think that

624
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:15,440
there are so many good products out there. If you look at the medical grade brands,

625
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,920
which are sold in doctor's offices, but you can find them also online. You can find them on some

626
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:26,320
of the online vendors. Elta is known to be a good brand, MD Solar Science. I like Replenix,

627
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,960
Skinceuticals. You'll find a long list of potential products. I don't mean to leave any

628
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,880
out or focus on those. Yeah. Okay, so then the next thing I want to talk about as far as just

629
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,960
sort of nuts and bolts maintenance stuff is something I've heard quite a bit about and also

630
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,120
have tried from time to time is retinoic acid. So first of all, what is it and why does one use

631
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:58,720
it or how does it work? Well, so we're talking about a form of vitamin A and it acts like a

632
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:06,720
hormone in the fact that it works in the intracellular and the DNA level. So it's affecting

633
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:12,560
transcription of particular genes. It's promoting collagen synthesis. It's increasing the turnover

634
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:20,400
of skin cells. It's one of the few things that's proven for anti-aging, but also for acne. So there

635
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:27,440
are a wide range of forms of vitamin A, but it's one of the top three things I would recommend for

636
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,040
everyone to be using if they are interested in having a skincare regimen that's effective.

637
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,680
Now, retin A cannot be bought over the counter or can it?

638
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,200
You can get over the counter retinols. Okay. So the retinol is a less potent

639
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:50,160
version of what you're referring to, which is retinoin. And do those over the counter versions,

640
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,400
which are obviously less potent, do they have the same efficacy or do you have to reply them

641
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,880
more frequently? They're not as potent, but they have less side effects. So if you have not used

642
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,200
one of these products before and you're looking primarily for anti-aging or for anti-wrinkles,

643
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,080
you want your skin to look younger. So it helps that you have less wrinkles. It helps reduce

644
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,200
pigment in your skin. Someone who's been using retinol from their twenties on, they always look

645
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,320
better. How often should one use it? This stuff can dry your skin out, right? Yeah. So it's less

646
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:26,000
drying when you're using the over the counter retinol type products. I would start with something

647
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,160
like that if you haven't done it before. And often those have moisturizers or hyaluronic acid or

648
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,760
other things in there that avoid some of that drying. If you do get dry from that, then you can

649
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,640
just use it every second or third day, or you can do sort of a pulse treatment where you put it on

650
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,280
and then 10 minutes later, you wash it off. So you've sort of gotten a short exposure

651
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,840
if you can tolerate that. And that's primarily recommended for nighttime. There's a myth that

652
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:59,360
retinol is making you sun sensitive. I mean, it's possible because your skin has less pigment in it

653
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:06,240
and your skin looks younger, but it's more that the retinol breaks down from sun exposure,

654
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,680
right? So it becomes ineffective. I always assumed it was for what you said in the first place,

655
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,320
which is you'll get more burned if you use it. And that's okay. It's not necessarily true,

656
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,280
but it is recommended. We use it at nighttime. I use it every night. Now, if you can tolerate that,

657
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,520
then you can talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for a higher strength. And that's

658
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:33,200
usually like 0.025% or 0.05% or 0.1. So I'm up to 0.1 now and I do it every night and I have no

659
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,120
side effects, but I use just the generic 0.1% tretinoin. Yeah, that stuff ain't cheap. Yeah,

660
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:44,960
no, I know. And there's newer generations that also have less side effects, but the traditional

661
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,080
tretinoin works nicely, but a little bit goes a really long way. I mean, you can use one of those

662
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,000
45-gram tubes, can last you several months. And you put it all over your face. Yes. The other

663
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,040
myth. So for guys, someone like me who's got kind of a beard, am I also supposed to apply it over

664
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,960
the bearded area? I think that's tough to do. The nice thing as someone who shaves every day,

665
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,960
that area, when you're shaving it, you're basically giving yourself like a microdermabrasion. So you're

666
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,880
mechanically abrading the outer surface, the surface layer of your skin, which also promotes

667
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,280
skin turnover. So you're probably a little bit protected there, but I would apply it to your

668
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,760
whole face and include your eyelids. A lot of people say, don't put it on your eyes. There's

669
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,880
a myth, I think, that you have skin on your eyes, right, on your eyelids. So that skin, if anything,

670
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,240
it's more effective because that skin is thinner. So you might not use it as often there, but I

671
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,720
close my eyes, I apply it to my upper lids, I apply it all the way up to the eyelash line.

672
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,200
So if we're going to do, we've got two things in our toolkit so far. We're going to put sunscreen

673
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:51,600
on in the morning. We're going to put retinoic acid on at night. Is there anything else that you

674
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:57,920
recommend as part of a kind of overall maintenance plan? So like vitamin C would be the third part

675
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,200
of the trifecta. Vitamin C is also- Vitamin C, which most people think of as like a vitamin you

676
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,160
take to avoid getting colds, though that seems to be kind of bogus. So topical vitamin C. And

677
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,920
this one might be a little bit more controversial. I mean, it's not thought to be controversial because

678
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:20,480
every skincare line promotes their vitamin C. And the question is what type of vitamin C is

679
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,200
effective, but think about vitamin C deficiency, right? What happens to your skin? Yeah, well,

680
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,920
you'd get scurvy, you'd get collagen deficiency, right? So we know that lack of vitamin C is a

681
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,920
problem for the way you look in your skin. If you're healthy, does vitamin C help your skin?

682
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:41,280
Well, we know it's a very powerful antioxidant. So it's scavenging free radicals. So it's protecting

683
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,360
you from UV damage in that way. It also is a cofactor for collagen synthesis. It turns out

684
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:53,040
it does work better if you have it with vitamin E. But here's the thing. A lot of the products that

685
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:58,320
are out there, they oxidize. Vitamin C oxidizes very easily. And the L-ascorbic acid, which is

686
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,560
meant to be- it's thought to be the form that penetrates the best and is the most effective

687
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:09,040
once it's penetrated. It needs to be stabilized. And so there's different patents that are developed

688
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:14,000
by these companies. And they sort of have these patent wars, like whose patent is better for vitamin

689
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,520
C. And they try to protect their technology so other companies can use it. You'll find a lot

690
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,200
of stuff out there. And if your vitamin C can oxidize over time in the bottle.

691
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,080
That's why they always tend to- these things come in very dark bottles, right?

692
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:31,680
Right. And you keep it in your cabinet. Sun damage skin tends to have lower vitamin C levels. And I

693
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,160
think vitamin C is effective in those cases. Why can't they just add vitamin C to sunscreen,

694
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,640
for example? I don't know if it interacts well.

695
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,440
Isn't there something about iron that they put in this as well?

696
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,840
I think the one that you're thinking of that product, which is the C-E frulic. So the C in

697
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:51,840
the E we know are synergistic. The frulic acid is just another antioxidant. So it's just another

698
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:58,080
form of antioxidant that's added into the mix. But the issue is- and what I've seen in the literature

699
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,640
is that if your serum levels of vitamin C are high, then your skin doesn't absorb topical vitamin C

700
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:10,960
very well. So we don't know if applying vitamin C topically is preventing you from developing

701
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,880
sun damage. We know that if you already have sun damage that it helps to reverse it.

702
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,040
And you put this on in the morning or in the evening?

703
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,040
I typically do it in the morning, but you could do two times a day. But I use vitamin C in the

704
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,440
morning and I do retinol at night. And then the sunscreen goes on top of the vitamin C?

705
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,840
Yes. But I don't want too many steps. If I tell you you need to do 10 things,

706
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,680
you're going to stop doing all of them. So but if you can do these three things,

707
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,640
which I think that's pretty easy. You just have to think about your

708
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,960
C in your sunscreen in the morning and your vitamin A in the evening.

709
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,240
Do you have to separate the time between the sunscreen and the vitamin C so they don't

710
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,160
interact negative? I like the serums, the C serums. So I usually wait a couple of minutes

711
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,320
and when it's dry, then I apply my sunscreen. And look, this isn't a universal plan for

712
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:56,000
everybody. We all have different skin needs. But in general, this is a pretty good plan for most

713
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,040
people. Yeah. If one does this kind of stuff, right, they say, look, I'm going to put the effort

714
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:09,680
into what I do with respect to sunscreen with topical vitamin C, retinol. As you alluded to

715
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,880
earlier, I'm going to take greater care to care for my skin by wearing a hat, that kind of thing.

716
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,920
What percentage of the benefit is someone getting in terms of an anti-aging regimen?

717
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,160
Is that like half the battle right there? It will go a really long way. I've had patients

718
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,200
where we didn't touch them with a needle. It's been no surgery. It's just been recommendations

719
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:35,200
and a directed skincare regimen. And look, I'm not a dermatologist, but a lot of what I do is

720
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,440
skincare. Using these powerful basics, I've seen amazing changes. And so when you combine that

721
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,960
sometimes with some other concerns, some directed treatments, then it's synergistic. It's even better.

722
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:52,240
It sounds simple, right? But it's powerful. I mean, I think that makes sense. I guess anybody

723
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,800
can do those things. You do need prescriptions for at least the retinol, but I think everything else

724
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,640
you... But only for the prescription grade. Only for the high grade, yeah. So kind of going back

725
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,720
to something we talked about earlier, what are some of the trends that we're seeing now? I mean,

726
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,600
we alluded to at least one of them, which is lips getting a little fuller. Botox has certainly been

727
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,840
around for quite a while now. Are we seeing people using Botox in ways today that they weren't doing

728
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,640
it 10 years ago? Well, yeah. I mean, there's many more indications for Botox. We have

729
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,520
non-cosmetic indications, bladder spasms, vocal cord spasms, torticolis, migraines,

730
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:33,840
axillary hyperhidrosis. Botox is being used for so many different things. And I think we've

731
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:39,440
developed a more nuanced approach to how we treat people with Botox. I hope so. I still see people...

732
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:45,360
I even know Botox injectors that have these spock brows. If you've seen that where you get the

733
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,680
overarched, Nicole Kidman sort of had that appearance for a little while, not to say that

734
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,800
she doesn't look good or I don't know anything about how she was injected or treated or not.

735
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,960
But that look is often not desired, especially if you didn't have that look before.

736
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,560
So I still see a lot of those, what I would consider like amateur mistakes or maybe just not...

737
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,720
The field has progressed and most of us have gone along with it. But there's sort of a pressure,

738
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,480
I think, for a lot of physicians to move into the cosmetic realm because the world of insurance

739
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,440
doesn't reimburse as well as it used to. And so we're seeing a lot of new providers in the marketplace

740
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,600
and some of them have more experience than others. But we do have better ways of using

741
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:31,360
Botox, using it in smaller amounts, spread out over a larger area, using different facial muscles.

742
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,800
We can turn up the outer corners of the mouth so you don't look like you're frowning as much.

743
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:41,680
We can reduce a gummy smile by injecting above the lip. I can treat the lower eyelids so that you

744
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,160
can look like your eyes are slightly more open or we can reduce some of the squinching wrinkles

745
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:52,000
that happen under the eyes. There's a lot of ways that we can use this, that we didn't use them 15

746
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,680
years ago or 10 years ago. We've talked about some of this stuff in the past and one of the things

747
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:00,960
that I think I've taken away from those discussions is that if you're going to have this kind of stuff

748
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,200
done, you really want the person who's doing it to understand the anatomy. That's true. Because

749
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,800
you can see the wrinkle on the surface, but you have to understand that the wrinkle is the product

750
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:18,640
of changes in musculature and connective tissue and fat. I'm sure when you look at a face,

751
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,840
you actually are almost doing so with X-ray vision. You're seeing beyond the skin. You're

752
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,560
seeing everything that's underneath it and knowing that, well, look, if I actually want to reduce

753
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,960
that wrinkle, I don't necessarily inject into the wrinkle. I'm injecting obviously where the

754
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,800
muscle is. It's not just looking or understanding. It's also asking the patient to move. I say,

755
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,960
okay, I want you to frown for me and I can touch them. I can see where the muscle is pulling.

756
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,120
There's a variation in the way that we're built. Your muscle might come up at an angle and might

757
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,640
be different on the two different sides. It's important to look at those little differences

758
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:00,560
and to see what's happening. People say, look, I like to avoid a cookie cutter approach. Everything

759
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:05,920
is personalized. It's easy to say that. Everyone markets themselves as like, oh, we offer personalized

760
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,240
care. Every doctor says that that's what they do, but do they? Are they really giving personalized?

761
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,920
I know in your practice, you're giving personalized care because you're diving deep.

762
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,880
You're looking at things. You're not just ordering. You don't just call the lab and say,

763
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,120
hey, give me a CBC and a Chem 7 and then I'll tell a patient what he needs to do.

764
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:32,880
You're diving deep. That's truly personalized care. When you're looking at a patient and

765
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,840
if I have a fellow following me, I have to answer to what someone is training.

766
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:44,080
I have to answer to him too in terms of what I'm doing. If he sees me or she sees me doing the

767
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:49,440
same procedure in the same place in every patient, they're going to ask me, why did you do that same

768
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:56,320
thing? I don't because I feel that scrutiny for myself as well that your treatment is going to

769
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,520
be different from the other persons because you look different in your bodies, different in your

770
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,640
muscles or in different places and you have different concerns. That's what personalized

771
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,880
treatment is. It's not just saying it on your website. One of the things I get asked about a

772
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,000
lot by patients and this is why I'm really glad I know people like you because I obviously don't

773
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,600
know the answer to any of these questions is my friend got such and such a laser treatment on his

774
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:26,080
or her skin and I want to do that and all these different types of lasers and these things together.

775
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,920
Can you give us the 101 on laser treatment for skin?

776
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,640
I think lasers are effective in many ways and lasers are getting better. The technology is

777
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,040
getting better. There's fractional technology. There's different types of energy and it's

778
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:44,880
confusing though to consumers because you don't know, are you selecting a doctor? Are you selecting

779
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,080
a device? Anyone can buy a laser if you have a certain amount of money and you have a certain

780
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:55,280
amount of patience and how much of the work is being done by the laser by itself? You just turn

781
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:00,720
it on and it just happens or is it the provider selecting the right patients and changing the

782
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:06,720
settings? There's a lot of variables. There are some devices that doesn't matter who does it,

783
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:13,680
for the most part, like the cryolipolysis, cool sculpting. It's a device that suctions your fat

784
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,840
and it freezes it at a certain temperature and it uses an algorithm to figure out what

785
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,680
temperature needs to stay at for how long to adequately cause apoptosis of those fat cells.

786
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,560
Basically, someone just has to say, okay, this is the area we're going to do it and they stick

787
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,040
the machine on you. There's a little bit of understanding and training that goes into it,

788
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,720
but once you turn it on, it's done. You sit there and it happens and then you-

789
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,360
And is this cool sculpt procedure effective?

790
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,480
It's effective. There are other ones too. There's other types of the sculpture. There's other

791
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:50,960
devices that also effectively, non-surgically, can reduce fat, but they don't require a lot of,

792
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,760
it's not an operator dependent for the most part. So you turn them on and they're good and so

793
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,640
you can probably go to most places and they'll do a good job for that.

794
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,760
There's a procedure where they use heat and then there's a procedure where they use

795
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,440
cold. What is more effective?

796
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,560
They're both effective. There's a lot of devices, but the two main leaders in the market are both

797
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,800
effective and they're probably equally effective. They work in different amounts of time,

798
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,320
but usually you get about 20% of subcutaneous fat reduction with that course of treatment.

799
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,240
So if a person wants to take a little bit of fat off, presumably you do this on your belly

800
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,240
or you can do it like- You can do your flanks. Anywhere you can pinch fat, you can do it.

801
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,480
So it's subcutaneous fat. It's not visceral fat that's under the muscle, but it's the subcutaneous

802
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,360
fat and it works well. As long as you can apply the applicator, there are some limitations,

803
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
but they both, the main devices have FDA approval for NEX as well.

804
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,720
So those devices, doesn't really matter so much about who's doing it. You want to go to a reputable

805
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:49,520
place. You want to make sure it's the real device. There are Chinese knockoffs that are not FDA

806
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:56,000
approved. So you want to get the real one. There's cool sculpting as an FDA approved cryolipolysis

807
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:02,000
device, but I've seen fat freeze or something. And then you look into it and you say, this wasn't

808
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,040
even approved by the FDA for marketing. Got it. So at least make sure you're going with an FDA

809
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:12,080
approved procedure or device. There are lasers that work on skin. There are lasers-

810
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,080
What are the skin laser? People talk about getting their face

811
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:21,600
lasered for skin. I've had a chemical peel once a little while ago. I was really,

812
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,640
I mean, this has got to be about five or six years ago, I was amazed at two things. First of all,

813
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,160
how quick and easy it was for this dermatologist to apply this stuff to my face. That's the first

814
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:38,000
thing. The second thing that amazed me was how red I was for five days and how I had to lather

815
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:43,280
myself up in aqua for. And then third, I was just amazed at how many sunspots vanished.

816
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,520
Yeah. Well, I mean, that procedure can be very effective. There's lots of different types of

817
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:54,320
peels. There's phenol peels, which can have more risk, but more benefit. In fact, for a phenol

818
01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,560
peel, you have to be connected to an EKG. So you're monitoring for arrhythmias. There are TCA peels,

819
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:06,720
which can be also equally strong. There's a lot of experience that goes into selecting the type

820
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:12,000
of peel, how it's being applied, how many layers, what you're seeing. That is a very

821
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,840
operator-dependent procedure. So is there a chemical peel that you would say is,

822
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,880
if you were going to have one tomorrow, that you would preference?

823
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,160
I wouldn't say that. I think that's more of a depends on your skin type. There are certain

824
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:32,560
things that are not safe for darker skin types. So that's a very specific treatment plan for each.

825
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,840
Questions could people ask the provider to know that that, because really what you're

826
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,080
saying is you have to rely on the provider's judgment to know that.

827
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,840
Very heavily. Very heavily. And you can get a burn and you can get a scar.

828
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,400
So how do you screen out for who the right person is?

829
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,800
Well, it's asking, how many of you have you done? Can you show me examples? And is this

830
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:57,120
safe for my skin type and what are the risks? So chemical peels are essentially using an acid

831
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,880
or a chemical to burn away the outer layer of your skin. That's why you look so red.

832
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,520
And they go at different depths depending on how many layers of chemical are being applied

833
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,960
and what type of chemical and the strength. So I can use a 10% TCA peel on you and you'll

834
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:17,600
look slightly red and you'll look a little better. I can use a 35% and your skin will

835
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:24,000
peel off like a snake. So there's a wide range and it might not be safe for all skin types.

836
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,560
So let's look at me right now. I'm kind of an olive skin dude. I've probably got,

837
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,480
I don't know where I would rank on the sun damage scale, but I would say for you,

838
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,560
either you're looking at a, let's say you want to just do a skin rejuvenation,

839
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,760
you want to look smoother, less wrinkles, improved texture and brown spots. So we would

840
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,200
either talk about a chemical peel, like it may be a TCA peel of 20% and I might recommend three

841
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:54,000
treatments or we would talk about a laser. So the laser does the same thing that the chemicals do

842
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,920
except it's using energy to burn the surface. Most lasers today are fractional, meaning that

843
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,400
they're not taking away everything like a peel would, right? The liquid from the chemical peel

844
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,520
is going to take off all of your skin, at least the outer layer in a continuous fashion,

845
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,680
whereas the fractional laser is creating dots and leaving some normal skin in between.

846
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,920
So the most common lasers for resurfacing would be Herbium and CO2, carbon dioxide.

847
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,080
And again, within those, there's different levels and different energy settings

848
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:32,720
and certain patients are not candidates for those and some are. So that relies heavily also

849
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:37,120
on the experience of the provider. Now there's some very safe lasers that are very low grade,

850
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,840
like a laser like clear and brilliant, very low risk at causing a problem for most people

851
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,320
and doesn't always have to be a doctor performing the procedure. It can,

852
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,160
and depending on your state laws can be an esthetician or a nurse.

853
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,760
And are these painful procedures? Do people need some sedation for them?

854
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,920
Usually no, it means it depends on your pain tolerance. The heavier duty lasers, the more

855
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,400
powerful are going to require some type of anesthetic, whether it's an injection,

856
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,280
topical anesthesia, sometimes sedation. And often we do them in combination with surgery. So my

857
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,520
patients asleep while I'm lasering them, we're doing one thing and then we're lasering another.

858
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:18,240
That is something where you need a consultation and someone to evaluate your skin type and say,

859
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,960
okay, this is my recommendation for you based on my experience and my knowledge, my training.

860
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:29,040
But there are also, I think when you would also lump into that category would be the energy

861
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:35,440
devices that are now becoming more rampant and these are designed for facial adjuvenation in

862
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,400
terms of tightening, not the skin surface. So the first generation were things like

863
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,920
thermage that used radio frequency or today you see all therapy, which is a focused ultrasound.

864
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:53,680
You're seeing more plasma devices. The idea is heat is stimulating collagen synthesis and

865
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:59,440
contraction and tightening. And for the most part, I'm underwhelmed with these technologies.

866
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,120
In a way, it's almost like, you know, I kind of referred to like the emperor wears no clothes,

867
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:12,080
right? Where the doctor has invested a lot of money in this device. And so they have some stake in

868
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:17,120
it working, whether it does or not. And the patient is investing a substantial amount of money,

869
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,200
potentially for them. And so you don't want to feel like you're a sucker and you've spent a lot

870
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:25,280
of money on something that doesn't work. But you have to look at the before and after photos.

871
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,760
And if you have a hard time telling which is which, then you're not going to see a lot.

872
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:36,400
Is anybody doing anything with PRP in terms of facial rejuvenation? PRP, plate-labelaged plasma

873
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,520
has obviously achieved, you know, some success, although I think it is still somewhat questionable,

874
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,720
but at least anecdotally, there are people who are certainly reporting success in the periphery,

875
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,840
for example, treating orthopedic injuries with it.

876
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,560
And it started out, I think, in the dental realm for dry sockets. I mean, I think they sort of

877
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,520
pioneered PRP in a lot of ways. Oh, I didn't know that.

878
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,920
And I think, you know, here in New York, I feel like you can get PRP on every corner now.

879
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:08,800
It's become so widespread in medical spas and cosmetic practices, because it's so

880
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,080
accessible for providers to perform. And it's always autologous.

881
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:17,360
Yes, yeah, of course. So what that means for people is it's your own. They take yours out,

882
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,720
they spin it, they return it versus aloe, which would mean you could use it from a donor. So

883
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,320
what do people do in skin with this? I think you probably feel the same way

884
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:31,600
as me. Whenever there's something is like touted as a cure-all, you have to be a little bit

885
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:37,520
skeptical. Can PRP help your joint pain? And can it make your skin look smoother?

886
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,280
And can it replace your hair? And is it going to heal all your wounds?

887
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:47,040
Enhance your erections. I know. So I think it's a nice thought to think that the magic

888
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,000
that we were looking for all these years was inside of us. It's like the end of a Disney movie.

889
01:18:52,960 --> 01:19:00,160
But is it true? I mean, I'm skeptical. I've had PRP injected in my head, my scalp,

890
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:06,400
for prevention of hair loss. And I'm underwhelmed. So let's talk about hair loss.

891
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,400
The mechanisms that are causing hair loss in men, the antrogenic alopecia,

892
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,560
are still happening, whether I do an injection or not. So how often are you going to have to

893
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,480
do it? Let's say it does work. You're creating, what does PRP do? You're talking about

894
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:29,120
the platelets in your blood, which are, what is their purpose? They're there to help with injuries.

895
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,920
They clot. They send out signals saying we have an injury here. So send more growth factors. Let's

896
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:43,600
heal this injury. There's angiogenesis, neocollagenesis. So let's explain those terms. So angiogenesis

897
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:49,760
means recruiting more blood vessels, neocollagen, more collagen. We're trying to create a scaffolding

898
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:54,560
and a framework to heal a wound. So when you have a cut on your arm and your platelets go to that

899
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,520
area and they create a clot. They send out chemical signals to also do those other things.

900
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,560
So we do heal ourselves. And if you're an animal in the woods and you get a gash in your leg,

901
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,640
then you'll get a clot there and it'll contract and hopefully if you don't get infected,

902
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:15,520
then you'll just have a scar. So for hair growth, if you inject it in your scalp, then I think

903
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,800
there's probably a role for the idea is that you're creating an environment

904
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:24,160
that will help to stimulate the existing stem cells that lie within your hair follicles,

905
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:30,400
maybe creating more blood flow to allow for more hair or prolong the cycle of hair growth.

906
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,160
Right. So the hairs grow longer. So you have more of them and they become potentially thicker.

907
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:43,120
But we still have the hormones of 5HT is still in that area and it's still fighting in the opposite

908
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:48,560
direction. So if you do have a benefit and let's say you do three treatments a month apart

909
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,320
and you look a little bit thicker, then how often do you have to repeat it like every four

910
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,440
months or every three months? Wow, that's a lot of work. And for me, it was uncomfortable. I mean,

911
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,800
look, you can do a ring blot. You can numb the area by injecting all the way around your head.

912
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,880
I drew my own blood, but then I had my dermatologist friend inject it for me. But by the time I did

913
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,640
that, the anesthetic that we injected did already worn off and it was uncomfortable.

914
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:16,480
But I tolerated it and I don't think it was, I didn't get a great result. I think it's known

915
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:22,320
to work better for females. But the literature is not very, it doesn't support it very strongly.

916
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,600
I think maybe it will eventually. We just don't have good studies on it.

917
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,920
And do you stratify by, you know, patients that are taking 5-alpha reductase inhibitors,

918
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:36,320
so a drug like Propecia or Avadart that block the conversion of testosterone to DHT,

919
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,240
the hormone that's responsible for hair loss. And then you can also apply these topical things

920
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,360
like Minoxidil. I mean, you can go all in and that probably is better. Or if you're having

921
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:51,040
hair grafting, right, like transplants, then it's often done at the same time and do PRP.

922
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:57,200
So I think I haven't seen any negative to it other than sometimes I think it's ineffective.

923
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,440
And I think it's one of those things also like these skin tightening lasers, the

924
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:07,840
facelift lasers that I think it's oversold. And the same thing with facial rejuvenation.

925
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,040
You know, it's very popular to do this thing called vampire facial.

926
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:11,600
What's that?

927
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,760
So that's taking the PRP, which is your, you know, from your own blood. That's where

928
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,440
the term came from. This was like a, I think it's probably like a Kardashian.

929
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,560
How much, how much blood do they need to do a PRP treatment?

930
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:28,080
Typically, if I'm so, and I offer this treatment, I don't oversell it, but I offer it in my practice.

931
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,560
I'll draw, let's say 10 vials, 8cc vials. So a total of let's say 80 milliliters.

932
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:41,120
And we spin it down. I do a double spin method. And then we extract the platelets from,

933
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,320
we separate it from the platelet, poor plasma and the red blood cells.

934
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,240
And then we, I activate those platelets. That's also controversial.

935
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,800
There's a lot of different methods of creating PRP and there's a lot of variety.

936
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,760
And so that's one of the problems with the studies that are out there,

937
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:01,600
that there's inconsistent methods and not everybody is also quantifying how much PRP

938
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,920
are they collecting. Some doctors have counters in their offices and they can say,

939
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,080
okay, this is the concentration I'm delivering, but there are different methods.

940
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,920
And so you don't know what you're getting. Some people are injecting platelet, poor plasma and

941
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,000
platelet rich plasma together and calling it PRP, but it's not necessarily.

942
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,240
So if you're going to get PRP done, you should confirm that the person doing this

943
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,600
has a way of counting the platelets. Not necessarily. I think you just have to

944
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,600
have a proven method of concentrating the platelets. They have to know exactly what

945
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,960
they're doing. I used to have a lot of experience with aphoresis when I was

946
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,760
back in the lab and this was super complicated. I mean, at the time we were identifying,

947
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:43,040
we were trying to extrapolate or rather identify lymphocytes. So you would put a huge 14 gauge

948
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:48,000
needle in one arm, draw a bunch of blood out, run through the aphoresis machine and basically return

949
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,760
everything except the lymphocyte. That's serious business. Like you've got to know exactly what

950
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,800
you're doing. It seems that PRP would be similar, wouldn't it? Especially because the platelet and

951
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,360
the red blood cells are the same color. So you can easily be confused by color contamination.

952
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,280
But you can see what the difference is when you spin this down. Yeah, the density should

953
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,680
separate them. The red blood cells are all that bottom section is all red and I don't want any

954
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:17,280
of that. But when I first started doing it, I did send the samples into the lab and we got an

955
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,360
emergency call in the middle of the night. Your patient has super high platelets and

956
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,760
oh, it's okay. We were just checking it. But I did quantify it initially. I don't quantify it

957
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,480
every time because I'm still using the same method. But then the question is, do you activate the

958
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,840
platelets or do you just put them there and hope that they're going to activate? And what do you

959
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:39,200
activate them with? You can usually use some form of calcium, like calcium gluconate or calcium chloride.

960
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,480
And so you just... And you dilute the platelets obviously before you inject them

961
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:49,120
or do you inject them in that concentrated... So I go from that ADCC of initial blood draw

962
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:54,480
and I end up with about 8cc total of PRP. And that's fully concentrated platelets.

963
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,720
There's a little bit of platelet-poor plasma in there, but I've gotten rid of most of that

964
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:04,480
platelet-poor plasma. So it's platelets suspended in plasma, but it's highly concentrated and many

965
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,600
fold more than what you'd have in your serum. So the vampire facial, what we're doing is taking

966
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,760
micro-needling pen, which is a pen that has 12 needles at the tip that are surgical small needles.

967
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:21,520
And these are not reusable. They're per-patient. So it's a sterile setting. This pen has a motor

968
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,800
and it's going up and down, driving the needles in and out of your skin at a selected depth.

969
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,840
It actually doesn't hurt like you would think it does. Come in and I'll do it. I might pass.

970
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:38,800
But I can do it at a depth of a millimeter. I can do 1.5 millimeters, 2 millimeters.

971
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,200
The deeper we go, the more you bleed. It doesn't hurt like you think. We numb you first with a

972
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:49,200
topical anesthetic. But as you bleed from those channels, the face looks sort of bloody. And I

973
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,240
think that's where the term vampire facial came, but then we're using the PRP on the surface,

974
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,240
but also applying it as we're doing the needling to drive the PRP into those channels.

975
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,960
So this is a hollow bore or solid bore needle? Solid bore needle.

976
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,800
So solid bore needle creates the trauma. And then how do you get the PRP into it?

977
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,400
So this is variable among doctors and providers, but you can apply it to the surface and then

978
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,800
needle over it. The idea is that you're driving it into the channel. You can apply it to the channel

979
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,520
and assume that it's going to absorb because you have now like more porosity. And you can also

980
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:25,680
inject it directly under the skin like a filler. I'm not a major proponent of this procedure.

981
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,560
I mean, besides infection, what are the other big risks of this?

982
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,280
It's actually a pretty low risk procedure. I think the biggest risk is financial loss.

983
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,840
How much does this procedure cost? I would say on average, it's about, you know,

984
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:43,920
let's say 800 to $1,200 a treatment for the PRP with the micro needling.

985
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,160
You can spend a lot of money trying to look good, huh?

986
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:51,840
Yeah. And you know, it's recommended to do it every couple months or do it every six months.

987
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,200
I mean, so I wouldn't say, I'm not saying I'm against this procedure,

988
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,160
but I don't think it's well proven because look, it's marketed for wrinkles,

989
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:07,280
for acne scarring, for hyperpigmentation, for anti-aging, most of the time. So again,

990
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,160
look at the before and afters because everyone's going to put their best work out.

991
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,480
So if you look at the before and afters that I've seen, like type in Instagram,

992
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:21,600
PRP facial or micro needling facial or PRP injections, and look at the acne scarring

993
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:28,960
pictures. And it's very hard to find good results that are not the result of differences in lighting.

994
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,080
Right? You have a shadowy picture before, and then you have a front-facing light in the after.

995
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:39,280
And I would say the majority of the time, any benefit that you're seeing is from that.

996
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,240
There's some evidence. There's some evidence that it does help. And on a histologic level,

997
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:50,400
yes, we're building collagen, but it has to be significant enough to be observable to the people

998
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:55,440
around you. Otherwise, are we just like making ourselves feel better? Or are we just jumping

999
01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:00,240
on to the bandwagon? Or is it a money grab for a doctor's office? I mean, I'm not criticizing

1000
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:06,240
anyone for doing this, but I don't think it's been fully vetted. And so I think because it's a

1001
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:12,480
relatively safe procedure, I think it's overall, I don't think it's detrimental, but the results

1002
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:18,000
speak for themselves. Is it safe to say then that these are three broad categories of facial

1003
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,560
rejuvenation? You've got the chemical peels where you're like physically applying a chemical to the

1004
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:28,320
skin and burning it. You've got the laser peels where you're fractionating and selectively burning.

1005
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:33,680
And then you've got this whole PRP vampire trick. And micro needling, there's radio frequency needles.

1006
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:39,840
I mean, there's a huge realm of devices. And there's a lot of money in this industry. So

1007
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:44,960
there's definitely a drive that's motivated financially for companies to come out with the

1008
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,520
next thing. And they have to sell the next thing to the doctor's office.

1009
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,160
What is the typical FDA approval process? I mean, a drug typically takes more than 10 years

1010
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,800
to get approved. It's not that lengthy. And it depends if there's a predicate device.

1011
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,720
So if there's something that's a similar energy, it's much easier. And you can usually get it

1012
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:08,480
based on the previous device. A new device can take longer. It depends. But it could be,

1013
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:13,840
it depends what it is. If there's an IRB study that's been already done, it could be six months,

1014
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,480
it could be a year, it could be two years. But you also have to have an understanding that

1015
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:22,240
such because something's FDA approved doesn't mean that it's effective. It just means that it's safe.

1016
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:28,080
Safe, yeah. So there's lots of devices that I think are bogus. And I see them all the time.

1017
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,960
And you have to look at what's really going on here. Is it that this industry needs to make

1018
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,520
more devices? And I hate to say that I'm not trying to criticize my friends and my colleagues

1019
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:42,240
that are in the industry. But I think we do have to step back sometimes and look at this and say,

1020
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:48,320
who are we serving? Are we serving ourselves? Are we serving our patients? If I do a treatment

1021
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,960
on you, and it's not that effective, are you going to come back to me? I mean, you might.

1022
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:58,960
But if I do it again and again and patients are walking, that's not the foundation of my practice.

1023
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,600
And hopefully it's not like that for everyone, but everyone has different motivations. And

1024
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,040
I would say I wouldn't do something on you that I wouldn't do on a family member.

1025
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,160
And hopefully that's how most people are. And it probably is. I think most physicians,

1026
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,240
most providers have good motivations, but it's not universal. And so I think you have to be

1027
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:21,360
careful. If you look for a device or a treatment, it's probably better to look for a provider that

1028
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:27,280
you trust than to look for the device. I mean, devices, you can find the same devices in most

1029
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,320
cosmetic offices. But how are they being used? And who are they being offered to? And are they

1030
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,920
being selective? I mean, there's a treatment that I do now that's called thread lifting, right?

1031
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,680
It's a dissolving thread that has barbs in it. And we sort of lift the skin non-surgically.

1032
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:47,120
And more than half the people that come in asking for it, I turn them away because I think they're

1033
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:53,200
not candidates. And I think it's effective in a very select group of people. And everyone

1034
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:57,840
else, I have to say I'm sorry, but I don't want you to walk around saying that it didn't, it didn't

1035
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,720
work. So it's interesting that I was in residency. I remember one of the attendings saying something

1036
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:08,400
that I never forgot, which was, he said, you know, your reputation as a surgeon is going to be much

1037
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:13,360
more about the patients you choose not to operate on the patients you choose to operate on. Yeah,

1038
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,320
I didn't really understand that at the time, but it certainly has made sense later on down the line,

1039
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,680
which is effectively what you're saying, you know, if you, you only need a couple of times where

1040
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:28,560
you've done something on someone who shouldn't have had it done, and it can out outweigh the

1041
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:34,000
benefits of the, you know, the hundreds of people who responded well. Yeah. And those are the ones

1042
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
you stay awake thinking about, right? We stay awake thinking about the mistakes. Yeah, it's true.

1043
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And hopefully you learn from them. I mean, the other phrase that you hear a lot is like,

1044
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,160
to the hammer the world's a nail, right? And so how that applies to this field is when you go into

1045
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:54,640
someone's office, are they, are they willing to refer you to somebody for something that they

1046
01:31:54,640 --> 01:32:00,320
don't do or that they don't think that they're the best person to do? If someone comes to me and

1047
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:05,680
they want tattoo removal, you know, I might have a laser that can do tattoo removal, but it's not

1048
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,960
the best one. If I'm not going to do it on my wife, then, and I'd rather, you know, I'm going to send

1049
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,640
her to my dermatologist friend that has the Pico second laser, then I'm not going to push you

1050
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:21,440
into that box. So you, I think you have to be wary too. If you're looking for a solution,

1051
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:26,800
you have a problem and you want a solution and you go to somebody, are they giving you the solution

1052
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,400
they have? Are they giving the solution that you need? So that could be another good filtering

1053
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,440
question for patients, which is when you meet with a doctor say, Hey, Dr. So-and-so, what are the

1054
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,320
types of procedures you typically don't do and you refer out? And depending on their honesty with

1055
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,560
that, you may get, you know, better insight into, you know, who they are. Yeah. Or if there's a

1056
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,560
procedure, let's say there's a problem that you have and you say, what is your solution and say,

1057
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:55,520
are there other solutions that are out there that you can discuss? So in my area of interest, which

1058
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:01,280
is longevity, I spend a little bit of time, not a tremendous amount of time, but maybe 10% of my

1059
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:06,720
energy goes into thinking about the future. What are the step function changes? What are the things

1060
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:12,560
that are out there that are not a part of what I do today because they're not ready for prime time,

1061
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:18,000
or they're still very theoretical, but they're the things I want to keep enough tabs on because

1062
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,520
I hope that within the next decade or maybe beyond, they become relevant.

1063
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:27,360
What fits that description in your field? What are the things that maybe aren't ready for use

1064
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:32,720
yet but show promise? It sort of makes me shudder to think about the future because I imagine myself

1065
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:40,000
20 years from now, hopefully I'm still practicing and I'm going to look back and think like, wow,

1066
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,080
you know, we were in Plato's cave at that time, like we were seeing the shadows on the wall

1067
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:51,040
and not seeing the true objects, right? And I think we are in a sense, right? I mean, what is

1068
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,440
our, how limited is our understanding and the things that we, we don't know that we don't

1069
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:00,800
know them yet. And so I think there are things, the things that we're doing today that I don't

1070
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:06,240
fully understand, like things like fat grafting, I use it and I think there's some predictability to

1071
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:14,400
it, but we don't fully understand why it works and how it works. And I think some of that relates to

1072
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:19,600
the stem cells, the stem cell effect. And you hear a lot about stem cells being used for all

1073
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:24,000
types of medicine. And it's the same with cosmetic procedures. And I do some procedures.

1074
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,720
I think of stem cells, like I think of Chevy Chase describing ball bearings and Fletch,

1075
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:33,280
you know, that scene when he's like, you know, that's all ball. And the guys like ball bearings,

1076
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,280
he says, that's all ball bearings nowadays. And it's like, that's like stem cells and ball bearings.

1077
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,480
It's just the same thing to me. It's the cure. It's the PRP of the future.

1078
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,680
Which remains to be seen how viable it is, right? It's the PRP of today. I think,

1079
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,000
look, there's something there. We know there's something there. We just can't exactly

1080
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:55,760
understand. We can't put our finger quite on it. And there's some good science there now.

1081
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,760
But I think there's definitely going to be something. And I have colleagues, I have friends

1082
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:04,640
that are doing a lot of stem cell treatments, whether it's intravenous, direct injections.

1083
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:10,560
I'm in a sense using nanofat as a stem cell, you know, that our fat is a rich source of stem cells.

1084
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,760
Yeah, this is counterintuitive, isn't it? People have always considered fat to be a

1085
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,520
totally inert tissue, but it's actually an endocrine tissue.

1086
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:21,760
That's true, right? And then why are we going to bone marrow first stem cells when it's

1087
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,680
closer to the surface? It's right there. And it's abundant in a lot of people.

1088
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,480
When I do procedures with fat grafting, and I'm thinking, hey, I'm injecting fat,

1089
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:34,720
and these fat cells are making them look younger. But it might be that the fat cells are not,

1090
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,600
none of them are surviving. It might be none of the fat cells at all. It might be the adipokines

1091
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,080
or the cytokines. Maybe it's a combination or when I do what I call nanofat, which is the

1092
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:47,440
stromal vascular fraction or the soup that's in between the fat cells. And now I inject that

1093
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:54,480
with the fat. Am I supporting my fat grafts with these factors? Maybe. I mean, I'm seeing

1094
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:59,920
results and we sort of look at the literature, which is limited. And we look at large scale

1095
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:05,920
studies, which are also limited. We're looking for answers in doing these things and we try to

1096
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,520
stay safe. But there's definitely a lot to learn when it comes to that particular area,

1097
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:16,480
right? We know that. We look at other types of growth factors. I've seen some promise with

1098
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:22,080
fibroblast growth factor, which is also an injectable. I consider that a biologic therapy.

1099
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:26,480
And in FGF world, which is the abbreviation for fibroblast growth factor, there are so many

1100
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:32,000
numbers to them. Are you talking FGF 21 or? Well, this is something that's not even,

1101
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,800
it's not approved in the US. We don't have it here. There's been studies in Asia.

1102
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:42,560
Actually, I don't even know which version. I probably have it in my notes here because I haven't

1103
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:49,440
been able to do it. But basically, are they harvesting autologous FGF from an individual?

1104
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:55,840
No, these are laboratory derived. Got it. So they're basically making FGF as a growth factor

1105
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,080
and then just injecting it. Correct. And is this done in Europe? It's done in Asia.

1106
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,320
And what's the indication? Volumization, facial volumization. And it seems to have

1107
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,920
long lasting results. So is the FDA evaluating this stuff now? I'm not clear about that. I don't

1108
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:15,120
haven't heard of any studies. I don't know if anyone who's part of an IRB, but it seems to hold

1109
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:21,760
some promise. I think customization, like what you do in your practice, and you're going to get

1110
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:27,200
down to the specific gene level eventually. And hopefully we'll be able to have a full map of

1111
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:32,240
everything. And each person will know exactly what drug is going to work well for them. And we'll

1112
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:37,920
be like that, I think, with cosmetic procedures. How is your skin going to respond to this laser?

1113
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:43,360
And what energy setting is appropriate for you versus this other person based on

1114
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,880
what your genetic screening told us? I think that's definitely in the future.

1115
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:54,160
I think customization in terms of 3D printing, bioprinting. So let's say there's something

1116
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:59,200
you don't like, you want to change your ear, we'll probably be able to print ears. We'll

1117
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:03,600
be able to print organs. I mean, there's no question that bioprinting is in the future

1118
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:08,560
and we'll be able to replace blood vessels, organs, skin. That just seems so far out. I mean,

1119
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,560
as an interesting aside, I remember once being in your office and you showed me a bunch of surgical

1120
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:17,440
instruments that you designed yourself and had 3D printed and they were just perfect. It was like

1121
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,800
you knew exactly what you wanted and you were like, well, this doesn't exist, I'll just make it.

1122
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,200
Right. I mean, in the past, you would have to go to a manufacturer and you'd have to convince

1123
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,880
this industry person of what you want to make. Right, make a fab.

1124
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,800
And then they're going to say, well, how many people are going to buy this and how useful?

1125
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,560
Well, I don't know, it's for me. It's useful for me, but then they're not going to make an

1126
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,920
injection mold for me based on, you know, let's say the 300 eyelid surgeon specialists in the

1127
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:48,800
country, that's a limited market. So with a 3D printer, I just draw what I want and I have it

1128
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,760
translated into a digital file and then I print it in a, there's a place in Long Island City,

1129
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,320
Queens, and they make it in stainless steel and then it comes to my office and I'm using them

1130
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,800
every day. And I've sent them out to my friends and that kind of thing, but we're in the future,

1131
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,280
we'll be able to make what we want. Imagine a box that is connected to your computer and

1132
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:12,080
whatever you can imagine will be in that box. And it doesn't have to be just like in silly,

1133
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:17,120
like it doesn't have to be a Hello Kitty made in plastic. It can be made out of multiple materials

1134
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:23,280
and so you can have, imagine your phone. I mean, I'm not trying to promote 3D printing and it's

1135
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:30,080
not my, my practice isn't 3D printing, but let's say just you pay on Amazon and then you press the

1136
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:34,880
button and then it prints the phone in your box and then you have the new iPhone. I mean, I think

1137
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:40,880
that's conceivable in the future. I mean, it's easily conceivable. And so the same thing with

1138
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:45,360
organs, I think there's a big- See, I didn't realize we could go beyond, I mean, I've certainly seen

1139
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:49,920
amazing things in 3D printing where you're dealing with something that's homogeneous,

1140
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,160
but a phone is like a completely heterogeneous thing. Well, you can print circuits,

1141
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:59,680
you can print in different materials right now. You can print in different thicknesses and

1142
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:04,640
rubbers. So you can have a soft rubber inside of a hard rubber. So you can print a, let's say you

1143
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:08,880
can print a silicone breast implant, right? And you can make it exactly your shape. So I would

1144
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,040
scan your body. Well, I don't know if you want a breast implant. Yeah, I'll probably pass, but

1145
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,240
maybe you want a peck implant though, and I would scan your body. Are you saying my peck's

1146
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:23,680
inferior? You can use a little bit of bulk. I know you did the Joe Rogan podcast, so maybe

1147
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:28,320
you're thinking you need to be a little beefier. Yeah, I take a lot of heat for looking too scrawny

1148
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:34,640
on that. But I could scan your body with a 3D camera. I would probably get some CT scans of you

1149
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:40,240
as well to look at your bone structure. We would design an implant that was, and you'd have, maybe

1150
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:44,240
your left peck needs to be a little bit higher, and your right one needs to be a little more

1151
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:50,000
projection. And it would fit your body exactly. And it would be, let's say soft on the inside,

1152
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,600
a little firmer on the outside, so it feels like muscle. But when you press on it, it's kind of

1153
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,320
squishy like muscle. But why stop there? Why not just make it out of muscle cells? Right? We'll

1154
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:03,760
create a scaffolding. And that scaffolding will populate with cells that we cultured from your

1155
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,960
muscle in a lab. And then we populated it onto the scaffolding, and we grow it over a week or two.

1156
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:12,960
And then we just use a small incision and we implant it in you. Yeah, it's interesting. When I

1157
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:20,160
was in medical school, my very first summer, the first lab I worked in was the lab of an ENT surgeon,

1158
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:26,400
and he was interested in growing septal chondrocytes. So taking these chondrocytes,

1159
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:33,360
these cartilage producing progenitor cells, and growing ears. And at the time, a very,

1160
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,520
very popular paper by God, I'm trying to remember the name, it was Langer and Vakanti,

1161
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:42,560
two very famous guys in this space from MIT and Harvard. And they grew the ear in the

1162
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:47,840
mouse. And we had that picture up in our lab. And we were trying to replicate it. And of course,

1163
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,560
the challenge at the time was coming up with biodegradable scaffolds. And of course,

1164
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,680
I haven't paid attention to this problem in 20 years. Well, there are scaffolds now,

1165
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:59,840
there's people that are printing blood vessels, but I think it's a big regulatory obstacle.

1166
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:05,520
I think for me, what I was always interested in was printing in materials that are already approved,

1167
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:13,760
right, like silicone. And I think the living cell printing will be there. But think about

1168
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,000
the regulation of if you're in the operating room and you want your tissue printing device,

1169
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:24,800
you have to approve it for every indication. So we have to approve it for making this thing for

1170
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,840
this procedure. And you have to, it's, it's, it's like an endless permutation. So the FDA now is

1171
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,720
looking at 3d printing, and they do have new guidelines and regard to that. And they're

1172
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:41,360
recognizing that this is the future and that medical 3d printing is growing. But it's definitely

1173
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:47,760
going to happen. There's been use of 3d printed implants in University of Michigan for infants

1174
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:53,840
with trachea, Malaysia. It's actually considered to be 4d printing because these implants change

1175
01:42:53,840 --> 01:43:00,000
over time. So the implant can grow with the patient and eventually can reabsorb. But someone with a

1176
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,920
baby with a narrow trachea, they were building 3d printed cages and suturing the trachea to the

1177
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:11,840
cage to hold it open externally. And then as the patient grows, the cage and larges and then

1178
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:16,640
eventually can absorb. So the application here goes far beyond cosmetic surgery and it will be

1179
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:22,080
unbelievable. And I mean, it is believable to me, but I can talk about it for another two hours.

1180
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:29,440
It's just, it's mind blowing and it's exciting. And it's frustrating because I want the next step

1181
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:35,360
it takes money, it takes time, and it takes people that are interested. But if somebody's

1182
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:42,000
listening and wants to talk to me about developing 3d printed materials for surgical procedures,

1183
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:46,560
I mean, I have something specific in mind. I've been trying to do that for a while. I have

1184
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:51,520
non-disclosures with a lot of large companies, but it's hard to get someone to invest money

1185
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:57,120
in something that doesn't give you a return in the next two years. Right? That's one of the,

1186
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:01,760
I think the struggles. Well, speaking of people contacting you, I follow you on Instagram because

1187
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,480
I just love looking at your before after photos and how can people follow you? What's the best

1188
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:12,160
way to follow you? So on Instagram, it's at Dr. Kotlis, D-R-K-O-T-L-U-S. You can look me up on my

1189
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:17,680
website. I have some videos and procedures in my website. And what's your URL? It's DrKotlis.com,

1190
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:22,640
D-R-K-O-T-L-U-S. But yeah, I share a lot of my stuff on Instagram. I think that's kind of fun

1191
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:28,080
because people can give me feedback and I've seen my audience grow and I'm following you on

1192
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:33,680
Instagram too with your race cars and your family. My nonsense, yeah. It's fun. I think

1193
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,440
Instagram has connected me with a lot of people that I probably wouldn't have met otherwise.

1194
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,920
The internet and social media has made the world a smaller place in a way. Look, there's a lot of

1195
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,880
garbage to wade through, but it's not all bad. I don't think there's anything I do clinically

1196
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,440
that is really relevant to Instagram. It's not visual, but it is, right? I mean, I think

1197
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:00,400
people are interested in seeing what you're doing in your day. I'm interested in your routines.

1198
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:05,440
I'm interested in like, oh, what is he eating? What is that indwelling device that you have that's

1199
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:09,440
measuring your blood glucose or what's going on your lap? You posted that picture on your white

1200
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:14,480
board of your, like it looked like your Einstein theories of longevity. I mean, it's actually

1201
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:20,480
very poignant breakdown of your longevity approach. And I've seen you working on the white board,

1202
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:25,760
so I'm imagining you writing that and sort of like constructing your book that everyone's waiting

1203
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:32,480
for. But I think people are looking for insight into your life and into your philosophy and it

1204
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,760
doesn't have to be, I mean, for me, it's a little bit easier maybe because I can show a before and

1205
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:40,640
after, but that's not, I think the before and after is not the important thing. The important

1206
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:45,440
thing is like the story behind the before and after. Like this is a teacher and she came to me

1207
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:51,200
because she was recently divorced and she's thinking about finding a new partner maybe or

1208
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:55,760
maybe just feeling better about herself because she's surrounded by younger teachers. Like those

1209
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,480
kind of stories to me are the powerful things. And what's important, like what I love about

1210
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:06,800
what I do is that people bring me into their lives in many ways, not just for an injection,

1211
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:12,960
but to tell me about why they want to do it. Yeah. You have a video on your website that

1212
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:18,240
you produced, right? Right. Yeah. So that was just, I think trying to convey my philosophy

1213
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:24,560
in a way that I thought was more powerful about the stories of people who are seeking my help or

1214
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:29,360
my advice. And so I'm always thinking about the next one. I think I could do it better,

1215
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,680
but that was a fun project. Well, Brett, I can't thank you enough for this. I've learned a lot

1216
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:37,920
from you over the last couple of years. Oh, and I feel the same way. But I appreciate you taking

1217
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,720
the time to sit down today. I hope that people get something out of this. And again, it could be

1218
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:47,600
as extreme as they know that they want to do some of these procedures and now they feel armed to

1219
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,360
scrutinize the providers out there and make sure they're getting the best care possible. And

1220
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,600
alternatively, it may be, I don't want to do any of that stuff, but boy, if I can just do these

1221
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:00,160
three things, you know, put my sunscreen on, use some rhinoic acid and maybe a little topical

1222
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:05,040
vitamin C, that's going to make a 10-year delta. Well, thank you for inviting me to do this and

1223
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:11,600
for leading the way for many of us in terms of searching for the answers and also sharing those

1224
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:17,200
answers. It's great to see you and I will continue this discussion, I'm sure. All right, see you.
