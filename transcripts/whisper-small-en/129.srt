00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,040
today's episode. My guest this week is Dr. Tom Despray. His name is probably familiar to some

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,000
of you because back in October of 2018, we released a five-part series with Tom and that

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,680
set of episodes, despite being quite technical, are some of the most popular episodes we've

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,200
released, especially amongst people who really like to get serious about their understanding

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,320
of cardiovascular disease. So we wanted to have Tom back basically to pick it up where we left

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,480
off. And in this episode, we try to focus on things that have changed in the last couple of years. And

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,440
that kind of loosely fell into three categories that we probe. The first is digging really deeper

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,280
into the recognition of the importance of atherogenic lipoproteins. So kind of revisiting

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,760
the idea of what ApoB is, why it matters. And both Tom and I discuss a little bit about how our views

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,840
have changed with respect to the use of ApoB as a laboratory surrogate over LDL-P. And we get into

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,240
all of the nuance around that with respect to VLDLs, triglycerides, LpA, et cetera. We also get into

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,840
why HDL cholesterol is a far less relevant metric, at least why we believe that to be the case. We

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,360
then pivot a little bit and talk about risk assessment. Basically, how do you understand

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,760
these metrics? How do you use these metrics? This is a lot of the clinician type stuff here around

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,360
ApoB and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We again revisit the idea of LpA. And then finally,

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,080
we bring it home with some discussion around therapies. And in particular, we talk about

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,520
the continued evolution of the PCSK9s, the evolving data around omega-3 fatty acids,

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,360
in particular, some of the controversy between EPA alone versus EPA and DHA. And obviously,

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,640
we talk about the most recent addition to the lipid drug story, which is a drug called Bembandoic

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,120
acid, which has not been around very long. And probably many people are not going to be familiar

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,440
with that, but Tom does a great job explaining that. Tom's a diplomat of both the American

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,640
Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Clinical Lipidology. He practiced internal

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,040
medicine in New Jersey for 37 years, the last 17 of which was devoted to consulting patients

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,880
with lipid and cardiometabolic disorders. Between 2012 and 2019, he served as the chief scientific

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,480
officer at two major cardiovascular biomarker laboratories. Since that time, he has been

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,920
working with us in our practice, primarily on the research side of things, but also as a consultant

35
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,280
advising on most of our cardiovascular cases. He's both a fellow of the American College of

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,320
Physicians and the National Lipid Association, the NLA. And he's an associate editor at the

37
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,720
Journal of Clinical Lipidology. He was also the recipient of the National Lipid Association 2011

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,280
President's Service Award. He's authored and illustrated more manuscripts and book chapters

39
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,960
related to lipids than I can count. And so without further delay, please enjoy my conversation

40
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:59,120
with my mentor and friend, Tom Dayspring. Hey, Tom, thanks so much for making time to sit down

41
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,560
again and talk about lipids. It's been almost two years since we sat down for what still remains

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:15,040
the longest podcast I've ever done, nearly eight hours, which I believe was divided into a five

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,480
part series that is still a very popular podcast series. And don't take this the wrong way, but

44
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,320
I'm kind of surprised at the popularity of that episode, given that I thought it was really

45
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,440
geared only towards people that were really, really diehard lipid fanatics. But it's had

46
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
broad enough appeal that I think we've agreed mutually that it makes sense to sit down again.

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,800
That was amazing. First of all, it's always great to sit down with you, Peter, and chat about my

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,840
little lipid world. But yeah, I'm shocked every time somebody tells me we've listened to the whole

49
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,000
series and I've done it three times and I just can't imagine that. But I'm glad it came across

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,640
pretty good. You know, one of the things I wanted to do today, Tom, and I can promise you and all the

51
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,520
listeners, we are not going to do this for another eight hours today. But what I want to do today is

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,960
I think kind of pick up the mantle from where we were a couple of years ago and talk about what's

53
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,760
different since then. I think the last two years has seen a number of things that are actually

54
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,520
pretty exciting in the field of lipidology, in the field of cardiovascular disease. Some of it's been

55
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,840
at the really nuanced level scientifically. Others have been, frankly, at the broader level in terms

56
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,560
of recognition of certain things that you've been talking about and many others. People like Alan

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,440
Snyderman have been talking about. A lot of this stuff is very clinically relevant. The way I pose

58
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,640
this to you and I think this, unless you're opposed to it, the way I'd love to kind of go through this

59
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,920
is maybe use our time today to talk about things that are different today than perhaps they were a

60
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,880
few years ago and dive into those things in enough depth that everybody from the lay person to the

61
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,280
aficionado will have something to chew on. Yeah, that's a perfect strategy for today. Now,

62
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,160
there's no doubt we'll reiterate some concepts that we went over in great depth back then,

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,440
but we won't have that opportunity today. And you know me, Peter, I've always lived on the

64
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,120
cutting edge of lipidology science leading the charge, trying to understand new concepts that

65
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,680
come down. But one of the great satisfactions of my career is much of what I've promulgated for the

66
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,360
longest time has come to fruition. And that's what's really happened in the last two years.

67
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,520
There are certainly some new concepts and some abandonment of some other issues, but it's just

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,280
the, you know, my whole mantra for a long time, you know, we've known each other a decade probably,

69
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,640
is that atherogenic lipoproteins are really the issue behind clinical atherosclerotic vascular

70
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,120
disease. And although many of us have known it for a while, the data has just become so overwhelming

71
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,600
that virtually all of the guidelines have signed on to that premise now that atherogenesis is

72
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:19,360
certainly a sterile mediated disease, but sterols are trafficked within apob containing lipoproteins,

73
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,280
which provides the vehicle that transports them into the artery wall where they can in some start

74
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,280
a pathological process. So it's the recognition of atherogenic lipoproteins that is now in the

75
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,040
guidelines. And you know, atherogenic lipoproteins are still diagnosed using various

76
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,120
cholesterol metrics, but there are things beyond LDL cholesterol matter in the guideline. And even

77
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,920
ApoB is certainly within every of the contemporary guidelines in the last two years. And that's of

78
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,840
course, the Allen Snyderman thing that he's been harping about for a long, long time. So it's

79
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,160
atherogenic lipoproteins within that category, though, the things that are also emerging is

80
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,320
what contributes to the atherogenicity of an ApoB particle triglycerides has really taken

81
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,480
center stage, how they affect lipoprotein concentration and quality or functionality,

82
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:22,320
whatever adjective you want to ascribe to. It's the loss of the ability of at least the HDL

83
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,880
cholesterol metric to be terribly informative to us. And it's the emerging significance for a lot

84
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:38,480
of reasons of lipoprotein little a. So those are the big areas where changes really become important

85
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,240
and is really useful at the bedside. Of course, pharmacology and intensity of pharmacology

86
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
has also advanced and we'll touch a little bit on that today, I'm sure.

87
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,160
To sort of summarize that, we're going to talk about kind of double clicking on ApoB

88
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,880
slash LDL particle, basically the atherogenic lipoproteins front and center in the pathogenesis

89
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,400
of cardiovascular disease. We're going to talk about the modification of our risk assessment.

90
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,960
And I like that you brought up HDL because I want to have a pretty interesting discussion about that.

91
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
And obviously, we're going to talk about what's happened in therapies. There have been actually

92
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
quite a number of things, including the continuation, more data around zetimibe and

93
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,480
PCSK9 inhibitors, much more data since we last spoke around omega-3 fatty acids. I spoke with

94
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
Bill Harris about that, but I think we can go a little bit further. And there are a couple of

95
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,120
other therapies. So let's start with maybe a little bit of a reminder for people as to what

96
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:49,360
ApoB is. People like you and I sometimes use ApoB and LDLP interchangeably as shorthand.

97
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,760
That's not entirely correct. And when we last spoke, we probably disproportionately spoke about

98
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,360
the number of LDL particles. And now we're going to focus on ApoB. So do you mind explaining

99
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,680
what the difference is both from a biology standpoint, but also from a laboratory standpoint?

100
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
And those are critical points, Peter, because it's one thing to talk about ApoB,

101
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,840
but almost what you're saying about it depends how did you analyze it? What laboratory metric

102
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,600
did you order that you think is telling you something about ApoB, whatever that encompasses?

103
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,480
So to make a story very simple and short, lipids go nowhere in aqueous plasma because they're

104
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,720
hydrophobic. So for a lipid to be trafficked throughout plasma, it has to attach to a protein.

105
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,680
Now, a few molecules of any lipid can attach to albumin, but that's not the primary way lipids

106
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:49,920
get anywhere. Serious collections of lipids, hydrophobic substances, attach to fairly significant

107
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,880
proteins which solubilize them. And these Apo proteins, as they're called, proteins that wrap

108
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,880
collections of lipids, provide structure and stability to this macromolecule that we're going

109
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,920
to call a lipoprotein. So the main structural protein that enwraps lipids in our body is

110
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,960
ApoLipoprotein B. It's a 500 kilo Dalton molecular weight protein, so it's pretty big,

111
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,720
and it has a great ability to attract a lot of lipids to bind to it. But once the lipids are

112
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,040
bound to it, this is a water soluble lipid transportation vehicle. There's basically one

113
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,200
other class of lipoproteins, and that is the HDL particles that you mentioned, and they have

114
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:43,280
no ApoB on them. Their structural protein is ApoLipoprotein A1, capital A dash either Arabic

115
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,680
or Roman number one. So right away we have a double classification of lipoproteins, the ApoB

116
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,360
containing, they're often called beta lipoproteins, or the ApoA1 are called the alpha lipoproteins.

117
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:05,840
So now within that ApoB family, it always gets a little more complex in lipidology. The two tissues

118
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,280
in your body that can make ApoB are the liver, hepatocytes, and of course the small intestine,

119
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,760
which is absorbing a lot of lipids, so it has to put them in something if those lipids are going

120
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,760
to get into your plasma. So the ApoB that's made in the liver is a big 500 kilo Dalton protein that

121
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,560
I mentioned, and it's called ApoB100. Now why do they add the 100 on it? Because the intestine

122
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,360
also produces ApoB, but it produces a truncated version that has 48% of the molecular weight of

123
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:45,200
the hepatic-produced ApoB. So that's called ApoB48. So if the liver makes an ApoB particle full of

124
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,080
lipids, it's got one molecule of ApoB100 on it, if the intestine makes a big lipoprotein, and it

125
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,880
does, they're called chylomicrons, that has one molecule of ApoB48. The intestine can put it in

126
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,360
your lymphatics, it enters the systemic circulation, the liver just secretes it directly. So those are

127
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,840
the two types of ApoB. We're not going to talk a lot about chylomicrons. They're in most people

128
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,200
without a pathological, genetic pathological issue. It's not your chylomicrons that are the major

129
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,000
problem here. They're a postprandial lipoprotein. So the liver makes these ApoB100 particles,

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,120
and they can go out, the liver can secrete them, but some of the particles that the liver secretes

131
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,560
can be catabolized into smaller and smaller versions, even though they're still ApoB proteins.

132
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,160
So if we're going to talk about the ApoB100 family, and I'm probably not going to use the term 100

133
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,520
anymore, we're talking about very low density lipoproteins, intermediate density lipoproteins,

134
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,800
and low density lipoproteins. And of course, part of the LDL family is lipoprotein little a,

135
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,800
if you happen to produce that, not everybody does, to significant amounts. The names of those

136
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,400
particles, as you know, they were originally discovered via ultracentafagation. So the ones

137
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,880
that floated on top of the tube with a very low density, the ones that sank to the bottom,

138
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,120
were the high density, and the in between were the IDLs and LDLs. Now, so the ApoB family is VLDLs

139
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,640
plus IDLs plus LDLs plus LP little a, if you have it. Well, that's true. But here's the reality.

140
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,960
We have to look at plasma residence times. How long do these things float around? How long are

141
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,960
they in your system? Because that's important, because these are the particles that have the

142
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,320
potential to crash your artery wall and traffic stirrulls and whatever else into the artery wall.

143
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,640
The chylomarkrons I mentioned are half-life is in minutes. They're plasma residence time a few

144
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:54,080
hours. The VLDL particles, their half-life is two to four to six hours, depending on how rapidly

145
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,400
they're catabolized. The IDL particles are a transient in between particle between a VLDL

146
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,600
and an LDL. They're around for an hour or two. They're not, other than an unusual genetic

147
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,320
condition, a player in this ApoB game we're talking about. And finally, we have the LDL family.

148
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,960
Now, LDLs have a plasma residence time of two to five days. And there are other attributes to the

149
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,760
LDL that determines, is it going to just hang around for two days or five days? Clearly,

150
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,800
the longer it hangs around, you're going to have a lot more LDL particles than if you could rapidly

151
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,080
clear them. So when we talk about whatever ApoB metric you're doing, technically you are measuring

152
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:44,800
VLDLs, their remnants, their smaller VLDLs, IDLs plus LDLs plus LP little a, but because of the

153
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:53,680
half-life, 90 to 95% of your ApoB particles are LDL particles. So that's why many people say,

154
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,000
hey, ApoB is just another way of getting an LDL particle count. And that's true. Even in people

155
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,280
who might have a lot of remnants, the remnant particle number is quite small. It is still way

156
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:14,000
more LDL particles floating around in these people who might have these random VLDLs that cause issue.

157
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,080
Not to say a VLDL remnant might not be a very injurious ApoB containing particle. It certainly

158
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,080
is in some people, but if we're looking at the number, which is the primary driving force as to

159
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:34,720
how an ApoB particle enters the artery wall, LDL is king. And that's why our metrics of ApoB or LDL

160
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,560
particle count are what are at the top of all the guidelines. And of course the metric most people

161
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,480
use are LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol. I mean, Tom, on a personal level, the reason I

162
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,840
have switched to ApoB in our practice, which is obviously heavily influenced by the work that

163
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,680
you've discussed, the work that people like Alan Snyderman have been doing for many years, frankly,

164
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,600
comes down to a consistency factor. So we had historically relied on LDL-P, LDL particle number,

165
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,000
as a concentration count. But frankly, in the span of eight years, went through three

166
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,320
technologies to do that, right? Two generations of NMR coupled with electrophoresis. And while in

167
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,040
the end we felt the electrophoresis provided the most accurate measurement, you always have a

168
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:38,560
problem when you don't know what you're comparing it to. So if we have Gen 1 NMR, which is probably

169
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:46,320
still being used by LabCorp and Quest today, that is probably quite inaccurate compared to Gen 2 NMR,

170
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,920
but the percentiles, meaning the populations of people that were measured, are still what we use

171
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,880
to understand where someone lies. It puts you in a bit of a dilemma. As a clinician or as a patient,

172
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,120
you want to continually upgrade your technology. In other words, if you're talking about getting a

173
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,600
new iPhone, you don't really care that your phone is so much better than two generations ago's phone,

174
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,720
because all your metrics are better and there's nothing to be gained by comparing yourself to

175
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,000
how much better you are. But when you're talking about diagnostics, it does matter where your

176
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,560
reference range is and if you're moving it. So do you agree with my logic for switching to APO-B

177
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:35,440
a year ago as now being a much more homogeneous way to assess patients even across labs? So

178
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,960
especially now in light of COVID, we can't always use the same lab to measure APO-B. So I might be

179
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,360
sending a patient to one lab versus another lab and I just feel like we're getting better results

180
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,520
this way. Does that jive with you? No, that makes total sense. And a real important take-home point

181
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,800
for listeners is pick your favorite metric. Peter's right now is APO-B, mine right now is APO-B,

182
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,200
and stick with it. Don't do APO-B this time in an LDL particle count via NMR. Peter didn't even

183
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,040
mention Quest has a particle number technique called ion mobility transfer that people are,

184
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:20,080
they're not comparable. All biomarkers you should consistently try and use, of course the same lab,

185
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,360
not always possible, but the same assay. And the APO-B immunoassay is pretty standard throughout

186
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,680
the industry. It's not like everybody's got their own APO-B assay. The NMR can vary widely. The

187
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,040
other big reason to do that, consistency of results over time, is sooner or later yourself,

188
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,360
you're going to read the guideline or maybe your patients are going to go, all the guidelines talk

189
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,360
about APO-B. There is no guideline telling you to do a NMR LDL-P or an ion mobility LDL-P. So it's

190
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,440
another reason to just stick with the APO-B. And I think there are less false positives with the

191
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,840
APO-B. It's just been my personal experience. I've been an NMR guy all my life and as we got better

192
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,720
and better, we just so often saw totally unexplainable discordance between LDL-P and APO-B.

193
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,480
That that is overwhelming for APO-B. So I think that's where you should be in today's world,

194
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,440
as your marker of atherogenic lipoproteins. Yeah, I think we saw that, especially with the

195
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,920
second generation NMR. It was almost like it had become too sensitive. We were seeing discordance

196
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,360
that far exceeded what the Framingham or Mesa data predicted the discordance should have been.

197
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,520
And that's really actually what took us to the ion mobility assay. But again, I'm actually very,

198
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,080
from a diagnostic and management standpoint, I'm actually quite comfortable with where we are.

199
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,280
I think the final point I'd add to that, Tom, is just the economic one. Frankly, I think the cost

200
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,320
of an APO-B is, at least in Canada. And the only reason I know that is because Alan Snyderman is at

201
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,680
McGill and he's been pounding this for a while. I mean, we're talking about a three or four dollar

202
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,240
test. So there is no excuse for any physician to say, we're not going to order your fancy APO-B

203
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,720
because it costs too much. I'm going to order the LDL cholesterol. I think that excuse has lost

204
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,160
all of its water. It's so true. And Alan just published a beautiful paper where he's researched

205
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,120
the cost of APO-B assays, because, you know, even some of the people in the guidelines always,

206
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,560
oh, we can't say APO-B, it's so expensive. That's an old excuse that is no longer applicable to 2020.

207
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,160
So of all the technologies to quantitate atherogenic lipoproteins, APO-B is the most

208
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,520
affordable. And even, you know, look, labs sometimes change crazy. But if you tell a lab

209
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,720
you want to pay a cash price, it's really pretty cheap. Yeah. Let's go back to kind of the macro

210
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:56,240
point here around APO-B, which is a greater coalescing around the idea that APO-B concentration

211
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,880
matters. So I think it's very well understood that two of the biggest risk factors for cardiovascular

212
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,480
disease are smoking and hypertension. I don't think there is any ambiguity that cigarette

213
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,640
smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. And they both appear to

214
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,720
do so through a mechanism that weakens the endothelium or creates an injury to the endothelium.

215
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:32,960
The question now becomes, as you put it, Tom, how ironclad is the story that it's the APO-B bearing

216
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,240
particle in the presence of injured endothelium that is the Trojan horse that begins this

217
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:49,360
destructive trajectory of taking that cholesterol into the subendithelial space, becoming retained,

218
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,760
undergoing this chemical oxidation process, which then kicks off an inflammatory response

219
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:03,040
that paradoxically, as an attempt to repair the damage, results in what can be a fatal injury.

220
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,560
There are other hypotheses, for example, there are people who note, and we have, I mean, look,

221
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,360
I have a patient in our practice, Tom, you've weighed in on her case, walks around with a

222
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,160
total cholesterol of 300 and something, an LDL cholesterol of 220 milligrams per deciliter,

223
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:28,560
an APO-B of 170 milligrams per deciliter. She's in her late 60s and her coronary artery calcium

224
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,160
score is zero. We have elected to not treat her with any lipid lowering therapy. In other words,

225
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:43,120
there are exceptions to this. How do we reconcile that? Well, it's the human body in medicine. As you

226
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,000
know, not all smokers are going to come down with lung cancer or chronic obstructive lung disease.

227
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,320
Why not? If that's such a horrible risk factor. I try to explain this, and I've certainly seen

228
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,760
cases like you say where, oh my God, if I was just going to say, give me your APO-B or whatever

229
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,040
cholesterol metric, you're going on three drugs right now, you got no choice. And maybe the old

230
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,880
days we approach people that way, but no more. I think you have to individualize your whatever

231
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,360
risk factors you discover that might wind up causing atherogenesis and then figure it out.

232
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,320
So particle number is certainly a major factor that might force it in, but not always. Endothelial

233
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,440
function, although you can certainly, if you review the history of this and how do you really

234
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,200
determine endothelial function, not everybody has serious endothelial dysfunction who winds up with

235
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,400
atherosclerosis. So particle number itself, and some people can just make the particles go in.

236
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,160
I think if we take most adults who's not going to have a little bit of endothelial dysfunction, so

237
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,960
I agree with you, it's a combination of something about atherogenic particles, be it their number,

238
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,200
endothelial dysfunction. But I'm talking more and more now when I discuss any type of lipoprotein,

239
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,760
I don't care which subgroup you want to talk about. I think we certainly have to know it's

240
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,320
particle concentration, but I like to talk about particle quality. So what are the other attributes

241
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,360
of any lipoprotein that might contribute to its atherogenicity or in some perhaps not understood

242
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,440
make it relatively, it's not going to generate atherosclerosis. And there certainly have to be

243
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,240
things like that going on. So as we're getting smarter, we're looking at other components of

244
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,840
the lipoproteins that could be other proteins that are on them that could be their complex

245
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,520
lipidome. And trying to see, aha, can that help us discern whether in you, a given particle

246
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:49,520
concentration is more worrisome than it is in the next person. So there's a lot going on. And also,

247
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,040
from the gist of this conversation, listeners will know atherosclerosis, atherogenesis is a

248
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,160
multi complex, multi factorial disease. And that's why even when Peter and I, if we consult on a case

249
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,400
and we realize in this person, we have to beat up Apo B and get their particle numbers to a more

250
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,400
physiologic range, we don't stop once we do that. We examine in great detail for other things that

251
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,320
might be injuring the endothelium or the arterial wall and see are any of those treatable or so.

252
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,800
So we're getting a little bit smarter on lipoproteins, but there certainly is more to it than just

253
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,720
particle number. Do we think that there's a limit to where the benefit of reduction

254
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,320
becomes diminishing or even J curves in the other direction? So we discussed it in the first episode

255
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,520
significantly. We did so again with Ron Krauss. It wouldn't be the worst idea in the world a couple

256
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,400
of years from now to sit down and do it again and reexamine the data. But again, I think the causal

257
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,360
relationship between Apo B and atherosclerosis is as strong as virtually anything we see in medicine

258
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,720
for which you can't do the perfect experiment where you have to rely on natural experiments.

259
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,400
Nevertheless, maybe it's not entirely clear what the dose response looks like. So if you have

260
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,240
somebody whose Apo B is 160 milligrams per deciliter, there's a risk reduction that comes

261
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,360
to lowering it from 160 to 100 and lowering it from 100 to 80 and lowering it from 80 to 60.

262
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:31,520
What do we know about the risk reduction in lowering it, say from 60 to 40 to 20? And I ask

263
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,880
both what we could infer pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically. In other words,

264
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,600
from the Mendelian randomization versus the pharmacologic. Well, even using pharmacologic

265
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,040
trials and Mendelian randomization, the concept you're going to come across with is lower is

266
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,120
better. And with the pharmacologic thing, we're modulating things that either have clinical trial

267
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,560
proof that if you lower them, it's good or the Mendelian randomization, looking at genes where

268
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,600
that drug might be doing something, it works. Now you do need a few Apo B containing lipoproteins.

269
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,960
They do traffic other lipids. They traffic fat-soluble lipoproteins. But we must never

270
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,440
confuse A-beta lipoproteinemia where nobody, or that person can't make them, or hypo-beta

271
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,200
lipoproteinemia where they make a few enough to traffic those other things that a lipoprotein

272
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,160
might have to traffic. But even the guidelines where they examine people looking at their baseline

273
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,200
Apo B or LDL cholesterol, the first thing they suggest, at least in the higher risk people,

274
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,560
is try and get a 50% reduction. And that's where most of the bang for the buck is going to be.

275
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Now, if you still have options that you can lower it further, yeah, the trials show, yeah,

276
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,280
there is incremental reduction events, but it's a much smaller absolute risk reduction and dropping

277
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:03,040
it the 50% or so. So I don't know if that answers your question. So most people don't have the type

278
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:11,360
of levels where with modern therapeutics, with modern lifestyle, we can more often than not attain

279
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,280
physiologic concentrations. And if I want to talk about Apo B, that's probably under 50 milligrams

280
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,680
per deciliter, if we can get there. That's what the newborns have. That's when you go in clinical

281
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:29,440
trials, if you take it down that low, you see your most risk reduction. And so far, at least with

282
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,640
pharmacologic lowering of Apo B with the currently FDA approved drugs, there is no signal of harm.

283
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,960
Yeah, again, it's funny because I was just about to say with the current crop of drugs,

284
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:52,080
specifically the PCSK9 inhibitors, we are routinely seeing patients who easily can get an Apo B into

285
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,880
the 20 to 40 milligram per deciliter range. You and I actually sat down a couple of months ago

286
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,240
and did a calculation to estimate how much cholesterol is actually contained in the

287
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,840
circulating lipoproteins versus that which is in cell membranes. Do you remember doing this with me?

288
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,120
Not per se, but and where we're developing equations, you're the master of that.

289
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,280
Well, it was one of these things, right? It was sort of like, look, when you look at a person's

290
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:30,800
plasma glucose level, you realize pretty quickly it represents a tiny fraction of total body glucose.

291
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,800
And similarly, there's such a concern about plasma cholesterol level, but, you know,

292
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,320
given how essential cholesterol is, it's understandable why people would be concerned

293
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,560
that low cholesterol could be problematic. But once you do the calculation and realize

294
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:54,160
virtually all of the cholesterol in the body is contained within the cell membrane or within the

295
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,120
steroidal producing tissue, the circulating amount is a very narrow window into the total

296
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:09,680
amount of cholesterol and therefore a reduction of say 60 milligrams per deciliter to 50 milligrams

297
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:16,480
per deciliter of ApoB or even something more extreme like a full 50% reduction of total

298
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,200
cholesterol, 200 milligrams per deciliter to 100 milligrams per deciliter does not represent

299
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,200
a significant reduction in total body cholesterol. This is a very important point,

300
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,960
right? Let me repeat it. You have a total body cholesterol that you measure in the plasma that

301
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,000
says, oh, it's 200 milligrams per deciliter. That goes down to 100 milligrams per deciliter. Let's

302
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,400
say the LDL fraction reduced from, you know, 150 to 75 or something. Someone might say, God,

303
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,600
you just cut cholesterol in half. That can't be good for you given the importance of cholesterol.

304
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,040
But my point is no, you simply cut the amount of cholesterol being carried by the lipoproteins in

305
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,040
the plasma in half. That doesn't capture the majority of the cholesterol. Yes. Thanks for

306
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,640
refreshing my memory. What you're talking about now, it's really pools of cholesterol throughout

307
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,800
the body. And I think I'm so glad you brought this up because this is just not even understood,

308
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:19,200
even in the lipidology community. We have a total body cholesterol. There are basically three pools.

309
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,520
There's your brain and nothing we're talking about today has anything to do with brain

310
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,320
cholesterol. It's a separate system. It doesn't interact with the other cells in your body or

311
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,920
certainly with the cholesterol in your plasma. So if it's not in your brain, where is cholesterol

312
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,200
in your body? Well, it's either in all your peripheral cells, perhaps some more than others,

313
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,680
or it's circulating in your plasma. And if it's in the plasma, where is it? There's an

314
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,320
easy weensie amount bound to albumin. There's more bound within all of the lipoproteins that

315
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,480
are trafficking in your body, meaning your ApoB and your ApoA1 particles. But believe it or not,

316
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,000
if I wanted to search down blood cholesterol for you, I would suck out your red blood cells and

317
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,320
extract cholesterol from them. Red blood cells carry far, far more cholesterol than do all of

318
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,320
your lipoproteins put together. And the other crucial point you made subtly, and I hope everybody

319
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,480
understood you, the amount of cholesterol within your lipoproteins has no correlation with your

320
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,000
cellular cholesterol or even your red blood cell cholesterol. So whatever, however you're

321
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,440
modulating some LDL, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol metric, that tells you nothing about

322
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,320
what might you be doing to the cholesterol content of your cells. So don't have a panic attack if

323
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,840
you're making LDL cholesterol 30, because I can assure you virtually every cell in your body,

324
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,040
even if that's your plasma LDL cholesterol, has more than enough cholesterol because it can

325
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,240
de novo synthesize it, it can put it in its cell membranes or other organelles that require

326
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,800
cholesterol. If it's a storogenic tissue, it can produce a little more or perhaps dilipidate some

327
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:11,200
life. So there's no cell that's being deprived of cholesterol in the periphery when you are

328
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:18,080
modulating lipids through lifestyle or drugs. Tom, what's the best explanation for why it's

329
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:25,840
not the red blood cell that is the primary driver of atherosclerosis given the fact you just stated,

330
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:32,480
which is red blood cells contain within them a lot of cholesterol within their membranes and

331
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:40,000
red blood cells clearly traffic to and from past the endothelium. I certainly have my own answer

332
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,960
for this question. I think the histology makes it abundantly clear. But is there any thought you

333
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,520
would add to that? No, I think histologically, we know it's foam cells. And where do foam cells get

334
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,320
their sterile content from ingesting oxidized lipoproteins carrying cholesterol is the vasovisorum,

335
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,520
which supplies the arterial intimate with blood cells dumping red blood cells in there that are

336
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,280
contributing cholesterol, maybe a few molecules, but I don't think we have any evidence. It's that's

337
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,520
a driver of cholesterol that's resulting in arterial wall pathology. Yeah, this is one of

338
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,760
those moments where sometimes a picture just serves a thousand words. And maybe this will be

339
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,360
one of the best. I mean, we're going to obviously accompany this podcast with a

340
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,640
a lot of figures and diagrams of yours. But what we're basically talking about is you have to

341
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,320
differentiate from the vasovisorum side, which is the non-luminal side of the vessel, where of course

342
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,600
you have to have blood vessels to keep the artery itself alive versus the luminal side, where the

343
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,240
endothelial lining is damaged by everything, including just daily life, but certainly high

344
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,120
blood pressure, smoking, uric acid, high glucose, high insulin, shear forces, you name it. And that's

345
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,440
what's allowing these lipoproteins in. But you're right, it's really this histologic examination that

346
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,920
makes a very clear, unmistakable case that it's not the cholesterol in the membrane that's doing

347
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,440
this. It's this trafficked cholesterol that ultimately becomes a foam cell through the

348
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:23,520
macrophages ingestion of the lipoprotein that is the insult. That's a pretty good tour de force

349
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,440
on this topic. One more little caveat, Peter, with that vasovisorum, as you know, as you have

350
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,400
an evolving plaque, it gets bigger and bigger and it becomes prone to erosion or rupture

351
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,120
and the coagulation system. So there's nothing to say that even in a minuscule histologic rupture

352
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,000
of a plaque that the vasovisorum can't be contributing some clotting factors or something

353
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,280
else to that pathological process. It almost assuredly does. At some point, once you have

354
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,680
damage, I would fully expect coagulation factors to be coming from both sides, the luminal side

355
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,640
and the vasovisorum side. It's an all hands on deck war. And the uric acid too, probably,

356
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,520
you know, which can crystallize just like cholesterol. You touched on it in the

357
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:16,400
outset, which is what have the guidelines stated with respect to other lipoproteins? So if we take

358
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:24,080
a step back and we went back to the early 1980s, right, in the early 1980s, when we were just

359
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,600
beginning to talk about the subfractionation of cholesterol. So little history lesson for people.

360
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:41,200
It's 1959-ish, early 1960s. Ansel Keys is clearly on to something and he is identifying a relationship

361
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,400
between serum cholesterol and coronary artery disease. He's correctly identifying a relationship.

362
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,320
And at the time, they're doing very rudimentary assessments saying, hey,

363
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,640
if you take the people who are in the top 10% of serum cholesterol and you compare them to the

364
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,640
people in the bottom 10% of serum total cholesterol, there's a profound difference in atherosclerosis.

365
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,600
Most people are not familiar with how that history went and, you know, where it got

366
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,800
taken off the rails a little bit by what might be the root cause of those things. But nevertheless,

367
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,040
it was pretty clear into the 1960s and 70s that something about serum cholesterol mattered.

368
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,560
Eventually, people began to, as you pointed out, Tom, begin to fractionate those things. So it

369
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,600
wasn't just about total cholesterol. It became about different densities of those

370
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,880
cholesterol. And these lipoproteins, some of them were lighter, some of them were heavier and really

371
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,760
light and heavier, the wrong words. They had different densities. But one that emerged pretty

372
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,560
quickly as a contrast to the low density lipoprotein was the high density lipoprotein.

373
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,240
And through all of the epidemiologic work that emerged in the late 70s and into the early 80s,

374
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,880
and that also, by the way, continued into the 90s through the work of Jerry Reven,

375
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,120
as he was in the early stages of identifying what would be called metabolic syndrome at the time

376
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:12,640
called syndrome X, it became clear that higher levels of cholesterol in the HDL particle,

377
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,440
which unfortunately is erroneously often referred to as high good cholesterol, had a positive

378
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,360
association, the opposite of what we have just been describing, which is high levels of cholesterol

379
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,520
in the LDL particle. There's a lot less talk of that today, at least amongst the people who know

380
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,800
what they're talking about. Unfortunately, there's still a lot of people who talk about that in

381
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,840
social media. But why is it that we aren't sitting here in the guidelines talking about HDL

382
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,120
cholesterol, the so-called quote unquote, I hate to use this word, good cholesterol.

383
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,400
And you know, I'm in your corner. I'm that one. Folks, there's one cholesterol molecule. I don't

384
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,760
care whether it's in your cell, whether it's in any lipoprotein in your brain. If I drew you the

385
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,440
structure of cholesterol, it's identical. So how dare we put an adjective on it like that's good.

386
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,000
And that's bad. How do you know? So you don't. So they're silly terms, but they,

387
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,920
they sort of evolved for a good reason. And this is a wonderful historical journey that you really

388
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,640
have to do to figure out why did HDL have like such importance? And now it's an afterthought.

389
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,480
Although it's an afterthought, I must say virtually all of the current risk algorithms that are used

390
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,680
to classify you as are you at high, very high, moderate or low risk still use the metric HDL

391
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:43,920
cholesterol to determine that because the data is just 40, 50 years old. The problem with HDL

392
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,200
cholesterol as a metric is all those studies that seems to suggest a higher is better or lower is

393
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,320
worse, we're never adjusted for anything else. So, you know, observational type data. Aha. I found

394
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,520
the answer. Here it is. You got blue eyes and everybody with blue eyes gets this, that, or whatever.

395
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,960
And of course you never adjusted for, oh, wait a minute. Everybody with the blue eyes has this

396
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,800
lethal thing going on also. So in retrospect, it turns out that the overwhelming majority of people

397
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,920
who might have low HDL cholesterol have a high APL B level. And that's what drives their atherosclerosis.

398
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:29,200
So all guidelines, even though they might do your baseline risk using an APL B metric like total or

399
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,440
LDL cholesterol, they'll use HDL cholesterol as trying to figure out the lipid component to your

400
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,960
wrist. They use smoking and blood pressure and other things Peter talked about also. When they

401
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,880
get to goals of therapy, though, only because we have multiple trials now where for decades people

402
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,000
have been trying this, that and everything to raise HDL cholesterol, because if high is better

403
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,840
than low raising, it has to be fantastic. And not a single trial has ever panned out that what you

404
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,360
do to HDL cholesterol results in cardiovascular benefit. Let's pause there for one sec, Tom,

405
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:10,640
and just make sure people understand that there have been multiple trials using at least two,

406
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:18,720
maybe more technical approaches to raise that number that is unambiguously associated with

407
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,160
better outcomes. Is that correct? No, there are no clinical trials that would support raising. No,

408
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,440
no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. There have been multiple clinical trials that have attempted to

409
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,720
raise HDL cholesterol. That's true. Yes. And it's more than two drugs. There are other drugs that.

410
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,960
Yeah, I think more than two mechanisms of action. Correct. At least two that I can think of. There

411
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,440
might be, there's probably three mechanisms of action that have been, that would all raise HDL

412
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:49,440
cholesterol. But the point that you made that is, should not be lost on anyone is at best those

413
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:56,080
trials have been neutral. As have the Mendelian randomization trials looking at genetics,

414
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:01,840
surrogates of HDL and cardiovascular outcomes. Yes. And at worst, those trials have been harmful.

415
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,280
Yeah, there are plenty of people and you know them. You've seen them in your practice. Certainly

416
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,120
I have when I was practicing with high HDL cholesterol who are full of plaque. And we

417
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:18,400
do see people with low HDL cholesterol who just like you said, you see some people with high LDL

418
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,960
or total cholesterol don't have plaque. There are plenty of people with low HDL cholesterol who,

419
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,880
my God, you don't seem to have much cardiovascular risk. So there has to be,

420
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,960
if HDLs are important to the cardiovascular system and I maintain they are, the metric HDL

421
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,840
cholesterol is useless. Yeah. And this is really where I think I want to go with this. And just,

422
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,760
I mean, there's so much we could say on this, but I think it's worth maybe even just explaining

423
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,760
this very important point, right? Which is HDL cholesterol, the number that everybody sees when

424
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,440
they look at their lipid panel, that if it's below 40 milligrams per deciliter is probably flagged as

425
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,880
being too low. If it's above 70, your doctor gives you a high five that is measuring the

426
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,200
concentration of cholesterol within an HDL particle. Now it doesn't tell you anything

427
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,000
about the functionality of that particle. And this is where I think, I don't remember if it

428
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,960
was Ron Kraus that said this, but someone said this to me and I've never forgotten it. It might

429
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,640
have been Alan actually. They said, this LDL biology stuff is trivial. All you got to do is lower it.

430
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,640
It's the HDL biology that is really complicated. That's what the 21st century is going to be about.

431
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,560
We don't have a clue what we're talking about with HDL. We've been using this idiotic crude

432
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,880
metric of how much cholesterol it contains. It is now completely clear that that was the wrong

433
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,880
metric. Then any attempts to increase it were futile. We've count the number of particles.

434
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,600
We can even measure the size of them. That also appears to be almost as crude as what the

435
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,760
cholesterol concentration is. But to come up with an assay that truly measures functionality may be

436
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,560
beyond the scope of laboratories. Whereas with the APOBL side of the equation, it really appears

437
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,520
to be a stochastic problem. The more of these things you have to the first order, the more

438
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,200
problems you have, you've already alluded to other attachments to them that can add second and third

439
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,040
order terms. But I mean, do you agree with my assessment, Tom, that this HDL problem is way

440
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,880
harder and we don't have a clue what we're talking about? It's just so perfect what you've just said

441
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,200
in the last few minutes. We all use laboratory metrics to try and figure out what a given

442
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,040
biomarker tells us and what we can do about it. The only metric that's really available to the

443
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,600
world world now is HDL cholesterol, which Peter says that's the collective cholesterol mass within

444
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:58,560
all the HDLs that exist in a deciliter of your plasma. If you are doing ion mobility or NMRs,

445
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,640
you can get an HDL particle count. But that although it might be a tad better than HDL

446
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,880
cholesterol telling you something, there's so many exceptions to that rule that it's not a useful

447
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:17,120
bedside metric either. But presuming again, HDLs must perform some function in the human body.

448
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,480
And part of that function might be either preventing or putting out arterial wall

449
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:30,720
plaque fires that have many etiologies. How can we measure what Peter referred to as the

450
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:37,520
functionality of the HDL particle? Being a fireman's son, if you listened to that last podcast, I look

451
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,680
at HDLs as fire engines. But I know any fire department has about 10 different types of

452
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,640
different fire trucks. And they all supply something different that fire flutters can use

453
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,600
to extinguish a fire. Some might carry chemicals, some might carry ladders, axes, water, some carry

454
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,960
more firemen than others. So what type of fire truck do you need at a given scene? Well, it depends

455
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:08,320
what the heck the scene is all about. So what do HDLs do? They certainly traffic some degree of

456
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,840
cholesterol, which it turns out is probably just there for stoichiometric reasons, making a spherical

457
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,920
particle to which other things can attach. The other things that are in that HDL, remember, HDLs

458
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,680
are tiny, so they don't carry a lot of cholesterol. Here's a stat that will astound a lot of people.

459
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,880
If I took the average HDL particle, the average size HDL particle out of your plasma, how many

460
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,200
molecules of cholesterol would be inside of it? About 45. How many molecules are in the average

461
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:44,880
size LDL particle? About 1,500, 2,000. So the volume of a spear is the third power of the radius.

462
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:52,240
What might influence even the cholesterol content of 45 cholesterol molecules within an HDL? Well,

463
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,800
it's a spear. There's only so much can go in there. What if that HDL was carrying extra triglycerides

464
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,200
for whatever reason? Well, it couldn't carry very many cholesterol molecules. So that would be a

465
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,560
cholesterol depleted HDL. What if that HDL, if I had five groups of HDL particles, same size, same

466
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:15,520
cholesterol content, but they all had different phospholipids on their surface lipidome, or they

467
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,440
all were trafficking different proteins. They all have APOA1, but what else are they carrying? And

468
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,840
those proteins have a multitude of functions. Dan Rader years ago always told me, Tom, HDLs are part

469
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,440
of the innate immune system. They're little fire engines. They're carrying, God knows what, that

470
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,760
could go into wherever there's inflammation in your body, a swollen knee, any in-tissue injury,

471
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,920
or your arterial wall. And they could maybe help what's going on there because they're trafficking

472
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:53,040
immunomodulatory functionality molecules, or they could go in because, oh my God,

473
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,680
these are corrupt HDLs. They're carrying bad junk, which is further inflaming it. We have no way

474
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,840
of measuring those now. I mean, researchers can do lipidome analysis of the phospholipids,

475
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:12,800
the sphingolipids, the ceramides that are in HDLs. We can, you know, they've identified over 150

476
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,640
different proteins that might be on an HDL. Now, they're not all on one given HDL, but some HDLs

477
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,920
may have two of this protein, none of that. And you have different groups of HDLs. In my analysis,

478
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,080
there are different types of fire engines carrying different things. Peter, in our lifetime, there

479
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,960
will never be an affordable, reproducible, high throughput way of evaluating anything.

480
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:41,360
People are hanging their hats now on the ability of HDLs to efflux cholesterol from a cell. And,

481
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,480
hey, if an HDL can suck some sterols out of your foam cells, yeah, I'm kind of thinking that's

482
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,080
pretty good, but it's probably a minuscule function of the hundred other functions that HDLs

483
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,040
can do. So what if the HDL is pulling out some cholesterol, but it's dumping other crap in the

484
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,760
process? So if we ever had an HDL function panel, it's going to be a dozen or more type tests,

485
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,240
which we're not going to see because nobody's going to pay for them. The research to be done

486
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,720
to prove that these have relevance in a large clinical trial is just not going to be done.

487
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,200
So that's the dilemma. There are such panels, right? I mean, I think, I feel like I've seen

488
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,440
a couple of commercial panels that attempt to subdivide the HDL particles even further. I've

489
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,000
never personally been able to know what to do with such panels. And I, you know, these days,

490
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,600
I don't even look at APO A1 anymore. I'm really focusing most of my efforts on

491
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:41,200
VLDL cholesterol as a poor man's proxy for remnant triglyceride, basically as a strategy

492
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,280
for how to lower APO B, APO B, LP little a, and then focusing just frankly much more on the

493
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,000
metabolic stuff that we've talked about, the obviously glucose, insulin, homocysteine,

494
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,160
uric acid, much more aggressive stance on blood pressure. But in some ways, my lipid world has

495
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,200
become a little bit easier in light of this discussion we're having. It is because you've

496
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:11,040
got the ability based on analysis and understanding of things to not order the silly hocus pocus HDL

497
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,320
panels that are being offered by people as a way to generate revenue. Now look, I've been associated

498
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,520
with labs all my life. I'm not at the present time. I don't work for any lab that does or doesn't do

499
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,240
any of these tests you're talking about. But mostly those panels that you look at,

500
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:33,120
they're looking, they're reporting HDL size, they're reporting APO A1. Peter knows there can be from

501
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:40,880
one to five molecules on APO A1 on your various HDL species. So you have just a few HDLs carrying

502
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,160
a lot of APO A1 or do you have a ton of HDLs that carrying little APO A1 and that could be a

503
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,680
misleading metric. People are looking at some of these phospholipids now. Some labs are offering

504
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:58,960
ceramide levels or shingosine levels. But again, you can find something that might support that,

505
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,080
but then you have to weigh it against the APO B and the things that are almost beyond discussion.

506
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:09,200
And you would realize this is contributing nothing to me. Why am I even ordering this? Am I trying

507
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:15,040
to impress some patient that I can use big words and this means anything? So they're silly. I'm in

508
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,960
awe for doing research on HDL functionality and looking into it so we all get a better comprehension

509
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,040
of it. I'd love to have a test that tells us what I talk about the flux of HDL particles,

510
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,760
how do little e-C-Ween-C HDLs mature, fill up, then what do they do with that cholesterol,

511
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,160
and are they catabolized? Are they not catabolized? Are your HDLs pulling cholesterol out of an artery

512
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,200
wall and then sharing it with an LDL that might take it right back into the artery wall? So there's

513
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:51,840
just so many phenomenal issues to get into with HDL, but right now don't waste your money. You're

514
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:57,440
going to get an HDL cholesterol. Everybody's going to be doing a lipid panel. Do not waste your money,

515
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,160
time, or your brain energy on trying to figure out these HDL metrics.

516
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,160
So let's at that junction pivot now to more of the risk assessment stuff.

517
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:16,320
We have talked probably on at least two podcasts about LPa. You and I spoke about it during our

518
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:21,440
marathon podcast. I think we had an AMA segment where Bob Kaplan asked me a lot of questions

519
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,680
about LPa. It's still on my list of things to do. I'd love to have Sam Tomikas on the podcast.

520
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:35,280
For people who don't know, Sam is certainly among close to the world's experts on LPa.

521
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,520
And I think, frankly, a dedicated podcast on this topic is warranted, given that directionally one

522
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:50,160
in 10 people listening to this podcast has an elevated LPa. And it represents, unless you

523
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,960
correct me, Tom, I believe it would represent the single greatest genetic driver of atherosclerosis.

524
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,560
So here we have this thing called LPa that tragically most people don't know they have.

525
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,280
I'll tell you a funny story. Have you ever heard of this reality TV show called Alone?

526
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,320
No.

527
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,920
I don't think I've watched TV in 12 years, but it now shows up on Netflix. And I do watch Netflix

528
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,080
from time to time. So a friend of mine mentioned to me the other day, he goes, you got to check out

529
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,320
this show called Alone. It's right up your alley. They take these people who have remarkable

530
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,800
survival skills and they throw them out in the world's worst environment, 10 of them,

531
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,960
separately, of course. And basically the person who last calls uncle wins half a million bucks.

532
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,960
So I'm into season six right now, which is, it's the first one I've watched, but it's clearly into

533
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,200
a really nasty part of the Arctic. So I'm watching this and I'm just humbled by the fact that these

534
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,520
people can survive any length of time. Anyway, one of the guys in the show, you know, you learn

535
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,240
their backstory and he's, this guy looks as impressive as anybody I've ever seen, but somehow

536
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,520
it comes up that part of his motivation for doing this is he had a heart attack like the year before.

537
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,520
And I think he's 39 on the show implying that he had his heart attack at the age of 38 or thereabouts.

538
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,760
Now, if you looked at this guy, Tom, you wouldn't think this is the kind of guy that could have a

539
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:20,800
heart attack. I mean, he looks, he is a specimen. And of course, what's the first thing that comes

540
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:27,440
to my mind? Well, I've seen this story play out 50,000 times, right? I mean, my wife's grandfather

541
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:35,120
died at 40. He was a firefighter, fit as if it'll drop dead of a heart attack at 47 in my mom's dad's

542
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:41,440
arms when he was 16. So I know the story very well. And it's, to me, it's LP little a until proven

543
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,040
otherwise on a hot O'Connor wrote a great story about this in the New York time several years ago,

544
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,720
disclosing that he himself found he's a carrier of LP little a. So always want to make sure

545
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:59,360
everybody stops, reevaluates, make sure that they aren't a high LP little a carrier. What else is on

546
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:04,800
our list of real risk assessment here? And by the way, feel free to just pile on to more LP little

547
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,880
a stuff because this to me is, I mean, this, this is interesting stuff. And I do think unlike my

548
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,080
pessimism around HDL, where I don't think we're going to learn a whole heck of a lot about it,

549
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:21,600
I think we're just scratching the surface of differentiating between really aggressive LP

550
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:28,000
little a's versus not as aggressive LP little a's. And I'm optimistic there. Well, you're right. And

551
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,320
of course, on the favor of LP little a be in dangerous is the a bunch of Mendelian randomization

552
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:41,040
trials, which don't exist for any HDL metric or so. So right away, it's a, a marker that requires

553
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,560
more serious evaluation or so you want to remind people again what it is. I guess I glossed over

554
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:55,040
that. Yeah, sure. For those new to this low density lipoprotein is a collection of cholesterol,

555
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,560
triglycerides, fossil lipids wrapped by a single molecule of a polipro protein B, because of the

556
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,600
size and density, it falls within a certain fraction of their centrifuge tube and it's called

557
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:13,440
low density. But all lipoprotein subclasses are heterogeneous. They consist of big particles,

558
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,040
small particles, or maybe a particle carrying something else that doesn't really change its

559
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:26,000
density that much. So it separates with the LDLs and LP little a is basically you have your LDL

560
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,400
part of this macromolecule. But co attached to the Apo B structural protein is another protein

561
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,160
that shouldn't be there. And it's called apoprotein little a and by little a we mean small case, not a

562
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:46,320
capital A. And that molecule that attaches Apo A, you know, can vary in molecular weight, size,

563
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,680
length, etc. But that's beyond this discussion. So it's an LDL, it's carrying an extraneous

564
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:59,440
passenger. And here's the problem. We know people with high LP little a that don't seem to be

565
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,360
bothered. They're not coming down. There's no premature family history in them. And other

566
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,400
people's the example Peter just gave my God, they're atherosclerotic Rex at young ages.

567
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:15,120
So I also just as I've sort of iterated about other lipoproteins, I think when we're talking

568
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:20,800
about LP little a in the year 2020, we are talking about all right, let's what's its mass,

569
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:27,200
what's its LP little a particle number. But I also think we have to be smarter on understanding the

570
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:35,200
quality or other attributes of this LP little a particle. What makes this Apo little a attachment

571
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,320
may be terrible for that guy who had his heart attack at age 30. But here are other people who

572
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,200
are coming in at age 80 and they got high LP little a and they're not full of plaque or so.

573
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,280
And one of the things we're beginning to understand is look, Apo a has potentially some

574
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,920
thrombogenic properties, which perhaps get expressed in some people more than others.

575
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:02,400
But more and more, one of the functions perhaps even of Apo a wide even evolved is a little

576
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,720
scavenger protein that attaches to oxidized lipid moieties, specifically oxidized fossil

577
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,440
lipids, oxidized sterols, they bind to it with great affinity. And maybe that little garbage

578
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,680
truck full of oxidized particles, if it could bring it back to the liver or some other tissue

579
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:25,920
that could catabolize it, those oxidized lipid moieties, which tend to be destructive to cells,

580
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:33,040
are not getting to cells. So we are beginning to have metrics that are starting to appear and

581
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:39,040
available in the real world that we can measure the oxidation, the oxidized lipid moieties that

582
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:46,400
are on Apo little a. They're actually it's called oxidized PL fossil lipids on Apo b.

583
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:52,880
And if you say, well, these oxidized fossil lipids are on all the Apo b particles to a minuscule

584
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:59,760
degree for because of the affinity of oxidized lipid moieties, Apo a, you overwhelm if you have

585
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,520
a positive oxidized fossil lipid Apo b, the overwhelming majority of Apo b particles trafficking

586
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,520
those oxidized lipids are LP little a particles. So two people came to consult me tomorrow, they

587
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:18,080
both have an elevated LP little a metric. One has a normal oxidized fossil lipids on Apo b,

588
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:24,080
but the other one is elevated. Based on Sam Sinekis and others were work, I'm going to be a little

589
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:30,080
more worried about that person who's my God, not only do they have this undesirable particle, but

590
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:36,160
this particle is loaded downward, injurious other lipids that are potentially very harmful. So that's

591
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:42,560
one aspect of it. We're nowhere near being able to test for the thrombo genicity, if that's a big

592
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:48,560
factor of Apo little a and everything. So there are other ways of doing this. I mean, I all the

593
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:53,680
time when I get my weekly email from Peter T here's the podcast this week. I'm waiting for Sam

594
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:00,320
Sinekis. So but for those of you still waiting for Peter to nab him, he's pretty active on Twitter.

595
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:06,400
And he really tweets a lot of good information on the cutting edge of what's coming down with LP.

596
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:12,640
I think it's LP little a dash underscore doc something like but we'll go on Twitter and Sam

597
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:19,360
Sinekis, T S I M I K S and you'll be happy you followed him. So there's just a lot to understand

598
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:26,320
Peter. So it's who has it. And by the way, the new guidelines are the European guidelines suggest

599
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,880
that everybody ought to have it once in their life as they approach adulthood. And you never need

600
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,080
repeat it unless somehow you're trying to modulate it or maybe you go through medical is where it can

601
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,480
go up a little bit. But it's a genetically determined marker you have it or you don't have

602
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,000
it if you don't have it at age 18, you're not going to have it at age 68. So it's a one time test.

603
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,320
And it helps us before we talk, let's do thorough cardiovascular risk assessments, no matter what

604
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:58,160
your APOB is. And this would be one of the tests that at least the Europeans have signed on to now,

605
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,040
the National Lipid Association, other people have issued guidelines to it and they're still telling

606
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,960
you, well, do it for unexplained heart attacks or strong family history of heart disease. To me,

607
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,400
again, it's not a very expensive test. Get it once and for all. But there's so much to talk about this,

608
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:20,800
Peter. And in the future, I mean, there are ways, what would you do for somebody with high

609
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:26,000
LP, little a, we have strategies, which is mostly attacking APOB right now and any of the other

610
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,080
cardiovascular risk factor. But there are drugs in the pipeline that may give us better alternatives

611
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:38,880
to perhaps stop your liver from making APO, little a. Let's talk about that a little bit. So up until

612
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:46,320
I would say a few years ago, the only strategy for patients, let's assume that we've confirmed

613
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,120
that a patient's LP, little a is elevated. And furthermore, let's confirm that we have reason

614
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:57,440
to believe that in that patient, the LP, little a is also problematic. And again, this usually shows

615
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,880
up in family history. It's not a subtle thing. A lot of times I'm taking the family history from

616
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,680
a patient before I've got the blood test. Those could be offset by weeks. And it's because we give

617
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:16,000
our patients the template to work on this, they come in with a very thorough family history. They

618
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,680
really know what happened to the mother's older sister and the grandfather and all of these other

619
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:27,280
things. And you usually just see this history of lots of heart attacks before the age of 60.

620
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,600
Obviously it can be confounded by people who are heavy smokers and things like that.

621
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,320
Yeah. Let me just interrupt you for one second. It'll be a minute because published yesterday

622
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:41,840
in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology is a study and a fantastic editorial.

623
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:47,680
And they looked at people with terrible family histories of heart disease and people who had

624
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:53,280
LP, little a issues or they didn't. And the conclusion was simple. Don't have high LP,

625
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:58,160
little a if somehow you can avoid that, which you can't. Don't have a terrible family history of

626
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,880
coronary artery disease. And I don't know how you avoid it, but if you want the worst scenario,

627
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,880
don't have both LP, little a and fis so Peter, what Peter is just saying is now backed up by a

628
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:15,120
nice study. Yeah. I love the best advice is choose healthier parents. So let's assume we're in that

629
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:20,160
situation, which is we have high LP, little a and we have the family history that is not favorable

630
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,040
or something else that's even more germane to the patient, which is a positive calcium score,

631
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:32,560
something to that effect. Well, again, historically, our best bet would be remove all other risk to the

632
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:40,800
extent that it is possible. So we lower all other ApoB maximally pharmacologically. We optimize

633
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,480
completely all of the metabolic parameters that we've discussed briefly here, but touched on in

634
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,360
greater detail elsewhere. And that includes everything from modulating blood pressure as

635
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:56,400
aggressively as it needs to be to controlling all of these other factors that don't get enough

636
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,720
attention in my book, the uric acids, the homocysteines, things like that. But then as you

637
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,040
point out, there's a strategy now that says, wait a minute, what if we knock out the liver's ability

638
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:16,080
to make Apo, little a and all of a sudden you wouldn't have an LP, little a. So what does that

639
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:23,520
strategy look like and where is that strategy in the pharmacologic pipeline? In pretty early trials

640
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,880
and of course, any cell we're talking about the liver here, if the liver is the primary site of

641
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:37,440
production of Apo, little a and it is, if we could mess with the genes to ASO therapy, we could

642
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:43,680
probably stop a cell from making a given protein. If we can stop the liver from making Apo protein,

643
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:49,920
little a, if you don't have that, you certainly the liver can't secrete it so it can attach to

644
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:56,080
LDL particles, transforming them into LP, little a particles. So that's almost like a no-brainer.

645
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:02,320
The Mendelian randomization trials says don't have high Apo way or LP, little a. So let's just

646
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:07,360
inhibit its synthesis as we've done with other things that contribute to coronary artery disease.

647
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:13,280
And that has to work. Yes, provided that protein doesn't screw or that ASO treatment doesn't screw

648
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,640
up something else or cause a downside to it. And that's why you ultimately have to do large

649
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:25,840
clinical trials looking at not only event reduction, but safety. But those drugs are in early,

650
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,840
you know, and like anything else, the first generation of those antisense oligosaccharide

651
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:37,040
drugs that came around, they've perfected them. So there's a second generation of them now that

652
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:42,480
they've made even more hepatoselective so they can dose less of it. And it goes right into the liver.

653
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:52,720
But they're phase one, phase one, two trials. And Novartis, I believe, has now acquired the

654
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,160
product that they're going to put it in a major which has just started enrollment of phase three

655
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:05,920
trial on let's not. But here's the problem. Peter knows the billions that probably have to be

656
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:12,240
invested when you're developing a drug of that type of magnitude to reduce something. You're not

657
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:17,440
going to do it on every time Dick and Harry who has a trivial LP little a you want that first

658
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,640
trial to work because if it doesn't, that's it. The drug the drug is dead. It'll never be tested

659
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:29,200
and lesser risk people. So the only way you can get into this current apo little a synthesis

660
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:35,840
modulator drug is you have to have had an atherosclerotic clinical event of myocardial infarction,

661
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:41,840
stroke, blah, blah, blah, stents. And you have to have an astronomical like upper quintile

662
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,320
concentration of LP little a. Because Bendelian trials suggest if you're going to get benefit

663
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:54,320
by lowering apo little a or LP little a, it has to be a pretty significant drop in it. So you're

664
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:01,680
not going to take somebody with a trivial LP little a elevation and, you know, if you tested 50,000

665
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,400
maybe it would work. But so if they go through this first trial and it'll probably take three,

666
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,920
four or five years to show efficacy and safety, then they're going to have to maybe do some

667
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:18,320
sub trial analysis. And then is anybody even going to fund the primary prevention trial with this

668
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:24,240
drug with the cost that that takes? I don't know. So even if you're somebody who's had a heart attack

669
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,880
because of LP little a and you're waiting for this drug, you got five, 10 years to wait. And

670
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:35,040
for primary prevention, go on to other ways that clinicians are attacking this problem right now,

671
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:42,880
because you're not going to have anything. Why is it that statins, which are probably the most potent

672
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:51,440
drug until five years ago to lower LDL and by definition, then lower APO concentration,

673
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:58,960
have virtually no effect on LP little a. But this new class of drug that's been around for five

674
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:08,160
years called PCSK9 inhibitors, well, even more potent in lowering LDL seem to also be able to

675
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:14,640
lower LP little a. I think there's two reasons there. And one, we've gotten enough trials now

676
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:23,120
that seem to show depending on your APO a makeup, do you produce the large high molecular weight APO

677
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:29,280
a or the smaller low molecular weight APO a, which in epidemiologic trials seems to be way more

678
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:35,200
associated with atherosclerosis, that if you're one who does produce the low molecular weight,

679
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:40,400
short APO a, which means because it's such a small protein to make the liver can make a ton of it,

680
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,160
so they actually, even though their molecular weight of APO little a is lower, they have much

681
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:52,720
higher LP little a particle counts. If you have that isiformity LP little a statins can induce

682
01:09:52,720 --> 01:10:01,120
the synthesis of that statins do not affect the synthesis of the larger APO a moiety. So in some

683
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,720
people, Peter says statins do not much to LP little a concentrations, but there is a small

684
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:12,400
component where statins will actually raise it a little bit. And people get scared. They go, well,

685
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:18,160
I'm lowering LDL cholesterol, LDL particle counts a tad, but I'm raising LP little a, even Sam

686
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:24,960
Samikas will tell you, don't worry about it. LP little a, if you learn nothing else about our LP

687
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,480
little a discussion is a minority LDL particle. So even though if you have the small isoform of

688
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:40,800
statin may be raising LP little a a tad, it's so blowing away the LDLs that don't have APO a attached

689
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,400
to it that at the end of the day, you have less cardiovascular risk. And that little excursion in

690
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:52,160
LP little a concentration is probably meaningless. Now to go on to the second part of the questions,

691
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:59,280
the piece SK9 inhibitors don't have an effect on the synthesis of APO a in the body. So at least

692
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:05,360
they're not aggravating it in some people. But we're still in our infancy trying to understand

693
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,840
how LP little a particles are, you know, catabolized or cleared, and it's probably due to multiple

694
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:19,360
receptors, the LDL receptors part of it and a PCSK nine can give you more LDL receptors than a statin

695
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:27,040
probably can putting aside the synthetic interference with it. But PCSK nine, their finding has effects

696
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:34,320
now on APO we receptors in three or four other lipoprotein clearing receptors that are expressed

697
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:40,960
in liver and other cells or so. So I mean, that's, there's got to be better clearance of the particles

698
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:49,920
with PCSK nine inhibitors, then there is with LDL receptor expression with statins or statins plus

699
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,200
whatever other apo b lowering drug you're going to add to it or so. So I think that's where we're at

700
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,480
right now. Most of the time, these people are going to wind up on statins plus PCSK nine unless

701
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,240
they can't tolerate a statin or there's another reason not to use a statin. So that's my explanation

702
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:11,280
right now, Peter, that I think we touched on that a little bit in the last podcast, and we still

703
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,960
don't have a lot of info and clearance of LP little a particles. And as you said, it's quite variable.

704
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:22,720
I mean, we've seen patients where they're on a PCSK nine inhibitor for other reasons. And every

705
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:27,120
time I put somebody on when I recheck their LP little a just different or the reason than to

706
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,960
gather our own data on how much of an effect the drug either prior went to Rapata is having on

707
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:41,920
LP little a and there's the range is zero to 60 70% reduction. I mean, that's literally how broad

708
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:48,720
it is with probably a median reduction of a third. Yeah, so two important points here. One,

709
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:53,600
LP little a is not an acceptable goal of therapy because there wouldn't be trial data. So even

710
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,760
though we all think that's probably going to be good. But I think most people like Peter when he

711
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,560
prescribes it, sort of likes to at least see what happens to get his own information or so. But

712
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:09,760
realize that's not what you're making a therapeutic decision on per se is the LP little a concentration.

713
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,640
So just keep that in mind when you when you're following up on these people.

714
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,800
One last thing I want to circle in on you with that you and I spoke about a couple of years ago.

715
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:27,520
It was an experimental metric that was being bandied about. In fact, I remember you guys ran it

716
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:35,280
at THD on some of my serum. But I don't know that it ever saw the commercial light of day,

717
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:42,240
which was I think it was like LDL triglyceride concentration. Have those tests ever seen the

718
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:48,960
light of day? I think if you look around enough, you might find a lab. It's a very easy

719
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:55,520
assay. Denka makes it where you could get an LDL triglyceride level. And by the way, just

720
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,880
another thought jumped into my brain on that LP little a, as I told you, there are other things

721
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:08,160
that attach to even LDLs and HDLs that make them less clearable or more atherogenic. And a very

722
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:14,480
recent study show, believe it or not, there are LP little a particles that carry Apo C3.

723
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,720
You're not going to clear that particle if you make it so. The double whammy. Yeah. Oh my god.

724
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:28,160
But anyway, back to LDL triglycerides. People, I often tease them if you said, you know what,

725
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:33,440
we're really cost effective. We're only going to allow you to have one lipid concentration on this

726
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:38,640
person. Nothing else. I would tell him, give me an LDL triglyceride level, certainly not an LDL

727
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,160
cholesterol level. And remember, Apo B is a lipoprotein metric, not a lipid metric. So that's

728
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:52,960
what I would really take. But the triglyceride part of the core of any lipoprotein has a lot to do

729
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:00,640
with plasma residence time of that particle. What else might be attached to that particle?

730
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:08,000
Even I alluded to it a little bit in my brief HDL discussion before Dan Rader calls them fat HDLs.

731
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,160
What if your HDL particle is not carrying very many cholesterol molecules, it's carrying triglycerides.

732
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:20,480
Well, he's shown, God knows a decade ago to those fat HDLs, meaning triglyceride and rich,

733
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:26,000
are dysfunctional. They're carrying some of the bad stuff that HDLs carry that don't allow them

734
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:32,560
to do their cardioprotective functions. So if triglycerides gets into an LDL, number one,

735
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,040
what happens to an LDL that's floating around and it might still be a big LDL because it's full of

736
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:45,120
triglycerides, not cholesterol, but it has a very great affinity for lipase enzymes that line our

737
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:52,800
arteries or the surface of the liver. So hepatic lipase is a very potent triglyceridase phospholipase

738
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:58,800
that is just like a fly trap looking for flies. It's looking for triglyceride enriched HDLs.

739
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:07,280
And if it binds to it, it will extract hydrolyzed the triglycerides. So if I had a LDL full of

740
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:13,600
triglycerides and I pulled the trigs out, what am I left with? Well, that's an LDL particle that's

741
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,200
lost a lot of surface phospholipids as well as a lot of core triglycerides. I have the so-called

742
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:25,600
small LDL or dense LDL. I try not to use both adjectives together because they're redundant.

743
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:32,960
And we have plenty of evidence that, yeah, it's no good to have an increased total LDL particle count,

744
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:40,240
but try not to have too many small LDL particles because the evidence has certainly emerged that

745
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:46,240
particle for particle, they're probably more atherogenic than the more buoyant larger LDL

746
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:52,240
particles for a variety of reasons. And the bigger non-triglyceride rich LDL, it might be a

747
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:58,160
better fit for an LDL receptor. It's going to clear it. So LDL triglycerides, basically, if you told

748
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:03,520
me it was high, I know you probably got a high LDL particle count, APOB. I know you have the

749
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:09,920
small LDL particles. I know where those triglycerides probably came from, your VLDL triglyceride rich

750
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,640
particles, your chiral micron particles. And when they transfer their triglycerides to LDLs,

751
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,840
they become remnant lipoproteins, which Peter has alluded to. And you can bet those same

752
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,280
triglycerides are invading the HDL particles contributing to HDL functionality. And last but

753
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:33,440
not least, in the studies where they've looked at LDL triglyceride, many of the inflammatory markers

754
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:39,440
are high because those particles set off the inflammasome in various endothelial cells and

755
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:46,080
elsewhere. So it's a really simple, easy to do metric that could tell us so much. And I think,

756
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,960
if I saw it was up, the first thing I'm saying up, I'm dealing with an insulin resistant person,

757
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,760
because that would be the most common cause, not some genetic triglyceride problem.

758
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,400
Right. And again, I think perhaps the reason why people aren't leaping up and down to

759
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,600
bring this to market is, frankly, if you're looking at VLDL cholesterol,

760
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:12,320
and you're looking at all of the markers of insulin resistance, along with the lipoprotein

761
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,600
markers we've discussed, I think you get the story. And look, I mean, taking a step back,

762
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,920
let's play devil's advocate for a moment. I think that it's worth doing ApoB over non-HDL

763
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:30,240
cholesterol. There are some people who are so opposed to advanced lipid testing that they will

764
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:36,640
argue, as long as you have non-HDL cholesterol, you don't even need to measure ApoB, because of

765
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:44,000
course the non-HDL cholesterol is measuring the LDL cholesterol, but somewhat correcting

766
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:51,840
for the additional VLDL by adding the VLDL cholesterol. What is your take on the idea of

767
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,240
non-HDL cholesterol versus ApoB as they are somewhat proxies for the same problem?

768
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,720
Well, I'm in the Snyderman School, and he's published on this extensively. I find it,

769
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,760
all right, it probably gives you a little bit more information for the reasons you just described.

770
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,360
Versus LDL cholesterol, yeah.

771
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:15,520
Beyond LDL cholesterol. But as Snyderman has clearly shown in several studies,

772
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:22,080
even though non-HDL cholesterol correlates with ApoB a little bit better than does LDL cholesterol,

773
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:28,480
there's still 20, 30% of the population in our diabetics and psoriasis where they're discordant.

774
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:34,560
And where there is discordance, even with non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB, risk follows ApoB.

775
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:40,880
So why am I wasting my time with it? Look, it's all useful. It might help you pick what therapy

776
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:46,480
you want to use, but at the end of the day, I see no need to follow your non-HDL cholesterol.

777
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:52,000
I'm following ApoB because I'd be a fool if I told you I normalized your non-HDL cholesterol,

778
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,360
and I've eliminated your lipoprotein mediated risk. Until you measure, you quantitate

779
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,640
these particles, and if we ever get a quality test, that's a silly thing to say to a patient.

780
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,680
Yeah, exactly. We saved $3.

781
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:14,720
Yeah. And we might spend a little time, or you're very good at explaining it. How do you determine

782
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:19,840
VLDL cholesterol in your patients, Peter? You're not dividing triglycerides by five,

783
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:26,640
the old Friedelwald formula. No. So we use a lab that is actually giving a VLDL cholesterol,

784
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:32,080
and even if they didn't do that, we would still take total cholesterol and subtract from it

785
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:37,440
LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Not perfect either, because in that situation,

786
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:43,760
sometimes the LDL is calculated. But I always do a back of the envelope trig divided by five.

787
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:49,360
It's not close enough. No, that's true. And listen, you made a key point here,

788
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,400
which maybe went over people's heads. You cannot do that calculation if you have a

789
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:59,840
calculated LDL cholesterol. You must have a directly measured LDL cholesterol,

790
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:05,440
because total cholesterol is LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. So if

791
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:11,120
you subtract a directly measured HDL cholesterol, a directly measured HDL cholesterol, in effect,

792
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:18,000
you have a directly measured VLDL cholesterol, which in our current world is about as close as

793
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,840
you're going to get to an evaluation of remnants. I think in our last podcast, we talked why there

794
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:31,200
are exceptions to that rule, and that's a more complex discussion. But please, you can't get VLDL

795
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:37,840
cholesterol using the Frito-Waltz calculated LDL cholesterol. All right. Let's talk a little bit

796
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:44,640
about therapies. Statins have been around forever. They still take up most of the air in the room.

797
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:52,240
They are the workhorse of lipid-lowering therapy. Is there anything new and exciting to talk about?

798
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:57,040
I would say that there's no new statin on the market today that wasn't there two years ago.

799
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:04,080
Is the most recently introduced statin live-alow? Yeah, and that's probably 10 years ago introduced.

800
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:12,000
What do you make of that, Tom? Why are we not seeing more statin innovation? Two things. I think

801
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,760
third-party payers would never pay for a new branded statin. They're going to always insist

802
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,880
you use the cheapest generic that's appropriate to the degree of LDL lowering that you need.

803
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,600
There are seven of them on the market now, so I don't think a bean counter at some farm is looking

804
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:35,760
for, let's get a new statin. We're well aware of potential downsides to statin things. We have to

805
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,720
look for who tolerates them, who doesn't. I don't know that they're somehow going to invent a new

806
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:46,720
statin that brings none of the potential downside of a statin to the equation. They're looking at

807
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:53,360
other therapies that will, now that we understand it's atherogenic lipoproteins, that will reduce

808
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:58,000
that. If your investment pays off, you'll have a branded product for X number of years, and you

809
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,920
might get a little return on your investment. I don't think we're going to see another

810
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,960
statin right now. The biggest thing that's happened with statins and in a guideline,

811
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:12,320
you know, in the old days when we had nothing else to do and we didn't know a lot about all

812
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:18,960
this lipoprotein stuff is, hey, you got this most trivial elevation of some LDL metric,

813
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,280
mostly LDL, you're going on a statin. I want them in the drinking water. In the old days,

814
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:29,120
oh, Tom, I just took a statin because they just reduced heart attacks. You and I know there is

815
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:34,720
an event reduction, but there's plenty of residual risk, even if you're aggressively using a statin.

816
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:40,400
So there always is more to the story. But I think the newer guidelines give you a lot more ability

817
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:47,680
to ascertain in a given individual after you do your thorough cardiovascular risk assessment,

818
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:52,160
you and I do our own risk assessment, which is a little different than what the guidelines might

819
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:58,800
offer. But then once a person crosses a certain threshold of atherosclerotic risk, then it becomes

820
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:05,760
plausible to consider a statin. And there's more to it than per se the LDL cholesterol level.

821
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,360
There's all those other factors that go into risk assessment. And there are other

822
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:17,440
adjunctive diagnostics. Now you earlier, we briefly alluded to coronary calcium scoring,

823
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,760
LP, little a, they would be things that current guidelines says use of your

824
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,800
Hammond or horn. Should I give a statin? Should I not? Or the patient? I don't want to take it

825
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,080
at least to a CAC, at least to an LP, little a look at the family history, as you mentioned,

826
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,960
look at the blood pressure, other concomitant risk factors. In fact, that add into,

827
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:44,800
do I want to use a statin or other Apo B lowering therapy? So that's the biggest change with statins.

828
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,120
Nobody's saying, hey, they belong in the drinking water. You should carefully choose who you're

829
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:56,000
advocating statin therapy to. Any sort of rules of thumb, just in terms of the alchemy of this,

830
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,040
you mentioned that there are seven out there, you know, in our practice, we really only pick from

831
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:09,600
four of them, Livolo, Crestor, Lipitor, and Prevostatin. I mean, most of these are generic now.

832
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,960
And if you listen to the podcast with Catherine Eban, which I know you did, we are actually still

833
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:21,280
pushing for branded whenever we can get it. And if we're not getting a branded version of those,

834
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,720
we cross check with who the generic supplier is. And we've seen differences, right? We've seen that

835
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:33,600
two versions of Resuvostatin can produce different outcomes. So our default position is that all

836
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,840
generics are crap until proven otherwise. And that's why we use a tightly controlled list of meds.

837
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,120
But I don't think I've ever prescribed Simvastatin, for example. What's your take on some of the older

838
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:49,920
statins versus the four? I mean, the reason I think we look at Prevostatin and Livolo is mostly for

839
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,600
the sensitive patient, and then Crestor and Lipitor, Resuvostatin and Torvostatin being kind

840
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,400
of the workhorse. Yeah. Well, you're just too young, Peter, and old fogies like myself,

841
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,560
Lova statin or Mevacor was the first statin that came around, Simvastatin was an accident,

842
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:13,600
Prevostatin and Prevocol came. So we have a lot of experience with those drugs. But as time went on,

843
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:20,880
in pretty early on, there was a pretty rational thing that whatever the reason Prevostatin is

844
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:28,080
a safer statin to use than Simvastatin or Lova statin. And it turns out that was mostly related

845
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:34,160
to drug-drug interactions where Prevostatin is pretty clean. Subsequent to that, the only statin

846
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:40,400
that is even cleaner than Prevostatin on drug-drug interactions is the Livolo. So Ptoavastatin would

847
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:47,120
be its generic name. So that's in today's polypharmacy world where, and we're not only even

848
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,760
talking about prescription products, but the multitude of supplements or God knows what people

849
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:57,440
wind up taking, we have no way to check on drug-drug interactions. So you're probably going to get into

850
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:05,920
less trouble with Ptoavastatin or Prevostatin. Of course, along came Resuvostatin many years later

851
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:12,960
after Prevostatin. And it shared some, at least pharmacokinetic attributes with the Prevostatin

852
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:18,720
in that it was a hydrophilic statin, kind of hepatoselective, but it was way more potent on a

853
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:26,720
milligram basis than Prevostatin. So it became an over that evolution of all those early statins,

854
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,760
every three years we had lower and lower and lower LDL metric goals, which weren't there when we first

855
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:39,440
started. So what used to be acceptable is no longer acceptable. So it was very easy to transform from

856
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:47,760
the hydrophilic Prevostatin to the way more potent hydrophilic Resuvostatin. And that pretty much was

857
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,560
my statin of choice thereafter, unless you had a putz around because of statin intolerance,

858
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:58,640
where you would try some of those other things. Personally, once all this was known and once

859
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:03,920
Resuvostatin hit the market, I don't think I ever prescribed another Lipitor dose again, unless,

860
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:09,920
you know, third party payers are influences here. They sometimes tell people you either take this

861
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,480
one or here's what you're going to have to pay if you don't go on our formulae. So that can factor

862
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:20,320
into its use. Now Lipitor is a potent statin milligram per milligram. It's not as potent as

863
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:27,200
Resuvostatin, but you can get whatever LDL reduction if you use a higher dose of Lipitor,

864
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,680
as you can with a somewhat lesser dose of Resuvostatin. So unless the third party payer is

865
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:36,480
telling me to use it, I'm probably not going to advocate Lipitor. Just there are more drug drug

866
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:41,840
interactions and it is Lipophilic. There's perhaps other issues at play. You and I have talked about

867
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:47,360
statins ability to get into the brain and everything where Lipophilic statins might be have a little

868
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:53,360
more bit propensity to do that than hydrophilic statins. So there are other issues at play that

869
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,320
would influence where you're going. The other thing that, and I'm going to disagree in, I think

870
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,560
it's the way you practice too, all of the guidelines right now say, okay, you've made a

871
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,920
decision to use a statin. Pick the two most statin, the most potent statins. That means you're on

872
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:15,520
Lipitor or Crestor and prescribe it at the maximum dose. Because the way these trials were designed,

873
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,520
lowers better, they all start, you know, they very few trials where they took people with

874
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,720
minuscule LDL cholesterol levels and drew statins at them. So they want you to get,

875
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:31,600
hey, the clinical trial shows this statin at that dose works. Maybe there's pleiotropic effects at

876
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,960
that statin is doing too. So how do you know you have to be evidence-based? I don't buy it. I think

877
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,840
virtually all of the statins contribution to atherosclerosis reduction is ApoB reduction.

878
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:48,480
And I think you've known me long enough that rather than maximizing a statin using the Gorilla

879
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:54,320
dose day one, I would prefer to start with a smaller dose, again, dependent on your risk and

880
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,360
your metrics. I mean, if you're coming off an acute coronary syndrome and your LDL metric is

881
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:04,800
off the chart, okay, I'll start with a big one. But I'd rather take that baby statin, meaning a

882
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:12,400
lower dose of a statin and perhaps optimizing it with a second ApoB lowering drug. And for the

883
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,760
longest time we had a Zetimibe, which has since been proven in clinical trials to further reduce

884
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:22,800
benefit and also in Mendelian randomization trials, looking at the Neiman pick protein.

885
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:28,400
And now we have the new guy on the street, this Bempedoic acid, which is a weaker cholesterol

886
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,680
synthesis inhibitor affecting an early on cholesterol synthesis step. Also that has

887
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:39,280
Mendelian randomization support. And if you can't use a statin or if you can use a statin, if you

888
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:45,600
add dastudastatin or even the triple therapy statin, is that a Bempedoic acid? Maybe you can avoid the

889
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,400
expensive PCSK9 inhibitor. So we have a lot more therapeutic options now a day, Peter.

890
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,040
And then talk about the differences in the synthetic pathways between these two drugs,

891
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,640
or where are they targeting the synthetic pathways and what makes them different? Is one

892
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:04,480
more hepatic selective or is it really a question of potency with respect to where they're blocking

893
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:10,720
the chain? Yes. The cholesterol synthesis pathway is something like 37 steps. Each step has its own

894
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:17,760
different enzyme catalyzing the transformation of these precursor products into the next down the

895
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:23,760
stage. Statins happen to inhibit what's called the rate limiting enzyme. It's the third step

896
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:30,720
in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. And of course that's modulated by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.

897
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:38,160
Statins pretty significantly in a dose dependent fashion inhibit that enzyme. So you can seriously

898
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:44,000
slow down cholesterol synthesis in various cells. The one cell we really want to do it in is the

899
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,360
liver because that's a cell that has the greatest propensity to upregulate LDL receptors that can

900
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:56,720
clear our APOB containing particles. So statins do that. Now if you can deplete cholesterol pools

901
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:03,440
beyond what a statin can do in the liver, you will express more LDL receptors. So when we use

902
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:09,440
hisetimide, we block intestinal absorption of cholesterol or back flux of biocolestral into

903
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:16,480
the liver, further depleting hepatic cholesterol pools, you will get more expression of LDL

904
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:23,120
receptors. So now we have this new Bempedoic acid. It's called an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor.

905
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:30,080
Well, the first step in cholesterol synthesis is citrate, Natomitochondria coming out of the Krebs

906
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:39,280
cycle is transformed to acetyl-CoA, which boom, then goes down and becomes after it becomes HMG

907
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:48,800
and then the subsequent things. So this Bempedoic acid is called an ACL, ATP citrate lyase inhibitor,

908
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:55,600
but it's a prodrug. You swallow it. It's only up taken by the liver and it inhibits an enzyme

909
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:03,760
in the liver that you can't make acetyl-CoA. So hey, the less acetyl-CoA you make, you're going

910
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:09,200
to make less HMG and then therefore that's going to, you'll have less substrate for the statin to

911
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:15,440
add on to. So collectively you get additional APOB lowering. The cool thing is, because one of our

912
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:21,440
biggest downsides to statin is people get these myopathic symptoms, be they weakness muscle aches

913
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:26,800
or whatever, you know that. It's a big problem with statin therapy, probably more prevalent than

914
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:34,480
what clinical trials would show us, but this Bempedoic acid does not have any uptake in the muscle cells.

915
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:40,480
There's a specific receptor that pulls it into the liver. So it is hepato selective. Look,

916
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:46,480
razovastatin is somewhat hepato selective because there is a special cellular receptor that pulls

917
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:51,120
in razovastatin, but other cells can pull it, razovastatin, razovastatin can give you muscle

918
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:57,440
aches. So it's not quite as hepato selective as Bempedoic acid. Do you know what they saw, Tom, in the

919
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,320
trial versus placebo for muscle soreness? Because even PCSK9 inhibitors still had some

920
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:09,760
noise with respect to muscle soreness, even though mechanistically it's not entirely clear why,

921
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:14,880
whereas at least the statin, there's some explanation as to why someone could experience

922
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,960
muscle soreness. I'm just kind of curious as to what the head-to-head... Yeah, no, they did look

923
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:24,080
at that and it's not zero. So there are still people who... But they've also shown studies that

924
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,760
you can give... You give up placebo on your head. ...a placebo and people get muscle aches too.

925
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:33,840
But it's... And they did comparative trials versus a statin versus a placebo, and there is definitely

926
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:39,360
less with it or so, but it's not going to be zero. So it's worth a trial if you're really hung up.

927
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:46,080
So I think right now it's used and the FDA approved it. The FDA says, look, you got to go do a big

928
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:51,840
outcome trial, which the company is doing, but Mendelian randomization suggests it would work.

929
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:56,960
Before we ever had outcome trial with Zetimide, Mendelian randomization data suggests that

930
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,000
reducing cholesterol intestinal absorption would reduce cardiovascular events, and that turned out

931
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:08,640
to be so. So, and they only had to do with a certain amount of phase three safety trial, and

932
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:15,200
the FDA let it come on the market. And its use was you can add it to a statin and people with

933
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:20,400
familial hypercholesterolemia, who the statin probably is not going to get you to go by itself,

934
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:26,000
and you can combine it to that, or even very high risk people where you didn't blow your

935
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,760
LDL-C down to 70 or 50, whatever you're trying to do it. You need a junk of LDL cholesterol,

936
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:38,320
APOB lowering. You can co-prescribe the bempedoic acid. And they also allow you to co-prescribe

937
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:43,200
Zetimide with it. In fact, the company that manufactures this, and the brand name is called

938
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:49,120
Nexitol, they also have been given FDA approval because there are a lot of statin intolerant

939
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:55,600
people out there, or people who need triple LDL lowering therapy, that we're going to give you a

940
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:01,840
combo product, which is bempedoic acid plus Zetimide. I guess it's priced a little cheaper. So rather

941
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,960
than swallowing two pills, you could just take that combo pill. You could add it to a statin or not.

942
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,200
And look, I think for the nightmare of Zetimide, you could ultimately, if you had to add PCSK9

943
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:17,280
inhibitor, the end of the day, if you're good at individualizing your therapy, I think we have

944
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:23,440
four APOB options now a day. And you're going to get down a fairly standard path because not

945
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:28,960
everybody can afford a PCSK9 inhibitor. Not everybody might be at the type of high level

946
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:34,400
risk that the FDA wants you to be at to, or the third party payer wants you to be at.

947
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:39,440
But it's a fun time to be in the APOB world. We have a lot of therapies, and we're not even

948
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:44,000
talking about addressing triglycerides, which there are therapies that do that that might

949
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:51,760
contribute to APOB lowering also. The statin works a lot by the hepatic upregulation of the LDL receptor.

950
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,320
Do we think that's the case here as well? Or do we think that this is

951
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,400
more about the actual reduction of cholesterol synthesis?

952
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,680
But remember, if you inhibit cholesterol synthesis, you're going to do hepaticals of

953
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:10,080
cholesterol, which will through the sterile regulatory element binding protein upregulate

954
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:16,960
LDL receptor expression, perhaps some VLDL receptors or other things like that, APOE receptor.

955
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,480
So at the end of the day, probably depleting hepatic cholesterol pools is what you have to do.

956
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:26,160
It's still its primary driver. So really, at least on some level,

957
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:31,040
bempedoc acid is attractive because it's more hepatic selective, even if it's less potent.

958
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,480
And remind me again, what do we think is the relative potency compared to a statin?

959
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:41,520
If you look at its monotherapy trials, it's like a zetimide. You're going to get anywhere

960
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:49,040
from a 10 to 18 percent lowering of LDL cholesterol by itself, a tad less APOB 10 to 12 percent,

961
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:55,520
if you use it as a monotherapy. As you know, with a zetimide with statins, there's a wide range of

962
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:01,680
responses. I think with all these drugs, there are hyper responders, middle-of-the-road responders,

963
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:09,040
and hypo responders. And I think that probably has a lot to do with how much synthesis of

964
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:15,600
cholesterol, how much absorption of cholesterol, what type of LDL receptors do you make or express.

965
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,440
There's a lot of factors at play, but if you want a generalization, that's what it is.

966
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:25,200
And now you alluded to it, but what do we think about in terms of what's changed in the last

967
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,960
couple of years in terms of our thinking about EPA and DHA specifically?

968
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:35,520
Well, two things, and it's been a long time and nobody has respected triglycerides more than I

969
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:41,280
have been lecturing about triglyceride rich lipoproteins forever. And I knew despite all the

970
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:46,160
nonsense that it doesn't matter what you do to trays, you don't reduce events like you do with LDL

971
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:51,680
cholesterol because of improperly designed trials and enrollment of people who basically didn't have

972
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:58,160
triglyceride issues and giving them triglyceride-lowering drugs. But anyway, we're far enough down

973
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:03,280
the road that not only does the Mendelian randomization trials certainly suggest, look,

974
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,760
there are certain genes that are involved with triglycerides that are seriously involved with

975
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,960
atherosclerosis. So it's very plausible if at least through those mechanisms we improve

976
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,160
triglycerides, you're going to reduce disease. So for the longest time, what was our other than

977
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:24,800
lifestyle? What was our way to lower triglycerides? We had niacin around forever. We had the emerging

978
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:32,400
fibric acid story, which progress, progress, progress until the terribly improvised trials

979
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:37,120
that were done to, let's see if fibrates worked. They didn't give them to anybody who had

980
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:42,720
triglycerides. So of course the fibrate didn't work, but there's always been this, hey, Omega-3s

981
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:50,880
really are a potentially triglyceride-lowering drug, and maybe we should use them. Anybody who's

982
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:57,360
known Bill Harris for the longest time, as I have, you have, no, yes, Omega-3s, if you really want to

983
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:04,160
get triglyceride-lowering from an Omega-3, you better be using serious, serious doses of the,

984
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:09,920
you don't give a gram, you don't give two grams if you want to get rid of triglycerides, or better

985
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:16,480
yet, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. If there are other attributes to Omega-3s, we have no way

986
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:21,680
of measuring that. Now, and there almost certainly are, because, you know, Omega-3s are a crucial

987
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:26,640
part of cell membranes and cell signaling. But if we're just going to deal in our lipid world,

988
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:33,520
and you want to have an Omega-3 on board to help you combat triglyceride-rich lipoproteins,

989
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:40,320
you want to have a maximum dose, which looks to be 4,000 milligrams a day. So this was the

990
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,480
belief, Bill used to always, listen, don't tell me that you gave somebody a thousand

991
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:50,240
milligrams of Omega-3 and you didn't reduce heart attacks. The odds are strong, you could never

992
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:56,960
reduce heart attacks with that drug, you know? So now we got confused, because as we started to

993
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:02,960
realize this, they started to do trials with, okay, let's give four grams of Omega-3s,

994
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:08,160
and let's really not make the fibrate mistake, put them in the drinking water, let's enroll

995
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:13,920
people into these trials who have high triglycerides. Many of those people also have concomitant low

996
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,960
HDL cholesterol, but that necessarily doesn't have to be an entry criteria. But you better have a

997
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,160
triglyceride level above a certain degree, or we're not going to waste our money giving Omega-3s

998
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:29,840
to people with triglycerides of 42. And lo and behold, the first trial that started to come down

999
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:36,000
the pike was done in Japan, so God, probably almost a decade ago, the Japan EPA trial.

1000
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:42,400
You know, Japanese people eat a lot of Omega-3s, so they have higher baseline levels anyway,

1001
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:49,840
so they just gave them, for whatever reason, EPA only, on top of a statin. And they didn't

1002
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:54,320
necessarily have to have high triglycerides, but many of the people did. And lo and behold,

1003
01:41:54,400 --> 01:42:00,640
although it was not a blinded trial, the evidence was pretty good that, wow, this is really plausible,

1004
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:08,400
that EPA at high dose, four grams a day, reduces the macrovascular outcomes when given with a statin,

1005
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:14,560
that of course is working on the LDL metric you're looking at. So, you know, of course,

1006
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,000
people said, aha, that's proving Omega-3s work. Nobody was given a lot of credence, perhaps other

1007
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,320
than the people who produce it, that, oh, this is unique to EPA. Most people are taking Omega-3s,

1008
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:32,480
are taking some combination of EPA and DHA, but as long as you're going to take four grams of that,

1009
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:39,600
why wouldn't it do exactly? So here's what happened. So after that EPA trial, the company

1010
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:48,000
that makes the branded EPA medication, which is VSEPA, Amarin is the company, did a major clinical

1011
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:55,360
trial called REDUCEIT, where they enrolled people with, who were taking whatever statin they had

1012
01:42:55,360 --> 01:43:00,720
to take to get their LDL cholesterol below 70. And in general, these were high risk people. They had

1013
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:05,520
some degree of carny disease or they were full blown diabetics or had a lot of cardiovascular.

1014
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:13,840
So it wasn't a low risk primary prevention type of study. You had to have a triglyceride above 137

1015
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:19,520
to get into that trial. Most people, it was 150, but you know, the triglyceride assay always

1016
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:25,120
varies plus or minus 15 points. So they would let you come in if you had a 137, because they thought

1017
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:30,400
in a week you're going to have 150. So they enrolled people. That was the cutoff. You had to

1018
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:37,120
have that. And lo and behold, and you were maximized on whatever statin it took to get your LDL-C,

1019
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:43,840
under 100 at the time, pretty good. And lo and behold, and we haven't come up with much in the

1020
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:50,560
world so far, at least it has a big trial saying we lower residual risk with a statin.

1021
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:57,600
Azetomide did it in acute carny syndrome survivors to a certain degree, but this high dose EPA,

1022
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:05,040
two grams twice a day with food, because it is an FLSter, theoretically it needs to be de-esterified

1023
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:11,440
before it's absorbed. There was almost a 30% residual risk reduction. That's mind boggling

1024
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:17,360
to be honest after taking a statin. But they would still say, oh, that's fantastic. We all have to

1025
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:23,040
start using omega-3s at the appropriate dose way more than we ever did. But a lot of believers,

1026
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:28,720
and I think probably Bill Harris and myself said, yeah, but we could also just give four grams of

1027
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:35,200
EPA plus DHA, because deep down many of us believe DHA is a pretty important omega-3 fatty

1028
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:39,920
acid too, if for no other reason than your brain needs it. But I believe all cell membranes need

1029
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:46,880
to a certain extent. And not everybody can convert EPA to DHA, although most people probably can.

1030
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:55,280
So, AstraZeneca had acquired a free omega-3 fatty acid, meaning it's not an ethyl ester,

1031
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:01,520
which means it has a better absorption, better pharmacokinetics, more bioavailability. And it

1032
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:09,760
was called epanova, but it was EPA and DHA, but free EPA and free DHA. And they enrolled basically

1033
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:15,200
the same type of people, high triglycerides, maybe the HCL cholesterol is low, at-risk people.

1034
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:21,840
And two years into the study, the company just stopped the study. It's never been published,

1035
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,960
so we don't know. But the reason was its futility. We're not seeing a signal at two

1036
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,360
years that it's going to work. So we're not wasting any more money on this.

1037
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,920
Yeah, this was last November, right, Tom?

1038
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,160
Yeah.

1039
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,160
I got to tell you, this caught everybody off guard, didn't it?

1040
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:38,480
Because-

1041
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,520
Surely caught me.

1042
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:48,080
It was certainly announced that the study was being stopped. And I would say most observers,

1043
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:52,960
myself included, felt, oh, wow, they're stopping it because the signal is so big.

1044
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,560
And then they announced at the cardiology meeting, actually, it stopped because there's no signal.

1045
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,920
I'm a little surprised it hasn't been published yet, are you?

1046
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:07,440
And annoyed, to be honest with you, is there something there hiding that didn't come out in

1047
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:13,680
that press release or the early discussion about it or so? So are there subgroups in there where

1048
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:18,960
maybe, yeah, I understand these trials are super expensive and where they say, hey,

1049
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,840
we're cutting our losses. We'll have to take this out to five or six years before we ever see a

1050
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,320
signal. And I wish they had done that, but it's not-

1051
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:29,920
But then they wouldn't have made the announcement. I mean, I guess to me the thing I'm trying to

1052
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:30,560
understand-

1053
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,560
Well, they would have announced it if they're stopping it.

1054
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,760
Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But if they were going to keep running it,

1055
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,520
they probably wouldn't have made that announcement.

1056
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,240
Oh, no.

1057
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,400
And so the thing that I'm trying to wrestle with, which I shouldn't spend any time on it,

1058
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:48,160
I'll just wait till it comes out, is how much of this is the vehicle versus the EPA-DHA split?

1059
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:53,600
You got to bring Bill Harris back on. Look, technically that should,

1060
01:46:53,600 --> 01:47:01,040
if what we want to do is achieve a certain level of omega-3s in our blood, be it in a red blood cell

1061
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:06,480
or a cell membrane where we would measure the omega-3 index, which they did not measure in the

1062
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:11,760
reducing trial, or whether you just want to reduce plasma free fatty acid levels.

1063
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,760
And by the way, that they did do in the reducing trial, and though it's not been published yet,

1064
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:23,120
it has been presented that the efficacy of the EPA-only product highly depends on the level you

1065
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:28,480
did achieve with a serum. So again, to me, that supports going with four grams a day. Don't think

1066
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:32,960
you can get away with two grams a day, perhaps unless you're really checking the levels,

1067
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:40,880
but even that would be guesswork. So to take home points right now, people ask me, Tom, EPA or EPA-DHA,

1068
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,200
if I want to be evidence-based and you're in that type of risk category, I think you got to go with

1069
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:50,800
EPA four grams a day. What if Trigless rides are below 150? What about the person with Triggs 100

1070
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:57,280
who still has residual APOB risk? Yeah, it's an unanswerable question right now. I'm not afraid to

1071
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:04,240
keep using EPA-DHA. Whatever the magical mystery effects of the EPA are, which is, you know,

1072
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:09,440
are all theoretical at the given moment, and they're checking a lot of biomarkers to try and explain

1073
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:15,920
and it's all winding up in this massive inflammatory world that's maybe to do something or self

1074
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:22,560
signaling world. Yes, but your brain needs some self-signaling from DHA too. So if I'm going to

1075
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:29,760
throw four grams of EPA at you, I, as you know, I'm a big advocate of doing the Omega-3 index.

1076
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:36,640
So if I'm giving you four grams of EPA only, but your Omega-3 index shows me you have adequate DHA

1077
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:42,000
in your system. I know some of that EPA is being converted, so I'm kind of happy. And I don't

1078
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,160
perhaps necessarily have to co-prescribe some degree of DHA with you. My worry would be what

1079
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:53,360
about somebody who's taken the four grams of EPA and the Omega-3 index shows you you're still

1080
01:48:53,360 --> 01:49:00,000
deficient in DHA. Then I think you got to scratch your brain and do what you want to do. And I might

1081
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:07,840
be, hey, let's start giving a little DHA. But I can't buy into the concept that a little bit of

1082
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:13,280
DHA is negating EPA. Maybe that's true. And that's what the EPA purists will tell you.

1083
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:19,200
Well, hopefully we have some published data in the next six months that can at least give us a

1084
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:24,720
hint. I don't think this study had enough in common with reduce it to answer that question,

1085
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:30,400
but I think it could potentially give us a clue. Yeah, and we're getting more and more data.

1086
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:36,000
They're doing additional trials with EPA and they're doing more subtrial analysis. They've even shown

1087
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:41,840
some angiographic data with despite that great reduction residual risk, if you actually look at

1088
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:48,000
plaque, it looks a lot better when you're taking four grams of EPA. So that's pretty encouraging

1089
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:54,800
of that type of study. Anyway, you know about predicting what a plaque image shows an event

1090
01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:01,440
reduction, but good nonetheless. Anything else on the pharmacology side, Tom, that's really

1091
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:06,400
interesting to you, especially in the last couple of years, because I like the way we've sort of

1092
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:11,200
at least tried to bring people up to speed on what the big changes have been.

1093
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:18,080
Listen, I still think fibrates are widely underused drug. I think for the right person where you've,

1094
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:23,600
through whatever method you use, have identified triglyceride rich lipoproteins,

1095
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:28,480
perhaps those where you clearly see insulin resistance, their diabetics, or their insulin

1096
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:35,600
levels are high. That's where the fibrate subtrial analysis shows miraculous things,

1097
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:41,840
not only with macrovascular endpoints, but with microvascular endpoints, retina, peripheral

1098
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:47,680
nervous system, renal function. So even though you might screw up creatinine a little bit,

1099
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:52,960
you're actually improving EGFR because of overproduction of creatinine, which in that

1100
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:59,520
case is not reflective of EGFR. So I think there still is a group of patients right now

1101
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:05,920
where fibric acids, the purest fibric acid, which is an approach drug, is that phenofibric acid

1102
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:11,840
still so is trilypics. So I think if you have to use a fibric acid, if at all possible,

1103
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:18,080
that's the one to use. And the good news is there is a new fibrate, permafibrate,

1104
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:23,840
pammafibrate that's being invested in clinical trials. It's called a SPARM, a Selective P-PAR

1105
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:29,600
Alpha Receptor Modulator, that they're really high on. And there's big outcome trials going

1106
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:35,840
on with that yet. But nobody's going to be using that or thinking about it until those trials are

1107
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:41,760
stopped for good reasons, bad reasons, or published, of course, and get FDA approval.

1108
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:46,160
So I think there's still hope with the fibrates. Niacin is a dead drug. I know there's going to

1109
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:50,800
be a lot of people listening to this who, oh no, it's not. It's out of every guideline. There's

1110
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:54,720
not a single guideline in the world that recommends you can use anything you want if

1111
01:51:54,720 --> 01:52:00,080
you're stuck between a rock and a hard place. And I certainly know there are LP little A advocates.

1112
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:07,440
If you bring Sam on, he will still selectively use niacin in certain cases, but few in the

1113
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:12,080
lipidology world still agree with that. Yeah. And back to your point on trilypics,

1114
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:17,200
we probably have three or four patients on it. And man, it's a world beater. I had one patient who was

1115
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:24,560
probably, I mean, he looked like he had FH and he looked like he also had, of course,

1116
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:30,240
a familial hypertriglyceridemia. I mean, you couldn't distinguish them. And even though you

1117
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:37,760
knew he was going to end up on both a statin and a fibrate at some point, I just out of curiosity

1118
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:42,960
wanted to see what ApoB reduction we'd get starting with just the trilypics. So his trigs were about

1119
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:50,560
400 to begin with. ApoB was over 200. The trilypics took him from a triglyceride of 400

1120
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:56,160
milligrams per deciliter to about a hundred. My memory serves me correctly. And that took the

1121
01:52:56,160 --> 01:53:06,080
ApoB from wherever it was, high 100s, 200 down to somewhere between 80 and 100. So that's monotherapy

1122
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:11,520
of trilypics, which was not the intention, but just in a stepwise progression showed you the potency.

1123
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,920
And unless you're dealing with a super humongous high risk and acute carnitis, I don't think it's

1124
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:21,200
irrational to go down that route. There are plenty of people who you have to bat them over the head

1125
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:25,360
with whatever to convince them to use a statin. And maybe they'll say, well, I believe in

1126
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:28,880
triglycerides. You're giving me a triglyceride. I'll work with you. Well, let's see what the

1127
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:33,760
parameter. Clearly you picked the right person there where it's triglycerides were generating

1128
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:40,640
the ApoB particles and the multi mechanisms on how fibrates reduced triglyceride had a beneficial

1129
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:48,400
effect. I've actually with Peter Jones published data using NMRs on resubastatin and phenofibric

1130
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:54,560
acid. And you, in some people, there were pretty nice reductions in LDL particle counts using

1131
01:53:54,560 --> 01:54:00,160
phenofibrate, always more. But when you looked at the particle analysis, when you were even

1132
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:05,760
combining phenofibric acid with the fibrate or excuse me, with the statin, you got way more

1133
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:11,200
dramatic remnant reductions with the fibrate than you ever did with the statin. So another reason,

1134
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:17,680
and almost certainly that person would trigger 400, there was some contribution from remnants in that

1135
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:24,160
person you would think. So just don't forget fibrates. A tragedy to me or young lipidologists

1136
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:29,280
are not being taught about it. Few of them can give you a dissertation on fibrates and how they

1137
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:34,720
work and what is their trial history. God, there's 40 years of trial history that you can

1138
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:40,240
always garner a little bit from any trial. So I find that sad that it's not even being taught

1139
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:45,120
anymore. And people bad mouthfully condemn it without knowing what they're talking about.

1140
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,760
I always feel lucky to have been trained by dinosaurs.

1141
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:53,760
Well, some of us have been around the block for a few times or so. But you know,

1142
01:54:53,760 --> 01:55:00,160
us old dinosaurs, when we meet you young, brilliant guys, you keep us, if I want to still

1143
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:05,280
talk to this guy, I got to keep up with this stuff. Because I know things I said 10,

1144
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:08,720
15 years ago are silly now, because you got to keep learning. You know that.

1145
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:13,840
Guys like you are really good for me that I just can't rest on my laurels.

1146
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:18,960
Tom, this has been a lot of fun. We were supposed to do this last week and we had some technical

1147
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:23,840
difficulties. So we postponed till this week and I'm glad we did. Because it was worth being able

1148
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,960
to do it and actually be able to look at each other through a screen as opposed to just have

1149
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:32,640
to do it by phone. And so I want to thank you obviously for your continued insight. You make a

1150
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:36,800
great difference in our practice. I guess I should fully disclose to people you are now

1151
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,800
basically full time inside Attia Medical as a practice. You're on the backside of things,

1152
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:48,240
doing mostly research, but we drag you into at least a third of our patient calls and we

1153
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:55,120
always consult with you on all of our cardiovascular cases. So I hope you're also enjoying being

1154
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:59,600
back to clinical medicine somewhat, even though it's at a much lower volume. We certainly enjoy

1155
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:07,440
having you. It's been such a wonderful part of if this is the finish of my career, still being

1156
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:12,560
able to do this. And you know, although I know a lot of this lipid stuff, the basic science,

1157
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:17,360
I've always been what I, I, Mike Davis, was a clinical epidemiologist. None of this lipid

1158
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:22,960
stuff is meaningful if you can't use it at the bedside and make individualized things.

1159
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:29,120
So I'm just thrilled to be able to contribute to you. And I think one day, as you know, I'm trying

1160
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:33,440
to write and generate and put more and more of this into writing, and that will become available to

1161
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:40,480
your followers and subscribers. And so folks, stay tuned for that. And I will say, maybe it's

1162
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:44,640
another podcast and are probably better people than me to talk to. But the one thing we didn't

1163
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:51,760
get into today is the emerging genetic world, genetic analysis of lipoproteins, and specifically

1164
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:58,240
the genetic lipidosis, FH, who needs that type of testing, who doesn't, whatever you discover,

1165
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:04,160
what can you do for it? It's another whole serious podcast. So other than that, thank you for

1166
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:11,280
everything, Peter. Meeting you a long time ago in Reno, Nevada was a big day in my life.

1167
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:17,600
Oh, mine too, Tom. Thanks so much. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.

1168
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:22,000
If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership

1169
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,280
program that allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads.

1170
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:31,760
It's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription.

1171
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:37,200
Now to that end, membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive

1172
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:43,040
podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word

1173
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:49,280
on the street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes,

1174
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:54,320
hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to

1175
01:57:54,320 --> 01:58:00,000
hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short

1176
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,640
podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics,

1177
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:09,280
and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

1178
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:13,200
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1179
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:19,200
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,

1180
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:23,360
and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you
