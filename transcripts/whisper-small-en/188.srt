00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,360
Hey, Bob. How are you, man? Looking pretty studious there in the library today.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,120
Hey, Peter. Thanks very much. Yeah, just getting some reading in before the podcast.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,840
Well, this is going to be a pretty good one because as you may recall about, I don't know,

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,400
four or five months ago, maybe longer, I was on a podcast with Tim Ferriss and I don't know how it

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,960
came up, but I do remember somehow it came up that we had spent a lot of time writing this series,

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:47,400
studying studies and God, that's been four years ago, I think. Yeah. But we didn't really have

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,000
something more digestible for folks on how to make sense of the ever-changing landscape of

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,440
scientific literature and in some ways how to distinguish between the signal and the noise of

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,440
the research news cycle. And I remember after that, Tim and I went out for dinner and he kept

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:13,800
pressing me on, well, what can I do to get better at this process? Are there newsletters I should be

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,160
subscribing to and things like that? And while I'm sure that there are, I didn't know what they were

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,880
off the top of my head. And so I think what we've done here, when I say we, I mean you,

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,720
what you have done here is aggregate all the questions that have come in over the past year,

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,320
basically, that pertain to understanding the structure of science. And I really, I don't know,

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,080
I looked through the questions last week and I was pretty excited. I think it's going to be a

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:50,400
sweet discussion and I hope this serves as an amazing primer for people to really understand

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,680
the process of scientific experiments and everything from how studies are published and

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,640
obviously what some of the limitations are. So anything else you want to add to that, Bob,

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,680
before we jump in? I agree. I think it's a fun topic. We get so many of these questions that we

21
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,520
end up, or at least I do, or to the website where we'll point readers to one of the parts

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,360
of the studying studies. But I think sometimes just talking about it and explaining it can help

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,680
a lot. So I think this will be really useful as far as like a question and answer session rather

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,440
than just reading a blog. Yeah. And I don't think this displaces that other stuff. I think we go

25
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,160
into probably more detail on some things there, but I also think we're going to cover things here

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,440
that aren't covered there. So depending on how you like to get your info, this could be fun. So

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,480
where do you want to start? So I think that we have, again, a lot of questions, but I think this

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,280
question gets to the core of I think what we're trying to do here, which is how can a user or a

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,760
person who has no scientific background better understand studies that they read in the news

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,400
or in the publications to know if the findings are solid or not, especially in today's age,

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,080
where you can easily see two studies that contradict each other. Coffee's good, coffee's bad. Eggs are

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,240
good, eggs are bad. So I thought we could run through a bunch of questions with the first one

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:28,480
that we got here is what is the process for a study to go from an idea to design and execution?

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:41,040
Yeah, it is a great question. I mean, in theory, it should start with a hypothesis. Good science

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:52,040
is generally hypothesis driven. So I think the cleanest way to think about that is to take the

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:01,440
position that there is no relationship between two phenomena. So we would call this sort of a null

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:15,320
hypothesis. So my hypothesis might be that drinking coffee makes your eyes turn darker. So I would have

38
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,400
to state that hypothesis and then I would have to frame it in a way that says my null hypothesis is

39
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:31,280
that when you drink coffee, your eyes do not change in color in any way, shape, or form. And that would

40
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:39,000
imply that the alternative hypothesis is that when you drink coffee, your eyes do change color. You can

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,080
already see, by the way, that there's nuance to this because am I specifying what color it changes

42
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,040
to? Does it get darker? Does it get lighter? Does it change to blue, green? Does it just get the darker

43
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,360
shade of whatever it is? But let's put that aside for a moment and just say that you will have this

44
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,440
null hypothesis and you will have this alternative hypothesis. And to be able to formulate that cleanly

45
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,960
is sort of the first step here. The second thing, of course, is to conduct an experimental design. How

46
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:13,400
are you going to test that hypothesis as we're going to talk about? A really, really elegant way

47
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,040
to test this is using a randomized controlled experiment. If it's possible to blind it, we'll

48
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,600
talk about what that means. But you'll have to decide, well, how long should we make people drink

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,680
coffee? How frequently should they drink coffee? How are we going to measure eye color? These are

50
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,080
the questions that come down to experimental design. You then have to determine a very important

51
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,760
variable, which is how many subjects will you have? And of course, that will depend on a number of

52
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,440
things, including how many arms you will have in this study. But it comes down to doing something

53
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,960
that's called a power analysis. And this is so important that we're going to spend some time

54
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,120
talking about it today, although I won't talk about it right now. If this study involves human

55
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,680
subjects or animal subjects, you will have to get something called an institutional review board to

56
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,240
approve the ethics of the study. So you'll have to get that IRB approval. You'll have to determine

57
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,440
what your primary and secondary outcomes are, get the protocol approved, develop a plan for

58
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,360
statistics, and then pre-register the study. All of these things happen before you do the study. And

59
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,960
of course, in parallel to this, you have to have funding. So those are kind of the steps that go

60
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,800
into doing an experimental study. And what we're going to talk about, I think, in a minute is that

61
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,280
there are some studies that are not experimental where some of these steps are obviously skipped.

62
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,560
Yeah. One of the questions we got was, what are the different types of studies out there? And

63
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,000
what do they mean? For example, an observational study versus a randomized controlled study. What

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,400
are the different types of studies? Yeah. So I mean, I think broadly speaking, you can break

65
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:07,400
studies into three categories. One would be observational studies, and we'll bifurcate those

66
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,920
or trifurcate those in a minute. Then you can have experimental studies, and then you can have

67
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:23,800
basically summations of and or reviews of and or analyses of studies of any type.

68
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:32,680
So let's kind of start at the bottom of that pyramid. And I think you actually have a figure

69
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,560
that I don't like very much, but I know it's- I was going to say, that was one of your favorites.

70
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,720
Yeah, I can't stand it. I'll tell you what I like about the figure. I like the color schema, because

71
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:50,040
my boys are so obsessed with rainbows that if I show them this figure, they're going to be really

72
00:07:50,040 --> 00:08:00,280
happy. So let's pull up said rainbow figure. Okay, got it. Okay, so you can sort of see these

73
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:08,280
buckets here. And again, at the level of kind of talking about them, I think this makes sense. What

74
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,840
I don't agree with the pyramid for Bob is that it puts a hierarchy in place that suggests a meta

75
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,680
analysis is better than a randomized control trial, which is not necessarily true. But let's

76
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,320
just kind of go through what each of these things mean. So looking at the observational studies,

77
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:32,200
an individual case report is, look, I think the first or second paper I ever wrote in my life when

78
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,800
I was in medical school was an individual case report. It was a patient who had come into

79
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:46,120
clinic. This was when I was at the NIH, and this was a patient with metastatic melanoma, and their

80
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,080
calcium was sky high, dangerously high in fact. And obviously our first assumption was that this

81
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,640
patient had metastatic disease to their bone and that they were lysing bone and calcium was

82
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,560
leeching into their bloodstream. Turned out that wasn't the case at all. It turned out they had

83
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,680
something that had not been previously reported in patients with melanoma, which was they had

84
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:18,280
developed this parathyroid hormone related like hormone in response to their melanoma.

85
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,360
So this is a hormone that exists normally, but it doesn't exist in this format. And so their cancer

86
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,440
was causing them to have more of this hormone that was causing them to raise their calcium level.

87
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,920
It was interesting because it had never been reported before in the literature. And so I wrote

88
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,640
this up. This was an individual case report. Is there any value in that? Sure. There's some value

89
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,600
in that. The next time a patient with melanoma shows up to clinic and their calcium is sky high

90
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,680
and someone goes to the literature to search for it, they'll see that report and it will hopefully

91
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,200
save them time in getting to the diagnosis. So your mentor and friend, Steve Rosenberg,

92
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,560
I think of him when I think of individual case reports where I think if you listen to the podcast,

93
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,400
he talks about this, but a lot of what motivated him early on, I think we're just a couple of

94
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,800
cases in it. I think it gets back to that first question too about the process for a study to go

95
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,720
to an idea to design to execution, which is to have a hypothesis, you need to make an observation.

96
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,400
So you make an observation, you say, hmm, that's strange. And I think that that's what individual

97
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,840
case reports can represent sometimes is this is an interesting observation. It's hypothesis

98
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,200
generating for the most part, but it really, it might kickstart a larger trial or it might

99
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,520
kickstart a career. You never know. Yeah, exactly. Now, of course, it's not going to be

100
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:52,760
generalizable, right? I can't make any statement about the frequency of this in the broader subset

101
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,160
of patients. And obviously, I can't make any comment about any intervention that may or may not

102
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,080
change the outcome of this. So that gets us to our next thing, which is a case series

103
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:16,200
or set of studies. So here you're basically doing the same sort of thing, but in plural, effectively.

104
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,000
So you wouldn't just look at one patient, you would say, well, I've now been looking back at my

105
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,920
clinical practice and I've had 27 patients over the last 40 years that have demonstrated this very

106
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,840
unusual finding. And another example of this going back to the Steve Rosenberg case would be

107
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,960
one could write a paper that looks at all spontaneous regressions of cancer.

108
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,040
Well, there's obviously been a number of them. They're infrequent. In fact, they're exceedingly

109
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,920
rare, but there are certainly enough of them that one could write a case series. So now let's

110
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,320
consider cohort studies. So cohort studies are larger studies and they can be retrospective or

111
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,440
they can be prospective. So I'll give you an example of both. So a retrospective observational

112
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:21,640
cohort study would be like, let's go back and look at all the people who have used saunas for the last

113
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:31,480
10 years and look at how they're doing today relative to people who didn't use saunas over

114
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,720
the last 10 years. So it's retrospective. We're looking backwards. It's observational. We're not

115
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,320
doing anything, right? We're not telling these people to do this or telling those people to do

116
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,080
that. And the hope when you do this is that you're going to see some sort of pattern. Undoubtedly,

117
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,720
you will see a pattern. Of course, the question is, will you be able to establish causality in

118
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:01,160
that pattern? Cohort studies can just as easily, although more time-consumingly, be prospective.

119
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:10,120
So you could say, I want to follow people over the next five years, 10 years who use saunas and

120
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,320
compare them to a similar number of people who don't. And now in a forward-looking fashion,

121
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,000
we're going to be examining the other behaviors of these people and ultimately what their outcomes

122
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
are. Do they have different rates of death, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

123
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,920
other metrics of health that we might be interested in? Again, we're not intervening.

124
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,920
There's not an experiment per se. We're just observing, but now we're doing it as we march

125
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,640
forward through time. Okay. So this brings us to the next layer of this pyramid, which are the

126
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,920
experimental studies. And again, we divide these into randomized versus non-randomized. And of

127
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,440
course, this idea of randomization is going to be a very important one as we go through this.

128
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:06,920
So a non-randomized trial sometimes gets referred to as an open label trial where you take two groups

129
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,560
of people and you give one of them a treatment and you give the other one either a placebo or

130
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,520
a different treatment, but you don't randomize them. There's a reason that they're in that group.

131
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:27,560
So you might say, we want to study the effect of a certain antibiotic on a person that comes in the

132
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:36,120
ER and we're going to take all the people that come in who look a certain way, maybe they have

133
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,400
a fever of a certain level or a white blood cell count of a certain level, and we're going to give

134
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,040
them the antibiotic and the people who come in, but they don't have those exact signs or symptoms,

135
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,680
we're going to not give an antibiotic to and we're going to follow them. That's kind of a lame example.

136
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,520
You could do the same sort of thing with surgical interventions. We're going to try to ask the

137
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:05,240
question, is surgery better than antibiotics for appendicitis or suspected appendicitis?

138
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,560
But we don't randomize the people to the choice. There's some other factor that is going to

139
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,880
determine whether or not we do that. And as you can see, that's going to have a lot of limitations

140
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,080
because presumably there's a reason you're making that decision and that reason will undoubtedly

141
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,000
introduce bias. So of course, the gold standard that we always talk about is a randomized control

142
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:35,800
trial where whatever question you want to study, you study it, but you attempt to take all bias

143
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,160
out of it by randomly assigning people into the treatment groups, the two or more treatment groups.

144
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,760
We'll talk about things like blinding later because you can obviously get into more and more

145
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,640
rigor when you do this. But before we leave the kind of experimental side, anything you want to

146
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,880
add to that, Bob? I would add some non-randomized controlled trials, maybe another example. I'm trying

147
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,560
to think of another example, which is you have patients maybe making a decision beforehand,

148
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,240
which we'll get into selection bias. But people might want to go on a statin, let's say, and then

149
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,560
you give them a choice. And the other ones might want to go on some other drug like azetimibe.

150
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,040
And they're basically selecting themselves into two groups, but you could compare those two groups

151
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,840
and see how they do, but it hasn't been randomized. There's a lot of bias that can go into that. There

152
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,720
could be a lot of reasons why one group is selecting a particular treatment over the other.

153
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,640
And so that's what I think when we get to randomized trials that it shows the power

154
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,520
of randomization. Yeah, exactly. We don't need to go back to the figure, but people might recall

155
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,920
that at the top of that pyramid was systemic reviews and meta-analyses. Let's just talk about

156
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,360
meta-analyses since they are probably the most powerful. So this is a statistical technique

157
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,440
where you can combine data from multiple studies that are attempting to look at the same question,

158
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:11,320
basically. So each study gets a relative weighting. And the weighting of a study is

159
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,720
sort of a function of its precision. It depends a little bit on sample size,

160
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,760
other events in the study. Larger studies, which have smaller standard errors, are given more weight

161
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,240
than smaller studies with larger standard errors, for example. A very common way that these...

162
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,600
You'll know you're looking at a meta-analysis. We should have had a figure for this, but

163
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,320
I'll describe it the best I can. They usually have a figure somewhere in there that will show

164
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,320
across rows all of the studies. So let's say there's 10 studies included in the meta-analysis.

165
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:51,720
And then they'll have the hazard ratios for each of the studies. So they'll represent them usually

166
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,600
as little triangles. So the triangle will represent the 95 percent confidence interval

167
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,280
of what the hazard ratio is, which we'll talk about a hazard ratio, but it's

168
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,000
basically a marker of the risk. And you'll see all 10 studies, and then they'll show you the final

169
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,080
summation of them at the bottom, which of course you wouldn't be able to deduce looking at the

170
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,520
figure, but it takes into account that mathematical weighting. So on the surface, meta-analyses seem

171
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:26,680
really, really great, right? Because if one randomized trial is good, 10 must be better.

172
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,320
But again, and I know I've said this before probably three or four times over the past few

173
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,240
years on the podcast, but as James Yang, one of the smartest people I ever met when I was

174
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,640
both a student and fellow at NCI, once said during a journal club about a meta-analysis

175
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,200
that was being presented, he said something to the effect of a thousand sows ears makes not a

176
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,680
pearl necklace. And that's just an eloquent way to say that garbage in, garbage out, right? So

177
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,440
if you do a meta-analysis of a bunch of garbage studies, you get a garbage meta-analysis. So

178
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:11,320
it can't clean garbage. It simply can aggregate it. So a meta-analysis of great randomized control

179
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,200
trials will produce a great meta-analysis. So I'm sure they try to control for garbage,

180
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,240
the researchers and the investigators, but I think to your point with the pearl necklace,

181
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,640
imagine if you had say 10 trials and nine of them are garbage. One of them is really good,

182
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,800
really rigorous randomized controlled trial. And you're looking at the top of the pyramid and

183
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,560
you're saying, well, meta-analysis is the best. We should be looking at this meta-analysis.

184
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,280
Meanwhile, you've got that one randomized controlled trial that actually is worth its

185
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,080
salt. It's rigorous, et cetera, that I would say if you had the option, I think you probably would

186
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,120
rely more on that one randomized controlled trial, which is lower on the pyramid. So I think that's

187
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,600
probably, I think you've told me one of your hang ups with the pyramid because it's not

188
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,960
necessarily top of the pyramid is going to be some meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

189
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:08,280
That's right. Yeah. And so I don't want to suggest meta-analyses are not great. What I want to suggest

190
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,760
is you can't just take a meta-analysis as gospel without actually looking at each study. You don't

191
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,680
get a pass at examining each of the constitutive studies within a meta-analysis is really the point

192
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:27,400
I think we want to make here. Yeah. There's one thing in here that isn't represented, but we had

193
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,280
a few questions about it, I think a couple. People were asking about what's the difference between a

194
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,800
phase three and a phase two or a phase one clinical trial? Do you know what's going on there?

195
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes. And these are great questions. So here we're talking about human clinical trials and this

196
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:53,720
phraseology is used by the FDA here in the United States. And typically, the world does

197
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,720
tend to follow and lock step, but not always with kind of the FDA's process. So if you go way, way,

198
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:09,880
way back, you have an interesting idea. You have a drug that you think is or a molecule that you

199
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:19,960
think will have some benefit. Let's think of it as a cancer therapeutic. And you've done some

200
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,760
interesting experiments in animals and you maybe started with some mice and you went up to some

201
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,800
rats and maybe even you've done something in primates. And now you're really sort of committed

202
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,240
to this as the success of this and the safety of this in animals looks good. So it's both safe

203
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,240
and efficacious in animals and you now decide you want to foray into the human space. Well,

204
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,680
the first thing you have to do is file for something called an IND, an investigational

205
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:55,080
new drug application. So after you do all of this preclinical work, you have to file this IND with

206
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:02,680
the FDA and that basically sets your intention of testing this as a drug in humans. And the first

207
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:10,520
phase of that, which is called phase one is geared specifically to dose escalate this drug

208
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:18,040
from a very, very low level to determine what the toxicity is across a range of doses that

209
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:25,080
will hopefully have efficacy. So these are typically very small studies, usually less

210
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,840
than a hundred people and they're typically done in cohorts. So you might say, well, the first,

211
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,920
you know, 12 people are going to be at 0.1 milligrams per kilogram. And assuming we see no

212
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,200
adverse effects there, we'll go up to 0.15 milligrams per kilogram for the next 12 people.

213
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:51,400
And if we have no issues there, we'll escalate it to 0.25. Now you'll notice, Bob, I said nothing

214
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,800
in there about does the drug work, right? So these are going to be patients with cancer. If this is

215
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,440
a drug that's being sought as a treatment for colon cancer, these are going to be patients that

216
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,160
all have colon cancer. They're often going to be patients who have metastatic colon cancer,

217
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:14,920
right? So these are going to be patients who have progressed through all other standard treatments

218
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,200
and who are basically saying, look, sign me up for this clinical trial. I realize that this first

219
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,760
phase is not going to be necessarily giving me a high enough dose that I could experience a benefit

220
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,880
and that you're really only looking to make sure that this drug doesn't hurt me,

221
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,280
but nevertheless, I want to participate in this trial. So if the drug gets through phase one

222
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:48,200
safely, then it goes to phase two. And the goal of phase two is to continue to evaluate for safety,

223
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:55,640
but also to start to look for efficacy. But this is done in an open label fashion. What that means

224
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:03,240
is they're not randomizing patients to one drug versus the other typically. They can, but usually

225
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,760
it's now we think we know one or two doses that are going to produce efficacy. They were deemed

226
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:18,280
safe in the phase one. We're now going to take patients and give them this drug and look for an

227
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,640
effect. And a lot of times if there's no control arm in the study, you're going to compare to the

228
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,000
natural history. So let's assume that we know that patients with metastatic colon cancer have,

229
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,520
on standard of care, have, you know, immediate survival of X months. Well, we're going to give

230
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,280
these patients this drug and see if that extends it anymore. And of course you could do this with

231
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,000
a control arm, but now it adds the number of patients to the study. So again, typically very

232
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,960
small studies can be, you know, in the 20, 30, 40, 50 range, maybe up to a few hundred people.

233
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,800
And that one Peter, I think is a probably a good example of if you have the non-randomization,

234
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,480
this might be a case where say it's an immunotherapy and people know about the

235
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,120
immunotherapy and it's been really effective for a particular gets approved for a particular cancer,

236
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,120
let's say. And there are a lot of people that know about it and there are cancer patients that

237
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,880
know about it and they want to get that treatment, but it's not approved. If they're talking to their

238
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,080
doctor, they, or maybe they're online, they might enroll in one of these trials because they really

239
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,920
want to try the drug and maybe they, you know, they might believe in it more than some other

240
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:29,080
treatment. Yeah. Yeah. There are lots of things that can introduce bias to a phase two if it does

241
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,480
not have randomization. Again, the goal would be to still randomize in phase two because you really

242
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:44,840
do want to tease out efficacy. So if a study, if a compound succeeds in phase two, which means

243
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,080
it continues to show no significant adverse safety effects, which by the way, it doesn't mean it

244
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,320
doesn't have side effects, right? Every treatment has side effects. It's just that it doesn't have

245
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,280
side effects that are deemed unacceptable for the risk profile of the patient and it shows

246
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,160
efficacy. So really you have to have these two things. You then proceed to phase three

247
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,760
and here a phase three is a really rigorous trial. This is a huge step up. It's typically a

248
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,520
log step up in the number of patients. So you'd, you know, you're talking potentially thousands

249
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:29,720
of patients here. Um, and this is absolutely a placebo controlled trial or not necessarily

250
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,120
placebo, but it can be sort of standard of care versus standard of care plus this new agent,

251
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,400
but it is randomized whenever possible. It is blinded and with drugs, that's always possible.

252
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:50,280
And these are typically longer studies. Uh, so, so now because you have so much more sample size,

253
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,160
you're going to potentially pick up side effects that weren't there in the first place. And of

254
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,000
course now you really have that gold standard for measuring efficacy. And it's on the basis of the

255
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,840
phase one phase two and mostly phase three data that a drug will get approved or not approved

256
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:13,960
for broad use, which leads to a fourth phase, which is a post-marketing study. So phase four

257
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:21,560
studies take place after the drug has been approved and they're used to basically get

258
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,040
additional information because once a drug is approved, you now have more people taking it.

259
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,120
And they may also be using this to look at other indications for the drug. So we talked about this

260
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,960
recently, right? A phase four trial, um, with semaglutide being used to look at obesity, uh,

261
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,160
versus its original phase three trials, which were looking at diabetes. So kind of, that's a,

262
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,240
the drug's already been approved. This study isn't being done to ask the questions. Should

263
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,800
semaglutide be on the market? No, it's on the market. It's basically expanding the indication

264
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,840
for semaglutide in this case, so that insurance companies would actually pay for it for a new

265
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,720
indication. But given the size and the number of these studies, you're also looking for, hey,

266
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,160
is there another side effect here that we've missed in the phase three? Right. And it might be the,

267
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,640
the particular population that might have a different risk profile so that you might,

268
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,520
you might have a different threshold. That's right. Because you're not doing this in patients

269
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,200
with type two diabetes. You're doing this in patients who explicitly don't have diabetes,

270
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,120
but have obesity. Ah, you know, different patients. Kind of, we're going to see something

271
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,880
different here. So yeah. So, um, anyway, that's, that's the, that's the long and short of phases

272
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:37,160
one, two, three, and four. Okay. So going back to observational studies, are there any things that

273
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,160
you look for in particular that, that will increase or decrease your confidence in it,

274
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,800
whether the bits of pearl necklace or, or garbage. Thank you for listening to today's sneak peek

important for those of you who haven't heard all of the back episodes, it becomes a great way to go

284
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,240
back and filter and decide which ones you want to listen to in detail, really steep discount codes

285
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,600
for products I use and believe in, but for which I don't get paid to endorse and benefits that we

286
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,480
continue to add over time. If you want to learn more and access these member only benefits,

287
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,120
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Lastly, if you're already a member,

288
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,120
but you're hearing this, it means you haven't downloaded our member only podcast feed where

289
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,080
you can get the full access to the AMA and you don't have to listen to this. You can download

290
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:15,000
that at PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash members. You can find me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook,
