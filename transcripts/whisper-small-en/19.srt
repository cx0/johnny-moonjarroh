00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,420
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,420
at PeterAttiaMD.com.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:45,920
Hey everyone, before introducing today's guest, a couple of housekeeping issues.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,080
First if you're enjoying the podcast and you'd like to wake up Sunday mornings to what I

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,240
promise is a non-lame email on what I've been up to and the most interesting papers I've

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,280
read or some other relevant insight, please sign up for my weekly email at PeterAttiaMD.com.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,000
Secondly, if you have any questions on the papers, topics, or people, or anything that

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,080
we discuss on the podcast, be sure to check out the show notes which are at my website.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
My team puts a ton of work into doing this and we've been getting great feedback on just

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
how robust they are.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,880
So I want to make sure that people know it's out there if in fact you finish a podcast

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,700
and you're like, God, that was a little over my head in this area or what were they talking

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
about here?

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,280
Pretty much anything that's discussed on the podcast is going to be found in more detail

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
there.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,480
So head on over there.

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,200
If that's something that interests you, certainly today's podcast will provide an opportunity

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
to test that.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,440
Third, if you're enjoying the podcast, it would be an honor if you would head over to

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Apple Podcast and leave a review.

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,720
If you don't like the podcast, I guess you can leave a review also, but I'm probably

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,240
not going to ask you to spend as much time doing so.

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,080
All right, on to today's guest.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,000
Now this is going to be a slightly longer introduction than normal.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Apologies in advance.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,360
If you positively, absolutely don't want to hear it, just skip ahead, I don't know, five

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,660
minutes or so.

36
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,540
If you're a low-carb enthusiast, you've undoubtedly heard about Dave Feldman and his cholesterol

37
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,480
drop protocol and his take on what he calls lean mass hyper-responders or people who go

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,700
on ketogenic or low carbohydrate diets see a very high LDL cholesterol and or LDL particle

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
number.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,820
You've probably also heard that Dave is somewhat skeptical of the LDL is causal paradigm or

41
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
thinking in atherosclerosis.

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,380
So you're probably going to understand that out of the gate, Dave, and I don't really

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,820
see eye to eye on the genesis of heart disease.

44
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,900
We go right into the conversation assuming people know the background.

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,220
The reason for that is I knew that this was going to be a long enough discussion anyway,

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,540
and I'd already heard Dave on a number of other podcasts present his model and his observations.

47
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,940
So I thought rather than recapitulate those things here, we would link to those previous

48
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,340
shows of which there are at least two or three, including a couple of presentations on YouTube

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,140
so that you can kind of watch those if you're not already familiar with Dave's hypotheses.

50
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,540
I do recommend that you familiarize yourself with these because as I said, I didn't really

51
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,540
make the time in this episode for Dave to go into the depth that he would normally go

52
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,540
into.

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,860
And again, that wasn't out of any reason other than I knew that we were going to have enough

54
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,780
to talk about without that, and I didn't want to reproduce or recreate the wheel, so to

55
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
speak.

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,980
Now, I believe Dave is putting up a companion blog post for this episode, so if you head

57
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,760
on over to his site, which is cholesterolcode.com, he will undoubtedly have his own links and

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,220
show notes and that will probably on some level overlap with what we do, but also probably

59
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,780
provide some new information.

60
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,500
Now we've got a kind of a special treat on this as well, which is Tom Dayspring, who

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,060
if you don't know who Tom is, you certainly will by the next week or so because Tom is

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,740
kind of my foremost lipid mentors.

63
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,020
And I wanted him to make sure that anything that Dave and I said that wasn't accurate

64
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,180
was sort of corrected.

65
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,820
So he's actually taken a look at the transcript of this, which we usually pull together for

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,820
episodes and he's kind of weighed in with some commentary, mostly clarifying and elaborating

67
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,220
on some technical stuff, but even as I said, correcting any mistakes that we've made.

68
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,940
So hopefully Tom's clarifications to the transcript will be valuable to those who want to kind

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,420
of get on the next level of detail.

70
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,540
Show notes will have lots of links to graphics that help conceptualize some of these topics

71
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
we get into.

72
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,060
I mean, a lot of the time that Dave and I were talking, we were looking at diagrams

73
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,980
and pointing things out and so we hope to reproduce that for you.

74
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,420
Now before jumping into this episode, I do want to provide my summary and synthesis of

75
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,260
where I've landed in my own mind when all was said and done.

76
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,660
I think I came into this with a point of view and I think I left with a slightly different

77
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,780
point of view.

78
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,540
I think that it's actually kind of hard maybe to follow the logic in my mind as I go through

79
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
the episode.

80
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,100
So I thought in the days after we recorded this, which was in July this year, 2018, that

81
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,320
I would sort of just put my thoughts down and sort of crystallize them.

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,820
So again, kind of an unusual thing to do, but I do think that this is a complicated

83
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,380
enough topic that it's helpful.

84
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,300
Ultimately, I am not convinced by Dave's model.

85
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,300
And again, truthfully, I came into this maybe 20% thinking that there was a chance I would

86
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,140
find the argument convincing, but I left with that number being a lot less and I'll explain

87
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
why.

88
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,140
There are basically three reasons.

89
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,540
The first is Dave was unable to explain to me the mass balance, meaning how does one

90
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,620
account for the greater amount of cholesterol in and the greater number of the LDL particles?

91
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,380
Now it's possible that at the time of this podcast being released, Dave has given more

92
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,180
thought to the questions I posed and has an answer for that.

93
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,900
But no one, including Dave, is disputing that the phenotype of interest has more LDL cholesterol

94
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,580
and more LDL particles.

95
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,700
So therefore, there's only three ways this can happen.

96
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,100
And these three ways are collectively exhaustive, but not mutually exclusive.

97
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,260
First you can make more cholesterol.

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,540
Second, you can clear less cholesterol.

99
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,580
And third, you can transfer cholesterol from other pools that we didn't see previously

100
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,500
such as cell membranes into pools that we now look at, such as the lipoprotein.

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I think the data makes the first of these cases by far the most likely, but Dave seemed

102
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,260
unable to address why that would be the case.

103
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:21,060
And therefore, what could possibly account for this increase in the LDL-P and the LDL-C?

104
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,940
So on first principles, my doubt of the model has gone up from where we started the discussion

105
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,700
to where we are now, because the person who developed the model wasn't able to really

106
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,820
articulate to me one of the most fundamental tenets of any physical model, which is it

107
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
must respect mass balance.

108
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,200
Now to be clear, even if this fundamental condition were met, it would not be sufficient

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,940
to make the case that this phenotype is not at risk.

110
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,620
It would be at best a necessary but not sufficient criteria.

111
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,380
So in addition to not being able to really explain the mass balance of how these additional

112
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,180
molecules of cholesterol show up in the LDL particles, the second thing that I found difficult

113
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:12,240
to reconcile was that Dave argued that VLDL production was driving the LDL concentration.

114
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,220
But the fact remains that in insulin-sensitive people, which presumably this phenotype that

115
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,940
he's referring to are, it's actually the opposite that is true.

116
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,620
There were fewer, not more triglycerides being exported from the liver, and there was

117
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,020
less, not more ApoC3 on the VLDL particles.

118
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,260
This would actually reduce, not increase, their residence time.

119
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,340
In other words, these so-called lean mass hyper-responders would actually have less VLDL

120
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,340
to LDL conversion than say someone with type 2 diabetes.

121
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,540
And I even point out in this discussion that even the person with type 2 diabetes does

122
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,060
not have nearly as much VLDL as we might think they do.

123
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,420
So I really see no evidence whatsoever from this energy model, which is I believe the

124
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,100
terminology Dave uses, that we could explain this phenotype on the balance of triglyceride

125
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,940
export through VLDL to LDL.

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,780
The third point that I still was not able to fully come to grips with was that basically

127
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,060
even if you ignore the first two points I've made, which I would argue you can't, I'm still

128
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,220
unconvinced at this notion that we should exclude the roughly 2,000 genetic mutations

129
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,600
that are known to produce a phenotype of high LDL, high HDL, and low triglyceride.

130
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,820
These are called natural experiments, and we have, as I said, about 2,000 of such these

131
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,460
natural experiments.

132
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,340
And surely at least some of these cases, for example the PCSK9 gain of functions, are excellent

133
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,580
proxies for the key features of these lean mass hyper-responders.

134
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,860
And yet to ignore them for reasons that are not at all based in our understanding of the

135
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,260
physiology of this disease, for example the PCSK9 hyper-functions somehow having toxic

136
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,900
endothelium reactions in response to this inability, or impaired ability to take up

137
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,820
cholesterol despite there being no evidence of that being true because there's no evidence

138
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,180
that PCSK9 hyper-functioning patients use an LDL receptor to take up cholesterol into

139
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,060
their endothelial cells, is to basically say that one doesn't want to know the answer to

140
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
this question.

141
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,820
Now I believe Dave is about as intellectually honest as anybody is in this space, and I've

142
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,500
made no secret of my general disdain for the groups of folks that claim that LDL is not

143
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,420
causal in atherosclerosis.

144
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,220
None of this is to suggest that I can be entirely certain that folks of this phenotype with

145
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,600
very high LDL are absolutely at increased risk for atherosclerosis, or to state that

146
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,880
more technically that their risk for atherosclerosis is commensurate with their lipid profile.

147
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,600
I don't know that, and ultimately I don't think we'll ever really know that.

148
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,200
Nothing that Dave or I discussed could ever definitively make that case for the reasons

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,540
that make this study of lipids challenging.

150
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,880
Science is based on skepticism, and certainty is forever elusive, so science gets better

151
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,480
and gets sharper through this type of discussion.

152
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,000
But that said, a body of evidence produces a probability of accuracy, and in the end,

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,120
the probability of one idea here seems disproportionately higher than the other.

154
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,960
As I said, coming into this discussion, I thought the probability that Dave's ideas

155
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,040
were correct was quite low, but following this discussion, I feel, I would say, of a

156
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,080
higher degree of confidence that his hypothesis is not correct.

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,240
In other words, my confidence in the probability of his hypothesis being correct has gone down

158
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,760
based on these three points I raise above.

159
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,280
The idea of probability is the new ones that's missing from this discussion, and that's what

160
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,240
troubles me, I guess, is that people think that we're dealing with a disease that has

161
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,200
one and only one risk factor, when in reality we know that atherosclerosis is incredibly

162
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,960
complicated and is impacted by many things beyond the lipoproteins.

163
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,480
But that doesn't diminish their role in the causality of atherosclerosis.

164
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,420
In the end, I would ask you to make up your own mind, because ultimately anyone who's

165
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,240
listening to this, whose LDL is through the roof as a result of going on a ketogenic or

166
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,640
low carbohydrate diet, has to make a decision for themselves.

167
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,040
I hope that what Dave and I have discussed here allows you to make a slightly more informed

168
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,360
decision than you could have made before, and some of the other guests that I have already

169
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,520
had on this podcast, including Ron Krause or those that will be on the podcast, including

170
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,080
next week's guest Tom Dayspring, will allow you to further think through those issues.

171
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,560
So without further delay, and with apologies for how long this intro took, welcome to this

172
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,760
episode with Mr. Dave Feldman.

173
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,080
Hey Dave, welcome to San Diego.

174
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,780
Thanks for having me, Peter.

175
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,240
You're here for a conference, is that correct?

176
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,680
That's right, Low Carb USA.

177
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:55,000
Got it, that would explain all of the low carb folks that seem to be in town this weekend.

178
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,880
How many are going to end up showing up here?

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:04,240
None, I'm actually leaving very early tomorrow to go to New York, so I will be missing this.

180
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm either deeply honored or very scared right now.

181
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,200
No, I actually was going to try to talk to one other person too, but they bailed on me

182
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,480
and took a better offer.

183
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,880
This is going to be a bit of a different episode, Dave, in the sense that I think this will

184
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,880
be even by the standards of this podcast, perhaps a bit more technical at times, and

185
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,640
I think this will probably be a podcast where you and I have already spoken offline.

186
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,320
I suspect a lot of what we discuss will need to be included in show notes because there's

187
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,840
just going to be so much visual stuff, there's so much data we're going to be talking about,

188
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,080
and some of it's just quite graphical in nature, which is not to be confused with graphic.

189
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,200
We will apologize in advance that this might be one of those shows when you're going to

190
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,300
probably get the most out of it sitting in front of your computer, but nevertheless, hopefully,

191
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,480
we can certainly get some interesting stuff out of the way.

192
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,660
I've been trying to think about how to set the stage for this because I think it's safe

193
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,680
to say many people listening to this don't know who you are and don't know what we're

194
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,560
going to be talking about or why we're even having this discussion.

195
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,940
I'm going to take a small liberty of trying to synthesize some of what I've heard you

196
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,280
say in the past, but then turn it over to you to clarify it and put it in context.

197
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,380
From my standpoint, I think you're one of the more thoughtful people on what I would

198
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,620
call the LDL is not necessarily causal in heart disease camp.

199
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,900
Certainly there's a number of people out there for various different reasons who have argued

200
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:38,140
that the causality of low-density lipoprotein and atherosclerosis is not a foregone conclusion.

201
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:44,380
In fact, there may be a subset of people in whom it's not quite relevant.

202
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,220
What you and I have done over the years is had email exchanges and things like that,

203
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,740
and you've been very curious.

204
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,740
You've done a lot of self-experimentation, which you won't find a more sympathetic audience

205
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,820
for self-experimentation than me.

206
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,180
I think in large part we want to explore some of the deep lipidology around these ideas,

207
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,140
but ultimately it comes back to a question.

208
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,480
This is, I think, the question that at least if I'm going to be selfish is the question

209
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,940
I care about, which is today I have to make a decision.

210
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,140
I mean that literally, meaning at five o'clock this morning I had a call with a patient.

211
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,180
Luckily he was in a different time zone, but we had to make a decision about his lipids.

212
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,280
I will have three more interactions with patients today, of which two will center around the

213
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,780
same discussion.

214
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,020
Ultimately decisions have to be made about how to manage dyslipidemia, and most decisions

215
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,380
have to be made with incomplete information.

216
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,680
I certainly don't have any expectation that we will emerge from this discussion knowing

217
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,100
an answer, but nevertheless hopefully we'll have clarified a few things.

218
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,820
Before I go any further, Dave, if someone were asking you what are you known for with

219
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,700
respect to this, so you can probably juggle five tennis balls simultaneously or something

220
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,100
else, but with respect to this discussion, how does the low-carb community kind of describe

221
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
you?

222
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,620
Well, in many of them right now would describe me as a lipid expert.

223
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,740
The irony is that I actually push off that reputation to some degree.

224
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,700
I'm not a formally trained biochemist.

225
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,140
I'm not a medical professional.

226
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,660
I regularly feel like I need to emphasize that.

227
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:28,820
In fact, I think that your series, Straight Dope on Cholesterol, was probably a way for

228
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,540
a lot of people, myself included, to kind of short circuit a lot of the formal education

229
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,860
that typically one would have to go through through university to get to really the general

230
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,620
concepts of lipoproteins and how they work within the system.

231
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,260
What got me to this place, going a little bit backward, is that I went on a low-carb

232
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,260
diet and now this story is fairly ubiquitous.

233
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,260
You hear it a lot.

234
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,620
A number of people, myself included, saw their cholesterol rise substantially.

235
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,380
After that happened, yes, per what you just talked about, I started doing enormous amounts

236
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,620
of self-experimentation and I started elucidating a pattern and part of what motivated me to

237
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:14,580
do that was that even though I had very little training on the medical side, I did have a

238
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,700
lot on the network side as a software engineer.

239
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,620
I saw a pattern that looked very familiar to me.

240
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,020
Without getting into a lot of geeky terminology, if there happens to be any software engineers

241
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,540
listening, you'll probably be familiar with this term.

242
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,340
It's called dependency injection.

243
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,940
It's something that gets involved with networks of distributed objects.

244
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,700
I saw that with lipoproteins, which you talked about at length in the Straight Dope on Cholesterol.

245
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,700
If I can, by the way, interject just this one thing.

246
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,980
Thank you for making that series.

247
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,580
I know I'm not the only person listening right now who would say that it really was a light

248
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,140
during a very dark time.

249
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,500
From that, this whole journey began.

250
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,940
Weirdly, I went from being a fairly well-paid software engineer to a poor, interval one

251
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,380
test, definitely tackling just exactly how far I could take moving around my cholesterol.

252
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,540
I'm going to make an outrageous claim.

253
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,900
I couldn't do it this week because I have too many things going on, but I had always

254
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,180
fantasized about the possibility of having a conversation with you and given where I'm

255
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,620
out on the research now saying, I would like you to write down a number between 100 and

256
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
350.

257
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,460
Then once you do, in about a week's time, I'm going to move my LDLC cholesterol to that

258
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,460
number plus or minus 20 mg per deciliter.

259
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,420
I think that would have been a lot of fun.

260
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,540
Maybe we'll get a chance to do that in the future.

261
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,980
The bottom line is I feel as if I've come across enough with my own mapping of my own

262
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,180
metabolism that I found how I can move LDLC cholesterol and LDLC particle count up and

263
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:56,700
down without medication or supplements by finding what I believe to be the primary influencer,

264
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,860
which is the energy metabolism, especially that of fatty acid utilization for energy.

265
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,140
I think the other thing we'll want to make sure listeners have done by this point, if

266
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,860
they want to get really deep on the understanding of this, is probably go back and listen to

267
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,260
at least one, but potentially two or three of the other podcasts you've been on.

268
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,380
You've been interviewed a number of times.

269
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,180
I've had the privilege of listening to several of them, which is what helped me get more

270
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,180
up to speed on some of your arguments.

271
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:36,140
I think rather than just spend an hour going over those again here, I'd rather we get to

272
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,260
it more quickly, which we will, and then let the listener go back and get that way of background.

273
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,300
With that said, let's talk a little bit about your story.

274
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,700
Before you went on a low carbohydrate diet, you probably had a standard lipid panel.

275
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,180
It probably showed what?

276
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,500
I believe the very last one that I had was typical of what I'd usually had gotten, which

277
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,580
is my total cholesterol.

278
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,000
I believe it was 186.

279
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,200
My LDL-C was 131.

280
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,640
My HDL was 40, and my triglycerides were 80.

281
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,880
Obviously, people who have heard me talk about this before will know that that tells us virtually

282
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,000
nothing.

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,560
Your total cholesterol is of no interest.

284
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,000
Your LDL cholesterol of 131 by the Framingham puts you a little over the 50th percentile.

285
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,080
Your HDL cholesterol of 40 puts you quite a bit below that actually.

286
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,080
Your trigs of 80 in someone who's Caucasian doesn't give us a great insight.

287
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,800
Gives us even less insight if you're African American, but your trig to HDL ratio of about

288
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,640
two would be considered acceptable by most.

289
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,880
Most people would even consider up to three acceptable.

290
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,400
We would have no way of knowing from this what your LDL particle number would be or

291
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,440
your APO-B, which would be better predictors of your risk than any of these numbers here.

292
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,640
Nevertheless, this is what everybody gets.

293
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,160
This is sort of the standard test.

294
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Yes, and in fact, anybody who's ever considered going on a low-carb diet, it's one of the

295
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,720
first things I jump on.

296
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,320
As I say, do me a favor and take a particle count test before you start the diet.

297
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,140
Because I think a lot of us would be very interested to know what particle counts are

298
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,040
before people start the diets.

299
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,240
It may actually hold keys to understanding what's going on with what—I'm not sure

300
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,960
if it was you or Tom Dayspring.

301
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,320
I think one of the two of you first started using the term hyper-responder to elucidate

302
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,160
those people who, going on a low-carb diet, see their cholesterol go high, not just their

303
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,720
LDL-C, but their particle count.

304
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,240
Yeah, I think Tom would deserve the credit for that.

305
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,700
In fact, it'll probably come up many times throughout this discussion, and we'll certainly

306
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
link to it.

307
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,520
Tom wrote a really fantastic piece on this in his Lipoholics series.

308
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:55,280
I think it was in 2013, might have been 2014, but it was following a number of cases that

309
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,840
he and I had shared back and forth about this phenomenon.

310
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,320
I would add something else, Dave, if you're going to make a request that people draw the

311
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,240
advanced lipid panels before.

312
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,240
The other thing that is essential is that they get a sterile panel.

313
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
That's not to be confused with sterile, like IL.

314
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
It's sterile, OL.

315
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:23,920
The reason for that is that there are basically four things that are moving LDL particle number.

316
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,400
When I sit down with patients and talk about this, we always start from this place, which

317
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,520
is what moves the LDL-P.

318
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,960
Three things that move it are generally cargo-related, and one is generally clearance-related.

319
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,340
Two things that move at the macro level, the cargo, is the amount of triglyceride it's

320
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,600
carrying and the amount of cholesterol it's carrying, or to be more specific, cholesterol

321
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,840
ester.

322
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,520
To get a sense of what its triglyceride burden is, you can get a crude sense from looking

323
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,880
at the serum triglyceride level, though there are no commercially available tests to my

324
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,560
knowledge that actually measure the triglyceride content of an LDL particle.

325
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,320
At the research level that's been done, I have some data on a self-experiment I did

326
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,000
in 2012 where we tracked the movement of cholesterol, ester, and triglyceride through all of my

327
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,840
lipoproteins, including chylomicrons.

328
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
If it becomes relevant, we'll certainly go over that.

329
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
I think you'll find it super interesting.

330
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah, and I think it's worth stratifying that just for a moment for the audience.

331
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,000
What you're referring to is if we do a blood test for triglycerides, that's inventory

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,680
of all lipoproteins, so we're not actually gathering it on a per-lipoprotein base.

333
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,840
This is what you're saying, is this test will help, or at least what we're trying to elucidate,

334
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,680
is exactly what it is on total triglycerides.

335
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,560
The blood test tells us nothing about the triglyceride burden within the lipoprotein

336
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,880
directly, but we know that that's one of the cargos.

337
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,760
As a general rule, the more we see the triglyceride go up, the more we know we need particles

338
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,560
disproportionate to their cholesterol content to traffic them.

339
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,120
The next two things we look at that are also quote-unquote cargo related is the synthesis

340
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
of cholesterol.

341
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,720
It turns out we can measure that quite well, and we measure that by using a number of molecules,

342
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,080
but most commonly a molecule called desmosterol, which is the penultimate molecule in one of

343
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,800
the cholesterol synthetic pathways.

344
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,160
Cholesterol synthesis begins, as you know, with the creation of a molecule from two

345
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,360
molecules of acetyl-CoA, and many, many steps later, I believe it's north of 30.

346
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Yeah, it's 30.

347
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,600
You'll have this pathway where you'll go from desmosterol into cholesterol.

348
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,840
When we measure the desmosterol level, especially when we measure changes in it, absent any

349
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,200
other drugs, because there are some drugs that can interfere with the conversion of

350
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,800
desmosterol to cholesterol, but we get a sense of what the synthetic function looks

351
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
like.

352
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,680
There are some people that are hypersynthesizers.

353
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,960
There are some people that have normal degrees of synthesis, and there are some people that

354
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,740
actually synthesize a relatively low amount.

355
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,720
The third thing we look at are phytosterols.

356
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,020
These are plant-based sterols, which means we can't make them, but by measuring them,

357
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:08,600
we get a clever insight into how cholesterol may be recirculated in the body.

358
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,320
Again, I know you know all this stuff, Dave, but I think for the listener, it's important

359
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,400
for them to get a little brush up on this stuff.

360
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,280
Most of the cholesterol in our body is endogenous, meaning we made it, and then we recirculate

361
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
it.

362
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,760
Maybe about 15% is exogenous, maybe less.

363
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,120
It would depend on a number of other factors, but the majority of the cholesterol that you

364
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,280
eat, and every once in a while you see a funny case study, and there was one this week about,

365
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,160
you know, guy eats 30 eggs a day and has low cholesterol.

366
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,800
How is this possible?

367
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
It's sort of an idiotic discussion that I can't believe we're still having.

368
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Even Ansel Keys noted this a million years ago.

369
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,840
Dietary cholesterol plays a very trivial role in the circulating cholesterol pool because

370
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,880
it has esterified side chains that can't be absorbed.

371
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,320
Nevertheless, you make all this cholesterol, we'll talk about in detail, I'm sure, how

372
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,000
it's trafficked.

373
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It comes back to the liver.

374
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,500
A portion of that is secreted through biliary means, and now that biliary cholesterol, along

375
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,820
with phytosterols, are brought in through this Neiman-Pikc1-like-1 transporter into

376
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,100
the Enerocyte where the LXR gene basically tries to regulate how much of this stuff do

377
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,540
you need, and if it's doing its job correctly, it jettisons out anything excess through this

378
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,620
ATP binding cassette G5, G8.

379
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,700
Of course there are people that have deficiencies in all of these things that can lead to hypercholesterolemia,

380
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,060
and in theory the system should balance itself out.

381
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:40,100
People who are very high synthesizers tend to compensate by being low absorbers and vice versa.

382
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,740
The long-winded soliloquy was for a reason.

383
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:48,300
It's not only important to get the lipid and lipoprotein numbers, but it also helps to

384
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,380
know those three things at baseline, one of which you get for free.

385
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,900
You're going to at least get a benchmark of your triglyceride, but to also know your levels

386
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,100
of dysmosterol, which would be your proxy for synthesis, your levels of cytosterol,

387
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,660
co-instantol, cytosterol, these things are phytosterols, meaning we can't make them,

388
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,460
so the higher they are, the more we know we're absorbing sterile.

389
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,380
The fourth thing that regulates LDL-P, so again it's triglyceride burden, cholesterol

390
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,700
synthesis, cholesterol reabsorption, the fourth thing is LDL clearance.

391
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,820
Now that is not as static as people would like to believe.

392
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,740
It's probably not even as static as I used to believe.

393
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,580
I used to believe that it was sort of genetically determined what your LDL clearance would be,

394
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,700
and obviously there's a great variability there.

395
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,820
We see it all over, but it turns out that that is highly regulated at the level of the

396
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
liver.

397
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,380
So even though we can use a drug to demonstrate the variability of it, a statin being the

398
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:49,820
most obvious example, statins are specifically designed to increase LDL clearance from the

399
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,660
liver by decreasing liver synthesis of cholesterol.

400
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,560
Other changes in cholesterol concentrations throughout the body, probably the burden of

401
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,520
reverse cholesterol transport and other things will also impact that clearance, and

402
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
the majority of LDL of course is cleared hepatically.

403
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,280
So we don't have an assay for that.

404
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,820
This is the one where I always have to say to patients, the only way I can really figure

405
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,880
out if your LDL-P skyrocketed because of defective clearance, which would by the way have to

406
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,420
be a new onset of defective clearance, is if the other three things don't change.

407
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,040
Or if they get better, meaning they all, I hate to use the term better or worse actually

408
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,320
because this is really, they're neither better nor worse.

409
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,900
They just are what they are, right?

410
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,160
But if the synthesis goes down, the absorption goes down, the trigs are largely unchanged,

411
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,340
and the LDL goes up, the LDL-P goes up, then you know clearance has gone down.

412
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,400
So most of the time you can't actually measure that unless you get lucky.

413
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,300
And by measure I mean sort of impute.

414
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:53,600
So anyway, this is helpful and I suspect this will offer an alternative hypothesis to sort

415
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,760
of what we're seeing.

416
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,640
But anyway, I apologize, I'm talking more than I should be.

417
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,680
For what it's worth, what you just mentioned, I myself have not gotten this, they're all

418
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,780
test.

419
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,720
I haven't actually broken down these but I've been particularly interested in this.

420
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,400
And for what it's worth, I've been looking forward to this because I think I may actually

421
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,160
be just the stealth interviewer in the room because I think it's just as possible I may

422
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,840
be asking you more questions than you're asking me.

423
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,240
I do want to add one thing to what you were just talking about on a lot of people who

424
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,320
go on a low-carb diet and they know they're bringing up their total amount of dietary

425
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,080
cholesterol who then see a likewise increase in their serum cholesterol, the cholesterol

426
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,500
in the blood, naturally because it's intuitive, come to the conclusion that must be because

427
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,740
I am a hyper absorber.

428
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,360
I must be absorbing more cholesterol.

429
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,840
And I think in the course of this conversation this will help illustrate another reason why

430
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,140
that may be the case because you may in fact be trafficking more fat as energy and therefore

431
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,900
it may be ride sharing with cholesterol in these liver proteins.

432
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,500
Yeah, I think the terminology is going to be confusing.

433
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,780
So when we talk about hyper absorbers we're referring very specifically to this mechanism

434
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,540
about the this Nieman peak C1, L1 transporter in the ATP binding cassette which is called,

435
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,460
it's usually referred to as ABC G5 G8.

436
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,020
But as you said that person who says, hey Dave I just went on a low-carb diet and I'm

437
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,220
eating more eggs and more this and more that and my cholesterol has gone up.

438
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,580
Well the problem with that is it's like wrong on many levels, right?

439
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,420
We should never be talking broadly or vaguely about cholesterol.

440
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
What went up specifically?

441
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
Right.

442
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Did LDL cholesterol go up?

443
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,100
Did LDL particle number go up?

444
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,340
Did total cholesterol go up?

445
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,340
Etc.

446
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,940
But it's quite likely that those two things are not causal, meaning the person who's increasing

447
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,400
their consumption of dietary or exogenous cholesterol is also usually increasing their

448
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,200
consumption of dietary fats.

449
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Absolutely.

450
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,520
And as we'll talk about later I'm sure one of those subtypes of fats in a subset of susceptible

451
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,520
individual seems to set off a hyper synthetic pathway for cholesterol which when we get

452
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,640
to it I want to share with you my data set on hyper responders meaning these patients

453
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,120
which is what is the pattern of hyper response?

454
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,800
Because not everyone has this experience where they go on a ketogenic diet and their LDL

455
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
skyrockets.

456
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,800
I didn't have that experience but I have the privilege of getting to see the blood of tens

457
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,800
if not hundreds of people over the past few years so I get to see oh sometimes this happens,

458
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,160
sometimes it doesn't.

459
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,480
What else is going on here?

460
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,880
So what year did all this start for you?

461
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,720
In April of 2015 was where I got my second A1c of 6.1 which is a hemoglobin test which

462
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,240
suggests that I'm pre-diabetic.

463
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,880
And that was with a triglyceride of 80?

464
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,280
Yes, actually that's correct.

465
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,360
That was the very last time.

466
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,160
That was that same test.

467
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:49,560
So when I saw that I then immediately felt compelled to go and learn everything I could

468
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:56,520
on how to change my blood glucose levels because also I had a fasting glucose of I want to

469
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,160
say like 103.

470
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,440
And at the doctor's office they said well yes it's the second year in the row but we'll

471
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
keep monitoring it.

472
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,320
And I said well no thanks.

473
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,880
I'm going to start trying to figure out what it is I can do to dodge type 2 diabetes because

474
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,600
it's rampant on my dad's side of the family.

475
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,920
And so I started to go to diabetic forms.

476
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,960
Diabetic forms they were talking about this LCHF diet which I would then find out is low

477
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,580
carb high fat diet.

478
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,160
I would then look a little bit further.

479
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,600
I found out about the ketogenic diet and it all sounded very interesting.

480
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,560
And I remember at that time asking on the forum saying okay now wait a sec how can I

481
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,240
be sure my cholesterol won't go up?

482
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,040
And at the time the common answer was well it only happens for a few people.

483
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,000
And even then it's complicated but it's really probably not a problem.

484
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,280
And there wasn't really a very solid answer to it but I felt at least confident enough

485
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,240
that it was unlikely to happen to me.

486
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,200
And therefore I would go ahead and take the shot because my cholesterol numbers were generally

487
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
pretty good.

488
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,400
I did like hearing that it typically raised HDL and that was the one thing my doctor would

489
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,560
occasionally ping me for.

490
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,840
He'd say like if your HDL was a little bit higher.

491
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,960
So after I started both my dad and my sister got enticed to do it as well.

492
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,360
My dad's type 2 diabetic his last day once he was like 8.3.

493
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,600
My sister's not diabetic but was hypertensive.

494
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
They both get inspired.

495
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,280
They end up going on the diet.

496
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,400
To this day now my dad's in the 5 nines something along those lines.

497
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,400
And my sister's no longer hypertensive when she's staying on the diet fairly well.

498
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,400
The two of them get their cholesterol test before I do after they start the diet around

499
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,720
the same time.

500
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,080
In both of them I warn them in advance that their LDL cholesterol might bump a little.

501
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,160
And sure enough that is what happened to both of them but it wasn't that concerning.

502
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,960
I get mine a little bit later, about 7 1,5 months later and mine skyrockets.

503
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,400
This is like late 2015.

504
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Correct.

505
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,240
So November 2015 I believe my total cholesterol was 329.

506
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,440
My LDL-C was 200 and I want to say 250.

507
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
I can't remember.

508
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,400
Somewhere around there.

509
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,360
That was a very cathartic moment for me.

510
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,800
At least as far as I'm looking at the lab work I'm going what the heck happened.

511
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,440
How did I get to this place?

512
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,920
For two very miserable weeks I found this guy Peter Attia who happened to already have

513
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,120
a lot of data and a lot of great series.

514
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,680
I like engulfed your series but I could hardly understand it at the time.

515
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,880
I started reading up on Thomas Dayspring.

516
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,280
I found Tara Dahl.

517
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,400
I started looking at just anybody and everybody who could say anything about lipids.

518
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,560
And in the course of doing it that's when I started seeing this pattern as I started

519
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,280
like tweaking a little bit into clinical lipidology, the book.

520
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,840
When you say the pattern just to be clear, the increase in LDL cholesterol on the presence

521
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,320
of a low carbohydrate high fat diet?

522
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,280
No I actually mean it being a network.

523
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,080
Okay so say more about that.

524
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,920
Lipoproteins are a boat.

525
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,960
This is going to be one on one but let's kind of do that for the listener for a second.

526
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,640
They're lipid carrying proteins and so your body makes them and they make them in numbers

527
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,560
we can't even imagine.

528
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,040
They're measured in quintillions which is like a million trillions.

529
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,760
And it's doing this both in the gut and in the liver and when they make it they're basically

530
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,200
packing in lipids that these cells need.

531
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,520
And in particular they pack just about every kind of lipid not just triglycerides which

532
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,760
your body uses for energy but also cholesterol which we're going to be talking about a lot

533
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,840
but also fat soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K.

534
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,680
And it packs all of these the same container but what's neat about it is this boat in order

535
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,360
for it to get to the cells that want to make use of it need to have a complex system in

536
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,000
place so that they can kind of special order what it is that they want to take off of these

537
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,400
lipoproteins.

538
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,800
And that's where it gets interesting because the lipoproteins have these kind of snakey

539
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,520
bumps on the top of them that are proteins that are the apo lipoproteins.

540
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,720
And hopefully we don't have to get too technical for the audience on that but of course I'll

541
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
appreciate it if we can.

542
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,600
I think we're going to have to.

543
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,800
Yeah we're probably going to have to but it's those apo lipoproteins that you could relate

544
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,560
on a computer side to like metadata to like headers for example as far as where it is

545
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
that they're going to go and why.

546
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,840
And what excited me about as I was learning about this I was like I don't know how much

547
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,080
of this I'm projecting my own experience as a software developer but this looks like a

548
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:31,640
very complex series of distributed objects that clearly if I'm looking at it from a payload

549
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,520
perspective is primarily an energy distribution network.

550
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,800
It appears as if its primary job more than any other job particularly chylomicrons and

551
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,480
VLDLs are to deliver this fat based energy to tissues.

552
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,440
That's what they go out with and that's what they come back typically not with coming back

553
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,760
to the liver.

554
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,800
And because almost everything ends up coming back to the liver this looks like it's a central

555
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,120
regulator and in that sense this looks I mean in many respects it has many attributes common

556
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,320
to what we would call in software as a cloud network something we use a lot.

557
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,280
It's very important to be able to do things at scale but particularly with the level of

558
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,520
interaction that goes on with the lipoproteins between each other.

559
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,000
It's not like these boats go out autonomously and never have any interaction beyond just

560
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,160
going to dock and dropping off their different cargo.

561
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
They actually constantly connect with each other through things like cholesterol ester

562
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,560
transfer protein, phospholipid transfer protein and so forth.

563
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,800
These are different ways in which they in the process of moving through the bloodstream

564
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,720
actually have further interactions that move around the total pool that's being used by

565
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,800
the entire system.

566
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,480
And hopefully I didn't get too technical there but you get the sense of it.

567
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,680
In many ways this has a lot of overlap with techniques that we use right now and how we

568
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,560
build networks out of servers.

569
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,960
So I think we do need to get pretty technical on this because I suspect that you and I will

570
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,880
draw different conclusions from the data and in my experience the easiest way to understand

571
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,080
where those differences lie is to sort of start to get into some of the things that

572
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,400
we would view differently.

573
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,760
I'll start with one thing that you said.

574
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,480
I like to be clear on where I believe the kylo micron, the VLDL, the IDL and the LDL

575
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,520
are coming from, going and what they're doing.

576
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,480
We can't actually know for certain any of these things.

577
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,160
I've had some very interesting discussions with people about this over the years.

578
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,640
I've had one of the most brilliant lipidologists I've ever spoke to said, why do we have LDL?

579
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,280
To which the answer is it's just God's cruel trick on our species because most other species

580
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,880
don't have the LDL burden we have.

581
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,040
I think a more thoughtful answer though is the overwhelming burden of evidence is that

582
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,200
the purpose of LDL is to carry out reverse cholesterol transport.

583
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,760
You alluded to this already.

584
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,960
You basically have these three different lineages.

585
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,160
This is a bit of an oversimplification of lipoproteins.

586
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:04,400
You have these kylo microns, which as you said are primarily getting fat from the gut

587
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,600
and very rapidly undergoing a process of hydrolyzing themselves and releasing through an apolipoprotein

588
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,240
called ApoC2 all of their triglyceride through interaction with something called lipoprotein

589
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,560
lipase.

590
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,440
We have this rapid chemical reaction that very quickly gets rid of these incoming dietary

591
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,960
and sometimes non-dietary because I want to be clear that we can't really distinguish

592
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,360
exogenous and endogenous fat in that pool because you're going through that same recirculating

593
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
process.

594
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,320
At the risk of oversimplifying, fat comes in the body.

595
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,560
If you're on a high fat diet, you're eating fat, it's coming in the gut.

596
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,000
The kylo micron, which is its own little lineage because it has a different apolipoprotein.

597
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,740
It has this thing called ApoB48 as you know.

598
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:53,160
That comes in and then the ApoC2 interacting with the LPL is what's extracting that.

599
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,440
Oh yeah, great.

600
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,280
Dave just whipped up a great picture.

601
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
We'll have this in the show.

602
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
We're going to link to all this stuff.

603
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,560
Yeah, so Dave, if you can make a note of this one and then that one when we're making the

604
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,760
show notes, we'll link all that stuff.

605
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,160
Then you have another path we're not going to talk about much today, which is the HDL

606
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
path.

607
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Totally different.

608
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,760
These particles last much longer.

609
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,160
They are primarily responsible for reverse cholesterol transport of which there are two

610
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,720
types.

611
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,600
Reverse cholesterol transport means taking cholesterol from the periphery back to the

612
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
liver.

613
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,640
That can occur directly, which is when the HDL brings cholesterol itself back from another

614
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
tissue to the liver.

615
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,640
The most important place it does this is from the subendothelial space.

616
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,520
If you have oxidized sterols waiting to cause atherosclerosis, the HDL can actually go and

617
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,680
through another one of those ATP binding cassettes, it can de-lipidate the HDL.

618
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,120
The sterile take it right back to the liver.

619
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:54,200
That's direct RCT, but there's also indirect RCT, which is the LDL can bring cholesterol

620
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,680
back and give cholesterol to the HDL through CTEP as you alluded to.

621
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,880
That goes the other way, right?

622
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,160
You mean HDL actually taking the cholesterol and giving it to the LDL to take back to the

623
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
liver?

624
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
No.

625
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Actually, both.

626
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,760
LDL gives to HDL to go back to the liver.

627
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
I see what you're saying.

628
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Yeah, through CTEP.

629
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:19,080
That's indirect RCT, but it's that VLDL to IDL to LDL path that is governed by these APO-B.

630
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,680
Their lineage is described by APO-B100, which differentiates them.

631
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,120
One of the things I didn't learn until recently, and I don't know if this is accounted for

632
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,320
in the model because the figure that we're going to link to is not actually showing that,

633
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,400
is that about 40% of LDL comes directly from the liver.

634
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,760
It's de novo created.

635
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Right.

636
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,800
Tom Dave Spring linked me to the study that I'd since read on this one.

637
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Really?

638
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Which one?

639
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Is this the Frank Sacks?

640
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
I don't remember.

641
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
I don't remember the authors.

642
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,440
They get into the different subspecies of APO, C3s, and APOE and how they counterbalance

643
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,080
each other as far as degree of affinity for clearance and so forth.

644
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah.

645
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,800
I mean, I wouldn't say it's unrelated.

646
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,080
This stuff's all related.

647
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,640
We'll park this topic because it's super interesting, but when these lipoproteins have APOE on

648
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,560
them, which is pretty unusual, it's about 2% to 5% if my memory serves me correctly.

649
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
We'll fact check that.

650
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,720
It might be different, but a very small number of these APOE-B100s are carrying APOE, and

651
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,560
when they do, they actually have much more rapid clearance.

652
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,600
As in having APOE only and not having APOE C3?

653
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,280
Well, that's actually a good question.

654
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,720
APOE C3 is clearly the worst actor you could have here.

655
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,600
There's nothing worse than having an APOE C3 sitting on your APOE-B100 cell.

656
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,800
In fact, some would argue that may be the single worst thing you could ever have happen

657
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,160
because it increases the residence time of them.

658
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,000
We're going to come to this, I know, because you've written about remnants.

659
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,860
I'm going to argue that we have no way of knowing what a remnant is without being able

660
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:54,120
to measure APOE C3 because when we look at a VLDL cholesterol, and I apologize to the

661
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,840
listener, I swear we'll get back to our main point here.

662
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,720
Unless we actually know something more than just how much cholesterol is in VLDL, we have

663
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,920
no way of knowing whether it's an appropriate remnant, what we call a physiologic remnant,

664
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,440
or a pathologic remnant.

665
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,800
The pathologic remnants disproportionately carry APOE C3, which increases the residence

666
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
time.

667
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
The same is true on LDL.

668
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,320
I do want to follow up on that point.

669
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Yes, yes, yes.

670
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,440
We absolutely will because it's such an important point.

671
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,880
To me, it's one of the two most interesting clinical assays I'd like to see developed.

672
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,200
I would love to see a clinical assay for APOE C3 and for LDL triglyceride concentration,

673
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,440
which goes back to a point we had a few minutes ago.

674
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,720
For anybody listening who's developing that assay, please reach out to me because for

675
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,880
all the self-experimentation I do, I mean, one of the things I didn't mention is that

676
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,720
I literally just did my 100th blood draw last Tuesday.

677
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,040
I've obviously done enormous amounts of self-testing to do this.

678
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,840
That's exactly one of the things I want to check is how dynamic or not dynamic the distribution

679
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:59,280
of things like APOE C3 are based on, for example, existing illness or the energy distribution

680
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
and so forth.

681
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,960
Anyway, I realize we're kind of getting in the weeds here.

682
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,920
You should have a low level of C3 because your insulin levels are quite low.

683
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,800
C3 tends to move with insulin.

684
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,800
This may be one of the things that explains why someone with type 2 diabetes who is hyper

685
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:24,280
insulinemic will, on a particle for particle basis, maybe even have a greater burden of

686
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,160
the lipoprotein because the actual residence time of each of their particles, both VLDL

687
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,080
and LDL, is longer than someone with lower insulin.

688
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:40,320
You have this de novo creation of VLDLs and you have this de novo creation of LDLs and

689
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,780
they form this circulating pool, but to my knowledge, we can't really differentiate those

690
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,280
when we look at that snapshot.

691
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,760
I can't tell.

692
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,800
Is that an LDL that came from a VLDL or is that an LDL that came straight from the liver in that form?

693
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,880
That was actually one of the questions I had for you was how, with a kinetic study, can

694
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:07,760
you actually determine if an APOE B100 lipoprotein that was secreted by the liver ever has, say,

695
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,360
an APOE C2 on it?

696
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,680
I think you and I would probably be in agreement that we don't know.

697
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,120
We don't have any clinical way to measure that.

698
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Right.

699
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,720
In a sense, I fully can see that I can't be sure, even with the energy model, that the

700
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,440
LDL particles that I'm seeing, the LDL-P, that I can say with any level of real confidence,

701
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,640
how many of the total proportion of those were truly for energy delivered?

702
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,440
I would argue that this is where we get into the semantics.

703
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,800
I would argue none of them are for energy delivery because that's not what LDL does.

704
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,840
But I think what you mean is how many of them came from VLDLs that were trying to deliver

705
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
energy.

706
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Right.

707
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,560
Originated as VLDLs for the purpose of doing it.

708
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,920
If the job of your ... in the morning, let's say that your job is to deliver pizzas.

709
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
That's your job.

710
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,880
You know it only takes you about an hour to do.

711
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Then guess what?

712
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,360
The rest of the next two to four days, you're actually going to be patrolling the neighborhood.

713
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,920
You're the neighborhood watch.

714
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
You're going around.

715
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,480
You're also helping to fix up people's houses or something along those lines.

716
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,040
Somebody who comes into the neighborhood and sees a whole bunch of these cars patrolling,

717
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,760
they don't know how many of those people actually delivered pizzas before they got started on

718
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,320
that part of the shift.

719
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,000
That's basically what we're both coming to.

720
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,160
We don't actually know how many people left the liver.

721
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,080
How many VLDLs left the liver versus?

722
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Well, we sort of know.

723
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,840
I mean, we know that if ... I mean, what Frank Sacks paper showed is if you take patients

724
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:37,160
with low triglycerides, and I believe he used a cutoff of 130 milligrams per deciliter,

725
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,680
38% were de novo secreted by the liver.

726
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:48,280
62% came from either IDL or VLDL, where you had de novo ... I don't think the paper differentiated

727
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:54,080
between which ones went IDL to LDL versus VLDL to IDL to LDL.

728
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
That's an important point.

729
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:00,620
The second thing is the half-life ... I actually had to go back and look at these kinetics

730
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:04,040
because I did a podcast with Ron Krauss, as you know.

731
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,840
I mean, I don't remember when we recorded it.

732
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,560
I think it came out kind of recently, but he mentioned that LDL half-life was a day,

733
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,800
and I was like, I always thought it was longer than that.

734
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,280
The literature says two to four days.

735
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,280
No, actually, if you go back and look at the kinetic study, people are confusing half-life

736
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,680
with residence time.

737
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,960
The half-life of an LDL particle is about a day.

738
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,320
Now, it can be longer, but that's a pathologic state, which gets back to this APO C3 thing.

739
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,320
That's interesting.

740
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,160
Yeah, you can have a pathologic state where LDLs will hang around longer, but if you look

741
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,720
at the actual kinetic studies, and Brown and Goldstein did this work, and this is part

742
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,680
of the work, I believe, that they won a Nobel Prize for, the kinetics of LDL are pretty

743
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,560
well understood using very elegant tracers.

744
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,380
We'll link to that paper because I actually had to go back and look at it because I was

745
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,760
surprised by Ron's answer when he said that LDL particle half-life is really only a day

746
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,600
under non-pathologic states.

747
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
You're right.

748
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,600
If I look at your LDL particles and I see 3,000 nanomole per liter, I do not know with absolute

749
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,320
certainty how many of those your liver made directly versus not.

750
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,760
But again, assuming you're insulin sensitive, assuming you fit Saks's model of patient,

751
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,520
that would suggest that roughly 40% of those were just de novo created.

752
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,800
And then of the remaining 60, some of those were from de novo ideal and some came all

753
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,080
the way through the VLDL pathway.

754
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,080
With that in mind, here's what I would speculate.

755
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,800
This is purely hypothetical, but I would speculate if you were to grab a whole bunch of people

756
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,640
who are, and we'll hopefully get into this model that I'm talking about that I call lean

757
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,800
mass hyper responders, people are at the far end of the spectrum.

758
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,340
They are athletic, they are thin, and they are very, very low carb and therefore see

759
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:47,660
very high levels of LDL-C and LDL-P, but they also have very high levels of HDL-C and low

760
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,580
levels of triglycerides.

761
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:56,160
I suspect that they would show a very high rate proportionally of VLDL secretion, that

762
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,960
they actually are trafficking a lot more for their energy, triglycerides in VLDL particles

763
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,560
and therefore have succeeding LDL particles as to the explanation as to why their LDL-C

764
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,120
and LDL-P would be higher.

765
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,320
So let's use this as a moment, because I want to get into that in greater detail, but let's

766
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,080
take that step back and have you maybe just put a little bit more color on what you mean

767
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,680
by your lean mass hyper responder phenotype.

768
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,800
So those people go on a low carb diet.

769
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,180
Some subset, and nobody seems to agree on this because there's really not been any large

770
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:35,740
study done on it, some people will say it's 5%, some will say it's 30%, will like me see

771
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,520
that their LDL, their total cholesterol, they will see both of those rides substantial.

772
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,580
Have the people at Virta Health released any of these data because they would probably

773
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,320
have the most rigorous database on this?

774
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,200
Here's a little bit of my qualification here.

775
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,880
The problem that I have is, at least with what we see at cholesterolcode.com, the blog

776
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,600
that I have, we have lots and lots of hyper responders that send it in, there is seeming

777
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,080
to be a higher proportionality of people who are lean and or fit, who seem to be metabolically

778
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,080
flexible.

779
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,640
Virta, of course, it's a pool of participants.

780
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,680
They had to start, I hope I don't get this wrong, but I believe that their BMI is at

781
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,560
a much higher level when they say it.

782
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,960
Well, it's a company obviously that is dealing with patients with type 2 diabetes.

783
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,680
Yes, they're not going to be disproportionately lean and fit to begin with.

784
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,960
You're saying that that basically wouldn't be the ideal pool to observe this phenomenon?

785
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,640
I would prefer a broader base.

786
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
Okay, all right, sorry.

787
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,360
With that said, it's absolutely true.

788
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,040
They've got some of the most pristine data.

789
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,400
They also have that data that I would be looking for where they get NMRs, for example, before

790
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,160
the participants start.

791
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,160
That was nice too.

792
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,200
They're going to have so much great data that comes out of that.

793
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,480
Getting back to hyper responders, per what you were talking about before, this was what

794
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,280
we called people, and this predates me, who would go on a low carb diet, would see

795
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,280
their LDL cholesterol, their LDL particle count climb.

796
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,760
Then there seemed to be a subset, and I wrote about this about a year ago last month, of

797
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,400
people who are on the furthest end of the spectrum actually tend to have the highest

798
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,200
levels overall of LDL cholesterol, but also have other things in common.

799
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,440
This pattern is very distinctive.

800
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,280
They would have say an LDL of 200 or higher.

801
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,280
You mean LDL cholesterol?

802
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:31,360
Sorry, LDL cholesterol of 200 or higher, HDLC cholesterol of 80 or higher, and triglycerides

803
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,520
of 70 or lower.

804
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,120
This is so prominent to the extent to where I even did this kind of recently at another

805
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,640
conference I called out another speaker to where I said, I'm very interested in your

806
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,800
lipid numbers because I think you might be a lean mass hyper responder.

807
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,920
She said, well, I hadn't actually taken it in years.

808
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,840
We tested it on the spot and it hit all of those points.

809
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:58,400
Her LDL-C was 189, her HDL-C was 80, and her triglycerides were 70.

810
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:05,600
This seems to so far span across all sorts of, for example, APOE types, APOE 3.3s and

811
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,480
2.3s, as well as the 3.4s and 4.4s.

812
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,280
We have not been able to identify any other SNP or anything that's clearly associating

813
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
this type.

814
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,800
Including the PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma?

815
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,040
That's one of the ones I wanted to follow up on, particularly since I heard your podcast

816
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,880
with Branda.

817
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,280
I had a bunch of people on Twitter just send me full body pictures for me to use in this

818
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,360
most recent speech I did on lean mass hyper responders.

819
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,000
You have to be careful with that.

820
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,040
You can get into trouble by the way.

821
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,360
I did say be sure to respond this tweet where I'm specifying exactly what I'd be using them

822
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,360
for.

823
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,200
Anyway, generally speaking, they tend to be very fit.

824
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,360
They tend to be very thin.

825
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,560
Often times, you kind of had a story of your own from before I even got into this.

826
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,080
They'll say, I really don't want to stop.

827
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
I really love this way of life.

828
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,720
I feel better than I ever have in my life.

829
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,760
I give the same answer not too far different from yours.

830
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:05,560
Then I say, okay, generally speaking, I feel like all of your markers look great, low inflammation

831
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,560
across the board.

832
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:11,760
Of course, I give the standard I'm not a medical doctor and this isn't medical advice, etc.

833
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,240
All of that said, it's hard for me to come to the conclusion that you're in trouble unless

834
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,740
we can likewise see further markers such as expanding CIMT and CAC and so forth that's

835
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,160
going to show that you actually are developing higher rates of atherosclerosis.

836
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,040
Now, a qualified advance because I'm sure you'd want to say this as well.

837
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,560
I've mentioned this to several people.

838
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:36,280
Things like atherosclerosis can develop without any sign for a fairly long period of time.

839
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,360
For example, I think it's what, 60% before you even see occlusion in the lumina, for

840
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,360
example?

841
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,120
Well, let's back up a little bit.

842
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,880
I always want to be careful that when people are talking about CIMT and CAC that we're

843
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,720
never using those in the same terms as we would think of biomarkers.

844
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,160
A biomarker, what you've described is, let's look at your LDL cholesterol or better yet,

845
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,600
your LDL particle number.

846
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,320
Remember something, a CAC, which is a calcium score, so it's a dry CT scan that very quickly

847
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,560
scans over the heart and just picks up calcification, no anatomic detail, or a CIMT, which is a

848
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,960
type of ultrasound that looks at the intimal thickness, so that's one of the walls of the

849
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,440
arteries thickness in the carotid arteries in the neck.

850
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,840
These are both tests that are used to try to gauge advanced disease.

851
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,360
The real way to think about this is to, and I think Ron and I talked about this at length

852
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,120
in the podcast, is to look at a pathology textbook.

853
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,640
When you look at the autopsies, you'll get a sense of what's going on.

854
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,600
Long before you have luminal narrowing, which may or may not accompany a problem, you have

855
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,640
a very clear documented path of what this disease does.

856
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,380
So again, I think you know this, Dave, but I think for the listener it is worth repeating

857
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:52,040
this if they don't want to go back and read some of the posts I've written on the progression

858
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,720
of atherosclerosis.

859
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,160
When we're born, we have these beautiful arteries.

860
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:03,040
The arteries have this endothelial lining, so this very thin type of cell that coats

861
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,800
the luminal, meaning the part that's closest to where the blood is flowing.

862
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,280
So there are spaces between these, and via diffusion, lipoproteins get in there and out

863
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,200
of there all the time.

864
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,240
This is relatively well understood to be a gradient phenomenon, so the more of the lipoproteins

865
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,760
you have, the more of them that are going to go in.

866
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,440
But as we talked about earlier, other things will influence it.

867
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,720
The residence time, for example, which might be why this Apo C3 thing is such a pain in

868
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,160
the butt, because if it allows these cells to stick around longer, bad things happen.

869
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,440
Now what most people don't know, I think, is that an LDL particle is more likely to

870
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,760
come back out when it goes in there than it is to stay in there.

871
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,760
That's good news.

872
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,040
HDL particles always come out of there.

873
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,160
There are other types of particles, LPa and pathologic VLDL remnants can do the same thing

874
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,520
as well.

875
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:58,080
The problem occurs when proteoglycans bind to, and let's just make math easy and not

876
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,760
get into the LPa's and the VLDL's at the moment.

877
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,480
Let's just talk about the LDL, since that's the largest burden of this.

878
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,500
But when these proteoglycans bind to the LDL and it gets retained, all of a sudden, now

879
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,500
you have something that's where it's not supposed to be.

880
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,880
That's not where we want that thing.

881
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,620
It's obviously in a high oxygen environment, so it's going to undergo a chemical reaction

882
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:25,100
called oxidation because it's carrying a cargo, a sterile, and by the way, they can

883
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,400
be carrying phytosterols and other things like that, but these things have ample opportunity

884
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,380
to undergo an oxidative reaction.

885
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:38,020
It's that oxidative reaction that then kicks off an inflammatory response in the endothelium.

886
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,560
Now the good news is today we at least have one laboratory test that can measure that

887
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
burden of oxidation.

888
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,180
It's called the ox LDL assay.

889
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,660
Now this has been around for a while, but clinically we've only been using it for a

890
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:53,740
couple of years because it turns out some very small percentage of those LDLs, once

891
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,600
they are oxidized, escape back into the circulation.

892
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:04,420
So by sampling those, we can track indirectly, hey, what's the likelihood that oxidative

893
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,860
damage is happening?

894
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:09,680
So for me, this is one of the most important metrics I look at because I want to spend

895
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,860
some time later on going over some clinical cases.

896
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,740
I want to see some of the data on yours.

897
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,420
I want to show you some of the data that will explain maybe how I'm thinking about

898
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:23,380
this, but this oxidized LDL, which is well documented and described in different quintiles,

899
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:28,100
right, is giving you a small sample of what's going on, but for the listener, it's important

900
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,260
to understand that when you get a blood test, that's not telling you what's happening in

901
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,500
your artery.

902
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,780
It's giving you probabilities of things that are largely stochastically governed that are

903
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:43,700
going on in your artery, and the ox LDL is no exception.

904
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:48,700
Even though it's a beautiful marker, it's still dependent on the idea that a subset

905
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,660
of those oxidized sterols are now escaping.

906
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,620
Can I actually ask a little more on that one?

907
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:03,340
So we already know that LDL particles, specifically ApoB100 at the LDL stage, have alpha toco

908
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,980
fural, I think is how I'm saying it.

909
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:10,900
Basically it's vitamin E, right, as part of the antioxidant defense system.

910
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:16,500
Part of the purpose of an LDL particle is to actually provide that as a means to battle

911
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,380
reactive oxygen species, right?

912
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:25,060
I don't know about that, and if it were solely true, it would make me wonder why people with

913
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:29,620
LDL deficiencies wouldn't have deficiencies of those processes as well, whereas to the

914
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,300
best of our knowledge, they don't.

915
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,420
Because I've actually been wanting to get into this a lot more recently, and correct

916
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,260
me if I'm wrong, basically there's a certain degree with which you've got vitamin E on

917
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,380
board.

918
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:43,420
On top of that, you've got the potential of the phospholipid shell to become oxidized.

919
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:50,700
If you get oxidized phospholipids, that also can bring about the role of LpA that can cleave

920
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,780
off the oxidized phospholipids.

921
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,860
That's ultimately what LpPLA2 is, right?

922
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,860
Correct.

923
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,260
It's the enzyme that's ultimately involved in helping to.

924
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:03,100
And this is also, I don't know how much of this is actually demonstrated, but is ultimately

925
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:08,580
where a lot of the concept behind why it is you would have a higher detection of small

926
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,580
lipoproteins, particularly small LDLs, can come around to.

927
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,940
Is if you're getting them constantly oxidized and having to constantly cleave them down

928
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,540
to much smaller amounts, and then they constantly remodel.

929
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,100
Yeah, but we're getting off into two different things here.

930
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,540
So let's come back to this.

931
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,300
It's not clear to me that there's sufficient evidence to suggest that part of the role

932
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,500
of LDL is to combat the oxidative stress.

933
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
Okay.

934
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,840
Let's put that as homework that we'll catch up on after this.

935
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,800
But this is relevant for whether or not we're detecting oxidized LDLs that had never entered

936
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,360
the intima, right?

937
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,360
No.

938
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,040
The oxidized LDLs that we're detecting have escaped the intima.

939
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,040
Interesting.

940
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,000
There's a very small subset that are getting out.

941
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Okay.

942
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,160
That's definitely something I would like to follow up because I'm genuinely curious about

943
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,960
that myself as to whether or not they can be oxidized sufficiently that they'd get picked.

944
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,080
Because it also may be something that is part of the test or is not part of the test.

945
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,800
But I'd be curious as to how we can actually determine that.

946
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,800
Yeah.

947
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,080
Meaning what you're basically asking is how do we know they weren't oxidized, never inside

948
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,640
the sub-endothelial space?

949
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
That's a fair question.

950
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
I don't know the answer.

951
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,760
I know very little about this assay.

952
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,080
I mean, I know the technical stuff of how the assay works.

953
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,240
Like it's an ELISA assay.

954
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,560
I know what enzymes it's looking at.

955
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:24,360
But the broader question is without a trace or do we know if that LDL has actually been

956
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:29,580
in the sub-endothelial space where it was bound, oxidized, and then escaped or liberated.

957
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,580
So fair question.

958
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:35,220
It's certainly relevant to this larger question of the value of LDL particles as to whether

959
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,100
they play an important part of the immunological role.

960
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,860
Well, they do.

961
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:44,060
Probably nowhere near as important as the HDL particle, which is probably why the HDL

962
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,820
particle has such a long residence time.

963
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:53,660
And the HDL particle, as important as it is for reverse cholesterol transport, both direct

964
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:59,020
where it's taking the lipid back to the liver directly or indirect, which we talked about.

965
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,020
And you corrected me.

966
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,020
Thank you.

967
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:04,120
Where it takes it to the LDL and the LDL takes it back to the liver.

968
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,540
Certainly some have argued that an even more important property of the HDL is the proteins

969
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,820
that it carries, the immunoglobulins, all of the other things that it carries that play

970
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,120
this important role in immune function.

971
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:20,540
So it really seems that the overwhelming body of evidence is that the purpose of the LDL

972
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,400
particle is to carry the cholesterol back to the liver.

973
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Interesting.

974
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,080
This gets back to the multipurpose value of a vehicle.

975
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,840
Is it doing things other than that that also turn out to be relevant?

976
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,680
And I think this kind of gets to the larger and more important question overall.

977
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:42,160
Like the question that I started with, going back to my November 2015 days, was I thought

978
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,000
very naively that in a few days I would learn all I would need to about cholesterol and

979
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,400
lipoproteins, find the landmark study that had a gajillion people, and they would just

980
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,120
show that if you had lower LDL cholesterol, you just died less.

981
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,280
Like that was it.

982
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,880
End of story.

983
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,120
And at first I thought that I had found that because I had found plenty that pointed to

984
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:09,240
events and pointed to lower cardiovascular risk, but then wouldn't necessarily talk as

985
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,640
much about all-cause mortality.

986
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,000
I then had to learn about all-cause mortality.

987
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,960
And then more and more I felt like I couldn't get to something that really emphasized.

988
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,080
I thought for sure at least I would see, for example, an elderly population, generally

989
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,640
speaking the lower your natural LDL, we can get into SNPs for example on this.

990
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,560
The more likely it is that you would just live longer.

991
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,560
Period.

992
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,360
But you have to remember how these studies are powered.

993
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:37,920
So the challenge with ACM is I don't think any study in the history of civilization is

994
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,680
going to be powered to detect that.

995
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,200
It's hard enough to detect cardiac mortality in a study.

996
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,840
I think we need to be more clear in what our concern is.

997
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,560
If the concern is if you are less likely to die of heart disease, you are more likely

998
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:56,120
to die of something else, then we should state that explicitly and say, hey, low LDL while

999
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,920
maybe protective of cardiovascular disease, I will argue that is unambiguously clear and

1000
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,600
we can discuss that.

1001
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,920
But the bigger question is are you concerned that, well, it's increasing the risk of cancer

1002
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,120
or neurodegenerative disease?

1003
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
A trade-off.

1004
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,120
Yes.

1005
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,560
So the question there is that's a question of power.

1006
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,200
And so it's not uncommon in cardiovascular studies to see a reduction in coronary mortality

1007
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,840
with no change in all cause mortality or a non-statistical change.

1008
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,880
Most of the time you just don't see a change or it's a change that's very slight.

1009
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:31,040
And then you have to ask yourself the question, even if it looks like, hey, death went up

1010
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,060
or down of other causes, you have to go back and ask yourself, was the study actually able

1011
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,440
to detect that?

1012
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,080
That's a very hard thing to detect.

1013
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,080
Absolutely.

1014
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,160
In fact, there's even a paper that I pointed to recently that says, is this even worth

1015
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,460
chasing after?

1016
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,640
Because it takes so much expense and time in order to get to a level in which it would

1017
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,140
be powered to detect for all cause mortality.

1018
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,280
Should we even make that part of the criteria that's required?

1019
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,960
Well, there's a broader issue here, which is the lifetime exposure problem.

1020
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Exactly.

1021
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,200
And this is, of course, just the problem with atherosclerosis in general is you do a drug

1022
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,480
study that's two, three years.

1023
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,840
But atherosclerosis doesn't take two to three years from zero to...

1024
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:12,920
I try to not get into any wars on Twitter, but once in a while I'm just, I don't know,

1025
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,680
I've had one, two, few topo chicos and I'll let it rip.

1026
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:20,500
But if I have to see one more person try to tell me why Fourier and Odyssey aren't interesting

1027
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,840
trials because they didn't show a big enough benefit, I might scream.

1028
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:30,800
So just for the listener, Fourier and Odyssey were trials that looked at two PCSK9 inhibitors.

1029
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,800
I want to also be clear before I get into my rant.

1030
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,200
I am never having an economic discussion about this.

1031
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:43,720
I'm saying that because people often confuse efficacy and effectiveness and cost and value

1032
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,800
and benefit.

1033
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,040
And I am not for a moment suggesting those things don't matter.

1034
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,360
I am not going to argue one way or the other that the cost of a PCSK9 inhibitor is worth

1035
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,360
it.

1036
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,520
That's an individual decision.

1037
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,880
Unfortunately, that decision is for most people made by their insurance company, and that's

1038
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,480
totally reasonable.

1039
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:08,000
I'm only interested in this as a conceptual tool, which is does inhibiting PCSK9 make

1040
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,120
a difference?

1041
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:15,080
And if you had told me, I remember knowing this, that Fourier and Odyssey had such short

1042
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,400
time horizons, I thought there's no way they'd find a benefit.

1043
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,080
In particular, Fourier.

1044
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:27,200
So Fourier took patients with an average LDL cholesterol of something like 90 or 92 milligrams

1045
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,840
per deciliter.

1046
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,440
These patients were already on the maximum tolerated dose of a statin.

1047
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,160
So they're at the 10th percentile in terms of their LDL-C.

1048
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,800
And in 2.2 years showed a reduction in events.

1049
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,000
The null hypothesis should be it should have never worked.

1050
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,400
You should have needed 20 years to show any benefit when you understand Alan Snyderman's

1051
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,520
lifetime exposure model.

1052
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,680
So a lot of people are critical and say it didn't show a mortality benefit.

1053
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:02,200
It just reduced revascularizations and events in 2.2 years to which I say, you're looking

1054
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,520
at that incorrectly.

1055
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,480
The fact that it showed anything to your point, Dave, lifetime exposure is staggering also

1056
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,520
on patients who are already maximally statinized.

1057
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:18,480
So coming back to this thing about lifetime exposure, this is where the Mendelian randomization

1058
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,800
becomes a very important tool in understanding LDL's causality.

1059
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,640
What you alluded to at the outset, you are correct in noting is deficient.

1060
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:36,740
There is no lifetime study where without a drug you can prospectively manipulate LDL

1061
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,460
and follow people for 100 years and determine outcomes.

1062
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,000
That would be the ideal study.

1063
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
That would be.

1064
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
You actually, you talked about this in the straight dope.

1065
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,760
No, I remember sort of going on.

1066
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,760
That's right, the magic wand test.

1067
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,400
And I think it's worth plugging in something important here.

1068
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,960
I've already said this on a prior podcast and I don't want anyone to misunderstand

1069
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,840
that you don't necessarily buy into the zero LDL hypothesis.

1070
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,640
You don't know that you would have LDL at zero.

1071
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:05,680
So you do believe there's some kind of trade off and you mentioned a few, for example,

1072
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,640
commonly known diseases for when your LDL actually gets to such a low level like cognitive

1073
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,640
disease and so forth.

1074
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,920
The way I would say it is this.

1075
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,680
So I'm glad you brought this up because it is a very important distinction.

1076
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:22,640
I absolutely believe that the lower the LDL, the lower the risk of cardiovascular disease,

1077
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,120
all other things equal.

1078
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
Why?

1079
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,200
Because LDL is necessary but not sufficient for atherosclerosis.

1080
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,280
And I say that full stop.

1081
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,960
Now it's important to understand what necessary but not sufficient means because there's going

1082
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,840
to be some people listening to this who are getting all phosphorylated now and they're

1083
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,120
just getting super pissed off.

1084
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,000
And my advice is sit down, shut up for a minute and pay attention.

1085
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,400
I have points for the phosphorylated insert by the way.

1086
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,400
That's for us lipid files.

1087
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Yeah, yeah.

1088
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,000
So necessary but not sufficient is the relationship between oxygen and fire.

1089
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,760
Oxygen is necessary but not sufficient for fire.

1090
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,800
Can you have oxygen and not fire?

1091
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,840
Yes.

1092
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,600
Can you have fire without oxygen?

1093
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,800
No.

1094
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,000
The lower the concentration of oxygen, the less likely you are to spontaneously get a

1095
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
fire.

1096
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,840
So, and again, that's a bit of an oversimplification because there are so many other factors and

1097
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:20,080
endothelial health and oxidation and inflammation of course are so important here.

1098
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:26,360
But the problem I have with the zero LDL model, which again, I think I don't want to speak

1099
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:30,040
for people who, but I think what people are basically saying is there's a subset of people

1100
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:34,280
in the medical community who are saying we should just be driving LDL to zero because

1101
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
that's the best thing.

1102
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,080
Well, my view is, as you said, no, that's not necessarily the best thing.

1103
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,400
That might be the best thing for the heart.

1104
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,120
In other words, it might be the best thing to lower the risk of atherosclerosis, but

1105
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,320
it's irrelevant because it might come at other costs.

1106
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,880
And so it depends on your point of view.

1107
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:55,460
I do from time to time get into arguments with other physicians who take care of my

1108
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:00,080
patients as well because I'm not a primary care physician, so I have to share my responsibility

1109
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,560
with other physicians.

1110
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,720
And about twice or three times a year, I do have to sort of go to war with one of these

1111
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,480
docs and it's usually over one extreme or the other.

1112
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,360
And the most recent example of this was a patient of mine who came to me on 80 milligrams

1113
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,880
of Lipitor, which is the maximum dose of Lipitor.

1114
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,480
He had a very high calcium score and a very bad CTA, but he had not had an event that

1115
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,960
we knew of.

1116
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,920
But for all intents and purposes, this is a secondary prevention patient, meaning we

1117
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,080
define secondary as has he had an event or not?

1118
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,460
Well, he has had an event.

1119
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,880
His event is look at his coronary arteries, right?

1120
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:42,240
But nevertheless, he came on 80 milligrams of Lipitor and his LDL cholesterol was very

1121
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,320
low, but his particle number was not quite at goal.

1122
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,600
The goal for a patient like that would be 10th percentile or lower, given how aggressively

1123
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,600
you're managing.

1124
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,560
He also had a slight elevation of LPa.

1125
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,560
So I added Zettia, which because he had very high levels of absorption, not uncommon given

1126
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,540
how much his cholesterol synthesis was being hit.

1127
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,880
And that brought him into goal.

1128
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,820
So now he was totally at goal.

1129
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,520
His cardiologist was happy.

1130
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:14,400
I was marginally happy, but what I didn't like was his desmosterol level was now unmeasurable.

1131
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,760
Now it turned out it was unmeasurable before, but I was so fixated on just trying to get

1132
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,760
him in the right zone.

1133
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,840
But now we had some breathing room and I said, you know, now that I'm thinking about it,

1134
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,520
oh, and by the way, in the interim, Rapatha and Pralulint had been approved.

1135
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,000
These are PCSK9 inhibitors.

1136
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,800
And I thought, this guy has no measurable cholesterol in terms of synthetic function.

1137
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,280
So it's very, very low.

1138
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,240
Now a lot of people right now going, aha, aha, that's the problem with those statins.

1139
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,960
They inhibit cholesterol synthesis.

1140
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,520
Well, careful.

1141
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
That's true.

1142
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:48,400
But every cell makes more than enough cholesterol for its own use with maybe a couple of exceptions.

1143
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,640
Gonadal tissues, steroidal tissues, during periods of high stress need to borrow cholesterol

1144
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,960
from other tissues.

1145
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,320
But for the most part, every cell can sufficiently produce its own cholesterol.

1146
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,160
I think you're right on the most part.

1147
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:05,920
I'm not sure if I am convinced that every, I mean, your body is running a buffet.

1148
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,920
That's the bloodstream.

1149
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:11,920
The bloodstream is this buffet of things that the body anticipates it wants to make available

1150
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,720
on demand to cells.

1151
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,000
And I believe, I mean, again, this is kind of just the engineering approach.

1152
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But we don't know that's true.

1153
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,080
That's a hypothesis with respect to the lipoproteins, at least.

1154
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,480
Absolutely true hypothesis, but it's not been proven to the other side as well.

1155
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,480
Right?

1156
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:29,400
We can see that the synthesis can happen within most cells to be able to make their own cholesterol.

1157
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,160
Do we have even in vitro studies where we can actually observe that every amount of

1158
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,600
cholesterol that they would need would ultimately be synthesized even under periods of stress,

1159
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,640
like for example, muscle repair and growth?

1160
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,760
Well, we have natural experiments, right?

1161
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:48,120
We can look at the A-beta hypolipaproteinemia patients who can't traffic cholesterol.

1162
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,920
Therefore they would be entirely dependent on their own cellular endogenous production

1163
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,840
and they seem completely fine.

1164
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,380
So that's not proof because we don't have proof to your point, but it's certainly evidence

1165
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,580
to suggest.

1166
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:05,300
I mean, we also know when that's off, right?

1167
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,300
So like one of the first things we used to see in the ICU, though at the time I didn't

1168
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:13,140
pay any attention to it, was any time a patient came in and they were septic or under great

1169
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:17,820
stress, so they had what's called systemic inflammatory response syndrome, SERS, so you

1170
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:23,180
could be in a car accident, you were shot, you have a horrible infection, their HDL cholesterol

1171
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,860
would transiently take a huge bump.

1172
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,860
And I didn't think anything of it at the time other than it was neat.

1173
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,380
It was like, wow, 2x bump in HDL cholesterol overnight.

1174
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:37,340
I think I would now look back and interpret those data as huge reverse cholesterol transport.

1175
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:42,760
Now the HDL is going out of its way to deliver cholesterol to probably the adrenal glands

1176
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:48,220
first and foremost because the enormous uptake of glucocorticoid, even epinephrine or epinephrine

1177
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,220
are needed.

1178
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:53,300
So clearly there are examples of when this is not a homeostatic balance.

1179
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,860
So I'll take your point that—

1180
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:00,860
Because the A-beta lipoproteinemia patients, in theory, should be the ones who are out

1181
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,460
living us all, right?

1182
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,660
They can take out the whole component of heart disease, of atherosclerotic plaque, everything.

1183
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:11,740
They should have massive longevity, relatively speaking, to everybody else.

1184
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:16,460
So there's only about 12 genes that are well enough studied, we have enough patients that

1185
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:24,580
we think we know something, and the most important of the longevity genes in cardiac is the hypo-functioning

1186
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,060
Apo-C3s.

1187
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:28,140
And that actually shows a net—

1188
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,040
A net longevity benefit.

1189
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:36,180
So work out of Albert Einstein has identified these roughly a dozen genes, and the hypo-functioning

1190
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:42,700
Apo-C3s—I mean, most of those genes are like GHR, IGF.

1191
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,940
Apo-E would be one, right?

1192
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:49,340
So Apo-E2 would carry with it protective benefits in terms of longevity, both cardiac, but more

1193
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,180
of it is neurodegenerative.

1194
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,180
But it's those C3s.

1195
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,780
In fact, as we have kind of alluded to a couple of times, I believe there's in any

1196
01:12:55,780 --> 01:13:00,980
sense oligonucleotide in clinical trials now trying to impair Apo-C3.

1197
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,620
So now that's becoming a therapeutic target.

1198
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,220
Dayspring alluded to that one, actually.

1199
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,220
Yeah.

1200
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,700
And again, this is one of those drugs that might not have much of a benefit in an insulin-sensitive

1201
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:08,700
person.

1202
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,580
They may have already captured that benefit by lowering insulin levels.

1203
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:16,620
Well, and that's actually part of what this kind of energy model, particularly that with

1204
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,540
hyper-responders, specifically lean mass hyper-responders comes back to.

1205
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,900
I know you don't necessarily hang out on Twitter too much, but you know that I have

1206
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,900
had—

1207
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,900
More than I would like.

1208
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,220
I have this pinned tweet.

1209
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,460
I've been pinging lots of lipid-lowering experts on this.

1210
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:38,100
I've said, look, I'm looking for any studies that show people with high LDL will have high

1211
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:44,260
cardiovascular disease if they likewise have high HDL and low triglycerides.

1212
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,260
But there's one qualification.

1213
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,500
It can't be a gene or drug study.

1214
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,500
That's two qualifications.

1215
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,500
Oh, fair enough.

1216
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,500
Two qualifications.

1217
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,580
But here's my concern with that, Dave.

1218
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,300
I have no doubt in my mind that you are a truth seeker.

1219
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,700
I don't think that's true of necessarily some of your peers.

1220
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:03,580
I do think a number of your peers are deluded and so filled with their own confirmation

1221
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:08,200
bias and so unwilling to acknowledge that their precious low carbohydrate diets could

1222
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:15,440
be hurting them that not with malicious intent, but with blind carelessness, they are absolutely

1223
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,440
ambivalent to anything.

1224
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:21,560
I don't put you in that category, so I will challenge you in the following way.

1225
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:27,920
When you say, show me an example of something that is not a genetic study that can point

1226
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:33,040
to that phenotype, the reason I would call issue with that is why would you limit yourself

1227
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,040
from genetic studies?

1228
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:40,560
It's sort of like me saying, show me—I want to know if there are people who are six feet

1229
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,560
tall.

1230
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,140
I think they might be, but I've never seen one.

1231
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,360
So if you can go into a kindergarten class and find me one, I'll believe it.

1232
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,560
But you must limit yourself to the kindergarten class.

1233
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,240
I mean, that's an obscure example.

1234
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:56,960
What I'm basically saying is you're excluding so much potential data by excluding all of

1235
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,760
the genetics, because when people talk about genetic studies, we have to remember something.

1236
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,540
Most of the genes, most of the SNPs that lead to alterations in lipids and lipid metabolism

1237
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,540
are completely unidentified.

1238
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:13,620
I mean, FH, for example, familial hypercholesterolemia, which would be the most obvious example to

1239
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:17,640
counter that point, you're excluding because it's a genetic condition.

1240
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:23,820
But what the listener might not know is that FH is a phenotypic diagnosis, not a genotypic

1241
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,820
diagnosis.

1242
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:30,200
FH is arguably the most heterogeneous collection of genes you can imagine.

1243
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,860
So why would we exclude looking at those people when that's, in many ways, one of the richest

1244
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:41,220
bodies of evidence for a natural experiment in—to answer the question, can you have high

1245
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:47,060
LDL-C, high HDL-C, low triglyceride, and still get atherosclerosis?

1246
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,060
That's the question you're asking, right?

1247
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,060
Yes, yes.

1248
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,660
Well, so we'll double back to that in a sec, but basically you're taking us back to genes,

1249
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:56,860
and this is why—this is another hypothesis, fully untested.

1250
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:01,420
I'm in the process of trying to collect on it, but I call this loosely cellular lipid

1251
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,900
malabsorption, or I just generally shorten it to lipid malabsorption.

1252
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,900
Basically here's the issue that I have with the existing Mendelian randomizations.

1253
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:13,940
For that matter, almost all of the gene-based studies is what we're trying to get is as

1254
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:19,620
much as we can the isolation of just a higher gradient of LDL particle count, right?

1255
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,580
That's what we all secretly—we want your wand that you're talking about where we can

1256
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:27,940
wave it and then there's just magically more LDL particles in some people, or for that

1257
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:34,260
matter, less LDL particles without touching any other parts of the process.

1258
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:41,520
The problem is that I believe of—I'm keeping a list of my own S&Ps of those genes that

1259
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:47,580
are either resulting in higher or lower LDL-C, and unfortunately of the ones that I find

1260
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:53,540
in the Mendelian randomizations, they don't just result in the higher LDL-C and LDL-P.

1261
01:16:53,540 --> 01:17:00,860
They also come to be that way because there's a lack of lipids or lipoprotein uptake by

1262
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,860
the cells.

1263
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,360
Therefore, particularly with endothelial cells, you've got to be concerned that that could

1264
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,380
cause dysfunction and therefore could be a reason for why you would have higher levels

1265
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,020
of atherosclerosis.

1266
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:12,020
And this is why I'm trying—

1267
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,020
Wait, wait, wait.

1268
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,100
Explain that part again, the last part.

1269
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,020
Entithelial cells being dysfunctional.

1270
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:19,660
Would that be potentially problematic for atherosclerosis?

1271
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:20,660
Yes.

1272
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:21,660
Okay.

1273
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:27,540
Then why would we want to look at any SNP that would in any way impair or inhibit them

1274
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,620
relative to a normal person's endothelial cell?

1275
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:35,420
Why do we believe patients or a subset of patients with FH as a result of their FH have

1276
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,900
defective endothelial cells?

1277
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,420
Well, if you've got defective LDL receptors.

1278
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,820
There's no receptors on the endothelial cell.

1279
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,820
It's diffusion mediated.

1280
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,660
Yes, but you've got the receptors with the adipocytes, right?

1281
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:52,620
Yes, but at least 20, if not 40 percent of LDL uptake is not even receptor bound in the

1282
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,620
body.

1283
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,620
Okay, but what about that?

1284
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:55,620
Which is—

1285
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:58,420
And not all cases of FH have receptor deficiencies.

1286
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:06,020
So there are at least 2,000 vaguely identified genetic causes of familial hypercholesterolemia.

1287
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,540
They have fewer receptors.

1288
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,340
So the PCSK9s are a subset of FH, right?

1289
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:13,100
About three to five percent of patients with FH have—

1290
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,100
Overexpression of PCSK9?

1291
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,100
Overexpression of PCSK9.

1292
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,100
Gotcha.

1293
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,900
In fact, that's how PCSK9 was first discovered.

1294
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,820
Okay, but in that case, you're impacting a cell's capability of uptake for lipids or

1295
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:24,020
for lipoproteins, right?

1296
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,020
Yes.

1297
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:31,420
In that situation, those patients' livers will take up less LDL because they— PCSK9

1298
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:36,460
is a protein that does, among other things, degrades the LDL receptors because they have

1299
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,620
hyperfunctioning PCSK9.

1300
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:43,820
They are more rapidly degrading their LDL receptors on the livers, so they're taking

1301
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:48,520
up less LDL particles, which explains why they have higher LDL.

1302
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,900
But this again introduces a dysfunction on the lipid metabolism itself.

1303
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,140
But that has nothing to do with the endothelium.

1304
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,580
That has nothing to do with atherosclerosis occurs.

1305
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,660
All that's doing is giving you more LDL in circulation.

1306
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:59,940
Let me put it this way.

1307
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:05,780
Why not take anything that results in a higher level of LDL-C or LDL-P that doesn't impact

1308
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:08,100
any lipid absorption from any tissue at all?

1309
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,620
Right, but that might be a bit of an artificial constraint, right?

1310
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:15,360
I mean, as you pointed out yourself, and I think anybody listening to this will appreciate,

1311
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,540
this is a complicated dynamic system.

1312
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:23,380
So it is going to be difficult to have some perturbation in a system that will lower

1313
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:26,260
or raise LDL that won't have some other effect.

1314
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:32,020
The question is, how do we, with some reasonable degree of certainty, look at those other effects

1315
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:36,620
and ask whether or not they're germane to the question of atherosclerosis and the causality

1316
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,820
of LDL to atherosclerosis?

1317
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:44,520
So I think the PCSK9 example is not an unreasonable one because we have a pretty clear understanding

1318
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,700
of what that gene does.

1319
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:49,200
We have a very clear understanding of where that protein lives and what it's doing.

1320
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:53,220
But if anything that's resulting in the other direction, where if you have lower LDL-C or

1321
01:19:53,220 --> 01:20:00,440
LDL-P from an under expression of the PCSK9, that actually results in a hyper absorption

1322
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,900
of lipids, for example.

1323
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,900
In the liver, yeah.

1324
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,540
They have enhanced hepatic clearance.

1325
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,980
So both ends of that though, right?

1326
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:12,020
So if you have hyperfunctioning and hypofunctioning PCSK9 patients out there, both of whom exist,

1327
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:16,760
I believe the hyperfunctionings were discovered first, but the hypofunctionings are kind

1328
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:21,200
of the ones that gave the drug companies the desire to go and, or not the desire, I guess

1329
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,840
the idea to go and create a drug to mimic that phenotype.

1330
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:30,040
But these patients walk around with LDL cholesterol of 10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter.

1331
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,440
And as far as anybody can tell, there's no other side effect of that.

1332
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,600
Well, and this is the thing I want to zero in on, is let's say that we do that.

1333
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,280
Let's say that we go, okay, never mind this side part of the lipid hypothesis end of it,

1334
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,460
or I'm sorry, the lipid metabolism end of it.

1335
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,840
We should then be able to look back at these people with the more novel versions of S and

1336
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,580
P's and assuming that there's at least a large enough population, we should see that longevity.

1337
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:57,580
Your mentioning of the ApoC3 from earlier is the first that I've been able to find of

1338
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,580
that one.

1339
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:01,860
I'm interested to see if we would see that across the board with these people who have

1340
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:02,860
these S and P's.

1341
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:03,860
Yeah.

1342
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,480
I mean, I suspect it will have to do with how many of them there are and how long they're

1343
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,480
being tracked.

1344
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:14,180
I sympathize with your concern is it's absolutely the case in nutrition, nutrition, medicine.

1345
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:18,940
There's certainly a lot of personalities that are out there, but I can understand, at least

1346
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,900
for me on my end, I like hard endpoints over soft endpoints.

1347
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,660
Maybe it's just the engineering me, I like ones and zeros.

1348
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,740
Death is pretty easy to diagnose.

1349
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:31,420
Whereas soft endpoints, the downside is there can be arbitrary decision making on the part

1350
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,420
of the patient and the doctor is to...

1351
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,420
Yeah.

1352
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,860
I heard you mentioned that on one of the podcasts.

1353
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,920
I got to tell you, I disagree with that.

1354
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,900
Having seen more patients in an ER when I was in residency with MIs, I can honestly

1355
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:48,020
tell you, Dave, never once knew what their cholesterol levels were.

1356
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:52,400
When someone comes in the ER with chest pain, I care about the advanced cardiac life support

1357
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,560
algorithm which involves oxygen, which involves an EKG, which involves troponin, which involves

1358
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:02,120
morphine, aspirin, and potentially a trip to the cath lab.

1359
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:07,820
We are nowhere in that algorithm are we asking what's their LDL and letting that help us

1360
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:10,620
think is this indigestion versus other things.

1361
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:13,940
I do take issue with calling MI a soft outcome.

1362
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,780
It's not so much whether it's a soft outcome.

1363
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:20,300
It's whether or not there are things like, say, revascularizations that can be determined

1364
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,460
based on a decision on the part of the doctor and the patient that may or may not have to

1365
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,260
do with their knowledge of the lipids.

1366
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,260
Right?

1367
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:28,260
I agree.

1368
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,820
I mean, these are all different things, but I also think we should be careful not to take

1369
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,720
mortality as the only outcome.

1370
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:36,360
I will say this, and I hate putting on the stupid doctor hat because it sounds ridiculous

1371
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,120
in this context, but unfortunately, I feel like I have to go back into and out of that

1372
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,120
world here.

1373
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:45,480
I would say at least half the patients that come to me do not actually find themselves

1374
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,180
asking for an extension in lifespan.

1375
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:51,480
My interest is longevity, but longevity has two components.

1376
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,640
How do you increase lifespan, meaning how do you delay death, and how do you improve

1377
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,640
health span?

1378
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,800
I won't go into what that means, but the bottom line is there are many people who say,

1379
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,480
I honestly have no interest in living one day longer than I might otherwise live, but

1380
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,300
I want that quality to be much higher.

1381
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,860
So if we're going to say, and again, I don't necessarily agree with that.

1382
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:15,060
I think the bigger issue is a statistical one with all-cause mortality, but nevertheless.

1383
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,740
But you're going to modality.

1384
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:20,780
Like if somebody has an MI and it actually impacts the quality of life afterwards.

1385
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:21,780
Yeah.

1386
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:22,780
Right.

1387
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:27,660
What if your quality of life is decreasing as a result of a procedure necessary or otherwise?

1388
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,660
Well, it would be-

1389
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,500
Or an MI, or a decrease in ejection fraction.

1390
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,980
Because remember, about half the people who first present with atherosclerotic coronary

1391
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:37,240
disease present with sudden death.

1392
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,520
But half the people don't, right?

1393
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,040
Half the people go through MI, stroke, God knows what else that follows.

1394
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:48,940
So again, I see it as my chief responsibility to delay the onset of death if a patient decides

1395
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:50,740
that that comes at too great a cost.

1396
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:51,740
That's great.

1397
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:52,740
That's their decision.

1398
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,080
In the end, the patients decide everything.

1399
01:23:54,100 --> 01:24:00,900
But going back to what got us here, I am convinced that if patients didn't have LDL, there would

1400
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:03,140
be little to no atherosclerosis.

1401
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:07,200
If you could give them no LDL over the duration of their life, if a patient comes to you and

1402
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,260
they've already got disease and you lower LDL, I don't think that that gets them out

1403
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,260
of the woods.

1404
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:16,380
I think that that's just stochastically moving them in the right direction.

1405
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:20,860
What we have to be careful of, and going back to that patient I was talking about, is we

1406
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:26,020
have to be able to identify the patients in whom the risk of LDL lowering is starting

1407
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:31,080
to cause a problem elsewhere, meaning they're incurring an unacceptable risk elsewhere.

1408
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:37,440
And in the case of this particular patient whose desmossteral levels had now become unmeasurable,

1409
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:42,120
my concern was we have overdone it with him on the lipid side.

1410
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:46,840
There's a safer, easier way we can lower his LDL without impairing his cholesterol synthesis

1411
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:53,380
because of the limited but to me quite convincing data on the plausibility of Alzheimer's disease

1412
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,500
in patients with overly suppressed cholesterol synthesis.

1413
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,900
I want to be really clear when I repeat that.

1414
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:02,480
I am not suggesting that statins cause Alzheimer's disease, which I know the blogosphere loves

1415
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,780
to talk about.

1416
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:07,960
If anything, statins slightly increase the risk of diabetes in susceptible people over

1417
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,200
a great period of time, but at the population level, there's actually no evidence that statins

1418
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,700
are causing Alzheimer's disease.

1419
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:18,520
However, I think there are a subset of patients who are susceptible and you have to be able

1420
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,820
to identify those patients.

1421
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:23,320
And that's the problem with population data, as you know, is you can lose the nuance.

1422
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,220
The nuance is you, right?

1423
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,760
What matters to you, Dave?

1424
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,640
In the end, I don't really care what your LDL is.

1425
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,520
I care about you not getting atherosclerosis.

1426
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,640
And if there is indeed someone walking around out there with an LDL cholesterol of 300 who's

1427
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:42,120
not getting atherosclerosis, and there are indeed examples of that, then that's great

1428
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,120
news.

1429
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:50,000
But we have to sort of use this heterogeneous population-based data to then try to probabilistically

1430
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,440
figure out what do you want to do with somebody at the individual level.

1431
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:57,020
So with this patient, in the end, after a lot of fighting, the decision was we're going

1432
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:00,960
to put him on Rapatha, or we're going to start cutting down the Lipitor until we get that

1433
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,000
desmosstrol to bump.

1434
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,560
And so we're still in the process of doing that, actually.

1435
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:09,440
So that, to me, is like kind of an example of what I would think of as hopefully where

1436
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:15,000
precision medicine would be going, which is you're now well outside of a clinical trial,

1437
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
right?

1438
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,160
There's never going to be a clinical trial that's going to ask the question if you take

1439
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,380
a bunch of patients and statinize them ad nauseam, and you drive their cholesterol synthesis

1440
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:28,160
very low and follow them for 30 years, do a subset of those people get it?

1441
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,680
No, I mean, you have to be able to look at retrospective data where those things were

1442
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,680
gathered.

1443
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,460
And we'll link to what I consider one of the best papers on this topic.

1444
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:41,340
But getting back to the challenge, in a sense, you're saying by ignoring the genetic data

1445
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:45,540
that the genetic data basically answers the question to your satisfaction, to where you

1446
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:46,540
don't need to look at non-genetic.

1447
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,540
Not alone.

1448
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:52,500
I think of it as the genetic data coupled with the pharmacologic data, coupled with

1449
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:57,480
the mechanistic data, give me a high enough degree of certainty that I am willing to act

1450
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,660
in a certain direction.

1451
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:03,820
Remember, everybody, me, you, whoever's listening to this, they have to make a decision.

1452
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:05,620
Indecision is a decision.

1453
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:10,740
So when you showed up with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1, did you have type 2 diabetes?

1454
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:11,740
Nope.

1455
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:13,380
Your doctor said, hey, I'm cool just waiting.

1456
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:16,820
But you said, no, indecision is not a decision anymore.

1457
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,900
I'm going to do something about it.

1458
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,140
Because presumably you said, look, I have a family history of this.

1459
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:24,900
I think I have a sense of what the progression of it is.

1460
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,540
And quite frankly, I don't want to wait until I have this disease to do something about

1461
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,540
it.

1462
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:32,440
So you decided indecision was not a viable decision.

1463
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,080
Indecision is a reasonable decision.

1464
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,120
But the point is people have to understand they are making a decision whatever they decide

1465
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,120
to do.

1466
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,120
Absolutely.

1467
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:43,360
Well, and for what it's worth, as I say outside of here and as I'll say on this podcast, as

1468
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,440
I actually just said at the speech, I don't know if you saw the one I did from last month,

1469
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,080
I told people I prefer they not be echo chambering.

1470
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,480
I prefer they find everything that challenges from every side.

1471
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:58,620
So with that said, going back to the lean mass hyper responder, you would say, given

1472
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:01,720
what you know right now, given everything we've just talked about, that they are at

1473
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,560
high risk of cardiovascular disease.

1474
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,560
Would that be correct?

1475
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,960
I'd want to know more data.

1476
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:11,200
But yes, if I didn't know anything else other than let's say all cardiovascular risk markers

1477
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:17,700
save LDL of 200 or higher, LDL P of typically 2000 or higher.

1478
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,000
Everything else is just pristine.

1479
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Perfect.

1480
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,160
Like CRPs at the floor there.

1481
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,960
There are LPP LA maybe let's look at this patient here.

1482
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,160
So we're going to we'll link to these labs.

1483
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,160
I asked this patient.

1484
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,480
This is a patient I saw last week.

1485
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,840
So that's the reason I printed this up because I see this so often.

1486
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,200
But I'm like, let's just get the last one.

1487
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:41,440
So this is a gentleman who's been on a low carb diet for a couple of years is achieving

1488
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,280
amazing success with it.

1489
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,280
He's a new patient to me, but he's been around the block on this stuff before.

1490
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,320
And he's got an amazing history of his labs going back many years.

1491
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:56,640
So I've seen what he looks like on and off all of these therapies on and off drugs, etc.

1492
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:00,880
But he's one of these guys where across the board looks fantastic, right?

1493
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,680
His glucose disposal is remarkable.

1494
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,200
His insulin levels are very low.

1495
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,380
His C reactive protein is zero point three.

1496
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,000
So everything looks good.

1497
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,400
So read off some of his numbers just for the folks, Dave.

1498
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,160
Does he he doesn't quite meet your lean mass because his trigs might be a bit higher.

1499
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,560
But talking about this guy's numbers.

1500
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,760
So total cholesterol is five oh four.

1501
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,760
High.

1502
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,200
This is I know what you're doing there.

1503
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,200
No, I'm just kidding.

1504
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,840
I get this all the time where somebody sends me just that number.

1505
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,840
No, no, no.

1506
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:29,840
Okay, go ahead.

1507
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,960
But anyway, total cholesterol, five oh four LDL C direct.

1508
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,400
And it's worth emphasizing just real quick for the listener when they say direct.

1509
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:40,880
It's very important to notice that because usually LDL C on a typical lab is actually

1510
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,120
calculated through the Friedwald equation.

1511
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,520
So when it's direct, that actually is a direct measurement that matters for remnant.

1512
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,520
Hope we'll get a chance to talk.

1513
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,860
We will talk remnants for sure.

1514
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:56,060
So LDL C at three sixty two, HDL C at ninety four, triglycerides at one twenty five.

1515
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:59,300
The very first question I would ask if somebody was sending this to me is whether it was faster

1516
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,300
or not.

1517
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,500
Yeah, this was but I've gone back and looked at all of his other trigs and he actually

1518
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,780
normally does reside below about 70.

1519
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:06,780
Oh, he does.

1520
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:07,780
Okay.

1521
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,780
So he would be typical for lean mass.

1522
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,540
He might have just eaten dinner a little too late or something.

1523
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,100
You know, I'm not I'm not sure what was going on.

1524
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,500
Do you want me to keep going on the particles?

1525
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,500
Yeah, go ahead.

1526
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,500
Hit the part.

1527
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:16,940
So Apo B is two eighty three.

1528
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:19,220
That actually is a little higher than I'm used to seeing.

1529
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,220
LDL P is above thirty five hundred.

1530
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:24,340
Small LDL P is at fourteen eighty three.

1531
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,700
Small dense LDL C is at forty seven.

1532
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:27,700
All right.

1533
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:28,700
We'll stop there and come back to it.

1534
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,820
So I've told you that everything else on this guy looks pretty good.

1535
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:32,900
Is this guy at risk?

1536
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:36,500
I'm actually looking ahead because I would have cared about these other markers that

1537
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,740
could indicate inflammation.

1538
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:40,660
So for example, the fibergen is is very high.

1539
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:43,220
LPPLA two is above six hundred.

1540
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:44,220
I don't know.

1541
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:46,540
In fact, I think I actually just tweeted about this recently.

1542
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:52,540
I don't know that I've seen an LPPLA two above three hundred or four hundred, I think,

1543
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:54,820
of the labs that have been sent to me.

1544
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:59,540
And I don't get a chance to interpret oxidized LDL, but you have the LDL as above hundred

1545
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,820
thirty five.

1546
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:05,220
So I would say by this lab, as it looks, I would be concerned about the triglycerides.

1547
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,580
I would ideally want the triglycerides to go down.

1548
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:11,140
But is it your impression that if his trigs were normal, he would be OK?

1549
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:15,760
I would be interested to see if the other inflammatory markers linked back to the reason

1550
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,880
as to why the tricks would be a bit higher.

1551
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,120
That would be something I'd be very curious about.

1552
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:23,640
But yes, if you were to say, I think what you're trying to drive to is if I had only

1553
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,320
the information of the lipid panel itself and it did say not 125 in the triglycerides.

1554
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,520
Let's make it even easier.

1555
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,880
Let's pretend that this patient had a zero calcium score.

1556
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,080
Well, zero calcium score.

1557
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,760
I'm not entirely on calcium score, but I do care about calcium score.

1558
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:43,880
The thing is, is I would say if you were to give me the same numbers, let me make this

1559
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:44,880
easier.

1560
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:50,080
I would say I would say if I was a big Moffitts who's very close to this, except that his

1561
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,200
triglycerides are much lower, if it was the same one, then I would I would wonder if there

1562
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,200
really was a risk.

1563
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,200
Yeah.

1564
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,200
OK.

1565
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:01,800
So again, that is a decision that every patient is going to have to make in that situation.

1566
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:07,440
In the case of this patient, I feel very strongly that he is at increased risk, though I think

1567
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:13,920
on many other metrics, I think his risk of cancer, he's actually an APOE23, this patient.

1568
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,920
He's lower.

1569
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:16,600
He's metabolically quite flexible.

1570
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:21,280
But if his other inflammation markers were low, like the LPPLA, the ox LDL, all this stuff

1571
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:25,280
that was below, would you feel he was at risk if the only thing that was different?

1572
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,840
I would still feel he is at risk because, again, this is one of the three legs of the

1573
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,000
stool, right?

1574
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
It's the burden of lipoprotein.

1575
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,880
It's the endothelial function or health.

1576
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,400
And it's the inflammatory response to it.

1577
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,920
And I can't measure number two very well.

1578
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:40,920
Right.

1579
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:47,000
And number three is pretty clugy, meaning all of these things like fibrinogen and CRP

1580
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,840
are not very specific.

1581
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,960
So you have to sort of at the individual level be very careful.

1582
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,600
You don't draw too much of a false sense of confidence.

1583
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:01,000
But look, looking at him, he has among the lowest asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine

1584
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,120
levels I've ever seen.

1585
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,440
These are staggeringly low.

1586
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,280
I would have expected those to be through the roof.

1587
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:11,000
So ADMA and SDMA are things that we use to look at endothelial health.

1588
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,840
They inhibit nitric oxide synthase.

1589
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:18,480
So when ADMA and SDMA are elevated, you're inhibiting nitric oxide synthase.

1590
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,440
You have less nitric oxide produced in the endothelium.

1591
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,520
You're more prone, obviously, to constriction.

1592
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,520
I've never taken that test.

1593
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,520
I'd be interested in trying.

1594
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,040
Again, just because I'm cheap and I didn't want to print up a bunch of paper, I only

1595
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:31,440
printed two pages of this guy's labs because those are the two that are most relevant.

1596
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,960
But you can take my word for it.

1597
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,400
The others were exceptional, right?

1598
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,000
Like this is a guy who looked really good across the board.

1599
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,680
The question is, should anything be done?

1600
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:44,920
Now, if this patient had a negative calcium score, which he did not, but if he did, I

1601
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:51,080
would have still recommended lipid-lowering therapy and or modification of diet.

1602
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,760
Why modification of diet?

1603
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,920
Because I've now seen more of these patients than I can count, and there is a pattern that

1604
01:33:58,920 --> 01:33:59,920
is emerging.

1605
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,080
And I think I wrote about this in one of the cholesterol things.

1606
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,760
But the pattern that always occurs in these folks, and I say always with a relatively

1607
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:13,120
small n, maybe there's 30 of these cases I've seen, is this exact pattern.

1608
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,800
This one, he's like a perfect example of.

1609
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,680
So his desmosterol is very high.

1610
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,480
Remember what we talked about at the outset?

1611
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:25,280
When a patient's LDL particle number is through the roof, you go through the checklist.

1612
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,640
Are their triglycerides high?

1613
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:27,640
No.

1614
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:33,800
No way in hell a trig of 120 accounts for someone being above the 99.9th percentile

1615
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,000
of LDL particle.

1616
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,880
Does he have an LDL receptor defect?

1617
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:43,040
It turns out I don't think so, because I've seen his, even though I haven't seen his LDL-P,

1618
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:47,600
I've seen his LDL-C off a ketogenic diet, and it was 125.

1619
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,600
Right.

1620
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,200
Is he lean and or fit?

1621
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,200
He is.

1622
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,200
Okay.

1623
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,860
So his cholesterol synthesis is through the roof, and his cholesterol absorption is quite

1624
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:56,860
high as well.

1625
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,060
Are these affordable tests?

1626
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:01,460
Because I would definitely want to turn these around to the existing group of lean mass

1627
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,460
hypersprongers.

1628
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:05,060
I'm sure the cash cost on these is not onerous.

1629
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:11,860
But my point is, I think that the explanation for this phenotype is the upregulation cholesterol

1630
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:15,180
synthesis from the saturated fat.

1631
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,140
I don't think this is an energy issue per se.

1632
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:23,580
I think this is a sterile regulated binding protein issue, or some sort of regulatory

1633
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:29,780
path around what the body is doing with ketones and or saturated fat.

1634
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:33,260
Tom Dayspring told me this a long time ago, and I totally forgot about it.

1635
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,500
And then the other day I went and looked up a case, because I never paid attention to

1636
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,500
this.

1637
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,500
We used to see patients all the time with diabetic ketoacidosis.

1638
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:45,280
So these are usually patients with type 1 diabetes that come in the ER, and usually

1639
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,700
it's precipitated by some acute illness.

1640
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:51,580
But basically what happens is their glucose level becomes very high.

1641
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,780
They don't have enough insulin, of course.

1642
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:56,180
They get a bunch of electrolyte abnormalities, but they present with very high levels of

1643
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,180
ketones.

1644
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:58,180
This actually is an emergency.

1645
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:02,900
So all the talk about ketosis being dangerous, this is the example of where it is very dangerous.

1646
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,820
It's life threatening.

1647
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:07,020
So what I didn't realize is I went back and looked.

1648
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:11,940
It turns out a lot of these people have very elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and total

1649
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,940
cholesterol.

1650
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,540
Now, they also have elevated levels of triglyceride.

1651
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:18,320
But of course, it's hard to know exactly what's driving that.

1652
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:24,760
But once you correct this metabolic deficit, which is quite easy to correct, it's basically

1653
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:30,360
potassium, IV fluids, glucose, and insulin, and you normalize their glucose levels and

1654
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:34,840
their fluid balance and their electrolytes, the cholesterol returns to normal.

1655
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:40,760
So it might be that the ketones themselves are a substrate to make more cholesterol.

1656
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:44,760
And again, we'll link to a great paper that Tom wrote on Lipaholics several years ago,

1657
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:52,560
where he goes through the biochemistry of how saturated fats specifically and ketones

1658
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,000
could in a susceptible individual produce this phenotype.

1659
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:03,840
And so bringing it back to this idea of genes, we might really be dealing with a subset of

1660
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,440
people, these hyper responders, whoever, whatever percentage of the population they are, who

1661
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,400
are the people that are susceptible to this?

1662
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,600
Because you were not going to find a leaner person exercising harder than I was when

1663
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,880
I went on a ketogenic diet.

1664
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,780
But I never had this response.

1665
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:23,000
But there is a distinction that I tend to find in this is Occam's razor.

1666
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,240
Again, more theory.

1667
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,920
And I'm actually going to be testing this myself in the next series of experiments that

1668
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,620
I'm doing.

1669
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,120
There is a difference between those people who are doing things like, say, endurance

1670
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:35,680
running and weightlifting or resistance training.

1671
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:40,780
And that I think that there is a greater overall gradient of receptor-mediated endocytosis

1672
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:42,180
for muscle repair and growth.

1673
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,980
Now, I could be wrong about that.

1674
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:47,100
But I'll be very curious to see if that turns out to be the case when I'm doing it myself.

1675
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:51,580
Sorry, a greater amount of endocytosis of which lipoprotein and for which product?

1676
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:53,060
Of LDL-P in particular.

1677
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:54,060
Into muscles?

1678
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:55,060
Yeah.

1679
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,060
For what product?

1680
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:57,060
For repair and growth.

1681
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:02,000
So you're saying that in these people, they're relying on their LDL for cholesterol delivery

1682
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
to the muscle?

1683
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,820
Well, and phospholipids and just about anything else that would be inside of an LDL particle.

1684
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:11,460
There's existing studies that are out there as far as those people who do a lot of weight

1685
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,620
training will also see lower LDL-C.

1686
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,140
And this is why I'm saying it's completely theoretical.

1687
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:19,700
I'll actually be testing this myself over the next few weeks because I'm actually going

1688
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:23,780
to be eating to a very fixed diet, fixed sleep schedule, fixed everything, and then

1689
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:27,860
actually be introducing basically any way in which I can get my muscles sore in a very

1690
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:31,060
fixed fashion that I can then turn around as data.

1691
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:36,660
And if the hypothesis is true, I would expect that my LDL-C and my LDL-P might change.

1692
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:37,660
But I'm confused.

1693
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:43,380
Why is the runner's muscle more demanding than the weight lifter's muscle or vice versa?

1694
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,580
The other way around.

1695
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:47,900
That I doubt I would see the weight lifter actually seeing a difference.

1696
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:51,660
Because I think there's more use of the product of LDL-P directly by the cells.

1697
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,860
I may be wrong about that.

1698
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,060
But what's the evidence that that's happening?

1699
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:58,460
The evidence as far as the keto gains groups, I'm sure you've heard of them.

1700
01:38:58,460 --> 01:38:59,460
No.

1701
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,420
There's a ketogenic group that's keto gains.

1702
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:04,860
There's not as many lean mass hyper-responders that come out of that group.

1703
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,340
People tend to see their LDL-C go up, but not as pronounced as those people who are

1704
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:13,420
like say runner types or aerobic types or even people who are doing yoga.

1705
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:17,820
There seems to be actually a more pronounced difference of higher LDL-C depending on how

1706
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:20,340
much you're doing resistance training or anaerobic training.

1707
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:26,000
I'm not aware of any evidence to suggest that the muscle is relying on LDL for delivery

1708
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,660
of anything, including energy.

1709
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,820
Well, and I'm not so sure about it on energy.

1710
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:34,240
What I'm thinking about is in terms of just raw material.

1711
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:39,280
As far as damage that can happen to, for example, the membrane of a cell.

1712
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:43,860
I realize this is kind of a key difference between us in that your sense is that effectively

1713
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,400
anything that the cell is going to need, it can basically synthesize on its own, right?

1714
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,400
No.

1715
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:54,720
I think my sense is that Occam's razor would at least have me start from a place of plausibility.

1716
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:59,880
I'm not aware of any data that suggests that LDL is functioning to do this.

1717
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:05,400
What's the value of non-hepatic receptor-mediated endocytosis from your perspective?

1718
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:10,900
You're talking about very specifically the little bit of LDL that gets out of circulation

1719
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:14,320
either with or without a receptor to non-hepatic tissue.

1720
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,320
Yes.

1721
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:20,720
My sense is the most important value of that would be to tissues that need more cholesterol

1722
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,040
to synthesize hormones.

1723
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:25,880
But specifically cholesterol and not like the phospholipids or anything else that's

1724
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:26,880
on there.

1725
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,640
Phospholipids probably may be more delivered through others.

1726
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:35,200
I mean, certainly the VLDL delivers far more phospholipid than LDL.

1727
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,400
But LDL is really a custom-built package for cholesterol.

1728
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:43,760
Like if you look at how many cholesterol molecules fit inside an LDL particle versus even an

1729
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:44,760
HDL particle.

1730
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:49,600
Remember, the HDL is the general of RCT.

1731
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,640
And yet it can still only carry about 50 molecules of cholesterol.

1732
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:58,280
The LDL particle can carry 1500 molecules of cholesterol.

1733
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,360
That's staggering when you, again, consider the size of these things.

1734
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,560
It's tailor-made for that.

1735
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:05,240
And that is largely conserved.

1736
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:09,240
I don't want to get us too far in the weeds, but I actually did a very interesting kinetic

1737
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,800
experiment many years ago.

1738
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:18,920
So I did three blood tests every day for three days, like the full NMR panel.

1739
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,000
But this is with kinetics.

1740
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,480
So this is not commercially available.

1741
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:26,640
What you're looking at is my ability to track, and you'll have to lay it down because I barely

1742
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:31,680
remember what I did here, but this is pre-workout, immediately post-workout, four hours later

1743
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:36,560
looking at my LDL particles, my VLDL particles, my HDL particles, both in terms of their cholesterol

1744
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,200
and triglyceride content.

1745
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,480
You see them going down yourself?

1746
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,560
I don't see any change in the cholesterol content.

1747
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,760
It's minimal change in cholesterol content, right?

1748
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:49,560
What I think you see here is, yeah, wow, under really periods of super high intense exercise,

1749
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,280
I actually did take some triglycerides out of this.

1750
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,280
Minimal out of here.

1751
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:58,880
By the way, this backs up Garvey's data, which is there's virtually no way to distinguish

1752
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,320
what's going on at the VLDL level.

1753
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,480
We can't tell what's a remnant here or what's not a remnant.

1754
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,480
I apologize for the listener.

1755
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,240
We're looking at the chart, but we're going to link to it so you'll see it.

1756
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:12,160
We're basically talking about this idea of how much movement of cholesterol is going

1757
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:15,360
into and out of the LDL particle under these extreme conditions.

1758
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,880
So I just did different types of workouts.

1759
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:21,080
On this day, I did the crazy high intensity interval training.

1760
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,840
On this day, I did a crazy intense swim.

1761
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,080
I think on this day was the hardest workout of them all was a crazy intense bike ride.

1762
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,360
The listener can't see this, but I'm smiling ear to ear.

1763
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,880
It's almost as if you knew I was.

1764
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:32,880
I forgot I did this.

1765
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,880
I did this six, seven years ago.

1766
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,880
That's fantastic.

1767
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,840
Again, it's not commercially.

1768
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,520
These are not assays that can be reproduced.

1769
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,480
Again, I suspect you and I will look at these differently.

1770
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:47,480
I'm looking at these to say the VLDL is definitely moving its triglyceride.

1771
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,520
The LDL a little bit.

1772
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,760
The cholesterol is barely moving.

1773
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:57,480
Now this is different from a broader issue, which is how much did my cholesterol actually

1774
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:00,440
change in those nine blood draws?

1775
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:03,320
Well that was the variability of my LDL-P.

1776
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:07,160
So we'll link to a graph that shows LDL-P versus LDL-C.

1777
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:10,480
These are nine points across three days.

1778
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:16,480
I wish I could go back in time, find the U of what is this like 2012, 2013, something

1779
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,480
like that?

1780
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,080
Yeah, probably 2011 or 2012.

1781
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,080
I'd be a Peter.

1782
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,080
This is Dave from the future.

1783
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:24,800
I need you to eat exactly the same thing you do on all these days.

1784
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,800
Yeah, I pretty much did.

1785
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:26,800
Oh, you did?

1786
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1787
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,800
Okay.

1788
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,800
I can hold for that.

1789
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:30,800
Yeah.

1790
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,800
Okay, good.

1791
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:32,800
And I was timing exactly when I would eat it.

1792
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,800
This is back when I was very strictly in ketosis.

1793
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,800
Fantastic.

1794
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,800
That's effectively what I'll be doing.

1795
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,800
So I'll actually have, I'll add a two to your end, but I'm super excited to be seeing

1796
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,800
this now.

1797
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:43,400
Yeah, but you're not going to have, unfortunately, this.

1798
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:47,000
I mean, this to me is the interesting part is, this is the part that surprised me the

1799
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,600
most was how little the cholesterol was actually moving out of the LDL.

1800
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,880
Even when the particle was going down.

1801
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,520
And remember, the height of this bar is artificial.

1802
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,520
It doesn't mean anything.

1803
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,840
This is not the LDL-P, right?

1804
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,760
This is milligrams per deciliter, milligrams per deciliter of cholesterol of triglyceride.

1805
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:05,920
Maybe I'm getting a little confused here.

1806
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:10,080
How do you know about the cholesterol moving out of the LDL-P?

1807
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:15,640
Because well, what I can say is before the workout, there was 116 milligrams per deciliter

1808
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,200
of cholesterol in the LDL.

1809
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,240
And after the workout, that's what was there.

1810
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,280
This is how much triglyceride was in the LDL.

1811
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,280
That's what was there.

1812
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,280
Okay.

1813
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,280
So it's sort of a flux.

1814
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,280
Right.

1815
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,280
Because here's the thing.

1816
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:30,000
I mean, in a sense, we're sort of, I know you can acknowledge this as well.

1817
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,860
We don't exactly know what the true circulatory level of recycling is.

1818
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:37,580
You're just saying on a per-particle basis for testing it afterwards.

1819
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,980
Like, for example, we're talking about the pool.

1820
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:40,980
Correct.

1821
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:43,500
Not the individual particles in that sense.

1822
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,500
Yeah.

1823
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:50,340
It's basically saying if you took four snapshots in a room and how many people had blue shirts

1824
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:54,980
on and how many people had red shirts on, and you saw the deltas, you could not infer

1825
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:58,700
the actual numbers that went in and out, but just the net delta.

1826
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:02,580
So there is either a net influx or efflux of people in blue shirts or red shirts.

1827
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:03,580
Right.

1828
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:04,580
That's the best we can do.

1829
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:08,340
There may be some kinetic studies that could do even one better, but that's to me pretty

1830
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,700
interesting stuff.

1831
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,460
Let's circle back to remnants real quick.

1832
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,460
Okay.

1833
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:15,740
So this is why I kind of paused a little bit on the case study that you showed me where

1834
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:18,180
you had the triglycerides a bit higher.

1835
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:23,900
Now, as you know, what is the poor man's version of remnants is you basically can just take

1836
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,860
your triglycerides divided by five.

1837
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:26,860
You probably actually-

1838
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:27,860
No, no, no, no.

1839
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:28,860
We've got to be very clear on this stuff.

1840
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:30,020
We're going to confuse the hell out of people.

1841
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,020
Okay.

1842
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:32,780
That's the poor man's version for VLDL cholesterol.

1843
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,780
Correct.

1844
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:34,980
That's a very important distinction.

1845
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:35,980
Yes.

1846
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:39,460
So the poor man's version, which should never be done because it is such an abomination,

1847
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:42,860
is to take the triglyceride level divided by five.

1848
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:46,720
And that number would be an estimate of your VLDL cholesterol.

1849
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:50,740
What would you, Peter Attia, recommend as the most effective means by which somebody

1850
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,600
could determine the remnant cholesterol?

1851
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,600
We can't.

1852
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,600
It's impossible.

1853
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:56,260
We have no way of knowing remnant cholesterol.

1854
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:58,140
Well, let me be clear.

1855
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:02,220
I think I know what you mean by remnant, which is why I'm asking that question.

1856
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:04,060
You're asking pathologic remnant.

1857
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:11,860
You're asking VLDLs that have shed their triglyceride and are now basically pathologic,

1858
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:18,060
small, started out as big, triglyceride rich, and now have shed that through their ApoC2

1859
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:22,180
to LPL pathway and now have the potential for atherosclerosis.

1860
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,660
Is that what you're meaning about remnant?

1861
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:24,660
No.

1862
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,460
I now think we may think of it differently.

1863
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:31,540
So straight up Wikipedia right now would define remnant cholesterol as basically all cholesterol

1864
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:36,740
that's not in either an LDL particle or in a HDL particle.

1865
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:39,420
So if you were to just subtract HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

1866
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:42,980
Yeah, so if you directly measure total cholesterol, which you can, and you can directly measure

1867
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:48,220
LDL cholesterol, and you can directly measure HDL cholesterol, you subtract those two and

1868
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:53,660
you have the amount of cholesterol that is virtually all in a VLDL and presumably some

1869
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:54,780
IDL if it's stick around.

1870
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:59,100
Some IDL, possibly chylomicron remnants if you ate recently, but you shouldn't have any

1871
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,100
chylomicron remnants.

1872
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,580
Yeah, that's very easy to exclude.

1873
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:03,580
Right.

1874
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:08,500
But effectively, if you've had a fasted cholesterol test, pretty much all your remnant cholesterol

1875
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:13,060
pretty much will be in VLDL, has the longest residence time relative to the IDLs.

1876
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,060
That's correct.

1877
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:19,300
But that's sort of telling me, outside of very few pathologic states, like Fredrickson

1878
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:23,860
type 3Bs, that's as interesting to me as your eye color.

1879
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:24,860
The remnant cholesterol.

1880
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:25,860
Yeah.

1881
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:26,860
Really?

1882
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:27,860
Yeah.

1883
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:28,860
I mean, it's generally going to be very low.

1884
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:34,380
It's quite well with triglycerides, though there are lots of examples where it's been,

1885
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:38,060
actually I think I brought a copy of one of my other goofy experiments.

1886
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:43,180
I don't know if I probably won't find it anytime soon, but there was an example of how mine

1887
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:44,460
was so far off.

1888
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:49,460
It was like a 700% delta between actual versus predicted in one of these studies.

1889
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:54,740
But no, the point is like, yeah, directionally speaking, I'd love to see a VLDL cholesterol

1890
01:47:54,740 --> 01:48:00,780
below 15 milligrams per deciliter as calculated by taking non-HDL cholesterol, subtracting

1891
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:05,900
the LDL cholesterol, which if you have a direct LDL cholesterol is your best measurement of

1892
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:06,900
that.

1893
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:11,500
But whether it's 10 milligrams per deciliter, 15 milligrams per deciliter, 20 milligrams

1894
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:18,260
per deciliter, that just tells me the sum of cholesterol in all of my VLDL remnants.

1895
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:20,580
It tells me nothing about the pathology of them.

1896
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:23,440
It tells me nothing about what they've done or where they're going.

1897
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:29,760
But that said, the question then becomes even for as much as what you just qualified, does

1898
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,240
that become a more powerful predictor relative to something like say LDL cholesterol?

1899
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:39,280
Maybe but that's sort of like saying, is rubbing two stones together better than rubbing like

1900
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,280
two logs together to start a fire?

1901
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,480
It's like, why not just use a Zippo lighter, right?

1902
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:48,880
It's sort of like we could split hairs on whether non-HDL cholesterol or remnant cholesterol

1903
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,560
is a better predictor of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol.

1904
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,520
But again, given that LDL cholesterol is such a crappy predictor of cardiovascular disease,

1905
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:00,800
I prefer not to really even think about that.

1906
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:06,120
We do have now a situation where this particular phenotype, we're lean mass hyper responders,

1907
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:11,920
will have very low levels of VLDL cholesterol, have very high levels of LDL cholesterol,

1908
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,640
will have very low levels of remnant lipoproteins.

1909
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,280
But we don't know that.

1910
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,160
There's no way you've measured that.

1911
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,420
I've never measured that.

1912
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:22,220
That's not measurable in a commercial assay that's worth its salt.

1913
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:26,300
I think VAP does a vague ass version of that, but it's sort of bunk.

1914
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,260
But look at this, look at Garvey's study.

1915
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:29,500
So we'll link to this as well.

1916
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:33,660
So this is actually measuring the number of particles, right?

1917
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:36,420
So this is an insulin sensitive person.

1918
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:41,140
Their total LDL-P is about 1200.

1919
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:44,140
Their VLDLP is about 80.

1920
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:46,740
You go to someone who's insulin resistant but not diabetic.

1921
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:50,260
Their LDL-P goes up to 1435 on average.

1922
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:54,220
Their VLDL goes to 84.

1923
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,580
Their IDL is counted.

1924
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:57,200
It's a rounding error though.

1925
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:00,980
And then you take the population with type 2 diabetes.

1926
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:05,060
Their LDL cholesterol is up to 1600 nanomole per liter.

1927
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,140
And their VLDL goes up to 100.

1928
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,300
So you're right.

1929
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:14,020
The VLDL is going up as you get more insulin resistant.

1930
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,780
But it doesn't appear to be very clinically relevant, right?

1931
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:19,180
Remember, it's all the burden of disease

1932
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,980
is from these ApoB-bearing particles.

1933
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:26,980
And so the increase in VLDL particle number

1934
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,300
is not what's driving the risk of the disease.

1935
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:30,780
You actually had a really nice graph

1936
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:32,200
in one of your figures that showed,

1937
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,460
you titled it as remnant that was going up.

1938
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:36,260
Do you know the figure I'm talking about?

1939
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:37,260
We'll link to that as well.

1940
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,440
But you had a graph that showed,

1941
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:40,860
I think as people were becoming more insulin sensitive,

1942
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:42,960
their pool of remnants was growing.

1943
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,840
Well, and actually I wanna qualify something real quick.

1944
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:47,360
If I think it's the graph you're talking about,

1945
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,240
it was the one downside to that

1946
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:50,960
is it was non-fasted remnants,

1947
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,520
which I had been trying to find more fasted remnants.

1948
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:55,360
Which I have a problem with that.

1949
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,560
It was in one of your talks.

1950
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,040
It was more of your talks.

1951
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:59,440
But anyway, my point is,

1952
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:02,760
what's missing from that analysis is ApoB or LDL-P.

1953
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:03,600
Right.

1954
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,560
In other words, the expansion of that,

1955
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,840
see this study, which is,

1956
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,360
I mean the most elegant study of this ever done,

1957
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:11,520
shows that if you only saw the top line,

1958
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,280
this to this to this,

1959
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,400
everyone would be like, wow,

1960
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,520
the more insulin resistant you get,

1961
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,040
the more your total burden of ApoB goes up.

1962
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:21,080
But what this is showing is,

1963
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:22,640
where is that burden coming from?

1964
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:26,800
The VLDL only increased by 20 nanomole per liter,

1965
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:30,800
but the LDL-P increased by 400 nanomole per liter.

1966
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,640
Right.

1967
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:32,480
And the point I'm coming to is,

1968
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,400
this is where we're in uncharted territory.

1969
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,880
Is I don't believe this will apply

1970
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:38,680
to people who are ketogenic fat adapted.

1971
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,640
I don't believe this will apply

1972
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:41,920
to people who are very ketogenic fat adapted,

1973
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,080
and particularly who have this phenotype.

1974
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,840
So let me see if I can come at it this way.

1975
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,800
Right now, if I were to be able to get the dataset

1976
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,960
for a Framingham offspring,

1977
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:50,960
because that is one of the studies

1978
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,720
that I was showing out from before,

1979
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:57,160
and I could basically just do this basic calculation

1980
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,120
of remnant cholesterol the way that we were talking about,

1981
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:02,600
and conceding the point that you said earlier

1982
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,440
that there's no way to truly know.

1983
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:07,540
Would I still come up with a more valuable metric

1984
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:10,400
for subtracting HDLC and LDLC,

1985
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,160
particularly when associating it to all-cause mortality?

1986
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,960
Relative to like say, LDLC.

1987
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,520
Let me make sure understand what you're saying.

1988
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,600
You're saying, if you could develop an assay

1989
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,560
to distinguish between the pathologic remnants of VLDL

1990
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,400
versus the physiologic remnants.

1991
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,360
I'm not even developing that.

1992
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,360
Let's say I'm not even developing it.

1993
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,440
I'm just taking the existing HDLC and LDLC metrics

1994
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:31,480
as they're recorded right now.

1995
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:32,560
Like I'm not even.

1996
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,400
Oh, I see.

1997
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,280
I'm just grabbing the data set as it is right now.

1998
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:38,200
Will the remnant cholesterol

1999
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,620
that I get from that subtraction,

2000
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:42,600
will that actually be more relevant to all-cause mortality

2001
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:43,960
than say LDLC?

2002
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:47,120
I don't know, but it would certainly rival it.

2003
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,080
Again, the data are probably more clear

2004
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,500
on non-HDL cholesterol versus LDL cholesterol.

2005
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,640
That's typically what the literature talks about.

2006
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:57,320
But as you can tell, the non-HDL cholesterol

2007
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,840
and LDL cholesterol are two of the three variables

2008
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:00,720
you would need.

2009
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,600
So there's a strong correlation

2010
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,720
between non-HDL cholesterol and remnant cholesterol.

2011
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:07,320
And yes, I believe non-HDL cholesterol

2012
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:09,760
is more predictive than LDL cholesterol.

2013
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,080
But there's one problem with non-HDL cholesterol

2014
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:13,360
that I definitely want to bring up for people

2015
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,120
who are on a low-carb diet.

2016
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,720
If you're going to be powered much more

2017
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,740
by triglycerides directly,

2018
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:22,620
literally triglycerides being brought to you in LDLs,

2019
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,320
then that is going to be relevant.

2020
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,480
Now, again, conceding per what we talked about before,

2021
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:30,720
I can't know if I can stake my flag on it just yet,

2022
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,880
but I'd be willing to bet if I'm right on the energy model

2023
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,400
that in fact you are being powered more

2024
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,320
by triglycerides found in LDLs,

2025
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:39,960
then you could have a higher resulting LDL particles.

2026
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,760
But effectively, the bigger question is,

2027
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:45,800
are particularly lean mass hyper-responders showcasing

2028
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,200
directly that they are being powered much more

2029
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:51,520
by triglycerides brought on these LDL boats, if you will,

2030
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,520
and therefore having more subsequent LDL particles?

2031
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:58,240
Okay, so my hypothesis is that that is not the case.

2032
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:00,320
That it's the higher degree of synthesis, right?

2033
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,160
Yes.

2034
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:02,000
Going on with the cholesterol.

2035
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,440
That's correct, that it is the higher degree of synthesis

2036
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,800
which may or may not also be matched

2037
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,520
by a higher degree of absorption.

2038
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:13,360
If you're willing to suggest a way that we could test this,

2039
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,520
how would you suggest that?

2040
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,060
Before I do that, let me unpack

2041
01:54:16,060 --> 01:54:18,620
where I think energy is moving from, right?

2042
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:22,520
So I think we all agree that someone who is

2043
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:26,500
very insulin sensitive on a low carbohydrate, high fat diet

2044
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,080
is utilizing a lot of triglyceride.

2045
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,160
We agree on that.

2046
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:31,000
Yes.

2047
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,220
Okay, let's take an artificial construct

2048
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:36,720
and separate endogenous from exogenous triglyceride.

2049
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:40,920
Meaning someone on a low carbohydrate diet

2050
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:44,760
is eating themselves and they're eating triglycerides

2051
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,360
from the outside world.

2052
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:49,080
Assuming they're in the phase of getting leaner, right?

2053
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:52,880
So they're losing weight or even someone whose weight's

2054
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,240
static, they're utilizing their own internal stores

2055
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,120
of triglyceride that they're replenishing

2056
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,240
if they're staying weight stable.

2057
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,080
100%.

2058
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,240
Okay.

2059
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:03,840
So the exogenous triglycerides

2060
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,000
enter the body through chylomicrons.

2061
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,080
That's a pure lymphatic play through CTEP.

2062
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,320
That's rapid hydrolysis.

2063
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:12,320
I think we all get that.

2064
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:15,520
I think it's this other endogenous pool that's interesting.

2065
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,920
And if I could just interject this one thing,

2066
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,320
because this is one thing we're dancing around

2067
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,760
that we both know that probably somebody who's not familiar

2068
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,960
with my work should be aware of.

2069
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:25,080
Chylomicrons, they drop off these triglycerides

2070
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,200
and they're just gone, almost, like,

2071
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:28,280
depending on who you're reading

2072
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,160
within minutes to hours at the most.

2073
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,640
So if you're taking a fast cholesterol test,

2074
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:33,840
per what we were talking about earlier,

2075
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,240
you shouldn't see any chylomicrons

2076
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,280
or chylomicron remnants, they should be gone.

2077
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,160
And the cholesterol payload

2078
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,000
on those chylomicrons should be gone.

2079
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,440
So with that in mind, go back to the endogenous triglycerides.

2080
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:47,680
Endogenous means we're dealing with the pool

2081
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:50,560
of triglycerides that are coming out of you as the person.

2082
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,600
So you have adipocytes.

2083
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:55,640
Adipocytes store triglycerides.

2084
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:59,600
And those triglycerides are hydrolyzed,

2085
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:02,340
such that you have free fatty acids

2086
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:03,980
that will be transported.

2087
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:05,180
So where do they go?

2088
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:09,940
So when they come out of the adipocyte, who picks them up?

2089
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:11,100
Albumin.

2090
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,020
So albumin then does two things.

2091
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:16,100
It can take it directly to the muscle

2092
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:17,380
so that the muscle can use it

2093
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,740
in the highly fat adapted athlete,

2094
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:22,140
or it can take it back to the liver.

2095
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:25,460
And it can be repackaged in VLDL,

2096
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:27,220
or it could be turned into a ketone

2097
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:28,600
if we're getting into an extreme state

2098
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,300
of someone who's ketotic.

2099
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:32,500
So let's talk about Greg Moffitt,

2100
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,260
who looks like a super fit dude,

2101
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:38,200
who's running around, has a total cholesterol of 457

2102
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:39,420
milligrams per deciliter.

2103
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:43,260
His LDL cholesterol is 335.

2104
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,540
His HDL cholesterol 109.

2105
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:49,580
And his trig is 67.

2106
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:52,180
So you have, I'm assuming you did the math correctly.

2107
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:53,020
I'm not gonna check it,

2108
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:55,420
but if that's presumably the LDL is direct,

2109
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:58,300
his remnant cholesterol is 13 milligrams per deciliter.

2110
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,060
And by the way, that's not terribly far off

2111
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:03,420
from what you would get by the trig by five formula.

2112
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,620
He's not that far off.

2113
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:05,840
Okay, fine.

2114
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,660
So where is he getting his energy?

2115
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:09,740
So let's say he's out for a run.

2116
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:11,420
So he's not eating anything.

2117
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:12,680
And he's fat adapted.

2118
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,420
So he's, and he'll say he's fasted.

2119
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:15,440
Let's make it even easier.

2120
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,660
He's fasted going out for a run.

2121
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:20,660
So his adipocytes are releasing free fatty acids to albumin.

2122
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,860
The albumin is taking some fraction of that

2123
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,380
to the muscle directly.

2124
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:27,220
And they're undergoing beta oxidation there.

2125
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:29,420
The albumin is also going back to the liver.

2126
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,500
Some amount of that is being converted

2127
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:32,820
into beta hydroxybutyrate,

2128
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,660
which goes down its own metabolic pathway.

2129
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:37,020
And some amount of that is being packaged

2130
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,220
in either a VLDL or an IDL.

2131
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:42,460
Because remember, there's still de novo ILDL

2132
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:43,540
production in the liver,

2133
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:45,500
just as there's de novo LDL production.

2134
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:49,140
Those VLDLs and IDLs are leaving the liver

2135
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:53,980
and dropping off their payload of lipid to that tissue.

2136
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:58,820
So the tissue is basically getting ketones from the liver,

2137
01:57:58,820 --> 01:58:01,580
triglyceride from albumin directly to the muscle

2138
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:04,060
and triglyceride through the VLDL and IDL

2139
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:05,380
directly to the muscle.

2140
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:06,580
Do we agree on that?

2141
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,420
We do.

2142
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:09,500
I'm just gonna expand a little bit on what you just said.

2143
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,380
So yes, it's full body lipolysis

2144
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:13,980
in that he's releasing the free fatty acids.

2145
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,620
In the literature, they're usually calling him NIFA,

2146
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:16,820
his non-esterified fatty acids.

2147
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:19,160
But we'll just keep it to free fatty acids.

2148
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,000
It's getting released from all over.

2149
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,340
And we usually measure them, by the way, as one.

2150
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:23,540
Yeah, it's a little frustrating

2151
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:25,180
because a lot of this terminology gets interchanged.

2152
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:27,940
But the free fatty acids that are ultimately making it back

2153
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:30,880
to its liver getting packaged into the VLDLs.

2154
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:34,340
While we're talking about the target sites of the muscles

2155
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:36,420
for which you're making use of triglycerides,

2156
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:39,320
I should emphasize that I believe that the primary purpose

2157
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:42,260
of the creation of those is to replete everything.

2158
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:45,060
So it's not just to fuel the muscles.

2159
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:48,180
It's also to put it back into the adipocytes

2160
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:50,380
that just now released it as well.

2161
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:53,380
In other words, Craig Moffat, like many people

2162
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:55,120
who are lean mass hyper-smarters,

2163
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:57,620
if we could install a little turnstile

2164
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:59,660
into their adipocytes,

2165
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:02,380
we would see that turnstile just spinning like crazy.

2166
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:04,300
They barely parked the triglycerides there

2167
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:06,580
before it's heading right back out.

2168
01:59:06,580 --> 01:59:10,660
And that's because there's less total adipose mass

2169
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,980
overall on Craig Moffat compared to somebody

2170
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:14,500
who's a lot heavier.

2171
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:17,340
And therefore there needs to be more global supply

2172
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:19,700
of VLDLs relative to somebody else

2173
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:21,300
who has a lot more fat mass.

2174
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:23,340
But this depends on his energy requirement.

2175
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:24,980
I mean, of course, while he's running.

2176
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:26,660
And I wrote a blog post on this a long time ago,

2177
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,300
which I guess we ought to link to called,

2178
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,300
it's something about fat flux.

2179
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:30,640
I don't remember the name of it exactly,

2180
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:34,000
but the gist of it was oversimplifying a fat cell

2181
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,500
as having two input doors and one output door.

2182
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:39,100
The two input doors being the de novo lipogenesis door,

2183
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:41,460
which is still an esterified entry door,

2184
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:44,220
but I separate it as a different storage,

2185
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:46,780
meaning it's coming from a carbohydrate, not from a fat.

2186
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,740
And then you have the reesterification door,

2187
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:51,500
which is the turnstile that allows fat to go right back in.

2188
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,500
And then you have the lipolysis door,

2189
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:55,340
which allows the fat to exit.

2190
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:58,660
So a person who is in fat balance

2191
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:02,140
has a situation where L, lipolysis,

2192
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:06,180
equals the sum of the esterified de novo lipogenesis

2193
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:10,300
plus the reesterified fatty acids, agreed?

2194
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:12,340
That's just straight up mass balance.

2195
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:16,140
So when Craig's running, he's in negative fat flux.

2196
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:17,420
Make no mistake about it.

2197
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:20,380
His de novo lipogenesis is zero at that moment.

2198
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,620
His esterification is something

2199
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:24,900
and his lipolysis has to be something bigger.

2200
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:26,860
If he's not depleting glycogen,

2201
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:28,540
which if he's highly fat adapted, he's not.

2202
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,340
And maybe it's worth putting out a distinction.

2203
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:32,420
I'm not talking about whether they were successfully

2204
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:34,220
at the moment that he's running,

2205
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:37,020
successfully reesterifying these fatty acids

2206
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:37,940
back into the adipose.

2207
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:38,940
And they might be though.

2208
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:40,340
That's my point is we don't know.

2209
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:42,220
What we know is that in, which gets back to their question.

2210
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:44,220
But do we know that it's the job of the liver

2211
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:46,060
to keep maintaining that buffet,

2212
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:48,420
to keep putting that energy back out there?

2213
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:50,660
And generally speaking, we do know that.

2214
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:51,820
It's just to what degree?

2215
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:53,580
My hypothesis is yes.

2216
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,500
My hypothesis is, which is not by the way,

2217
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,260
I don't think this is a commonly held view.

2218
02:00:58,260 --> 02:00:59,540
I think a lot of people would disagree with me.

2219
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:01,060
But my view is that the liver

2220
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:03,820
is the N-ergostat of the body.

2221
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:05,820
I borrowed that term from Mark Friedman

2222
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:08,820
who wrote an amazing chapter on this in 2008

2223
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:11,740
that has been one of the most influential things

2224
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:13,460
in my thinking on appetite.

2225
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:15,740
But he described the liver as the N-ergostats

2226
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:18,500
was an engineer you'll appreciate, the nomenclature, right?

2227
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,820
It's looks kludgy to someone who's not an engineer

2228
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:23,980
to say, why would he call it an N-ergostat?

2229
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:26,580
But in engineering speak, that makes perfect sense.

2230
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:29,820
But that the liver is probably most susceptible

2231
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:32,900
to detecting some currency of circulating energy

2232
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:34,860
and circulating metabolites.

2233
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:38,460
ATP would be the most logical thing for it to be sensing.

2234
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:42,700
So probably ratio of ATP to ADP or ATP to AMP

2235
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:45,180
or ADP to AMP, something like that.

2236
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:47,380
But yeah, I think the liver, I mean,

2237
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:48,580
I think most people don't appreciate

2238
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:50,380
how impressive the liver is in general.

2239
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:51,860
I was just talking to a patient this morning

2240
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:54,100
and I said, look man, here's the deal.

2241
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:55,380
Anything that goes wrong with you

2242
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:58,380
can be supported extracorporially, right?

2243
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:00,580
You get into a coma, no problem.

2244
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:03,020
You need to go on a left ventricular assist device.

2245
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:05,220
Okay, it sucks, but like it's there.

2246
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:07,700
You need dialysis, you need a ventilator, all that stuff.

2247
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:10,100
We do not have extracorporeal support for the liver.

2248
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:11,900
It is too complicated.

2249
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:14,900
Anybody who follows me knows just how much I'm loving this

2250
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:18,820
because you're the preachers preaching to the choir by far.

2251
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,260
I've often referred to the liver

2252
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:22,180
as like the straight laced partner

2253
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,340
who always puts up with your crap.

2254
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:25,700
He says, whatever you're giving it,

2255
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:27,100
it's having to parse out and figure out

2256
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:29,700
and balance the ledgers and get everything in it.

2257
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:30,940
No, no, that's a great point.

2258
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:32,820
And that was part of the other point I made to this patient

2259
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:34,860
who was not in any way opposing that view.

2260
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:37,740
He was just asking if the elevation we'd seen

2261
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:40,460
in his liver function tests, which was mild,

2262
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:42,260
could explain a synthetic issue

2263
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:44,300
to which the answer was not a chance in hell

2264
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,460
under normal circumstances

2265
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,760
because the liver has an enormous capacity

2266
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:50,880
to do its job under even the most ridiculous stress.

2267
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:55,880
So going back to Craig, at the moment that he is running,

2268
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:58,800
which is the same as saying if someone's losing weight

2269
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,280
while they're on a low carb diet,

2270
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:02,320
they are in negative energy balance.

2271
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,120
They are in negative fat flux.

2272
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:05,200
And again, when I say losing weight,

2273
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,080
let's ignore the water weight and stuff.

2274
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,120
Like I'm talking about legitimate weight loss.

2275
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:10,680
Metabolism exceeds.

2276
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,480
Yeah, but that's what it means, right?

2277
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:15,040
Like on a practical level, it means lipolysis,

2278
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,560
the amount of fat that is leaving the fat cell

2279
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:19,520
has to exceed that which is reentering it.

2280
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,160
And again, I don't know that this is entirely relevant,

2281
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:24,840
but you've alluded to it, so it's worth reiterating.

2282
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,760
Not all of that is oxidized, right?

2283
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:28,920
Like some of that free fatty acid leaves

2284
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,560
doesn't get oxidized and guess what?

2285
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,960
Gets mopped back up,

2286
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:34,740
provided the hormonal milieu still permits it.

2287
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:35,580
Yes.

2288
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:38,160
So we agree on that completely.

2289
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:40,280
I look at his remnant cholesterol

2290
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:43,480
of 13 milligrams per deciliter and say, okay,

2291
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,520
it doesn't tell me anything.

2292
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,540
So I apologize, because I've sort of lost your question

2293
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:50,020
and was looking at that, what could we infer?

2294
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:53,220
And this probably gets to just the larger problem

2295
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:54,620
that I feel like remnant cholesterol

2296
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,440
is helping us to address.

2297
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:59,440
Is why is it that anybody would have

2298
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,740
high triglycerides at all?

2299
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:03,980
Why aren't all triglycerides making their way

2300
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:07,320
to either the tissue that's using it immediately,

2301
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,540
the skeletal muscle or the cardiac tissue

2302
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:11,980
or to the adipocytes if the body means

2303
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:14,980
to not have it sitting inside of a loop of proteins

2304
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:16,360
parked in your bloodstream?

2305
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:17,880
So that's a totally separate question.

2306
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:20,240
I wanna come back to this remnant cholesterol question.

2307
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,640
But that's where, look,

2308
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:24,820
this is why like the original graph that we talked to,

2309
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:26,360
this is why I draw that dotted line,

2310
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:28,400
I draw a lot of people's attention to it.

2311
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,000
This is kind of the core emphasis.

2312
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,040
So this is the energy delivery support diagram

2313
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,960
for the person who's gonna be looking at this later.

2314
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:35,800
Right.

2315
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:36,880
We see that the chylomicron,

2316
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:39,040
I mean, if I'm gonna way oversimplify it,

2317
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:41,640
but not by too much, chylomicron's job,

2318
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:42,760
deliver fat-based energy.

2319
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:44,120
Yeah, but is so far gone

2320
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:45,800
that it's not really entering the discussion

2321
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:49,440
we're talking about outside of very, very rare diseases.

2322
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,960
HDL, not to deliver energy.

2323
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:54,520
We'll just say things not related to delivering energy,

2324
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:57,360
but I just call it support, generally speaking.

2325
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:00,240
Operations not related to delivering energy.

2326
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,240
I agree with that.

2327
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:03,320
Okay, last line, liver.

2328
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:07,840
This being the Apo B100 containing lipoprotein

2329
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:11,520
is the one lipoprotein that clearly is pulling double duty.

2330
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:12,440
No, no, no, but hang on, remember,

2331
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:14,480
now this is where your diagram,

2332
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:16,520
which you acknowledge is oversimplified,

2333
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,120
the oversimplification is hurting you, right?

2334
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:21,400
So the liver has three purple arrows coming out of it.

2335
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:24,720
VLDL, IDL, LDL.

2336
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:27,240
Agreed, which is why earlier I was emphasizing

2337
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:30,200
that I believe there was a higher secretion of VLDLs

2338
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,840
overall for those people with lean mass hyper-responders,

2339
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:34,840
which is very relevant to our discussion.

2340
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:36,040
And how do we know that?

2341
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,440
It's a theory, I'm not saying that.

2342
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,760
What I'm saying is if this arrow is fatter,

2343
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:43,000
if the VLDL secretion is at a greater degree,

2344
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,520
it would make sense why there would be more remodeled

2345
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,520
final LDL particles remaining.

2346
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,080
And why we would see the inversion pattern

2347
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:50,920
in the first place.

2348
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:53,800
Because it originated in order to deliver more

2349
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:56,560
of those triglycerides, which was brought about.

2350
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,760
So why the excess cholesterol?

2351
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:02,200
If that were the case, Dave, wouldn't you hypothesize

2352
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:05,040
that the LDL particle would be very high

2353
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,600
because you have more VLDL particles,

2354
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:10,200
but they're shedding all of their triglyceride

2355
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:13,000
in an effort to deliver their energy payload.

2356
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,280
But you shouldn't have an increased LDL cholesterol.

2357
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,880
You should actually have a reverse discordance

2358
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,440
from what we see in the insulin resistant patient.

2359
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,260
Where we typically see the LDL particle number

2360
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:27,120
being disproportionately higher than the LDL cholesterol.

2361
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,080
By percentiles, of course, in absolute numbers,

2362
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:30,280
that's always the case.

2363
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:32,800
In other words, if I was buying your hypothesis,

2364
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,000
I would say the LDL cholesterol should be very low.

2365
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,600
You should have very cholesterol depleted skeleton particles

2366
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:45,120
that were mostly used to shed triglyceride as VLDL.

2367
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:46,420
Instead, we see the concordance.

2368
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:49,240
We see the LDLC and the LDLP very concordant people

2369
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:51,920
who don't appear to have other types of diseases.

2370
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,560
Well, at that point, they're so high, it's hard to know,

2371
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:56,960
but they're clearly not discordant in the direction

2372
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,200
that would make sense given your hypothesis.

2373
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,480
In other words, what I'm getting at is,

2374
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:03,320
why is there so much cholesterol in those LDLs?

2375
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:04,920
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2376
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:07,160
But as far as the actual drop-off rate,

2377
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:09,720
the LDLC is still going to be relatively standard

2378
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:12,720
on a per-particle basis in a healthy subject.

2379
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:16,520
How much variability is there typically in LDLC

2380
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:18,120
per LDL particle?

2381
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,680
And again, correct me if I'm wrong.

2382
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,080
I thought that the secretion level

2383
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:24,240
tends to be fairly standard,

2384
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:27,120
kind of like a spare tire is standard per car.

2385
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:28,280
Yeah, it's-

2386
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:30,520
The triglyceride levels can be very variable.

2387
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,480
Yeah, but so can the cholesterol levels.

2388
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,600
I mean, they have capacity to carry a lot,

2389
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:37,200
but think about it, like you have large and small particles

2390
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:39,800
that even for the same amount of cholestro,

2391
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,280
have different amounts of cholesterol.

2392
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,360
But the bigger point is,

2393
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:44,880
where is the cholesterol coming from?

2394
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:47,480
So if we go back and look at my guy or look at Moffitt.

2395
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:49,080
So Moffitt's LDL cholesterol

2396
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:52,360
was 335 milligrams per deciliter.

2397
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:54,080
Right, but that's what's in circulation

2398
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:55,640
in the blood at that time.

2399
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,880
So the larger question-

2400
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,580
So hang on, just to be clear, Dave,

2401
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:00,840
is there any point during his 24-hour day

2402
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:04,200
when that number is like 30 milligrams per deciliter

2403
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,920
of LDL cholesterol in his bloodstream?

2404
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:06,880
I don't believe so.

2405
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:09,120
So in other words, if you take the area under the curve,

2406
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:13,000
if we could get real-time LDL cholesterol number on Moffitt

2407
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,320
and integrate him over 24 hours,

2408
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:17,400
we could argue for argument's sake,

2409
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:21,280
he's gonna be always over 300 milligrams per deciliter.

2410
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:23,160
His AUC would be very high.

2411
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:24,400
Yes, for the LDL particle.

2412
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,960
I mean, basically what we're talking about is what's,

2413
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:29,920
I almost wanna say it in terms of like birds in the air,

2414
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,420
right, like you have so many ships that have left the dock

2415
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:34,460
that are continuing in circulation.

2416
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:35,580
I guess here's a different question

2417
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:36,780
that I'll pose back to you.

2418
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:37,620
How much of that cholesterol-

2419
02:08:37,620 --> 02:08:38,700
But wait, I'm actually asking this

2420
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:39,820
because I'm trying to understand it.

2421
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:41,980
How much of this cholesterol has already made a lot?

2422
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,760
Are you thinking of this in terms of it's all getting

2423
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:46,520
synthesized and then reabsorbed and then recreated again?

2424
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,500
Let's go back and make sure we're agreeing

2425
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:51,020
on the same conditions here.

2426
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:54,320
Notwithstanding the experiment where they eat a ton of fat

2427
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:57,260
and they go from having incredibly high LDL

2428
02:08:57,260 --> 02:09:01,180
to very high LDL, but let's just take Moffitt.

2429
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:03,020
Over the course of a week,

2430
02:09:03,020 --> 02:09:06,020
assume you could do real-time LDL cholesterol

2431
02:09:06,020 --> 02:09:07,180
sampling on him.

2432
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:09,060
And specifically LDL cholesterol?

2433
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:10,300
Yes. Okay.

2434
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:12,260
Or everything, everything that's on your page.

2435
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:13,580
You could sample his total cholesterol,

2436
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:16,460
his HDL cholesterol, his LDL cholesterol,

2437
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:19,240
his VLDL cholesterol, and his LDL particle number.

2438
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:20,820
You could sample all of these things

2439
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:23,660
in every second for a week.

2440
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:25,760
I think we're agreeing that he will always have

2441
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:28,940
a very high LDL-P and a very high LDL-C

2442
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:31,100
and a low VLDLC, correct?

2443
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:33,220
Unless he eats a lot of fat.

2444
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:34,380
We'll come back to that after, but yes.

2445
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:35,220
Sure.

2446
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:38,860
Okay, so given that the half-life of his LDL is a day,

2447
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:41,660
where is that extra LDL cholesterol coming from?

2448
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:43,240
I believe it's being recycled.

2449
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:44,660
Well, it's always being recycled.

2450
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:46,140
How is his being recycled?

2451
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:48,940
So where is he deficient in cholesterol

2452
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:53,260
that a person who has an LDL cholesterol of 100 is not?

2453
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:54,540
I guess I don't understand the question.

2454
02:09:54,540 --> 02:09:56,220
Where is he deficient in cholesterol?

2455
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:58,780
Yeah, if he's got 335 milligrams per deciliter

2456
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:01,460
of cholesterol in his LDL particles,

2457
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:03,700
are you telling me that he has less cholesterol

2458
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:07,620
in his cell membranes or less of it somewhere else?

2459
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:09,680
So he has more cholesterol in his body.

2460
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:10,520
Correct.

2461
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:11,360
Why?

2462
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:14,180
For the same reason that we would have, say,

2463
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:16,780
life rafts on a boat, and once we have more boats,

2464
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:18,060
we have more life rafts.

2465
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:21,820
If we had a harbor just outside this window, right,

2466
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:24,820
and you had 100 boats, and on those 100 boats,

2467
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:26,480
their main job is to deliver something

2468
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:27,580
unrelated to life rafts.

2469
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:31,740
They're delivering cargo to the other island, right?

2470
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:33,580
And they deliver it, and 100 of them go out,

2471
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,700
how do them come back?

2472
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:37,420
And then demand on that island has changed.

2473
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:40,040
Now they need to deliver five times as many things

2474
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:41,460
as they were delivering before.

2475
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:43,600
The problem with that analogy is it assumes

2476
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:46,860
a completely fixed number of life rafts per boat.

2477
02:10:46,860 --> 02:10:47,860
It definitely does.

2478
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:49,220
But that's not how lipids work.

2479
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:50,340
How does it work?

2480
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:51,820
There's much more flux in the system.

2481
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:54,300
And furthermore, you could ask the question in reverse,

2482
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:55,500
why isn't it higher?

2483
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:58,220
Why wouldn't LDL-C be higher on a per boat basis?

2484
02:10:58,220 --> 02:11:00,500
Why wouldn't LDL-C be higher in that patient?

2485
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:03,500
In other words, what's regulating it?

2486
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:06,500
What's regulating how much LDL cholesterol he has?

2487
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:09,280
The demand for the boats themselves for LDL particles.

2488
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:10,420
What's driving that demand?

2489
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:11,900
This is, I think, where we differ, right?

2490
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,300
The demand is for the cargo, the originating cargo

2491
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:15,500
that is clearly getting used.

2492
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:18,680
Right, but we agree that the VLDL vanishes very quickly.

2493
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:22,100
The VLDL remodels to LDL very quickly.

2494
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:25,100
Yes, but if you go through the kinetics of this,

2495
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:28,380
I can't follow why he should still have

2496
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:30,500
that much LDL cholesterol,

2497
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:33,580
unless he is making more cholesterol.

2498
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:35,220
In other words, I've tried to think of this

2499
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:36,660
10 ways to Sunday.

2500
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:38,780
The only way on a mass balance

2501
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:40,920
that I can explain this hypothesis

2502
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:42,700
is if he's making more cholesterol.

2503
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:45,500
And not if he's recycling the same cholesterol?

2504
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,800
Like certainly he's making more relative to something

2505
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,700
he doesn't. Only if he were depleting it

2506
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:51,860
in some other store.

2507
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:53,400
So in other words, if I'm making this up,

2508
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,560
but if you could say, well, all of us,

2509
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:56,680
I mean, you probably know this,

2510
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:59,080
everyone loves to quote this fact, right?

2511
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:00,720
Red blood cells have more cholesterol

2512
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,680
in them than LDL particles, right?

2513
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:03,520
Right, right.

2514
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:05,160
So the LDL denier loves to say,

2515
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:06,880
well, we don't think red blood cells

2516
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:08,280
are causing atherosclerosis,

2517
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:10,480
and yet they have more LDL, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2518
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,320
whatever.

2519
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:15,300
But my point is, unless you've depleted a pool

2520
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:18,120
of cholesterol elsewhere in his body,

2521
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:20,880
just on mass balance, you had to make more of it.

2522
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,320
As far as I understand, the liver can recycle cholesterol

2523
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,160
as many times as it wants to.

2524
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:26,320
Again, that's true.

2525
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,160
So so.

2526
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,520
And the liver and the gut have a very clear pathway,

2527
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:30,360
which we describe.

2528
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:32,400
So correct me if I'm wrong, the liver is the only organ

2529
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,120
that can actually degrade cholesterol, right?

2530
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:36,440
Non-hepatic tissues can't degrade cholesterol.

2531
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:37,280
Well, again, it's my.

2532
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:38,820
It depends what you mean by degrade.

2533
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:41,400
You mean, remember, cholesterol has no caloric value.

2534
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:42,800
It's something that we metabolize, right?

2535
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,480
Right, but if you're synthesizing more,

2536
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:45,960
you're saying it's gonna go somewhere

2537
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:47,880
if it needs to be synthesized more.

2538
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:50,360
Right, if you're synthesizing more,

2539
02:12:50,380 --> 02:12:53,220
presumably you have a higher growth of the organism.

2540
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:54,160
You have more cells.

2541
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:56,200
You need more cells because obviously,

2542
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:57,960
probably the highest demand for cholesterol

2543
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:59,440
is for cell membranes.

2544
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:00,340
So that's what I'm trying to figure out.

2545
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:02,760
It's like, where is all this extra cholesterol coming from

2546
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:05,280
if it's not being synthesized de novo?

2547
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:06,620
And that's my larger point.

2548
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:07,880
The inversion pattern is part

2549
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:09,360
of what should bring this to light,

2550
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:12,560
is why then when I have an enormous amount of fat,

2551
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:15,440
over three days, I would see my LDL-C drop by 73.

2552
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:18,940
Why would I see my LDL-P drop by 1,115?

2553
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:22,460
In three days from eating huge amounts of dietary fat.

2554
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:23,500
Why would that happen?

2555
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:24,580
I mean, it's an interesting question.

2556
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:25,900
I'm just not sure.

2557
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:27,720
All it's basically saying is,

2558
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:30,160
you have a way to perturb those levels.

2559
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:34,060
I mean, I'll give you another just anecdote here.

2560
02:13:34,060 --> 02:13:35,380
You know, I did a one week fast.

2561
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:37,980
I went keto for a week and then ate nothing for a week.

2562
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:39,740
And now I'm actually back on keto for a week.

2563
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:42,120
And I'm checking my blood every seven days.

2564
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:47,120
So that was my LDL-P before I, that's my normal LDL-P.

2565
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:49,880
So I'm walking around at 920 nanomole per liter.

2566
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:50,720
This is after, you know,

2567
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,720
months and months of time restricted feeding

2568
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:54,820
with virtually no carbohydrate restriction,

2569
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:57,640
other than just, I don't eat crappy carbohydrates.

2570
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:59,520
So then I went keto for a week.

2571
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,380
And look, my LDL-P actually went up.

2572
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:02,840
Now I don't think I would meet criteria

2573
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:04,840
for being quote unquote a hyper responder

2574
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:07,440
because it went up to 1380, which is not that high.

2575
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:11,000
But you know, that's still a significant jump for me, right?

2576
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,720
Okay, what should it have done when I fasted for a week?

2577
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:17,040
Shouldn't it have gone up according to this model?

2578
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,680
Well, here's the catch.

2579
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:21,640
The catch is I only know the three day window.

2580
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:23,720
I don't have a lot of data from people who have fasted

2581
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:25,880
for a week, as in just water fasting.

2582
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:26,840
I do.

2583
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:27,680
Okay, you do, good.

2584
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:29,480
Yeah, I've done this on multiple patients

2585
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:31,560
who have done three, five and seven day fasts.

2586
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:32,980
Okay, who are fully ketogenic.

2587
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:34,120
And you're saying it typically goes down.

2588
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:35,140
Not always ketogenic, no.

2589
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:37,400
Sometimes they're just, you know, fat adapted.

2590
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:38,240
Sometimes they're not.

2591
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:40,240
Sometimes they're actually insulin resistant.

2592
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,400
And we use the fast to kick them into a state of ketosis

2593
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:44,680
to make it easier.

2594
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,120
And again, I wanna be very careful.

2595
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:48,160
This is simply just anecdote

2596
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:50,840
because I've only done this on maybe 30 people.

2597
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:52,480
But this is not uncommon.

2598
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:55,780
I mean, look, my LDL cholesterol went from 64 to 37

2599
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:56,960
after the fast.

2600
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,280
I mean, it went way down.

2601
02:14:58,280 --> 02:14:59,280
Wow, fantastic.

2602
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,080
And that's consistent with what I see.

2603
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:03,000
Now that's not the reason I'm fasting, to be clear.

2604
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,520
I don't, I'm not using a fast to manipulate lipoproteins.

2605
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:07,960
I'm doing it for a completely unrelated reason.

2606
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:11,400
But my point is I always see, and again, I can say always

2607
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,080
because it's a relatively small N,

2608
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:14,360
obviously at a large enough N,

2609
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:15,820
you're going to see counter examples

2610
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:17,380
to anything and everything.

2611
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:19,540
But the general principle seems to be

2612
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:22,200
under caloric deprivation, LDL goes down.

2613
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:25,080
And under fat deprivation, LDL goes down.

2614
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,700
I've got to put in the one footnote

2615
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:28,740
and it's an annoying footnote that I keep putting in.

2616
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:30,580
I really need to, and this is why I'm dying

2617
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,020
to get these parts of the exercise.

2618
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:34,540
I need to look at a population that also is not getting

2619
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:37,100
any particularly weight training or resistance training

2620
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:37,980
and so forth.

2621
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:40,160
Whether it's my theory or not,

2622
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:43,300
that seems to impact overall lowering LDL C numbers.

2623
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:44,460
And I'm very curious about this.

2624
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:45,860
I mean, I've got that in my patients.

2625
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:47,360
Not every one of my patients lifts weights

2626
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,780
despite my best efforts.

2627
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:53,180
So I think the more common thing that we see

2628
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:56,180
is that when you put people on a high fat diet,

2629
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:59,740
the ones that go on to have this hyper response,

2630
02:15:59,740 --> 02:16:02,520
as you know, their trigs usually go down.

2631
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:05,620
Their cholesterol goes through the roof

2632
02:16:05,620 --> 02:16:08,620
and it's driven by a doubling, tripling,

2633
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:12,260
or even greater output of synthetic biomarkers

2634
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:13,760
like it does master all.

2635
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,360
Now, for reasons I don't understand,

2636
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,600
you also tend to see at least two other three

2637
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:18,880
phytosterols go up.

2638
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:22,000
Now, one thing we didn't talk about though I wrote about it,

2639
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,280
so I'm sure you know about this is,

2640
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:27,880
this seems reversible if you eliminate the saturated fat.

2641
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:29,920
It does seem to matter in this case,

2642
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:31,920
and you'll like this, at least in our own data

2643
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:33,620
with APOE4s.

2644
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:35,880
Seems more likely if you're an APOE4,

2645
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:39,880
you will see a drop somewhat in saturated fats.

2646
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:41,720
So I don't think I have a large enough sample size

2647
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:44,480
because I've only put seven patients through that protocol.

2648
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:46,880
And I wrote about the very, very first one.

2649
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:48,400
So that's probably the only one that you've seen

2650
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:49,800
that I've talked about.

2651
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:54,280
But this was a young guy who went on a ketogenic diet,

2652
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:57,400
was crushing it, meaning like everything was going well.

2653
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:59,360
I mean, he got through the adaption period.

2654
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:01,920
I mean, his performance was exceptional.

2655
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,360
Mentally never felt better.

2656
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:05,520
He was not an overweight or metabolically ill guy

2657
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:06,360
to begin with.

2658
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:08,360
He was just kind of a normal software guy

2659
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:11,280
who just decided he wanted to take it to the next level.

2660
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:14,480
But then he showed up with labs not unlike these.

2661
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:16,300
He was the first guy I ever saw

2662
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:18,920
where there was a greater than sign on the LDL-P.

2663
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:20,280
Right, it maxes out at 3500.

2664
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:22,120
Yeah, I was like, oh, I didn't actually realize

2665
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:24,160
the assay stopped at 3500.

2666
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:25,980
This guy is my guy.

2667
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:28,220
He looked better on some of the other metrics.

2668
02:17:28,220 --> 02:17:31,720
He didn't actually have a lot of the inflammatory stuff.

2669
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:35,000
This was before the OX LDL assay was commercially available.

2670
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,080
So I didn't have that, but his CRP

2671
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:39,160
and his LPPLA2 were okay.

2672
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:40,360
But we had the discussion, right?

2673
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:42,180
Which is the discussion that at the end of the day,

2674
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:43,520
I'm accountable for having.

2675
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:45,680
Which is, what are we gonna do about it?

2676
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:46,520
And he was young.

2677
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:47,520
I mean, the guy was 30.

2678
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:50,760
So it wasn't like we had to do something tomorrow.

2679
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:51,780
This is not a guy who's gonna have

2680
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:53,080
a heart attack in a week.

2681
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:54,840
Because I think when you were originally writing about it,

2682
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:56,200
he actually pushed back a little bit.

2683
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:57,880
Like he wanted to come up with a...

2684
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:59,440
Well, what he pushed back on was,

2685
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:00,720
because I basically said, look, man,

2686
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,960
I don't think the ketogenic diet's right for you.

2687
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:05,320
Like, these numbers are crazy.

2688
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:07,200
And he was like, yeah, I don't ever wanna go back

2689
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:08,200
to what I was doing before.

2690
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:10,020
I mean, he basically said, in not so many words,

2691
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:12,260
like I'd rather die of a heart attack and feel this good

2692
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:13,740
than, you know, and he's not saying like,

2693
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:14,900
I'm gonna die of a heart attack tomorrow.

2694
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:16,340
But he's like, look, I'd rather live to 60

2695
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:18,300
and feel this way than live to 70 and not.

2696
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:20,440
To which I say, totally fair, by the way.

2697
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:23,580
Like, that's a very reasonable trade-off to make.

2698
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:26,980
But let's also think about this a little more logically.

2699
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:28,340
So that was actually probably the first case

2700
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:29,540
I ever discussed with Tom.

2701
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:32,580
And this was, I think back in 2011.

2702
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:35,700
And it was actually this discussion, I think,

2703
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:39,140
that led Tom to go on to write the Lipiholics case,

2704
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:41,860
even though it wasn't the patient that he used in that case

2705
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:44,660
because he then went out and found others like them.

2706
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:47,620
And what we just decided was on sort of biochemistry

2707
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:50,360
first principles, our hypothesis was,

2708
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:52,100
it's the saturated fat.

2709
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:54,100
More than the ketones, because that was the other thing.

2710
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:56,140
This guy didn't wanna leave ketosis.

2711
02:18:56,140 --> 02:18:58,180
Because my thought was, let's just dial this back,

2712
02:18:58,180 --> 02:18:59,900
get you out of ketosis.

2713
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:04,900
But so our hypothesis was both ketones and saturated fat

2714
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:07,700
can be readily converted into cholesterol.

2715
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:09,860
But if he's adamant on staying in ketosis,

2716
02:19:09,860 --> 02:19:13,860
let's at least get his SFA down to 25 grams per day,

2717
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:14,700
which was hard.

2718
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:17,060
This was a guy that was eating about 100 grams of SFA a day,

2719
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:18,100
maybe 80 grams.

2720
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:19,500
I mean, he was a lot.

2721
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:22,260
And we basically just made most of it MUFA.

2722
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:23,580
So I said to the patient, I said,

2723
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:25,420
look, the way we could do this,

2724
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:27,140
just for no other reason as the purpose

2725
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:28,940
of a thought experiment is,

2726
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:31,180
you're gonna basically have to become

2727
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:34,720
a nonstop olive oil macadamia nut eater.

2728
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:36,860
Even the avocado you can't go hog wild on

2729
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:38,820
because eventually you'll get too much carbohydrate

2730
02:19:38,820 --> 02:19:40,420
out of it for this purpose.

2731
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:44,060
And sure enough, I think he came back at like 1300,

2732
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:46,480
you know, after eight weeks or something like that.

2733
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:49,940
So six more patients have been so adamant

2734
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:54,060
about staying in ketosis and not taking any medication,

2735
02:19:54,060 --> 02:19:56,660
but wanting to go through this experiment.

2736
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:58,760
And all of them have had the same response,

2737
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:01,020
which is if you can get them to mainline MUFA,

2738
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:03,980
you fix the whole problem without reducing

2739
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:06,620
or increasing to any measurable effect.

2740
02:20:06,700 --> 02:20:08,340
How much fat they're consuming.

2741
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:10,540
Have you been keeping track of their PUFA levels too?

2742
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:12,700
Because it's hard to add a lot of MUFA's.

2743
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:13,900
Their PUFA's going up.

2744
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:15,680
And you know the issue with that,

2745
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:16,620
with adding more PUFA's.

2746
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:18,820
The downside is there's the potential

2747
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:20,740
that you're actually adding more peroxidation

2748
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:22,660
on the particle basis.

2749
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:24,480
Yeah, I mean, I think it depends.

2750
02:20:24,480 --> 02:20:25,980
This is one of those areas where I'm trying

2751
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:27,780
to get a lot smarter and I wanna make sure

2752
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:29,220
I'm not sitting in the echo chamber.

2753
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:33,020
I've historically measured RBC levels of arachidonic acid

2754
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:34,920
and all of those things and tried to keep track

2755
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:38,120
of the ratio of that to the EPA and the DHA.

2756
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:39,840
But ultimately I don't really think

2757
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:40,840
I know the answer to this yet.

2758
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:43,040
And I also don't think, my guess is PUFA's

2759
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,900
are not as bad as I've historically thought them to be,

2760
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:47,900
but they're probably not as good as MUFA.

2761
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:49,500
So not withstanding that.

2762
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:50,920
I just wanna talk about this from the level

2763
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:52,800
of the thought experiment, so to speak.

2764
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:56,160
My sample size of those people is too small

2765
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:58,640
to know if there's a relationship to their APOE gene.

2766
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:00,360
To your point, what I'm hearing you say is maybe

2767
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:03,260
that's something that you're more likely to do

2768
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:05,260
than someone who's an APOE4 carrier.

2769
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:06,860
It's been a proportional kind of thing

2770
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:08,120
that we've sort of noticed.

2771
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:08,960
I don't know.

2772
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:11,580
But what I do know is it seems to point back to this idea

2773
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:15,020
that the hyper responders, that the Occam's razor here

2774
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:17,140
is that they're making more cholesterol.

2775
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:19,600
Because that makes sense from a mass balance standpoint.

2776
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:20,440
Again, I'm still.

2777
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:21,500
And I would have agreed with you

2778
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:24,460
were it not for this energy inversion that I see.

2779
02:21:24,460 --> 02:21:26,940
If it were not the very thing that I said from earlier

2780
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:30,300
that I could move my LDL-C to where I wanna move it.

2781
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:32,380
That would be based on me basically arranging

2782
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:35,300
for a few days to eat to a certain level.

2783
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:38,380
And I'd be pushing down my LDL-C by eating up

2784
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:39,220
to a certain amount of fat.

2785
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:41,180
But notice you're pushing up and down on LDL-C

2786
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:43,520
within super physiologic levels.

2787
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:45,940
Meaning, if I recall seeing your data,

2788
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:47,100
do you mind showing me that again?

2789
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:48,300
Unfortunately, the computer died.

2790
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:49,140
Oh, I'm sorry.

2791
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:50,020
That's why I've had it close.

2792
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:52,140
But yes, what you'd see is an inversion graph.

2793
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:53,460
No, and I'm very familiar with it.

2794
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:54,580
And we'll obviously link to it.

2795
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:57,200
But it was, as I describe it, you're showing

2796
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:00,200
that you can move your LDL between the ranges

2797
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:02,300
of very high and stupidly high.

2798
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:05,540
What's the lowest you've ever got your LDL?

2799
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:06,380
98.

2800
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:09,740
And I suspect I could get my LDL down to 70

2801
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:11,380
if I was willing to go through with it.

2802
02:22:11,380 --> 02:22:12,860
There's another part of this conversation

2803
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:15,120
we haven't had a chance to touch on.

2804
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:16,420
But that you might find very interesting

2805
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:17,820
since we talked about the liver.

2806
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:19,740
And again, more theory.

2807
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:22,400
So about 80% of what I've talked about

2808
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:26,500
is an explanation that I'm trying to fit onto what I know.

2809
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:28,500
And this is definitely one of those.

2810
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:31,260
But I suspect, given the data that I have

2811
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:32,860
for the whole second phase of my research,

2812
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:37,240
that actually part of how I'm reducing my triglycerides

2813
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:39,580
in the blood through a certain series of experiments

2814
02:22:39,580 --> 02:22:41,980
I call carb swap experiments,

2815
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:44,820
is that I'm just trying to get a certain threshold

2816
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:47,920
of glycogen stores up in my liver,

2817
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:50,580
which seem to be at a certain point,

2818
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:52,780
meaning that there will be less VLDL secreted

2819
02:22:52,780 --> 02:22:54,020
and therefore less LDL.

2820
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:55,260
That's the theory.

2821
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,380
I'm sorry, say again.

2822
02:22:56,380 --> 02:22:59,140
By moving glycogen, you're doing what?

2823
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:00,620
Again, I'm trying to think about it more like

2824
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:03,020
as an engineer, whether right or wrong.

2825
02:23:03,020 --> 02:23:07,700
I think, okay, if I were trying to engineer this body

2826
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:10,640
and I were caring a lot about the long-term tank of storage,

2827
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:12,100
which is your adipose sites,

2828
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:14,620
but I was also to care about the short-term tank.

2829
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:17,080
What is the reason why it would make sense

2830
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:19,020
from a mechanistic standpoint

2831
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:20,980
as to why the body would want to be so adamant

2832
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:23,700
about mobilizing these triglycerides for fuel

2833
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:26,260
in a low-carb, high-fat athlete,

2834
02:23:26,260 --> 02:23:28,300
especially somebody who's very lean.

2835
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:31,580
The short Occam's razor from my perspective

2836
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:32,900
is it comes down to, well,

2837
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:36,180
there's very low glycogen stores relative to somebody

2838
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:37,620
who's on a high-carb diet.

2839
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:40,540
This isn't to say that they have bottomed out glycogen stores,

2840
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:43,660
but relatively speaking, there's less play.

2841
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:45,060
Because of that, it makes sense

2842
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:47,580
as to why the body would activate more lipolysis,

2843
02:23:47,580 --> 02:23:50,100
have more of the free fatty acids moving through,

2844
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:52,100
keep making it more available, et cetera.

2845
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:55,020
Okay, so then how could I tweak that?

2846
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:57,380
But wouldn't that also just as easily be explained

2847
02:23:57,420 --> 02:24:00,060
by the fact that when someone's walking around

2848
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:03,660
with 60% of the glycogen in their muscle,

2849
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:06,740
there's, by definition, assuming they don't have

2850
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:08,780
a sort of pathologic condition,

2851
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:11,280
there's not much circulating glucose,

2852
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:13,480
and therefore, it's probably,

2853
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:15,160
they're also in a low-insulin environment,

2854
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,860
which is fostering lipolysis?

2855
02:24:16,860 --> 02:24:18,340
Right, but it's gradiated.

2856
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:20,220
There's threshold points, which are part of what

2857
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,860
I'm trying to isolate out,

2858
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:23,780
and there seems to be a threshold point with me.

2859
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:26,940
For example, if I have around 90,

2860
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:28,820
it seems to be, the last time I tested this,

2861
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:32,260
if I had around 90 carbs per day, net carbs per day,

2862
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:33,780
that seems to be the magic threshold,

2863
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:35,620
that if I do that for about three days,

2864
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:40,180
my LDLC will just drop, like substantially.

2865
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:44,420
Now, let's say I did 70 net carbs for three days,

2866
02:24:44,420 --> 02:24:46,420
but we've already done that, doesn't do it.

2867
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:48,020
I have to get up to a certain threshold,

2868
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:49,460
and once I get up to that certain threshold,

2869
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:51,540
which seems to be somewhere around 90,

2870
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:52,860
all other things being equal,

2871
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:54,420
like I have to structure my life around this

2872
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:57,340
where I sleep the same amount and so forth.

2873
02:24:57,340 --> 02:24:59,500
That seems to be the point at which there's an actual drop,

2874
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:02,140
and I actually wrapped that around one of my presentations,

2875
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:06,700
is I actually had a fat shake, a ketogenic shake,

2876
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:09,980
for I wanna say three days, for a washout period,

2877
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:12,060
and then for just two days,

2878
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:14,060
I added what I thought would be the calculation

2879
02:25:14,060 --> 02:25:15,860
to demonstrate what I was looking to do,

2880
02:25:15,860 --> 02:25:19,700
so I swapped out the fat for carbs,

2881
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:22,580
kept it isochloric for two days.

2882
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:24,180
I had one that was a lower amount,

2883
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:25,340
I had one that was a higher amount.

2884
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:27,140
I can't remember the numbers right offhand,

2885
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:30,060
but then to further emphasize this,

2886
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:35,060
I switched back to the high-fat diet for the next five days,

2887
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:38,980
and we saw my LDLC drop almost immediately

2888
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:42,460
and continue to remain low for the next five days,

2889
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:44,820
and in fact, it got to the lowest point at the end.

2890
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:46,860
So it seems to be at least as sensitive

2891
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:49,220
on your carbohydrate intake as your fat intake, right?

2892
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:51,860
Correct, and this is very relevant,

2893
02:25:51,860 --> 02:25:53,580
because again, I'm still thinking about this

2894
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:54,460
from the energy model.

2895
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:56,180
But hang on, I'm not just saying this isn't interesting,

2896
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:57,980
but for this to be relevant,

2897
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:00,100
it has to be reproducing something

2898
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:03,580
that's going to last over much longer than five days.

2899
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:06,540
How do we know if these effects aren't transient?

2900
02:26:06,540 --> 02:26:08,820
And also, how do we know they're relevant

2901
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:11,980
if they require an extreme condition,

2902
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:13,780
such as, you know, one of them I know you talked about,

2903
02:26:13,780 --> 02:26:16,100
how you just have to force feed yourself a ton of fat?

2904
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:18,420
Yeah, that was the very first presentation I did,

2905
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:20,620
where I was having just a very high protocol.

2906
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:23,700
That also dropped your LDL-C paradoxically, correct?

2907
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:24,540
Correct.

2908
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:26,780
But the point is, we have to back up for a moment.

2909
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:28,500
Why does any of this stuff matter?

2910
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:30,820
In the end, if you're listening to this podcast,

2911
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:33,100
or if you're sitting in front of me as a patient,

2912
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:35,540
you have a very important question you have to ask yourself

2913
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:38,100
if your LDL-P is through the roof

2914
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:40,420
as a result of what seems to be your diet.

2915
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:42,500
Does it matter, and do you want to do anything about it?

2916
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:44,940
Right, and this is why this is the most relevant question,

2917
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:47,540
is if you're right, and I'm not saying

2918
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:49,380
that I know for sure either way,

2919
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:50,300
but let's say that you're right,

2920
02:26:50,940 --> 02:26:54,140
that regardless of how we got here,

2921
02:26:54,140 --> 02:26:56,580
if you have a high LDL-P,

2922
02:26:56,580 --> 02:26:59,020
because of being on a ketogenic diet,

2923
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:01,480
then there's a lot of people who need to know that,

2924
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:02,620
if they're at higher risk.

2925
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:04,180
And I definitely want to be one of the people

2926
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:05,580
that brings that to their attention.

2927
02:27:05,580 --> 02:27:07,780
I have emphasized this several times before,

2928
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:09,060
and I'll say it once more,

2929
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:12,180
I am on a journey of science, not of advocacy.

2930
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:15,460
I'm gonna be quite a skeptic, but all of that said,

2931
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:17,300
if I come to a point in which I can feel convinced

2932
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:19,780
that LDL-P is in fact atherogenic,

2933
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:21,700
absent remnant lipoproteins,

2934
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:24,860
absent having high HDL, low triglycerides.

2935
02:27:24,860 --> 02:27:27,300
But we already know it's absent remnant lipoproteins.

2936
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:29,260
I mean, there's a thousand studies,

2937
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:31,820
including this, to demonstrate that the atherogenicity

2938
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:34,180
between these people and these people,

2939
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:35,820
I'm pointing to the Garvey study,

2940
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:39,140
has nothing to do with what may or may not be remnants.

2941
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:41,420
The LDL-P alone here.

2942
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:43,100
So I think one thing that sort of...

2943
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:46,380
I've not seen a study yet where remnant lipoprotein,

2944
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:48,620
I mean, I'll send you the ones I have.

2945
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:51,340
If you have somewhere LDL particle

2946
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:54,820
is more relevant than remnant lipoprotein,

2947
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:56,660
I would be very curious, be very interested in seeing.

2948
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:57,500
Well, again, we have to be very careful

2949
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:58,460
at what we mean by remnant.

2950
02:27:58,460 --> 02:28:01,500
So there are clearly going to be a subset of remnants

2951
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:04,740
that are potentially the most pathologic

2952
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:06,620
on a per-particle basis.

2953
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:09,220
But I think the body of evidence implicating

2954
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:13,540
the causal role of ApoB and LDL-P is so overwhelming,

2955
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:14,380
is it perfect?

2956
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:15,380
Of course not.

2957
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:18,580
But I think what concerns me with this culture,

2958
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:19,660
when I say this culture, I mean,

2959
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:23,580
this sort of low-carb culture of LDL doesn't matter,

2960
02:28:23,580 --> 02:28:26,420
is if I had a dollar for every time

2961
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:29,100
I had to see some low-carb enthusiast

2962
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:32,380
basically dismissing the idea that LDL is relevant,

2963
02:28:32,380 --> 02:28:34,060
and touting the idea that statins

2964
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:36,140
are a big conspiracy theory,

2965
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:38,260
that's a really dangerous problem.

2966
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:39,580
So look, just generally speaking,

2967
02:28:39,580 --> 02:28:41,460
I think dismissiveness in general.

2968
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:43,420
But we do have to care about the quality of evidence.

2969
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:44,260
Oh, we sure do.

2970
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:46,820
Let me offer a very controversial viewpoint

2971
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:49,620
that I can't believe I'm about to voice publicly.

2972
02:28:49,620 --> 02:28:51,740
I think one of the challenges in the low-carb community

2973
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:55,180
is you have a group of people who have become very used to

2974
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:57,780
rejecting mainstream information,

2975
02:28:57,780 --> 02:29:00,940
because they did so with nutrition, right?

2976
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:03,340
If you are on a low-carbohydrate diet,

2977
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:08,060
on some level you have decided that the ADA, the AHA,

2978
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:12,260
the USDA, the NIH, and the CDC are full of shit.

2979
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:13,180
I think that's a fair point.

2980
02:29:13,180 --> 02:29:14,780
Okay, do you know what?

2981
02:29:14,780 --> 02:29:16,460
I think that when it comes to nutrition,

2982
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:18,020
that's largely true.

2983
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:19,740
Now, I think they're coming around,

2984
02:29:19,740 --> 02:29:21,340
but I think it's largely true.

2985
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:23,580
And I think the body of evidence,

2986
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:25,820
the body of literature that pointed

2987
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:28,540
towards the food pyramid was quite shoddy.

2988
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:30,500
I don't think it was nefarious.

2989
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:32,060
I don't think this was as much of a conspiracy

2990
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:33,140
as people want to make it out to be.

2991
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:35,500
I don't think Ansel Keys was some evil dude

2992
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:38,380
who was scheming away to like, I just don't buy that.

2993
02:29:38,380 --> 02:29:41,860
I think there were strong personalities in lousy science.

2994
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:43,020
Those are very different things.

2995
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:44,580
And let me go on the record with saying,

2996
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:45,420
I basically agree.

2997
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:46,260
I feel like there really is-

2998
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:47,660
Well, this is the easy part to agree with.

2999
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:49,740
This is the hard part that's coming up.

3000
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:52,860
So what happens is a lot of people get into this mindset

3001
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:56,660
of, well, look, over here I saw an entire body of evidence

3002
02:29:56,660 --> 02:29:58,580
that I was very easy to dismiss.

3003
02:29:58,580 --> 02:29:59,980
And by the way, look at the results.

3004
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:02,060
Like you don't have to be a rocket scientist.

3005
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:03,740
If you're sitting there following the food pyramid,

3006
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:04,840
getting fatter and sicker,

3007
02:30:04,840 --> 02:30:07,680
and you abandon it and get better, there's the proof.

3008
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:10,780
The real problem, and again,

3009
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:12,780
I apologize for getting on a soap box.

3010
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:15,460
The real problem is when people try to look

3011
02:30:15,460 --> 02:30:17,980
at the last 50 years of lipid literature

3012
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:19,940
through that same lens.

3013
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:21,980
Nobel Prizes have been won in this field.

3014
02:30:21,980 --> 02:30:23,900
Now I know that somebody's gonna start screaming,

3015
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:25,340
oh, that's an appeal to authority.

3016
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:26,940
That's a logical fallacy.

3017
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:28,140
I got it.

3018
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:30,940
To you, whoever said that, I acknowledge it.

3019
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:33,580
But unless you're willing to go back and read

3020
02:30:33,580 --> 02:30:36,980
every one of those papers, something even I have not done,

3021
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:39,780
though I've probably read more of them than most,

3022
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:41,500
we're talking about apples and oranges

3023
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:43,300
to a body of literature here.

3024
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:46,100
The body of literature implicating LDL

3025
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:50,500
as having a causal role, a necessary but not sufficient role

3026
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:53,060
in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis

3027
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:57,000
is on a different level from the body of literature

3028
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,940
that gave us the food pyramid.

3029
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:00,540
And the real challenge, I think,

3030
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:03,720
in this low-carb community, this LDL denying community,

3031
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:06,740
is they're throwing the baby out with the bath water.

3032
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:09,500
Now, part of that is because I think

3033
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:11,900
there are too many doctors who are too lazy

3034
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:13,580
at the other end of the spectrum.

3035
02:31:13,580 --> 02:31:16,900
They just assume, well, statins are what we give everybody.

3036
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:19,500
Anybody whose LDL-C is above 100 gets to be on a statin.

3037
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:22,040
And these doctors are equally guilty, in my mind,

3038
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:23,740
of being ignorant and not thoughtful

3039
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:26,700
and not understanding the pathophysiology of the disease.

3040
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:30,540
But somewhere between these is a measured space

3041
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:32,740
that requires a very careful consideration

3042
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:33,580
of the literature.

3043
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:35,820
So with that in mind,

3044
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:38,420
to kind of broad-base this pretty well,

3045
02:31:38,420 --> 02:31:40,340
this whole energy model that we've been talking about,

3046
02:31:40,340 --> 02:31:42,300
that I've been kind of walking you through

3047
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:44,940
and the audience to some degree,

3048
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:48,220
it's the lens by which I came up with the challenge.

3049
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:49,420
I didn't come up with the challenge

3050
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:50,860
because I was just like,

3051
02:31:50,860 --> 02:31:52,540
today I just want to tweet out something

3052
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:55,180
that I think will get a lot of people annoyed.

3053
02:31:55,180 --> 02:31:57,740
I believed that I looked at those two sides

3054
02:31:57,740 --> 02:31:59,820
of the dotted line, and I said,

3055
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:02,460
it looks as if, if you are insulin resistant,

3056
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:04,800
we tend to see that there are high levels of triglycerides.

3057
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:06,620
We tend to see the high levels of VLDL.

3058
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:07,820
Forget even Remnant.

3059
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:11,020
We can't detect VLDL to a certain extent.

3060
02:32:11,020 --> 02:32:13,300
We can see that people who are down the range

3061
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:15,260
of metabolic derangement, they've got that.

3062
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:16,620
And that tends to be highly associated

3063
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:17,900
with cardiovascular disease.

3064
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:20,140
This is all on the energy delivery side.

3065
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:21,520
On the other side of the LDL,

3066
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:23,880
we tend to see on the support side

3067
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:25,280
that there can be further problems

3068
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:26,400
in the immunological role,

3069
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:30,780
and oftentimes that can be induced by likewise, lipolysis.

3070
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:33,140
You'll see on the vitamin E studies, for example,

3071
02:32:33,140 --> 02:32:34,680
this gets brought up quite a bit.

3072
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:37,660
For example, if you inject lipopolysaccharides

3073
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:40,620
into a body, you'll actually have higher fatty acid

3074
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:41,860
synthesis that's going on the liver,

3075
02:32:41,860 --> 02:32:43,380
along with lipolysis,

3076
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:45,700
in order to induce that higher response.

3077
02:32:45,700 --> 02:32:47,100
So again, we see on that side,

3078
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:49,100
we see higher levels of triglycerides.

3079
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:51,060
And I kept coming back to it, I kept kind of, you know.

3080
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:52,300
But you're also, as we talked about,

3081
02:32:52,300 --> 02:32:53,660
when you inject LPS in somebody,

3082
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:55,340
you're gonna see a higher HDL cholesterol too.

3083
02:32:55,340 --> 02:32:56,820
I mean, everything at that moment,

3084
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:58,900
LPS is a terrible toxin.

3085
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:01,220
Like it's going to kick the body into a four alarm fire.

3086
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:02,060
For sure.

3087
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:04,460
Of course it's going to want all of the energy substrate

3088
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:07,460
it can muster, and all of the hormonal precursors

3089
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:08,340
it can muster.

3090
02:33:08,340 --> 02:33:09,260
Agreed, agreed.

3091
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:11,980
So when we're looking at an association

3092
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:16,060
between LDL particles and a bad outcome,

3093
02:33:16,060 --> 02:33:18,820
we want to absolutely confirm it was the cause

3094
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:21,100
and not the association, right?

3095
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:23,020
But the same reason that if we were to say,

3096
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:26,380
I want to confirm ambulances aren't the cause of death

3097
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:28,480
for people who are dying inside of ambulances.

3098
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:30,420
Yeah, I mean, we have to be a little careful

3099
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:32,100
with that analogy, so let's be clear.

3100
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:35,140
Can you get atherosclerosis without having

3101
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:38,300
an oxidized sterile taken up by a macrophage?

3102
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:39,140
No.

3103
02:33:39,140 --> 02:33:39,980
Okay, so.

3104
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:41,700
If I could take all the LDL particles

3105
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:43,300
out of your body right now,

3106
02:33:43,300 --> 02:33:44,540
I could feel totally confident

3107
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:46,280
that you will not die of atherosclerosis.

3108
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:50,340
Okay, so does that not imply that LDL is necessary

3109
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:52,500
but not sufficient for atherosclerosis?

3110
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:54,320
I don't disagree with that.

3111
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:57,460
Without question, LDL particles are a part.

3112
02:33:57,460 --> 02:34:00,040
It's important for some people to understand that

3113
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:02,300
because I do think, put it this way,

3114
02:34:02,300 --> 02:34:03,920
I've certainly heard people in this community

3115
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:08,360
argue the following, that the burden of proof

3116
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:10,660
should be on the lipidology community

3117
02:34:10,660 --> 02:34:15,360
to demonstrate that LDL is causal rather than the reverse.

3118
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:18,980
And I find that comical if it weren't for tragic.

3119
02:34:18,980 --> 02:34:20,920
Let's go back to the analogy for a second.

3120
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:25,040
Are ambulances causal for ambulance related deaths?

3121
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:25,880
Absolutely.

3122
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:29,440
They're a part of the, if I took life saving.

3123
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:31,280
That's not the same thing.

3124
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,760
Because what you're basically saying is.

3125
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:35,000
I'm emphasizing an association over a causation.

3126
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,200
We both realize that, right?

3127
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:40,120
So, okay, it could be in this town,

3128
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:42,580
you actually are in worse shape if an ambulance picks you up.

3129
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:44,520
There's very incompetent EMTs.

3130
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:46,760
And their life saving measures are poorly done.

3131
02:34:46,760 --> 02:34:49,400
And therefore, if you could ban all ambulances in this town,

3132
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:51,240
you'd find that actually all cause mortality would go down.

3133
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:53,400
A Mendelian randomization of ambulances

3134
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:54,500
would ferret that out.

3135
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:57,360
I would agree if there wasn't anything associated

3136
02:34:57,360 --> 02:35:00,200
in the ambulance, in the Mendelian randomizations

3137
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:02,920
with response by ambulances in the first place.

3138
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,520
The only way I think you can discount

3139
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:08,400
the Mendelian randomization is if you believe

3140
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:12,480
that the mutations that you are measuring,

3141
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:15,080
so you're looking at a series of mutations

3142
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:16,900
that are affecting a phenotype,

3143
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:19,400
in this case cholesterol level,

3144
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:22,280
you'd have to convince yourself that each and every one

3145
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:26,120
of those is also affecting something else

3146
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:28,760
that's driving the underlying cardiovascular process.

3147
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:29,600
Yes, yes.

3148
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:31,200
But we've already went through this, right?

3149
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:34,160
It can't be the LDL receptor because that's not even

3150
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:36,280
ubiquitous and there aren't LDL receptors

3151
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:37,280
on individual cells.

3152
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:39,920
I want this tested on a healthy vascular system.

3153
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:41,240
However, that's a crew.

3154
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:42,600
I want every cell to and I have.

3155
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:46,280
Why does a person with FH not have a healthy vascular system

3156
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,120
when they're born?

3157
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:47,960
When they're born.

3158
02:35:47,960 --> 02:35:48,800
Yeah.

3159
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:50,300
Meaning they inherit a clean slate, right?

3160
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:52,880
Someone who's born with FH has a normal,

3161
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:54,240
beautiful vascular system.

3162
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,080
Sure.

3163
02:35:55,080 --> 02:35:57,480
That over time in most of them becomes destroyed.

3164
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:58,600
Just to answer this question,

3165
02:35:58,600 --> 02:36:02,080
is there any cell in somebody who has FH

3166
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,960
that would function like a normal cell

3167
02:36:03,960 --> 02:36:05,160
in somebody who doesn't have FH

3168
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:07,000
in order to be able to acquire the lipids

3169
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,360
or lipoproteins it wants to take?

3170
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:09,200
Yes.

3171
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:10,040
Okay.

3172
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:11,000
There are plenty of patients with FH

3173
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,400
who do not have defective,

3174
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:15,180
completely defective LDL receptors

3175
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:17,080
and therefore are not impeded.

3176
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:17,920
Put it this way.

3177
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,240
Why is it metabolism is not impeded is what you're saying?

3178
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:21,120
Not all of them.

3179
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,120
Again, we have to be very careful when we talk about FH

3180
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:25,480
because there are at least 2,000 known versions

3181
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:26,320
of that disease.

3182
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:27,640
It's very cumbersome.

3183
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,440
So that's why I think it gets,

3184
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:32,080
FH gets talked about like it's one disease.

3185
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:35,240
It's a phenotype that has all of these things

3186
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:36,200
that can cause it.

3187
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:37,520
So the broader question is,

3188
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:43,520
is everyone with FH struggling to make steroid hormones?

3189
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:45,560
I don't know the answer to that question.

3190
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:46,520
No.

3191
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:48,960
In fact, FH may be slightly protective

3192
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:53,000
in the case of an infection and in the case of diabetes.

3193
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,160
And one argument for that,

3194
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:55,760
the diabetes one's a little hard to explain.

3195
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:58,760
The infection one, FH has stuck around for a long time.

3196
02:36:58,760 --> 02:37:01,280
So there may have been a time when having the ability

3197
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:04,480
to mount an incredible immune response

3198
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:07,440
would have proved to have a survival advantage.

3199
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:11,540
And if you have four times the cholesterol of somebody else,

3200
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:13,400
that's one moment in when that could come

3201
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:14,480
at a huge advantage.

3202
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:17,160
Right, which gets back to the immunological response.

3203
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:19,240
But to get back to the larger point,

3204
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:21,480
I wouldn't blame somebody who has a poor digestive system

3205
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:22,880
for being malnourished.

3206
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:24,520
As long as we can count on everybody's tissues

3207
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:25,640
to be properly nourished.

3208
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,480
You mean by blaming them?

3209
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:29,020
Help me understand what you mean by that?

3210
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:31,440
What I mean by that is if there was a problem

3211
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:33,920
with absorption of lipids or lipoproteins

3212
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:37,300
unrelated to total quantity of LDL particles,

3213
02:37:37,300 --> 02:37:38,680
that's what I'm gonna care about.

3214
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:40,800
And I hopefully will have an answer on this soon.

3215
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:43,660
I'm actually working with a couple researchers

3216
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:46,080
who I'm trying to get an S&P list together

3217
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:48,940
that doesn't include lipid metabolism issues.

3218
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:50,680
So Ronald Krause, who you had on from earlier,

3219
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:51,600
he was talking about this,

3220
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:54,380
that they are looking right now on, for example,

3221
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:56,540
lots of the genetic studies.

3222
02:37:56,540 --> 02:38:00,260
And he was explaining the receptor issues associated with,

3223
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:03,140
and this is how you end up with higher levels of LDL-C

3224
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:04,700
or LDL-P, right?

3225
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:06,460
Is that you end up having less absorption,

3226
02:38:06,460 --> 02:38:07,460
particularly on the liver side.

3227
02:38:07,460 --> 02:38:10,140
But I'm especially interested in non-hepatic tissues.

3228
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:12,340
But there are, there are people with Neiman-Pixie,

3229
02:38:12,340 --> 02:38:13,980
one-like-one transporter deficiencies.

3230
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:17,020
There are people with ATP binding cassette deficiencies

3231
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:19,580
who have a huge increase in cholesterol.

3232
02:38:19,580 --> 02:38:21,540
It has nothing to do with an LDL receptor.

3233
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:22,380
It's a transporter.

3234
02:38:22,380 --> 02:38:24,340
I'm not pointing just to the LDL receptor.

3235
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:26,580
I'm pointing to just the health of the cell.

3236
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:28,900
If the health of the cell is not compromised,

3237
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:29,840
then I'm interested.

3238
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,820
If the lipid metabolism difference.

3239
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:35,060
But why would someone who's ATP binding cassette

3240
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:39,300
in their enterocyte that is not appropriately

3241
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:42,700
excreting cholesterol, therefore driving up

3242
02:38:42,700 --> 02:38:45,260
the recirculated cholesterol pool,

3243
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:47,520
why does that mean that their endothelium

3244
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,060
is somehow defective?

3245
02:38:49,060 --> 02:38:50,940
I would have to follow what the path is

3246
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:51,780
that we're talking about.

3247
02:38:51,820 --> 02:38:53,420
I don't know that I could give an answer to that

3248
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:55,860
until I can actually see the study that's associated.

3249
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:57,940
If you can take a biopsy of anybody

3250
02:38:57,940 --> 02:39:00,040
who's going to have this issue,

3251
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:01,540
and you can basically effectively see

3252
02:39:01,540 --> 02:39:03,660
that the cells for which there would be targeted,

3253
02:39:03,660 --> 02:39:05,540
there is not gonna be any problems,

3254
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:07,420
I wouldn't have any problem with using it.

3255
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:09,860
I mean, basically what we really want,

3256
02:39:09,860 --> 02:39:11,340
what we really want is just the means

3257
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:13,380
of just an overproduction on the part of the liver

3258
02:39:13,380 --> 02:39:16,020
without it touching any other part of the lipid system.

3259
02:39:16,020 --> 02:39:18,420
And your point, I'll make your point for you.

3260
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:21,620
It's hard to get an S&P that doesn't in some way

3261
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:23,780
touch other parts of the lipid system,

3262
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:25,860
but that's also the point against it.

3263
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:26,700
You see what I'm saying?

3264
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:27,940
So let me ask you this.

3265
02:39:27,940 --> 02:39:30,980
You're saying, look, I want more evidence.

3266
02:39:30,980 --> 02:39:34,220
And I mean, I think science is based on skepticism.

3267
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:36,940
I completely respect that,

3268
02:39:36,940 --> 02:39:39,240
but I think we also have to temper that

3269
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:42,340
with some modicum of understanding probability theory

3270
02:39:42,340 --> 02:39:44,460
and saying, look, at some point,

3271
02:39:44,460 --> 02:39:46,300
the probability looks disproportionately

3272
02:39:46,300 --> 02:39:47,180
one way versus the other.

3273
02:39:47,180 --> 02:39:50,860
So right now, what would your confidence be

3274
02:39:50,940 --> 02:39:54,460
in the idea that LDL is playing a causal role

3275
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:58,420
in atherosclerosis, just as endothelial dysfunction

3276
02:39:58,420 --> 02:40:00,980
and inflammation play a causal role in atherosclerosis?

3277
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:02,940
Let's make a distinction.

3278
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:04,540
The distinction is, if you're saying,

3279
02:40:04,540 --> 02:40:07,860
is it part of the development of an atherosclerotic plaque?

3280
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:09,780
It's nearly 100%.

3281
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:12,460
If you're saying, is it the total quantity

3282
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:16,660
of LDL particles absent, any inflammation,

3283
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:17,500
or anything else along those lines?

3284
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:18,340
But nobody's saying that.

3285
02:40:18,340 --> 02:40:19,500
Nobody reasonable is saying that.

3286
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:20,980
So again, listen to what I said, right?

3287
02:40:20,980 --> 02:40:25,420
So you've got three things that we can sort of use a metaphor

3288
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:27,780
and say they form the three legs of the stool.

3289
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:29,340
Three things have to happen

3290
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:31,260
for someone to get atherosclerosis.

3291
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:32,980
Each of them is necessary.

3292
02:40:32,980 --> 02:40:35,140
None of them alone are sufficient.

3293
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:37,320
That's just the nature of complicated biology.

3294
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:38,500
Let me help you with the question.

3295
02:40:38,500 --> 02:40:40,980
I think this would be a better way of asking it.

3296
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:44,100
If given the same quantity of oxidative stress,

3297
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:45,520
whether it's low or high,

3298
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:50,400
would you rather have 1000 nanomoles of LDL particles,

3299
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:53,720
or would you rather have 2000 nanomoles of LDL particles?

3300
02:40:53,720 --> 02:40:55,680
Yeah, we don't need to ask me that question.

3301
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:57,440
I think the question is, what would you rather have?

3302
02:40:57,440 --> 02:41:00,560
I used to think that I would say the first,

3303
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:02,200
that I would rather have 1000.

3304
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:04,480
I would say last year was probably more like,

3305
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:06,480
could be about the same difference.

3306
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:07,400
Learning what I've learned,

3307
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:10,840
especially with the antioxidant defense system and so forth,

3308
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:12,240
and particularly given my own data,

3309
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:15,000
especially with the CIMT data that I presented recently,

3310
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:17,600
I don't know if you've seen that one as well.

3311
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:21,480
I was getting a carotid end to media thickness test

3312
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:23,720
every six months.

3313
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:25,200
And during those six months

3314
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:27,760
in the beginning of this diet,

3315
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:29,160
and through the experimentation,

3316
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:32,000
I was running at LDL C levels of 200 or higher,

3317
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,460
LDL P levels of 2000 or higher.

3318
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:36,460
For four tests in a row,

3319
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:39,460
you can actually see the regression that's happening

3320
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:42,280
on both the left and right side of the carotid arteries.

3321
02:41:42,280 --> 02:41:44,800
Yeah, I mean, again, I don't wanna get started on CIMT,

3322
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:46,840
which is, hopefully it's the same tech

3323
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:48,400
doing it the exact same way.

3324
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:51,520
I mean, I'm guessing your CIMT initially was pretty good,

3325
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:53,020
and it may have gotten a little bit better,

3326
02:41:53,020 --> 02:41:54,040
but I don't know.

3327
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:57,080
CIMT is even worse than calcium scoring, frankly.

3328
02:41:57,080 --> 02:41:57,920
Fair enough.

3329
02:41:57,920 --> 02:42:02,120
But again, Dave, we're putting a couple of N of how many's.

3330
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:02,960
We're saying, look,

3331
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:05,800
these three little interesting anecdotes

3332
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:08,960
are basically calling us to suggest

3333
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:11,840
that the null hypothesis around this topic

3334
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:13,180
should be what you're discussing,

3335
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:17,780
rather than what I think is a remarkable body

3336
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:20,460
of scientific literature that is not without its problems

3337
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:23,340
and that is not absolute in its inference, but.

3338
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:24,180
It's not what I'm saying.

3339
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:25,020
What I'm saying is.

3340
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:25,860
It might not be what you're saying,

3341
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:28,580
but it's certainly what a lot of people

3342
02:42:28,580 --> 02:42:30,060
are using your words to say.

3343
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:32,020
I have an energy model that a lot of people

3344
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:35,500
are utilizing probably overly simplistically.

3345
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:37,940
But if my energy model is right,

3346
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:39,500
it would suggest as to why,

3347
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:40,340
the answer of why you would have.

3348
02:42:40,340 --> 02:42:42,140
But, David, you haven't even described it correctly

3349
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:44,180
to me today, right?

3350
02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:45,660
I mean, I guess it depends how liberal we want to be

3351
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:47,060
with the term model, right?

3352
02:42:47,060 --> 02:42:50,480
But there is no evidence that the LDL

3353
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,940
is there to carry cholesterol.

3354
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:53,100
You have yet to explain to me

3355
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:54,840
where Moffitt got his cholesterol.

3356
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:56,780
You're talking about to the quantity that has it.

3357
02:42:56,780 --> 02:42:58,900
Yes, the guy's got three times

3358
02:42:58,900 --> 02:43:00,460
the amount of LDL cholesterol.

3359
02:43:00,460 --> 02:43:03,320
I think it typically tracks with the total particle count.

3360
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:04,700
You have to give me the mass balance.

3361
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:05,540
You're an engineer.

3362
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:07,100
You know this stuff just as well as I do.

3363
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:09,900
If you are a hyper responder coming to cholesterolcode.com

3364
02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:12,500
right now and you turn over your lab,

3365
02:43:12,500 --> 02:43:14,340
I can look at your LDL scene before you get.

3366
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:15,180
That's fine, that's fine.

3367
02:43:15,180 --> 02:43:17,220
And look, that's just pattern recognition.

3368
02:43:17,220 --> 02:43:18,340
That's not the interesting thing to me.

3369
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:20,220
I'm asking a very important physiologic question

3370
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:22,340
which you have yet to provide an answer to

3371
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:24,380
and it seems to be the central tenet

3372
02:43:24,380 --> 02:43:25,860
of your belief system.

3373
02:43:25,860 --> 02:43:28,140
Where did Moffitt get his cholesterol?

3374
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:31,460
Why does he have three times more than he had before?

3375
02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:34,300
The short answer to that is he synthesized it

3376
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:35,660
and he's recycling it.

3377
02:43:35,660 --> 02:43:37,460
Now there's some degree with which he's synthesized.

3378
02:43:37,460 --> 02:43:40,340
So this is a totally different answer than before.

3379
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:43,940
He has now increased his synthesis of cholesterol.

3380
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:46,340
He doesn't have the same circulating pool.

3381
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:48,540
This is not a shell game with boats, right?

3382
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:50,280
No, I was talking about circulating before.

3383
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:52,380
No, but what I certainly didn't hear you say before

3384
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:54,780
was that he has actually increased

3385
02:43:54,780 --> 02:43:57,280
his own endogenous production of cholesterol.

3386
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:59,820
There's some amount where you're increasing it

3387
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:02,020
in order to meet that existing demand.

3388
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:03,700
I don't know how much that is.

3389
02:44:03,700 --> 02:44:05,420
But this is different than what I understood you

3390
02:44:05,460 --> 02:44:09,460
say earlier which is the reason he has more cholesterol

3391
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:11,380
is it's along for the ride with the boats

3392
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:13,860
and he has to have more boats which defies.

3393
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:14,740
No, that is correct.

3394
02:44:14,740 --> 02:44:16,620
But that defies the principle of mass balance.

3395
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:18,300
You can't create matter out of nothing.

3396
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:20,180
I'm not saying he's creating matter out of, okay.

3397
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:22,660
So he had to make more cholesterol.

3398
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:23,820
I don't see a way around that.

3399
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:26,380
I'm not disagreeing with him making more cholesterol.

3400
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:29,280
I think where we're disagreeing is I think you're saying

3401
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:32,240
in total he's making three times more every day.

3402
02:44:32,240 --> 02:44:33,300
Am I wrong on that?

3403
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:36,380
On average he is making three times more

3404
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:38,340
or reabsorbing three times more

3405
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:39,900
but just based on what I'm seeing.

3406
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:41,100
Reabsorbing at the liver

3407
02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:42,700
or reabsorbing in non-hepatic tissues?

3408
02:44:42,700 --> 02:44:43,880
Probably in the gut.

3409
02:44:43,880 --> 02:44:46,260
That's where the majority of the reabsorption

3410
02:44:46,260 --> 02:44:47,100
is taking place.

3411
02:44:47,100 --> 02:44:48,780
Okay, in other words he's sending it back out

3412
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:49,620
the other side.

3413
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:51,740
Well again, this is what we look at these sterile numbers

3414
02:44:51,740 --> 02:44:53,980
for when the desmosterol goes through the roof

3415
02:44:53,980 --> 02:44:56,020
plus or minus the phytosterols that tells you

3416
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:58,140
these patients are making more cholesterol.

3417
02:44:58,140 --> 02:44:58,980
Okay.

3418
02:44:58,980 --> 02:44:59,860
But here's the question.

3419
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:01,820
If this were purely about energy,

3420
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:04,740
he shouldn't be making any more cholesterol.

3421
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:07,180
He should have more particles perhaps

3422
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:08,860
but they should be cholesterol depleted.

3423
02:45:08,860 --> 02:45:11,220
You answer this question for me.

3424
02:45:11,220 --> 02:45:15,100
When does somebody make more cholesterol depleted?

3425
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:16,100
Because everything that I've read

3426
02:45:16,100 --> 02:45:17,580
in clinical epidemiology and so forth

3427
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:19,380
is it's like a standard quantity

3428
02:45:19,380 --> 02:45:22,740
on the non-triglyceride side of the ledger.

3429
02:45:22,740 --> 02:45:25,480
If you're making cholesterol on a per-particle basis,

3430
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:27,220
it can vary on a per-particle level

3431
02:45:27,220 --> 02:45:29,500
but generally speaking it tends to hit averages

3432
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:30,820
that are fairly consistent.

3433
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:33,020
But this is an unusual circumstance you're describing,

3434
02:45:33,020 --> 02:45:33,860
right?

3435
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:35,020
This is the whole purpose of this experiment

3436
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:36,980
is you're describing people who.

3437
02:45:36,980 --> 02:45:37,820
It's not unusual.

3438
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:40,740
You're saying is so great for triglycerides

3439
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:41,580
that they're doing something.

3440
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:42,420
That you make more boats

3441
02:45:42,420 --> 02:45:45,140
but the boats if they already have a standard composition,

3442
02:45:45,140 --> 02:45:48,220
why would they change that standard composition per boat?

3443
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:49,940
So are you telling me that you're saying

3444
02:45:49,940 --> 02:45:54,260
that the large LDL particle and the small LDL particle

3445
02:45:54,260 --> 02:45:57,060
in the insulin resistant versus the insulin sensitive

3446
02:45:57,060 --> 02:45:59,060
patients have the same cholesterol composition?

3447
02:45:59,060 --> 02:46:00,180
No, that's my point.

3448
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:02,500
My point is getting back to remnant cholesterol.

3449
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:04,180
Why does that I think there would be something

3450
02:46:04,180 --> 02:46:06,060
that would happen on that dotted line?

3451
02:46:06,060 --> 02:46:08,300
Something before and after, right?

3452
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:09,420
Why would there be a problem with somebody

3453
02:46:09,420 --> 02:46:11,260
who's metabolically deranged with their cholesterol

3454
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:12,620
relative to one of these people

3455
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:15,960
that are theoretically metabolically flexible?

3456
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:18,000
Why would there be a difference?

3457
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:18,840
And the short answer to that,

3458
02:46:18,840 --> 02:46:23,000
short answer is I don't know fully all of the aspects to it.

3459
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,460
I do know though there seems to be a longer residence time

3460
02:46:25,460 --> 02:46:28,580
with BLDLs and we see that because that's the fastest.

3461
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:30,940
Yeah, no, we know that that's explained very clearly

3462
02:46:30,940 --> 02:46:34,940
by APOC3, the residence time on BLDL for that matter as well

3463
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:36,260
in pathologic states.

3464
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:38,820
So if I became more insulin resistant

3465
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:41,980
and therefore ended up with higher BLDLs,

3466
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:43,940
I couldn't say two years later have healed that

3467
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:45,260
and then have less BLDLs.

3468
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:46,820
No, look back to the Garvey study.

3469
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:47,900
There's a reason I printed this up

3470
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:50,180
because I knew we'd be talking about this over and over again.

3471
02:46:50,180 --> 02:46:52,380
There's very little difference.

3472
02:46:52,380 --> 02:46:55,740
To try to impute or infer something about

3473
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:59,860
remnant cholesterol from VLDL is as complicated

3474
02:46:59,860 --> 02:47:03,500
as trying to assess LP little a

3475
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:05,500
by looking at LDL cholesterol.

3476
02:47:05,500 --> 02:47:06,660
Think about that for a moment.

3477
02:47:06,660 --> 02:47:07,940
When you look at LDL cholesterol,

3478
02:47:07,940 --> 02:47:09,020
if it's directly measured,

3479
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:12,660
do you agree that it's the sum total of LDL cholesterol

3480
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:15,100
plus LP little a cholesterol?

3481
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:16,380
Yes, I believe that's how it is.

3482
02:47:16,380 --> 02:47:17,220
And it excludes.

3483
02:47:17,220 --> 02:47:18,060
I believe that's how the test works.

3484
02:47:18,060 --> 02:47:21,220
Yeah, it excludes VLDL cholesterol and ideal cholesterol

3485
02:47:21,220 --> 02:47:22,500
because they contain APOE

3486
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:24,940
whereas the LP little a and the LDL p do not.

3487
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:28,060
So if you have a direct cholesterol measurement,

3488
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:32,100
the LDL c is technically LDL c plus LP little a c.

3489
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:34,260
But there is no way on God's green earth

3490
02:47:34,260 --> 02:47:37,100
you can look at that and infer what the LP little a is.

3491
02:47:37,100 --> 02:47:38,620
Right, without testing directly.

3492
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:40,380
Yeah, and similarly,

3493
02:47:40,380 --> 02:47:44,300
we don't know what's going on with these VLDLs,

3494
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:46,200
meaning in Moffitt because we haven't measured it,

3495
02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:49,280
but we've measured this in patients that span the spectrum

3496
02:47:49,280 --> 02:47:51,620
of insulin sensitive to diabetic

3497
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:54,500
and that doesn't appear to be the answer.

3498
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:56,740
The difference in the atherogenicity,

3499
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:57,940
the difference in the residence time

3500
02:47:57,940 --> 02:48:01,500
and the difference in the total APOE load

3501
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:03,820
appears all driven through the LDL particle,

3502
02:48:03,820 --> 02:48:05,580
not the VLDL particle.

3503
02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:09,260
So something else explains why they have more LDL.

3504
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:10,660
That's what I wanna find out.

3505
02:48:10,660 --> 02:48:12,540
Again, I'm very upfront about what it is

3506
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:13,620
that's theoretical and what isn't.

3507
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:15,340
But we kind of already know the answer to that question.

3508
02:48:15,340 --> 02:48:17,020
It's the triglyceride content.

3509
02:48:18,180 --> 02:48:20,020
But until we can actually test it

3510
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:22,500
on people who are fat adapted or ketogenic,

3511
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:23,560
we can't say that we do.

3512
02:48:23,560 --> 02:48:26,160
When we can do a kinetic study on VLDL secretion

3513
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:27,220
with people who are particularly

3514
02:48:27,220 --> 02:48:28,880
like lean mass hyper responders,

3515
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:29,880
then we'll have some idea.

3516
02:48:29,880 --> 02:48:33,020
But Dave, that will only offer you an explanation.

3517
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:35,880
It will not change the question.

3518
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:36,720
Of risk.

3519
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,880
Yes, let's say you can do the kinetic study

3520
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:40,520
and hopefully somebody wants to fund this

3521
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:42,060
because it is an interesting question.

3522
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:44,020
Again, I've done the kinetic study on myself.

3523
02:48:44,020 --> 02:48:45,660
You've seen my data.

3524
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:48,240
I lose triglyceride, not cholesterol,

3525
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:50,280
which I would expect, right?

3526
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:53,640
I am seeing cholesterol basically stay the same

3527
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:55,480
in those cells during the periods

3528
02:48:55,480 --> 02:48:57,600
of extensive exercise and fasting.

3529
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,760
We're seeing triglyceride movement within the cell.

3530
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:03,560
But the point is, even if this theory turns out

3531
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:06,960
to be correct, it's an explanation, not a reason.

3532
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:09,320
It's an explanation for something,

3533
02:49:09,320 --> 02:49:11,100
but it's not a reason to ignore it, is it?

3534
02:49:11,100 --> 02:49:13,780
This is where I think we're getting a circular.

3535
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:16,200
It's an explanation as to why it could be benign

3536
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:17,500
or even beneficial.

3537
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:19,160
And that's where we're disagreeing ultimately,

3538
02:49:19,160 --> 02:49:21,360
which I figured we would be, right?

3539
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:25,280
Why would you have high LDL for a good reason?

3540
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:27,660
And your answer would be there wouldn't be one, right?

3541
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:28,740
No, no, that's not true.

3542
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:30,080
There wouldn't be a good reason

3543
02:49:30,080 --> 02:49:32,120
with respect to cardiovascular disease.

3544
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:34,300
There are plenty of good reasons to have high LDL.

3545
02:49:34,300 --> 02:49:36,680
We just talked about them, the FH patients.

3546
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:39,960
Obviously get some benefit from their high LDL.

3547
02:49:39,960 --> 02:49:42,560
But from a cardiovascular standpoint,

3548
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,940
I don't think there is a single good reason

3549
02:49:44,940 --> 02:49:47,400
to have high LDL, and I am not aware

3550
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:50,080
of a single card-carrying lipidologist

3551
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:53,200
or member of the community that spends a lot of time

3552
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:54,560
in this literature that could come up with one,

3553
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:56,080
and I've been asking.

3554
02:49:56,080 --> 02:49:57,640
It's something I've been very interested in.

3555
02:49:57,640 --> 02:50:00,560
Give me a teleologic reason to have high LDL

3556
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:02,520
from a cardio protection standpoint.

3557
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:04,880
I was asking this question seven or eight years ago.

3558
02:50:04,880 --> 02:50:06,800
There is no answer.

3559
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:10,560
So again, doesn't mean that having high LDL is always bad,

3560
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:13,480
but it's really important to understand this distinction.

3561
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:15,340
The other thing to keep in mind is lots of things

3562
02:50:15,340 --> 02:50:17,940
in biology are not linear.

3563
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:20,260
So look at Gilber's syndrome.

3564
02:50:20,260 --> 02:50:23,940
Gilber's syndrome is a very common condition.

3565
02:50:23,940 --> 02:50:25,620
Two or three percent of people listening to this have it,

3566
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:26,740
probably don't even know it,

3567
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:30,240
but they have elevated, unconjugated bilirubin,

3568
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:31,580
but very slightly elevated.

3569
02:50:31,580 --> 02:50:32,760
So if you've had a blood test done,

3570
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:35,700
you probably know down at the bottom it says ALT, AST,

3571
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:39,060
bilirubin, and normal bilirubin would be less than one.

3572
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:42,040
But these patients with Gilber typically get to about two.

3573
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:45,000
Well, in half a dozen studies,

3574
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,080
these patients have an enormous risk reduction

3575
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:48,680
in cardiovascular disease.

3576
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:49,780
Why?

3577
02:50:49,780 --> 02:50:52,460
Why would having a slight doubling of bilirubin,

3578
02:50:52,460 --> 02:50:55,160
which by the way at high levels is toxic.

3579
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:57,560
So if you walk around the bilirubin of 10,

3580
02:50:57,560 --> 02:50:59,360
you're not gonna be around very long.

3581
02:50:59,360 --> 02:51:01,060
And those patients present, they get sick,

3582
02:51:01,060 --> 02:51:02,800
they have obvious symptoms, they're jaundiced,

3583
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:05,560
and they usually have some pathology that's leading to it.

3584
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:07,440
But these patients can walk around with a bilirubin

3585
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:11,360
of 1.6 to two, and they seem to be getting a benefit from it.

3586
02:51:12,080 --> 02:51:14,600
And they also seem to have lower LDL,

3587
02:51:14,600 --> 02:51:16,800
and even if they don't have lower LDL,

3588
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:18,040
because the literature is mixed on this,

3589
02:51:18,040 --> 02:51:20,220
they always have lower ox LDL.

3590
02:51:21,640 --> 02:51:25,200
And it may be that the best explanation is that bilirubin

3591
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:27,020
has anti-oxidative properties.

3592
02:51:28,400 --> 02:51:32,080
So they get this protection from cardiovascular disease.

3593
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:34,120
But it's a U-shaped curve,

3594
02:51:34,120 --> 02:51:35,680
or an inverted U-shaped curve rather.

3595
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:38,680
Meaning as that bilirubin gets higher and higher,

3596
02:51:38,680 --> 02:51:40,640
they start to lose any of that benefit.

3597
02:51:40,640 --> 02:51:42,840
Meaning whatever oxidative benefit they get,

3598
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:45,440
it's more than being outweighed by the damage

3599
02:51:45,440 --> 02:51:47,720
that comes from that elevated bilirubin.

3600
02:51:47,720 --> 02:51:50,000
So I guess my point here is,

3601
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,180
even if there's an explanation for why this is happening

3602
02:51:53,180 --> 02:51:55,240
from an energy trafficking standpoint,

3603
02:51:55,240 --> 02:51:57,040
which again, I really wanna be clear,

3604
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:58,420
I do not think there is.

3605
02:51:58,420 --> 02:52:00,120
I do not think that energy trafficking

3606
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:01,600
explains this phenotype.

3607
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:04,420
I think that is not the Occam's razor answer.

3608
02:52:04,420 --> 02:52:05,760
I think the Occam's razor answer is

3609
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:07,520
they're making a boatload more cholesterol,

3610
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:09,920
because I think we have pretty good data to suggest that.

3611
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:11,200
Which I'm dying to test, by the way.

3612
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,040
Yeah, yeah, I know.

3613
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:13,120
I mean, we should make sure that you can,

3614
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:14,900
and that other people can do this.

3615
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:17,820
But of course, the point here is,

3616
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:20,400
it still won't actually answer the question,

3617
02:52:20,400 --> 02:52:21,800
what should you do about it?

3618
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:23,640
Just because there's a reason for something

3619
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:25,960
doesn't mean that it's a benign condition,

3620
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:27,080
or that it should be ignored.

3621
02:52:27,080 --> 02:52:29,360
I agree, and not only that, it's separate subjects.

3622
02:52:29,360 --> 02:52:31,280
I'll even go a step further and say,

3623
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:33,860
it could be a U-shaped curve on this end as well.

3624
02:52:33,860 --> 02:52:38,080
It could be that you could have an LDL-P of say, 1800.

3625
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:39,340
And it turns out that's actually

3626
02:52:39,340 --> 02:52:41,300
the bottom of the curve, and people at 1800

3627
02:52:41,300 --> 02:52:43,100
don't turn out to be as high a risk

3628
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:44,940
as people that are, like the one you just showed me,

3629
02:52:44,940 --> 02:52:46,380
above 3500.

3630
02:52:46,380 --> 02:52:47,700
I not only grant that,

3631
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:50,220
I also further tell lean mass hyper-responders,

3632
02:52:50,220 --> 02:52:53,820
I may turn out to be right on my cautious optimism

3633
02:52:53,820 --> 02:52:55,580
as far as the risk in cardiovascular disease,

3634
02:52:55,580 --> 02:52:56,980
but it could turn out that there's something else

3635
02:52:56,980 --> 02:52:58,480
we haven't yet determined.

3636
02:52:58,480 --> 02:53:00,340
That's a problem with this phenotype,

3637
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:01,900
which is another reason why we should be sharing

3638
02:53:01,900 --> 02:53:04,860
all the symptoms that may be coming along with it as well.

3639
02:53:04,860 --> 02:53:06,300
But all of that said, all of that said,

3640
02:53:06,300 --> 02:53:07,820
the larger question is,

3641
02:53:07,820 --> 02:53:10,540
why then would I be able to identify

3642
02:53:10,540 --> 02:53:14,100
a certain set of parameters that when studied,

3643
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:17,540
seem to suggest that high levels of LDL-C,

3644
02:53:17,540 --> 02:53:19,900
I want some with high LDL-P,

3645
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:22,200
doesn't prove to be problematic.

3646
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:23,580
And that's why I wanna get a hold of something,

3647
02:53:23,580 --> 02:53:26,220
I wanna get a hold of a really large data set.

3648
02:53:26,220 --> 02:53:29,820
By stratifying, stratifying for high HDL,

3649
02:53:29,820 --> 02:53:31,660
stratifying for low triglycerides.

3650
02:53:31,660 --> 02:53:32,500
No, no, no.

3651
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:33,340
And stratifying for high LDL.

3652
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:34,740
How will you know if they're not at increased risk

3653
02:53:34,740 --> 02:53:35,700
for cardiovascular disease?

3654
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:37,660
How long will you need to follow them to know that?

3655
02:53:38,380 --> 02:53:40,220
Well, that depends on the data set I can get a hold of.

3656
02:53:40,220 --> 02:53:43,460
I'm not in your space, so I have to work with other people

3657
02:53:43,460 --> 02:53:44,300
who are researching it.

3658
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:45,120
Oh, you're saying you wanna do this

3659
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:46,180
with retrospective data?

3660
02:53:46,180 --> 02:53:47,020
Correct.

3661
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:48,660
Okay, so meaning this is your challenge to say,

3662
02:53:48,660 --> 02:53:50,820
don't give me genetic data, don't give me drug data.

3663
02:53:50,820 --> 02:53:52,660
I'd like just normal, non-drug,

3664
02:53:52,660 --> 02:53:56,860
non-genetic stratified people, preferably.

3665
02:53:56,860 --> 02:53:59,340
And I'd like to stratify just on those three,

3666
02:53:59,340 --> 02:54:00,700
just on HDL, LDL.

3667
02:54:00,700 --> 02:54:04,820
Even though your patients probably have some genetic snips

3668
02:54:04,820 --> 02:54:06,220
that are explaining their phenotype.

3669
02:54:06,260 --> 02:54:07,820
Oh, I would definitely wanna know that as well.

3670
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:10,060
That's why I'm trying to actively get the 23 in me.

3671
02:54:10,060 --> 02:54:11,900
I would love to send it your way around and so forth.

3672
02:54:11,900 --> 02:54:13,140
But the point is you're excluding anybody

3673
02:54:13,140 --> 02:54:14,500
who has anything that could be called

3674
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:15,780
the genetic alteration,

3675
02:54:15,780 --> 02:54:17,020
even though the patient population

3676
02:54:17,020 --> 02:54:18,300
you're trying to understand this in

3677
02:54:18,300 --> 02:54:20,620
almost assuredly has a genetic alteration

3678
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:22,260
that's rendering them susceptible.

3679
02:54:22,260 --> 02:54:23,660
I'm not trying to exclude that.

3680
02:54:23,660 --> 02:54:25,540
But you just said you don't wanna consider

3681
02:54:25,540 --> 02:54:29,540
any of the genetic drivers of FH.

3682
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:32,080
Let me emphasize, if you're making a study

3683
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:34,100
that is gene-specific,

3684
02:54:34,100 --> 02:54:36,300
then it's the gene that drives the detection,

3685
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:38,460
the discovery of those people.

3686
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:39,300
I don't wanna do that.

3687
02:54:39,300 --> 02:54:41,380
I wanna actually see if I can get a broad-based study

3688
02:54:41,380 --> 02:54:45,340
of people who happen to already have high HDL,

3689
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:47,060
low triglycerides, and high LDL,

3690
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:48,160
and see if they have high rates

3691
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:49,980
of not only cardiovascular disease, but all cosmonautism.

3692
02:54:49,980 --> 02:54:52,060
But again, I come back to the FH patients.

3693
02:54:52,060 --> 02:54:55,100
You can't find a more broader demographic of people

3694
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:58,060
in terms of variable genetic inputs

3695
02:54:58,060 --> 02:55:00,700
that produce a phenotype similar to what you're looking at.

3696
02:55:00,700 --> 02:55:02,580
I think we're just gonna end up in one of these

3697
02:55:02,620 --> 02:55:04,140
gotta agree to disagree moments.

3698
02:55:04,140 --> 02:55:05,140
Until I can-

3699
02:55:05,140 --> 02:55:06,660
Which is fine, I totally respect that.

3700
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:07,740
But I just want you to understand

3701
02:55:07,740 --> 02:55:09,340
what it sounds like from over here

3702
02:55:09,340 --> 02:55:10,800
is you're looking for a six-footer

3703
02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:12,500
and you're not gonna be happy to see a six-footer.

3704
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:14,300
And gosh, doggone it, you're not gonna leave

3705
02:55:14,300 --> 02:55:15,820
the kindergarten classroom till you find one.

3706
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:17,420
I would argue the opposite.

3707
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:18,940
I would say, look, if I could right now

3708
02:55:18,940 --> 02:55:22,140
just grab a million people in the United States,

3709
02:55:22,140 --> 02:55:24,380
just absolutely randomly determine,

3710
02:55:24,380 --> 02:55:26,020
why would that not be significant data

3711
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:28,460
if I found that people, there was the stratification

3712
02:55:28,460 --> 02:55:30,820
for which high LDL did not result

3713
02:55:30,820 --> 02:55:32,400
in high levels of cardiovascular disease,

3714
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:34,040
or all cause mortality.

3715
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:35,080
Well, because if you're gonna do that honestly,

3716
02:55:35,080 --> 02:55:36,240
you're gonna say, well, they can't have

3717
02:55:36,240 --> 02:55:37,600
a single genetic mutation,

3718
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:38,920
they can't be taking a single drug,

3719
02:55:38,920 --> 02:55:40,640
and they can't be on any funky diet.

3720
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:42,920
Let's say all of that turned out to be true.

3721
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:44,040
What if they don't exist?

3722
02:55:44,040 --> 02:55:45,980
If I found that out, that would be definitely something

3723
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:47,800
I think would be very interesting to my followers.

3724
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:48,640
I would turn that back around.

3725
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:50,840
But you'll never know if you found that out or not, Dave.

3726
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:52,200
Well, I've already found two studies

3727
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:54,220
that do stratify for those three.

3728
02:55:54,220 --> 02:55:55,640
And of the two that do,

3729
02:55:55,640 --> 02:55:57,420
high LDL does not result in high rates

3730
02:55:57,420 --> 02:55:58,600
of cardiovascular disease.

3731
02:55:58,600 --> 02:55:59,520
Wait, wait, you're talking about

3732
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,800
these glycogen storage disease cases?

3733
02:56:01,800 --> 02:56:04,280
No, no, Framingham offspring has one study

3734
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:05,520
where they stratified by three.

3735
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:07,400
And I, unfortunately, my computer is dead,

3736
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:08,480
or I'd show you the other one.

3737
02:56:08,480 --> 02:56:10,280
There's another one that stratified discreetly

3738
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:15,120
between below 170 LDL-C and above 170 LDL-C.

3739
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:18,520
And the high HDL low triglyceride group,

3740
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:21,560
when compared to above and below, were nearly identical.

3741
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:23,280
Both on the high side and on the low side.

3742
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:25,680
Yeah, but this study didn't stratify by ApoB.

3743
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,240
Right, I would love to have ApoB.

3744
02:56:27,240 --> 02:56:29,000
Okay, but that's the Quebec Heart Study for you

3745
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:29,840
right there.

3746
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:32,440
The Quebec Heart Study has the stratification

3747
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:33,680
by all three of those metrics.

3748
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:35,800
The Quebec Heart Study here, I've got it printed it up here.

3749
02:56:35,800 --> 02:56:36,640
Oh, fantastic.

3750
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:38,080
I mean, it basically is showing,

3751
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:39,760
it has nothing to do with the LDL-C

3752
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:41,000
once you know the ApoB.

3753
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:41,880
Look at the risk.

3754
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:44,980
Okay, I'm trying to get those three in conjunction.

3755
02:56:44,980 --> 02:56:47,360
I want to specifically stratify those three.

3756
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:51,480
And in software, this is where I get a bit frustrated,

3757
02:56:51,480 --> 02:56:53,140
because I feel like there's such a cultural difference

3758
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:55,580
between medicine and software.

3759
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:57,680
We're used to having just loads and loads of free data

3760
02:56:57,680 --> 02:56:59,520
just like oral wash and free data.

3761
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:02,760
Google can't wait to give me everything that I want to see.

3762
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:05,520
I requested, I've actually applied as an individual.

3763
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:07,600
No, I know, I've heard you talk about it.

3764
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:09,880
Are you being denied that or do they not have the data?

3765
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:11,360
They just don't return my emails.

3766
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:14,440
There's even people that I would think would be sympathetic

3767
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:15,800
inside the low-carb community,

3768
02:57:15,800 --> 02:57:17,680
and I'm not gonna try to call them out,

3769
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:20,460
who I've also tried to get this information from.

3770
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:22,200
And I just can't get it.

3771
02:57:22,200 --> 02:57:25,180
And I want just a nice clean regression on three axes.

3772
02:57:25,180 --> 02:57:26,840
That's all I want.

3773
02:57:26,840 --> 02:57:28,400
That's nice and fat.

3774
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:29,880
So the three axes being?

3775
02:57:29,880 --> 02:57:33,920
Triglycerides, HDL, and preferably LDL-P.

3776
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:35,400
Now, there is an important distinction

3777
02:57:35,400 --> 02:57:36,520
we've gotta make with ApoB,

3778
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:38,680
because ApoB can, in theory,

3779
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:41,040
also include remnant lipoproteins.

3780
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:43,080
Yeah, LDL-P is more accurate than ApoB.

3781
02:57:43,080 --> 02:57:46,120
Right, and LDL-P would be extremely fantastic.

3782
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:48,280
If you could help me get in touch with that data set,

3783
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:49,240
I would be very interested.

3784
02:57:49,240 --> 02:57:51,080
Not with any major adjustments,

3785
02:57:51,080 --> 02:57:52,760
I mean, whatever, Cox Proportional,

3786
02:57:52,760 --> 02:57:53,920
something like that might be fine,

3787
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:55,360
but just generally speaking,

3788
02:57:55,360 --> 02:57:57,240
if I could get a big fat data set

3789
02:57:57,240 --> 02:57:59,160
and stratify on those three axes,

3790
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:00,840
I think that would say a lot

3791
02:58:00,840 --> 02:58:02,280
as to whether there's any validity

3792
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:03,860
to the energy model overall.

3793
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:05,760
So when you look at the MESA data,

3794
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:09,180
which stratify on a Kaplan-Meier curve,

3795
02:58:09,180 --> 02:58:12,820
the difference between LDL-C and LDL-P,

3796
02:58:12,820 --> 02:58:17,820
you're saying that that's not relevant because it?

3797
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:19,560
The thing we're dancing around here

3798
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:21,520
is obviously when you have high HDL-C

3799
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:23,760
and you have low triglycerides,

3800
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:25,640
it suggests a number of different things.

3801
02:58:25,640 --> 02:58:27,640
But more broadly, it's suggesting

3802
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:29,680
a properly functioning lipid energy system

3803
02:58:29,680 --> 02:58:32,240
and probably not being in a state of a challenge of that.

3804
02:58:32,240 --> 02:58:35,320
HDL-C tells us absolutely nothing.

3805
02:58:35,320 --> 02:58:37,800
If we've seen enough from Mendelian randomizations

3806
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:41,160
and another, how many more CTEP failures do we need to see,

3807
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:44,440
HDL cholesterol tells us nothing about HDL function.

3808
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:47,920
In fact, any time you increase HDL cholesterol pharmacologically,

3809
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:49,640
you seem to make patients worse.

3810
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:51,480
I know, but these are modifications

3811
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:52,640
to the existing lipid system.

3812
02:58:52,640 --> 02:58:54,340
If you, why cholesterol? I get that, Dave,

3813
02:58:54,340 --> 02:58:56,540
but boy, if you're gonna hang your hat on,

3814
02:58:56,540 --> 02:58:58,860
it's all about HDL-C triglyceride.

3815
02:58:58,860 --> 02:59:01,660
I mean, wow, we are so far beyond that

3816
02:59:01,660 --> 02:59:03,140
in the lipid world at this point.

3817
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:05,420
If you're gonna go through this brain damage,

3818
02:59:05,420 --> 02:59:06,980
make it for something worthwhile.

3819
02:59:06,980 --> 02:59:09,820
But wouldn't you predict right now

3820
02:59:09,820 --> 02:59:11,860
that if I did hang my hat on those two things,

3821
02:59:11,860 --> 02:59:16,860
on those two markers, against LDL-C or APO-B or LDL-P,

3822
02:59:17,260 --> 02:59:18,980
that it would fail?

3823
02:59:18,980 --> 02:59:21,300
That if I were to say, hey, I wanna get a stratification

3824
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:24,420
just of high HDL-C and low triglycerides,

3825
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:27,420
that you'd say, sure, Dave, I'll bet you $10,000.

3826
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:29,420
I'll give you 100 to one odds.

3827
02:59:29,420 --> 02:59:30,820
Those people with high LDL,

3828
02:59:30,820 --> 02:59:32,820
even if you stratify for those two,

3829
02:59:32,820 --> 02:59:35,220
will still have high rates of cardiovascular disease.

3830
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:37,380
Again, I'd have to completely see the patient population

3831
02:59:37,380 --> 02:59:38,700
before I could even hazard a guess.

3832
02:59:38,700 --> 02:59:41,020
But right now, you would assume that, right?

3833
02:59:41,020 --> 02:59:44,000
I am going to assume that LDL-P

3834
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:48,380
is going to be a stronger marker of prediction than HDL-C.

3835
02:59:48,380 --> 02:59:50,260
And that's not what I'm making the case on.

3836
02:59:51,140 --> 02:59:51,980
What I'm making the case on is whether or not

3837
02:59:51,980 --> 02:59:53,820
there's a properly functioning lipid metabolism,

3838
02:59:53,820 --> 02:59:55,420
which would be indicated by all three of those.

3839
02:59:55,420 --> 02:59:58,060
No, you have absolutely no understanding

3840
02:59:58,060 --> 03:00:01,380
of the lipid metabolism by looking at HDL-C and triglyceride.

3841
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:02,980
I think that's- Not even close.

3842
03:00:02,980 --> 03:00:04,060
I don't know, this isn't like,

3843
03:00:04,060 --> 03:00:06,040
we can disagree on things that are nebulous.

3844
03:00:06,040 --> 03:00:07,100
This is not nebulous, Dave.

3845
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:09,460
This is, I mean, again, I hate that I'm saying this

3846
03:00:09,460 --> 03:00:11,260
because I sound like a jerk and I don't mean to.

3847
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:13,620
You've got to spend more time with lipid people.

3848
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:14,740
Okay. You really do.

3849
03:00:14,740 --> 03:00:16,620
You are not dealing with your peers at this.

3850
03:00:16,620 --> 03:00:18,540
You have to go and figure out,

3851
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:23,260
HDL-C is just categorically not a useful metric.

3852
03:00:23,260 --> 03:00:27,100
It is like a first order term on a,

3853
03:00:27,100 --> 03:00:28,300
no, it's not even that.

3854
03:00:28,300 --> 03:00:31,420
In engineer speak, it's the fourth order term

3855
03:00:31,420 --> 03:00:33,300
on a fifth order polynomial.

3856
03:00:33,300 --> 03:00:35,180
That hurts, Peter. That hurts.

3857
03:00:35,180 --> 03:00:36,020
I mean, come on.

3858
03:00:36,020 --> 03:00:37,580
It's just not that interesting.

3859
03:00:37,580 --> 03:00:39,060
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

3860
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:40,860
Look, I- It's super crude.

3861
03:00:40,860 --> 03:00:44,540
And don't confuse the ubiquity of it with its utility.

3862
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:47,140
Right? The ubiquity of it is, yeah, it's cheap.

3863
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:48,860
It's easy. Everybody's got it.

3864
03:00:48,860 --> 03:00:51,700
But like, let's not let people listen to this

3865
03:00:51,700 --> 03:00:53,820
and get lulled into a false sense of,

3866
03:00:53,820 --> 03:00:56,340
hey, if my HDL is high and my trigs are low,

3867
03:00:56,340 --> 03:00:59,100
who cares what my LDL is?

3868
03:00:59,100 --> 03:01:00,100
And unfortunately-

3869
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:01,700
I want to prove that right or wrong.

3870
03:01:01,700 --> 03:01:03,820
Well, first of all, you'll never prove anything in science.

3871
03:01:03,820 --> 03:01:05,900
So let's be really clear on our lingo.

3872
03:01:05,900 --> 03:01:06,740
Okay. No, no, no, no.

3873
03:01:06,740 --> 03:01:07,580
It's very important.

3874
03:01:07,580 --> 03:01:10,580
It's important for your listeners to understand that.

3875
03:01:10,580 --> 03:01:11,700
Fair enough. Fair enough.

3876
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:12,740
Nothing is proved.

3877
03:01:12,740 --> 03:01:13,900
It's about probability.

3878
03:01:13,900 --> 03:01:15,340
Sure. But likewise.

3879
03:01:15,340 --> 03:01:17,380
Would you say the Libet hypothesis is proved?

3880
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:20,380
Absolutely not. I just said there's nothing outside

3881
03:01:20,380 --> 03:01:22,620
of mathematics that exists in a proof.

3882
03:01:22,620 --> 03:01:24,060
Right. Nothing.

3883
03:01:24,060 --> 03:01:25,740
And I have the basis of the luxury

3884
03:01:25,740 --> 03:01:27,220
of having been a mathematician once.

3885
03:01:27,220 --> 03:01:28,060
So I get it.

3886
03:01:28,060 --> 03:01:31,980
There's a luxury of being able to write QED at the bottom.

3887
03:01:31,980 --> 03:01:34,060
We will never do this here.

3888
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:35,460
And if people are sitting there saying,

3889
03:01:35,460 --> 03:01:38,540
well, I'm going to keep eating my bacon and eggs

3890
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:41,700
like it's main lining and ignoring my LDL-C

3891
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:44,900
because my HDL-C is high and my trigs are low

3892
03:01:44,900 --> 03:01:47,580
because I'm on a low carb diet

3893
03:01:47,580 --> 03:01:49,620
and somehow that makes me special

3894
03:01:49,620 --> 03:01:52,300
because no one's proved that this is wrong.

3895
03:01:53,220 --> 03:01:55,380
Wow. That's not the legacy I want.

3896
03:01:55,380 --> 03:01:57,860
So what if I continue to find more data sets

3897
03:01:57,860 --> 03:01:59,620
that actually support that?

3898
03:01:59,620 --> 03:02:00,580
What do I do?

3899
03:02:00,580 --> 03:02:01,860
I don't know. I don't know what that means.

3900
03:02:01,860 --> 03:02:03,740
What do you mean by more data sets?

3901
03:02:03,740 --> 03:02:04,980
Meaning more anecdotes?

3902
03:02:04,980 --> 03:02:06,020
No. I'm talking like,

3903
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:08,900
let's say I do actually get ahold of Framingham offspring.

3904
03:02:08,900 --> 03:02:10,580
Let's say I get ahold of,

3905
03:02:10,580 --> 03:02:12,420
I forget what some of these larger data sets are.

3906
03:02:12,420 --> 03:02:13,260
And how will you have to go through it?

3907
03:02:13,260 --> 03:02:14,420
Mesa. Mesa.

3908
03:02:14,420 --> 03:02:15,820
Sure. Let's say I can get Mesa

3909
03:02:15,820 --> 03:02:17,060
and I can stratify for those three

3910
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:18,460
and it's showing the same thing

3911
03:02:18,460 --> 03:02:20,060
without doing a lot of adjustments

3912
03:02:20,060 --> 03:02:22,100
or anything along those lines.

3913
03:02:22,100 --> 03:02:23,380
What would I tell my followers?

3914
03:02:23,380 --> 03:02:25,900
I would say, no, it looks as if still there's further

3915
03:02:25,900 --> 03:02:28,140
evidence that showing high LDL-C in this case

3916
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:29,340
is not problematic.

3917
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:32,500
Or Mesa did actually stratify for LDL-P, didn't it?

3918
03:02:32,500 --> 03:02:33,700
Yes. Yeah.

3919
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:34,980
So that'd be a great example.

3920
03:02:34,980 --> 03:02:36,980
Mesa would be fantastic data to get ahold of.

3921
03:02:36,980 --> 03:02:39,300
Is that something you think I would ever actually be able

3922
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:41,200
to see or be able to run regressions against?

3923
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:43,460
I've never thought of it, but I agree with you.

3924
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:44,420
That would be great.

3925
03:02:44,420 --> 03:02:46,340
I don't know who owns the data.

3926
03:02:46,340 --> 03:02:48,140
But would that be compelling to you?

3927
03:02:48,140 --> 03:02:50,180
If it turned out that we could run regressions,

3928
03:02:50,180 --> 03:02:52,420
let's say that it was in the next room right now

3929
03:02:52,420 --> 03:02:54,340
and we worked it up on the computer

3930
03:02:54,340 --> 03:02:56,140
and sure enough, I went by these stratifications

3931
03:02:56,140 --> 03:02:59,860
I was looking for that are identical to somebody who'd be,

3932
03:02:59,860 --> 03:03:01,620
and they were typical to somebody

3933
03:03:01,620 --> 03:03:04,420
who was already a lean mass hyper-responder.

3934
03:03:04,420 --> 03:03:05,940
And it would show that they didn't have high rates

3935
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:07,940
of cardiovascular disease.

3936
03:03:07,940 --> 03:03:09,620
Would that be compelling data to you?

3937
03:03:09,620 --> 03:03:11,580
I think compelling is the wrong word.

3938
03:03:11,580 --> 03:03:13,420
The question is how would it add

3939
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:15,420
to the existing body of literature

3940
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:17,580
that informs a decision we have to make every day

3941
03:03:17,580 --> 03:03:18,460
with a patient?

3942
03:03:18,460 --> 03:03:20,680
And the answer is I'd have to see the strength of it

3943
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:22,540
and decide how does this fit

3944
03:03:22,540 --> 03:03:24,460
into the existing body of literature?

3945
03:03:24,460 --> 03:03:26,420
I mean, that's the only way I can imagine

3946
03:03:26,420 --> 03:03:27,600
thinking about this.

3947
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:30,780
But everybody listening to this and you and I

3948
03:03:30,780 --> 03:03:32,960
all have to put our heads on a pillow at night

3949
03:03:32,960 --> 03:03:36,060
with a null hypothesis against which we have

3950
03:03:36,060 --> 03:03:38,260
to challenge existing data.

3951
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:41,660
And I'm not convinced that the null hypothesis here

3952
03:03:41,660 --> 03:03:44,700
should be anything other than the lipid hypothesis.

3953
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:47,620
Now the lipid hypothesis gets bastardized all the time.

3954
03:03:47,620 --> 03:03:49,460
It gets misstated all the time.

3955
03:03:49,460 --> 03:03:53,140
It gets based on LDL-C and a whole bunch of other stuff.

3956
03:03:53,140 --> 03:03:55,460
But I'm talking about the real honest to goodness

3957
03:03:55,460 --> 03:03:57,740
no bullshit LDL hypothesis,

3958
03:03:57,740 --> 03:03:59,700
which again, I've written about eloquently

3959
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:02,340
and people have written about it far more eloquently.

3960
03:04:02,340 --> 03:04:04,100
I should say I've written about it in a kluge way.

3961
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:06,620
Others have written about it eloquently.

3962
03:04:06,620 --> 03:04:08,980
The lipoprotein, the endothelial damage,

3963
03:04:08,980 --> 03:04:13,540
the inflammatory changes, all of these things cascading.

3964
03:04:13,540 --> 03:04:14,940
That's my null hypothesis.

3965
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:17,620
And in the end, if there's data to counter that,

3966
03:04:17,620 --> 03:04:18,940
I'm all for it.

3967
03:04:18,940 --> 03:04:22,300
For example, even when you look at the IL-1, IL-6 agonists,

3968
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:24,860
the low-dose mesotrexate studies that showed

3969
03:04:24,860 --> 03:04:27,900
you could delay or reduce cardiac events

3970
03:04:27,900 --> 03:04:29,580
without changing lipoproteins,

3971
03:04:30,500 --> 03:04:33,380
I don't think I'm being delusional when I say

3972
03:04:33,380 --> 03:04:35,680
that doesn't change the model.

3973
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:36,800
It actually feeds into the model.

3974
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:38,720
The model is there are three things

3975
03:04:38,720 --> 03:04:39,920
that are driving this pathology.

3976
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:42,680
If you reduce one of them, things get better.

3977
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:45,240
All things equal if blood pressure goes down.

3978
03:04:45,240 --> 03:04:46,600
Do outcomes get better?

3979
03:04:46,600 --> 03:04:47,440
I believe they do.

3980
03:04:47,440 --> 03:04:48,920
Absolutely they do.

3981
03:04:48,920 --> 03:04:50,000
Very potent, why?

3982
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:51,160
Endothelial function.

3983
03:04:51,160 --> 03:04:52,920
All things equal if you stop smoking.

3984
03:04:52,920 --> 03:04:54,260
Do outcomes get better?

3985
03:04:54,260 --> 03:04:55,100
Absolutely.

3986
03:04:55,100 --> 03:04:57,840
So when you start to look at all of these things,

3987
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:58,680
and again with those.

3988
03:04:58,680 --> 03:05:00,400
But by outcomes get better, your specif-

3989
03:05:00,400 --> 03:05:01,320
Cardiac outcomes.

3990
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:02,320
Right, cardiac outcomes.

3991
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:05,000
The all-cause outcome is a much more complicated question

3992
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,460
that probably has a podcast in of itself.

3993
03:05:07,460 --> 03:05:09,720
To your question, yeah, Dave, of course.

3994
03:05:09,720 --> 03:05:11,620
I'd be incredibly curious to see this.

3995
03:05:11,620 --> 03:05:12,700
Who wouldn't be?

3996
03:05:12,700 --> 03:05:16,520
But don't think that one regression analysis on Mesa

3997
03:05:16,520 --> 03:05:18,520
is gonna turn over 50 years of data

3998
03:05:18,520 --> 03:05:20,160
regardless of what it shows.

3999
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:23,000
The question is how does it alter our understanding

4000
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:24,220
and thinking of the problem?

4001
03:05:24,220 --> 03:05:26,200
Look, the whole reason I'm even pursuing

4002
03:05:26,200 --> 03:05:28,760
this particular strata is because of the model

4003
03:05:28,760 --> 03:05:29,600
in the first place.

4004
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:31,760
I had to have something that I could conceive of

4005
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:34,000
that would inform the decision by which I would be looking

4006
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,760
for what the data is that would disprove it.

4007
03:05:36,760 --> 03:05:38,640
That's why I'm in pursuit of disproving it.

4008
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:41,220
At the end of the day, Peter, I can't emphasize this enough.

4009
03:05:41,220 --> 03:05:43,160
I'm not looking to talk to the echo chamber

4010
03:05:43,160 --> 03:05:46,480
or looking to just maneuver around inside of a number

4011
03:05:46,480 --> 03:05:47,760
of people that are gonna congratulate me.

4012
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:48,880
I specifically-

4013
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:51,360
But I think you're better off going to an NLA meeting

4014
03:05:51,360 --> 03:05:52,400
than a low-carb meeting.

4015
03:05:52,400 --> 03:05:54,120
Sure, but they're freaking expensive.

4016
03:05:54,120 --> 03:05:55,680
I've looked at all of them.

4017
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:58,480
I get the low-carb community to fund you.

4018
03:05:58,480 --> 03:06:00,140
If they wanna know the answer,

4019
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:01,280
because I don't think they do,

4020
03:06:01,280 --> 03:06:02,400
if I'm gonna be brutally honest.

4021
03:06:02,400 --> 03:06:04,280
I think the worst of that crowd

4022
03:06:04,280 --> 03:06:07,060
just want their confirmation bias.

4023
03:06:07,060 --> 03:06:09,220
They have seen these incredible benefits

4024
03:06:09,220 --> 03:06:10,680
of low-carbohydrate diets,

4025
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:13,840
and their belief is nothing can be wrong with this.

4026
03:06:13,840 --> 03:06:16,080
Like we somehow live in a mono-dimensional,

4027
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:21,080
monochromatic world where it's that black and white.

4028
03:06:21,160 --> 03:06:23,080
And if the diet is good for this,

4029
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:25,040
it can't be bad for anything.

4030
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:26,520
And they are so wed to that

4031
03:06:26,520 --> 03:06:29,680
that they construct these crazy arguments.

4032
03:06:29,680 --> 03:06:32,240
But if they share your passion for truth,

4033
03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:35,080
then they should happily fund you to go to an NLA meeting

4034
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:36,360
and spend a week there,

4035
03:06:36,360 --> 03:06:39,280
and actually start hanging with these guys

4036
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:40,960
who are way smarter than me.

4037
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:42,520
Like I'm a knucklehead.

4038
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:45,320
I mean, I know a lot about lipids for a knucklehead,

4039
03:06:45,320 --> 03:06:47,960
but I'm talking about like the smartest people in the world

4040
03:06:47,960 --> 03:06:51,320
are the ones you need to be talking to on this topic.

4041
03:06:51,320 --> 03:06:53,400
And they're not at low-carb conferences.

4042
03:06:53,400 --> 03:06:55,240
I promise you that.

4043
03:06:55,240 --> 03:06:56,600
They're not on Twitter,

4044
03:06:56,600 --> 03:06:59,520
and they're not playing patty cakes on their like high-carb

4045
03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:00,880
or whatever low-carb blogs.

4046
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:03,320
It's just not about that stuff, man.

4047
03:07:03,320 --> 03:07:04,360
And again, I mean,

4048
03:07:04,360 --> 03:07:06,640
I think what you're doing is really interesting.

4049
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:08,200
I don't agree with the model,

4050
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:10,720
but I'm glad that you're pursuing it.

4051
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:13,320
I wish you the best in pursuing it with the right people.

4052
03:07:13,320 --> 03:07:14,160
Absolutely.

4053
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:16,840
Well, and perhaps you'll be able to help me set up

4054
03:07:16,840 --> 03:07:17,680
with the right people.

4055
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:20,200
I would definitely be more interested in finding those voices

4056
03:07:20,200 --> 03:07:21,760
that can help tear out this model.

4057
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:23,720
I would be more than happy to help in any way I can.

4058
03:07:23,720 --> 03:07:24,560
Great.

4059
03:07:24,560 --> 03:07:26,200
I can't emphasize enough as I anticipated.

4060
03:07:26,200 --> 03:07:28,560
I was gonna ask you more questions than you asked me.

4061
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:30,320
I'm really appreciative that you took the time

4062
03:07:30,320 --> 03:07:31,560
to chat with me about this.

4063
03:07:31,560 --> 03:07:32,400
No, my pleasure, Dave.

4064
03:07:32,400 --> 03:07:33,280
Thank you very much.

4065
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:35,720
I apologize if this just took longer

4066
03:07:35,720 --> 03:07:37,080
than we thought it might have.

4067
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:40,400
And I know we went off on tangents all over the place.

4068
03:07:40,400 --> 03:07:42,680
I guess this will be one where the show notes

4069
03:07:42,680 --> 03:07:44,080
are probably quite helpful,

4070
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:46,520
but nevertheless, it was great meeting you in person.

4071
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:48,480
I didn't realize it's only been three years

4072
03:07:48,480 --> 03:07:49,840
since you've been at this.

4073
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:52,160
It feels like a lot longer, actually.

4074
03:07:52,160 --> 03:07:53,840
It certainly does for me.

4075
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:56,480
And my wife would say it's felt twice as long for her.

4076
03:07:56,480 --> 03:07:58,200
I mean, you have to realize something.

4077
03:07:58,200 --> 03:08:00,920
Almost nobody knew about me a year and a half ago.

4078
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:03,120
And I knew almost nothing about cholesterol

4079
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:04,720
three years before that.

4080
03:08:04,720 --> 03:08:07,000
This has absolutely been a fresh journey.

4081
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,600
And that's why I have to oftentimes emphasize

4082
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:11,840
that I'm not a formally trained biochemist.

4083
03:08:11,840 --> 03:08:14,480
I really have a lot of gaps, I'm sure,

4084
03:08:14,480 --> 03:08:17,040
in my knowledge that I'm looking to fill

4085
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:18,800
and find as fast as I can.

4086
03:08:18,800 --> 03:08:21,160
All right, well, it was great to meet you.

4087
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:22,960
Enjoy your time in San Diego.

4088
03:08:22,960 --> 03:08:24,640
Oh, by the way, for the listener,

4089
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:28,840
this is being recorded on July 26th.

4090
03:08:28,840 --> 03:08:30,920
It will be a long time before this goes up, Dave.

4091
03:08:30,920 --> 03:08:32,440
So hopefully the listeners understand

4092
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:34,760
that whatever's transpired since then is just,

4093
03:08:34,760 --> 03:08:36,600
we pre-record these things many months in advance.

4094
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:38,460
We may have to bump it up a little bit,

4095
03:08:38,460 --> 03:08:40,480
depending on maybe we can reshuffle it

4096
03:08:40,480 --> 03:08:42,680
and get it out before the end of the year,

4097
03:08:42,680 --> 03:08:45,400
which is probably right now where it sits in the pipeline.

4098
03:08:45,400 --> 03:08:47,000
You're gonna subject me to quite a hell

4099
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,440
because I'm guaranteed every single follower I have

4100
03:08:49,440 --> 03:08:51,520
is gonna be knocking on my door

4101
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:53,400
until this thing has opened up.

4102
03:08:53,400 --> 03:08:54,400
So that'll be pretty funny.

4103
03:08:54,400 --> 03:08:55,400
We'll do what we can.

4104
03:08:55,400 --> 03:08:57,160
Anyway, man, all right, thanks so much.

4105
03:08:57,160 --> 03:08:58,960
Absolutely. Awesome to finally meet you.

4106
03:08:58,960 --> 03:09:02,720
