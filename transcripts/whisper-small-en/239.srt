00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Well, Andy, it's wonderful to see you here on video. We were supposed to do this in person,

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,040
but we got a good laugh as to why that didn't pan out, but that's okay. Perhaps there will

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,200
be an in-person chance the next time.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited to be here this way. It would have been more enjoyable in person,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but we'll make it work.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,280
I've wanted to speak with you for quite a while, and I think listeners to this podcast

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,320
are not strangers to the idea of how much of an emphasis I place on exercise. I've said

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,760
it many times before. I'll continue to reiterate it until the data suggests otherwise that

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:52,680
there's really no more potent tool to improve longevity, meaning extending the length of

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,680
life and improving the quality of life than exercise. That includes nutrition, that includes

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,960
sleep, and that includes the entire pharmacopeia of medication, supplements, drugs, hormones,

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,920
et cetera. It's probably for that reason that I would say that exercise makes up a disproportionate

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,800
amount of the content on our podcast. Of course, within exercise, I tend to divide it really

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,160
down into these different pillars of strength, stability, and cardiorespiratory fitness,

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,560
which of course then gets further subdivided by the metabolic state and energy state of

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,760
it. Of course, what we're going to probably talk a lot about today is strength, but also

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,720
all of the things that stem from that, like hypertrophy and various things like that,

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,720
which I think are of huge interest to people. Maybe for folks who don't know you, can you

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,120
give us a sense of your path, even frankly out of high school college, what was your

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,000
athletic background and what made this be something that you have dedicated all of your

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
time to?

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,200
Sure. I guess initially I need to state a conflict of interest, which is I'm going to

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,840
actually have scientists. If you want to start giving more credit to exercise for ongoing

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,240
wellness, I cannot be a little more biased into that lane, especially with then actually

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,200
assigned strength training. I've been waiting for 30 years for this to happen in the field.

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,920
Now I get to prove that all my preconceived notions are actually holding true. I will

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,560
refuse to change despite what you said. I will refuse to change despite what the data

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,560
suggests. No, for really, I grew up in a very small town in Southwest Washington. So I played

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,840
everything in high school, football, basketball, baseball, track and field, the whole thing.

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,800
I went to a small school in Oregon where I played college football and got my undergraduate

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,400
degree in exercise science. And then after that, I made some stops in Arizona and worked

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,320
in a facility training professional athletes. I went back and got my master's degree in human

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,960
movement sciences, which is just another fancy way of saying kinesiology or exercise

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,920
science, and then got my PhD in human bioenergetics. So in 2011, I got that came out here

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,640
to California and I've been working at Cal State Fullerton ever since. So I've been for a

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,240
while now the director for the Center for Sport Performance there, as well as my lab,

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,000
which is a biochemistry and molecular exercise physiology lab. So that's the condensed version

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,680
of the academic path. Now, I think one more pertinent question was college football, and

40
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,600
then training professional athletes started at that point as well. And then I started

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,600
competing in weightlifting, which locally is Olympic weightlifting that version of it,

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,000
and then combat sports a lot of that. So I've continued to work with athletes the entire

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,480
time. I'm still over the last 10 years, you know, running my labs, running our research.

44
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,960
I've worked with professional athletes in just about every sport with exception of racing,

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,760
I have yet to get into Formula One. But Cy Young winners MVPs, all pros, you know, the

46
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,320
whole whole thing, Olympic gold medalists, etc. So my research actually, and my interests

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,520
really come back from the exact same point. And if someone returns at the very beginning

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,560
here, which was, I was a decent athlete, but I actually feel like I was in the perfect

49
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,560
spot because I wasn't so good that these details didn't matter, I was going to be in all pros going

50
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,320
to, you know, go to the next level no matter what that wasn't the case. So when I did things

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,560
better, was more effective with training, more effective recovery, it mattered, I saw differences

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,840
on the field, right, it was the difference between me being a starter and being not a starter or

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,600
whatever the case is. I also was good enough to know where I got rewarded. So if you're not good

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,720
enough, then it's just like doesn't matter what you do, you're not gonna play the next level. So I

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
was in that perfect scenario. And so I was totally obsessed with making sure I gave myself every

56
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,440
advantage possible to have some success. I knew I was never going to be a professional level caliber

57
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,280
or even division one. But I was like, the difference is, do you want to play college football or not?

58
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,560
That's going to be the difference. So if you can do these things, you might be able to do it. If not,

59
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,760
you're gonna have no chance. And where I'm from, people don't, don't really go to college in general,

60
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,080
and they certainly don't play college sports. There's no advanced degrees. And so to me, I was

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
like, wow, you got a chance to do something really special here. And do something that no one else

62
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,960
you really know has done that often. So that's that initial passion came from. Additionally,

63
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,440
the town I grew up with, my parents and everybody I knew, it is a very working class place. And so

64
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,320
losing was always fine. There's always better than you. But losing because you didn't prepare was

65
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,800
totally unacceptable. We all most of the kids I grew up with, we worked on farms,

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,600
we cleaned stalls, we did something before school. My parents worked in construction,

67
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,840
like building. So that whole idea of like, you fend for yourself, and you get what you earn,

68
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,200
and all that sort of stuff was just something I grew up with. And so moving that into sports

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,640
academia was like, if you want a chance, like this on you and nobody else. And so do the work or

70
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,320
don't do the work. So that's what all pushed me to get here. And then, as I'll finish up,

71
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,160
the background is, then when I started moving past my athletic career, and I started

72
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,680
started finding athletes who wanted to pursue these tremendous goals like go to the Olympics,

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,640
but in a sport like women's wrestling, like no one's going to help them, they don't have funds.

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,680
And so I just became very interested in these people, because I'm like, man,

75
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,160
I can help you a lot. No one else cares about you. There's no money on the back end here. There's no

76
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,680
fame. There's no social media at the time. I just want to get help you here in this journey,

77
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,160
because that's something that's going to reach my soul of, let's give everything we can have to do

78
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,800
something really special that no one's going to care about, besides you and I, and like your team

79
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,200
and your family. And so that's what drove it initially. And that's what really put me in this

80
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,880
position. And that's what put me in a position to continue to go get my master's to get my PhD was,

81
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,960
you got to learn more, there's more things going on here, you've got to find all the answers,

82
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,760
that you can. And if you're doing anything less than that, what are you doing? You're just giving

83
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,880
up. So that's the background of sort of how I got here and what I do now.

84
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,560
Now you mentioned briefly Olympic lifting. We've had Lane Norton on the podcast several times.

85
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
Lane obviously is a very successful power lifter. I think folks are kind of familiar with power

86
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,240
lifting, having the three lifts. And it's really about these three lifts and what your total is

87
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,240
in those three lifts. Can you contrast that a little bit with what Olympic lifting is? And

88
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,480
I think more importantly, what are the physiologic differences between those two? And I'll preface

89
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,240
the question for the listener by saying, again, even if you never plan to power lift or Olympic

90
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,560
lift, this is going to be germane to our discussion. Yeah. So this is very, there's actually a,

91
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,280
a fairly recently we published the most in-depth analysis of muscle composition of Olympic weight

92
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
lifters. So we can actually come back to that and we can talk more specifically about muscle

93
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,800
composition. But in general, as some background, if you think about power lifting, it's tricky

94
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,640
because we're about to run some loops on your brain here. So technically you have force production,

95
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,120
which is in the case of lifting, it is one rep max. So it's the most amount of weight you can lift

96
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,520
one time. Period. Not repetitions on how many times you can do it, not how fast you can do it,

97
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,760
just what can you get up. And the sport of power lifting, like what Lane does, it is three exercises,

98
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,480
the deadlift bench, the squat, and it's how much weight can you lift one time? You get a couple of

99
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,800
tries at it, but it's, that's effective what it is. Right. So it's really an expression of pure

100
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,680
strength. It's not really an expression of power at all because the speed component is very poor.

101
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
In fact, the deadlift can take as long as you want. It doesn't matter. Did you get it up or did you not?

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,560
Squat, et cetera. So we're already at the gates, which confuse people because the name of the sport

103
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,120
is called power lifting. Despite the fact that it is not a power exercise, nor is it determined by

104
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,080
power. When you move over to Olympic way, that thing, it's the same basic idea. There are now

105
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
two lifts instead of three, one left being called the snatch and the other one's called the clean

106
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
and jerk. It's called the clean and jerk because it has two parts. You clean it to your chest and

107
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,880
then you jerk it over your head, but it's still considered one lip. Name of the game is still one

108
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,480
rep max. So whoever can lift the most amount one time is the winner. Man, there's no repetition

109
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,880
method to it. The difference is though, this is now more expression of power because although it's

110
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,880
all about one rep max, it's difficult to lift something over your head as high as possible

111
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,880
slowly. So there's a speed component required to the movements to perform, whether it's the clean

112
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,720
or the snatch. And so it is an expression of tremendous strength, but there's a force or

113
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,480
velocity component to it. So when you multiply force by velocity, now you've got power. And so

114
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,320
technically the weight lifters, Olympic weight lifters are significantly more powerful than a

115
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,360
power lifter, despite the fact the power lifter is in a sparkle power. So the confusion there is,

116
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,240
and this gets worse when we start roping in things like strong man. So strong man is fantastic

117
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,640
because again, you think of strength and you think that must be the biggest expression of strength.

118
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,240
Or in fact, it's not because strong man is contested over multiple repetitions.

119
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,480
So it is an expression of very, very high strength, repeated several times, very, very high strength,

120
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,520
but it's not technically a true one rep max that actually goes to back of the power lifters. So now

121
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,920
you've already confused powerlifting, weightlifting and strong man. And none of those three things

122
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,800
are actually explaining what they do correctly. We can keep going on with multiple sports here,

123
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,960
but this is the gen, the core, the problem. The reason you're, I think you're bringing this up is

124
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,480
this also explains training adaptations. And it's exactly, it's a perfect way to outline

125
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,120
to understand what's happening. So if you train like a power lifter, that's probably represents

126
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,760
the best way to get truly strong. If you train like a weight lifter, it represents the best way

127
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
to get powerful. If you train like a strong man, it represents a fantastic way to get very, very

128
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:06,240
strong and more, what we'll say, life functional movements. So walking, carrying, lifting objects

129
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,240
and doing it probably multiple times. So the only difference between all those three, the last part

130
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,560
I'll add to is with Olympic weightlifting, the amount of coordination required, because you're

131
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,480
going to take away from the ground, throw it over your head and catch it over your head in a full

132
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,680
squat. So when it comes to things like balance and proprioception and eccentric catching, it is

133
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
the advantage goes to weightlifters, you know, big time there. You're not going to see that

134
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,200
powerlifting is very controlled. It's a very specific foot position, hand position. There's

135
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,280
no movement ideally. And it's very, it's typically you're minimizing range of motion intentionally,

136
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,320
because you want to minimize work, right? So working force times distance. And if the game

137
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,720
of the game is who can create the most force, you can minimize the distance you're going to win.

138
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,320
That's why they take those funny positions. That's why Lane has both of his feet,

139
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,120
six miles apart. And does it, he calls it a deadlift, even though it's a fake movement.

140
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Just kidding. And Lane and I go back many, many years. So he would laugh at that joke, I promise.

141
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,960
So that's the basic foundation of the difference here. You have a very sports specific application

142
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,920
for powerlifting. Weightlifting is very sports specific, but it's a much greater range of motion

143
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,560
has those other components. And strong man is kind of addition. I didn't know, I know you didn't ask

144
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,920
about strong. No, no, no. I love that you brought that in. Before I go on to my next question,

145
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,400
let's put one more little bow on that. We've talked a lot about who's the strongest, who's

146
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,800
the most powerful, who has the most functional strength. You want to throw in a little bit on

147
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,560
hypertrophy within that trio? Yeah, great. So you can actually add a couple of more scenarios here.

148
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,640
Hypertrophy would be more of your bodybuilding, which Lane has also done. Holly, I think you just

149
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,800
have Holly on, right? So Holly can smash with physique, whether you want to call it bodybuilding

150
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,320
or general physique or any stuff is simply improving generally leanness and total muscle

151
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,560
mass. And then there's a component of symmetry and shape, things like that, that don't really

152
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,200
matter for this conversation. So if you add that on top of it, now you're talking about who can

153
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,560
optimize muscle size as well as leanness, which is really, really important with no consideration

154
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,040
for function. Doesn't matter if you're strong or fast or athletic or any of those things.

155
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,720
And so there, in fact, this is so interesting that you started the conversation like this, because

156
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,520
this is day one of my strength conditioning courses, the academic semester. I spent the

157
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,720
first week actually just on going over these different categories of sport, because it does

158
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,040
exactly like what you're setting up here is it outlines exactly how to train. And the last two

159
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,440
pieces just to throw this in there would be actually, if you think about the competitive

160
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,440
circuit training sports, like CrossFit, for example, totally, no offense. I'm just meeting

161
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,720
it as a sense of they are very strong. They have a lot of muscle, but they're not nearly as strong

162
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,160
as power lifters, as a general statement, and not nearly as strong as world's strongest men,

163
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,320
but they do a lot more repetitions. And so a world's strongest man is going to win

164
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,040
an event doing something like five to 15 repetitions, like something, you know, kind of

165
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,920
depending. And CrossFit, you might have to do 90 reps in a given workout, like way more. And so

166
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,520
it's way higher up that scale of number repetitions. They do some, of course, that are one

167
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,240
repetition, but you get the point. It's just like a very crude explanation of what's happening.

168
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,160
A lot of function, a lot of different movements, and a lot of workouts repeated in the same day.

169
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,280
And so it's a very different test of recovery over three or four days of just brutal on-salt,

170
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
and asked to do things in a lot of different areas, in a lot of different energy systems,

171
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,560
and movement patterns, and things like that. So it's a really interesting test of total physical

172
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,280
fitness. And the last one that I like to throw in there is either, is basically track and field.

173
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,080
And now you have the truest expression of velocity. These are the people who are going to be the best

174
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,600
at getting you truly fast. And so if you think about this now, what do you need to have as a

175
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,960
functional human being for lifespan, longevity, or sport? And if you want to think about this in a

176
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,360
spectrum, how do I get absolutely fastest? How do I get the most powerful? How do I get strong?

177
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,480
How do I add muscle size slash lose body fat? How do I improve my muscular endurance?

178
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,960
And now how do I improve my cardiovascular metabolic endurance? This is now occupied in

179
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,840
all of those sports. And so we can just look at them as a model for training and saying the best

180
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,160
in the world at getting stronger have been doing this. The best in the world are getting faster,

181
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,920
peak speed. The best in the world at getting able to recover multiple days in a row.

182
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,480
Okay. So we have different models of that. So that is a nice foundation for all training, really.

183
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,240
Yeah, I love it. And there's a matrix brewing right now in my head as you go through that.

184
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,760
So we're going to come and kind of start to fill in some of this matrix as we go.

185
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:09,920
So let's simultaneously go back to the fundamentals, but do so with

186
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,760
without any remorse for how rigorous we need to be.

187
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,360
That's the greatest setup ever.

188
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:29,600
So let's talk about muscles. What is a muscle? What is the functional unit? How does it generate

189
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,800
force? What are the metabolic demands? What makes these cells that are so ubiquitous in our body

190
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,360
different from say the cells in our liver, the cells in our gut, the cells in our brain, you

191
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,360
know, what, what are these, what are these cells that we almost take for granted sometimes?

192
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,960
All right. Now you're asking me to do like a two semester course in 20, 20 minutes.

193
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,280
Look, I did ask you to do a week in seven minutes. So by that logic, we could be here a while,

194
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,560
but yeah, let's see what we can do.

195
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,560
All right. Hopefully you're ready for part two, three, four, and five of this

196
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,960
podcast. I'll give you what I can give you and then we'll come back. Let's think about it this way.

197
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,280
Number one, I like to play a little trick. You ever asked people to kind of like that

198
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,560
jeopardy question of what's the biggest organ in your body? And people generally are going to say,

199
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,560
scan. Yeah, exactly. That's what I would have said actually.

200
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,760
Yeah, right. Well, us again, exercise scientists. And if I didn't give you enough of a bias earlier

201
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,680
about being an exercise scientist, I'm also a muscle physiologist. So I'm going to give

202
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,080
all the credit in the world, the muscle and none of it to anything else. So,

203
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,640
So basically the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs don't give a shit leader,

204
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
but they're just there to support the muscles.

205
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,720
A hundred percent. And if you start talking my worst enemy, the nervous system,

206
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm probably going to hit and record and go off. Those neuroscientists just take credit for

207
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,160
everything. It's garbage, hot, garbage, right? Give it all the muscle. So you've heard my biases.

208
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
If you want to stop listening, now you can, if not understand that that's really going here.

209
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,880
And so in general, if you think about it this way, again, muscle is, is going to be the largest

210
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,040
organ in your body. And you've talked about this a number of times on your show, but it's doing

211
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,040
everything from supporting function. And so locomotion, getting you throughout the world

212
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,720
to being your biggest reserve for amino acids, what you need for building any cell, any functional

213
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,440
cell in your body, your brain, your liver, the immune system, all that has to come from somewhere

214
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,680
to regulating glucose being your biggest dump and reserve for regulating metabolism, controlling

215
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,640
function. I could go sort of on and on and on about the, the physiological, the practical,

216
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,360
general health benefits of, of skeletal muscle.

217
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,160
And don't be bashful. This is a good time to, to, to say those things and to expand on them,

218
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,400
because I've said everything you've said, but I think there's more to it. And I think one of

219
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,160
the things you've said, I don't think probably is as appreciated, which is the storage depot for

220
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,440
amino acids, because we don't really think of it that way, right? We, we sort of, you know,

221
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,560
Elaine did a great job talking about this in the podcast, which is we're constantly breaking

222
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:24,000
down and constantly adding new. So there's this pool of turning over amino acids. And it's very

223
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,920
difficult to study them from a flux perspective, but clearly some of those things getting spun off

224
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,000
in the moat, you know, if you're working out, it's at least a plausible scenario that amino acids are

225
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,880
being broken down, meaning proteins are being broken down, amino acids being released. They may

226
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
not be resynthesized right back into that same piece of skeletal muscle. They may be used for

227
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,960
another application. Well, it's not even a maze. Like, it's a pretty much guaranteed, like that,

228
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:57,200
that's going to happen. If you kind of think about it this way, if, so I'll give a quick energetic

229
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,200
analogy here. So the, I have like a cheesy video I did 10 years ago, or a set in my backyard and

230
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,600
shot this and put it on YouTube. So we'll, we'll link to it if you, yeah, you'll send it to us and

231
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,760
we'll link to it in the show notes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's, that's, we'll find that

232
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:19,360
somewhere buried eight year ago, YouTube land or something. So if you think about the very basics

233
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,920
of energy, if you were going to be out camping, you're an outdoorsman, right? Yeah, you're a,

234
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,480
yeah, you and I. Okay, great. So if you're out, if you're out hunting, which I am actually even a

235
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,280
couple of days from my hunting trip. So this is front of mind is why this analogy comes up.

236
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,200
And you want to, you know, you may need to create a fire. You have a handful of, of options. And the

237
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,000
very first one being, if you had a match, right? A match is very easy to light. And if anyone lights

238
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,920
a match on fire, it's going to give you instantaneous energy, the fire, and it's going to last some amount

239
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,400
of seconds before it burns out. I don't know what those seconds are. Five seconds, 10, 12, doesn't

240
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,520
matter. So some, some short amount of seconds. Worst case scenario, you need energy. Great.

241
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,680
The downside is you have limited supply of them. They're kind of finicky, and you better hope they

242
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,920
don't get wet. And they're just not reliable. At best case, if none of that happens, you're still

243
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,840
going to get some amount of seconds. If you need that energy right now, though, that's where you

244
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,200
start. In terms of your tissue, that's going to be ATP. That's going to be your fossil creatine

245
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,840
energy system. So the stoichiometry is one to one there, you break down one fossil creatine,

246
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,680
you're getting one mole of ATP out of that. That's great. That's stored internally in your

247
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
muscle. So that's already right there. In fact, it's generally loaded right up on the myosin head

248
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,520
or close to it. And so it can contract tissue and we can come back to what all that stuff means.

249
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Yeah, we'll, we'll talk about actin myosin in a minute, because I want people to actually know

250
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,720
what this physically looks like, but let's go back to the 100%. Great. So that's your little energy

251
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,520
boost system. Now, if you had a little bit more forward thinking, you would say, okay, let me use

252
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,920
that mask and then actually just light a newspaper. If you had a newspaper or some of the other

253
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,640
if you had newspaper or something like that, and if you're in the woods papers, same thing, you get

254
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,840
fairly quick light, not as fast as a match. And it would give you some few minutes of energy. It

255
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,520
doesn't matter what these numbers are. It's just conceptual stuff here. And that's great.

256
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,400
That's going to be carbohydrate, right? So carbohydrate is stored both in the cell as well

257
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,800
as outside the cell in three major areas. But in the cell, it's going to give you a lot more energy

258
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,680
that is the most direct fast stoichiometry is a little bit better, but not much actually. And so

259
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,800
you're going to get a couple of moles of ATP per molecule of carbohydrate. And that's not,

260
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,000
it's better, but it's like, you're sort of splitting hairs here a little bit.

261
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,360
If that gets low, you can now pull glucose out of the blood. And for a little bit of terminology

262
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,840
here, glycogen in the tissue is what it's called. Glycogen in liver is what it's called. If we put

263
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,040
that in the blood, that's called glucose, blood sugar, roughly talking the same things here.

264
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,640
So we can pull that out of the blood. And then we can actually, if that gets low,

265
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,960
we can pull that out of the liver. So that's the basic like energy pathway in the liver then

266
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,440
functions as kind of your backup storage system for glucose to make sure that you can regulate

267
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,120
blood glucose while you're changing concentrations of glycogen in tissue. That's really what it's

268
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,520
doing. Cause you don't want, obviously, as you've talked about a million times, a bunch of instability

269
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,280
and blood glucose. That's a bad thing. It's one of the four things that your body will regulate

270
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,680
almost over almost anything else in addition to pH and blood pressure, et cetera, and electrolyte

271
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,760
concentrations. Like they don't like to mess with those things at all. So everything else will move

272
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,320
around those things to keep those stable. All right. So if we're in the tissue now and we've

273
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,320
got past our newspaper, the next thing it would be a giant piece of wood. So if you had firewood or

274
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,520
something like that, lighting firewood in the wild is very difficult to do. It doesn't happen in

275
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,360
seconds. You need to kind of know what you're doing, but it's going to give you exponentially

276
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,880
more fire length than you could put a log on a fire. And that could literally be on going the

277
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
next morning when you wake up and give you hours. Think about that as fat. Now, I like this whole

278
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,800
analogy is if you know a little bit about the chemistry of fat versus carbohydrate, they're

279
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,800
both big, long chains of carbon. Just like a paper is actually made of wood. It is sort of just a

280
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,560
separate piece of the same thing. So you get a small six carbon chain from glucose.

281
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,880
You can get any number of lengths of chains of fat, right? 18 carbon fatty acid chain. You can

282
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,200
put three of those on a backbone of glycerol and you've gotten yourself 50 carbon molecules per

283
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,520
triglyceride or something like that. So stoichiometry gets better here. You're going to get

284
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,120
something like 300 or 400 ATP per molecular fat. And that's where things get actually better.

285
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
The fat is actually coming mostly though from outside of the muscle. So energy from fat

286
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,240
mobilization comes throughout the body somewhat evenly. Glucose comes mostly from the muscle

287
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,480
itself. And then a little bit from the backup supplies, if it gets low, fossil creating comes

288
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,360
directly from the muscle. All that energetic background is safe. When you start moving and

289
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,040
you start trying to create exercise, where's the last piece we forgot here? Oh, that's protein.

290
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,640
So protein actually in this analogy would be functioning more like a piece of metal.

291
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,160
So if you had metal in the woods and you needed a fire and you had absolutely nothing else,

292
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,440
you can in theory melt metal with the fire. You're going to get some, but it is a very,

293
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,040
very low end proposition. If you absolutely have to do it, you can do it to survive.

294
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,800
But if that's your fueling strategy, you're in a big, big problem because you're going to run out

295
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,320
of metal very quickly in the woods. You're out of it. It's also the only thing you have to create

296
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,880
shelter and stability and to fend for food and everything else. And so it is a plausible way

297
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,440
to provide energy. It's just a terrible one. It's mostly there for you to reconstruct new tools.

298
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,360
And so if you're in the woods and you have metal and you need to make a knife, you can fashion that.

299
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,880
Okay, now we need to melt that thing down and make a roof. We can fashion that. Now we need to melt

300
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,520
that back down and make a shovel. It's meant to be kind of broken back down, recreated in the same

301
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,960
and different forms of the same basic item. And so that's really what we're looking at. The ability

302
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,360
to play back and forth with carbohydrate and fat as different fuel system. That's really like,

303
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,320
probably we don't have time to get to that today. It's not really the best thing, but the ability

304
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,760
and the need and the point of protein in tissue, it is not fuel, although it can be for what I

305
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,120
explained. It's really that. It is taking it and saying we need it mostly for this task right now.

306
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,160
We need it mostly for skeletal muscle. We need it mostly for immune system. We need it mostly for

307
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,600
these other functions. And so one of the ways to quickly lose muscle is to put yourself in a

308
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,360
compromised position because it's going to say if we're choosing between keeping that 24-inch bicep

309
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,160
or clearing up something we need immunologically, it's going to go towards that. This is also why

310
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,800
we see protein redistribution across muscle. So if you see, like say you spend a bunch of times on

311
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,520
your bicep and your biceps get really, really big and then you don't train your calf and your calf

312
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,840
is actually, and let's just say your protein intake is insufficient. You will start redistributing

313
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,080
proteins from the calf up to the bicep to actually enable that growth. And so you're thinking you're

314
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,200
getting bigger, but you're really just taking it from other places if protein intake itself is

315
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,200
not sufficient. And so it really is a cornerstone. And if you look at the research, like you're going

316
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,400
to see this bear through like very clearly as something. If you ever wonder why some of these

317
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,200
people are just like so diligent about protein intake and why this has become such a big deal is

318
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,720
is this is it's the raw material you really can't get anywhere else. And you can get carbohydrates

319
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,720
and fat and you can go through that whole thing in a lot of ways. You can't fake protein though.

320
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
It's just very challenging to do so. And the last little piece I'll say there is why this is so

321
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,240
important to me is you can't fake muscle most specifically without the protein. And when we

322
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:10,160
start losing muscle, now we enter a whole cascade of problems from physical performance. You know,

323
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,080
your interest is more of like aging and longevity. That whole cascade, it becomes a problem. And then

324
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,240
we can certainly talk about the specific changes in muscle and pass some of the details you've

325
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,960
actually covered before with that. But yeah, those are things like it just becomes a really big deal.

326
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:33,680
So it just doesn't make any sense to skimp on that one as a place to go. Yeah, I'll just stop there

327
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,880
because I can keep going. But yeah, no, I think it does. It's worth repeating, right? That when you

328
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,720
look at people across their lifetimes and you evaluate for muscle mass and you, you know,

329
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,760
divide people up and categorize them by the amount of muscle mass they have. And we should talk about

330
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,680
this because of course, my interpretation of the data is that once you normalize for strength,

331
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,640
the strength wins, but it's sort of easier to measure muscle mass. All you need to do is put

332
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,000
somebody in a DEXA and you sort of can figure out their ALMI. And so we tend to look at survival

333
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,480
curves based on ALMI, which for the listener just means the amount of lean muscle you have in your

334
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,400
arms and legs normalized to your height, appendicular lean mass index. You know, there's no

335
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,880
ambiguity about the fact that more muscle means a longer life. It's, you know, it's as clear as high

336
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:39,040
VO2 max means a longer life. So let's now go back and make sure people understand the structure

337
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,440
of a muscle because I want to talk about different fiber types as well, just to round out some of the

338
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,120
physiology. So in an effort to understand the difference between a fast twitch and a low twitch,

339
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,880
fast twitch and a slow twitch muscle fiber, which has a metabolic difference. I'm curious as to what

340
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,280
the structural difference is and maybe just kind of explaining how myofibrils work and things like

341
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,440
that. Yeah, sure. So let me go back just a little bit to understand whole human function movement.

342
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,720
I won't go as deep into this one though. If you just think about how you actually create movement,

343
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,760
it really has three core functions. So number one, you have to have some sort of direction or signal,

344
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,080
and this is going to be coming from your nervous system. And so whether this is central peripheral,

345
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,240
whether this is autonomic, whether this is a controlled somatic action response, it doesn't

346
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,720
really matter for this conversation. The nerve has to tell it what to do. So nerves, you get that

347
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,480
one. That's it. Don't take anything else in nervous system. You get that control. Now that nerve then

348
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,960
has to go into muscle fiber and tell the muscle fiber to contract. Okay, the muscle fiber then is

349
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,400
part two. So the cell actually has to contract itself, but that actually doesn't cause movement.

350
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,600
Muscles are not attached to bone. That's not how it works. So muscle fibers are surrounded by

351
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,320
connective tissue. All those connective tissue are bundled together in like a package. So if you

352
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,280
imagine buying a bunch of strips of bacon from the butcher and they would wrap that up and kind of

353
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,280
saran wrap together, that's actually kind of what a muscle looks like. So you've got that

354
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,000
saran wrap connecting it. So if you pulled on one piece of bacon, you'd notice the whole package

355
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,120
moves. And that's, that's sort of the point. You're transferring force from muscle through

356
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,960
connective tissue. That connective tissue comes together into a tendon and that tendon then

357
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,240
attaches to bone. And so the third part for human movement is actually connective tissue.

358
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,760
And so you have to have a signal, you have to have a muscle contract that has to make connective

359
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,240
tissue pull on a bone. That actually is what generates human movement. Well, if you look at

360
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,400
the front end, we'll leave the neuroscience to other people. You look at the connective tissue

361
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,400
and it's very difficult to understand what's happening there for a number of reasons, but

362
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,280
mostly it's, it's, it's not plastic. When we look at muscle, it's tremendously plastic. And what I

363
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,160
mean by that is it adapts. It changes very quickly, quickly and rapidly in response to a

364
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,480
lot of things. Connective tissues doesn't have a blood flow supply. It doesn't have an energetic

365
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,720
demand. It's just, it's kind of just there. It's, there's more to that story, but we'll just kind of

366
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,320
leave it like that. The core of the issue of adaptations, whether they are pro or negative,

367
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,360
is going to be in skeletal muscle. And so here's what that actually looks like. A nerve will come

368
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,120
down and actually attach and innervate to a whole host of muscle fibers. And so you can imagine

369
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,400
skeletal muscle fibers are some of the largest cells in all of biology by diameter. They're

370
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,200
tremendous in humans. In fact, what's actually very interesting about humans that makes us special

371
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,200
is our muscle fibers are what's called multinucleated. And so you probably remember this term from like

372
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,960
med school or something like that. In fact, I, whenever I talked to biology people about this,

373
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,400
like their head is blown because I forget how lost in exercise science I get,

374
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,440
but like us nerds, but it's very uncommon in nature to see cells that have more than one

375
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,600
nucleus. And the nucleus is the, is the core of the cell. If you will, it's what holds your DNA.

376
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,440
That's what controls and tells you when to replicate proteins, to grow, shrink, die, repair.

377
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,800
So the whole control center. So the fact that skeletal muscle has many of them per cell.

378
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,400
In fact, it's not a few, it's not two or three, it is thousands per cell. So skeletal muscle

379
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:23,920
can be extraordinarily large. You can actually, I have a video of this somewhere. I can't remember,

380
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,960
actually, there might've been a picture in a men's health thing we did. There's a video somewhere.

381
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,800
We're actually, we'll find that and we'll also put that in the show notes.

382
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:40,160
Okay. I can actually pick up a single muscle fiber from the human with tweezers and you can see it

383
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,160
with your naked eye. So we could hold this. In fact, I could do it right now. If I had one,

384
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,360
I could hold it in front of the camera and you'd be able to see an actual whole muscle cell.

385
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,760
They're that large. In fact, they can be very, very long. So they can be several inches.

386
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,520
And let's help folks understand what defines a cell because normally outside of the muscle,

387
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,160
we kind of define a cell by a cell membrane has a single nucleus. I mean, we kind of know what the

388
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,320
constitutive elements here. This is defined also by a cell membrane, but it's a sort of a longer

389
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,760
looking tube as opposed to a sphere. Oh, yeah. Just sort of. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Good distinction.

390
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,120
All right. Sort of, again, get lost in exercise science here. So yeah, if you remember,

391
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,440
you're back to high school biology and you think of a cell as like a circle or an oval.

392
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,640
It's like that. It's circular, but it's a tube. So it's a very long tube. The way to think about it

393
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,200
is like a ponytail. So if you think about a ponytail, you think about it as one thing. It is a ponytail,

394
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,200
but it's made up of a whole bunch of long tube individual hairs. And they all wrap together to

395
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,760
make a ponytail. That's what a cell, a skeletal muscle cell looks like, which is actually quite

396
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,000
different than a cardiac cell. Those are more rectangular, if you will, that they're shorter

397
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,680
and wider. Skeletal muscle fibers are very long or in error, but still circular. They still have

398
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,440
a cell membrane. They have a bunch of nuclei. Most of the organelle are the same as any other

399
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,320
thing that contract all units we can get to in a second. But yeah, that's the basic setup of them.

400
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,120
And just give me the typical length of a skeletal muscle cell.

401
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,000
You can't really give a typical because depending on what you'll see, a skeletal muscle is structure

402
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,120
as function. So if you can contrast this to cardiac tissue. So cardiac tissue is actually

403
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,280
quite interesting because it is what we call the ultimate slow twitch fiber. And so all the

404
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,800
cardiac tissue is slow twitch. And in fact, the slow twitch are even more slow twitch than the

405
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,960
skeletal and there tend to be fairly uniform. So you could give specific numbers and cross-sectional

406
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,760
area and diameter length on those skeletal muscle. If you look at like you're sartorius,

407
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,240
which is that kind of muscle that goes from that pointy part of the front of your hip down to the

408
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,880
inside middle of your knee, theoretically, those fibers could run the whole line.

409
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,240
A single cell. Correct.

410
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,520
Can run that whole length. Yeah. Even if it runs half that length, that's, that's extraordinary.

411
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:09,280
You go back though, and you'd go to like an ocular muscle and it's going to be mining. It's going to

412
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,920
be extremely small and like, if you go to muscles in your digitize your fingers, they're going to

413
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,960
be very, very, very, very short. So it's sort of, there is no like classic range. It could be from

414
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,920
millimeters to literally inches and like. So what, so presumably the reason that these cells have

415
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:42,000
multiple nuclei is, you know, basically to decentralize the actions of cellular construction,

416
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,840
right? So you've got DNA making RNA in the proximity of that nucleus coming out onto the

417
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:55,360
Golgi making protein. And if you had, for example, you know, even a one centimeter long cell,

418
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:03,600
which is enormous, outrageous, you couldn't simply make all of that work with one nucleus. So

419
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,440
the question is, does that mean these nuclei act independently?

420
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,960
Like what's the, where's the central command on this? It seems like a remarkable problem.

421
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,480
Okay. Boy, remarkable problem. Remarkable advantage, right? It's the same.

422
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,280
Hard to control, but amazingly adaptive. Exactly. This is exactly right. So if you want to dive

423
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,800
down the entire nucleation question, this gets very, very interesting because a handful of things

424
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:40,480
we've actually shown in our lab that a lot of professional athletes have more nuclei per volume.

425
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,720
And so this is one of the things that I posit is maybe this is why they can adapt so well.

426
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,200
My, what's why they can handle the volume that they can handle is they just simply have more of

427
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,760
these nuclei around. And you believe that that is how much genetic and how much adaptation to

428
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,800
training? Boy, I would love to give you an answer there. We have like anything that's going to be,

429
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,600
okay. So there's going to be a component to both. We actually know of numerous

430
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,040
lifestyle factors or your influence these things, but the more recent data are showing this.

431
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:22,320
In general, we have thought that nuclei have a couple of things. So one, it's not just nuclei

432
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,600
count that matters, which is what we previously thought the shape matters. And so there's

433
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,560
different, there's like spheres, there's ovals, they're all kinds. And it looks like the shape

434
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,520
determines the function, the location determines the function. And so it looks like there are

435
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,080
subtypes of nuclei that surround, for example, the mitochondria. And they're going to be very

436
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,440
specific to mitochondria repair. And then there's other types that are more specific to periphery,

437
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,960
that'll do cell wall damage. And then there are some actually that are regulating injury, specifically,

438
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,960
this is what it looks like right now. And so there are subtypes, and this is very, very recent

439
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,720
understanding. And this is probably why some folks recover and respond to injury more than others is

440
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,600
they just simply have more of the subtype. Now your question nature versus nurture, that's

441
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:18,160
challenging about that is the measurement fidelity here is difficult and attack is moving quickly,

442
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,840
but it's sort of like every couple of years when the microscopes get better, we sort of realize that

443
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,360
a whole three previous years are now invalidated. And so there's just a lot of movement back and

444
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:35,360
forth. And in fact, if you look at this related to cell growth, other words, hypertrophy, there

445
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,080
seems to be tremendous confusion about the role of these things in growth or not. So there used to be

446
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,240
a thing that we referred to as a myonuclear domain limitation. So in other words, a cell would only

447
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,320
grow. So this would be your fiber, it would only hypertrophy or grow in diameter, to the extent at

448
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,360
which the nuclei could control it. And so in order to gain more growth, you actually have to get more

449
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:03,680
satellite cells to come in and add nuclei. And then when you detrain, that cell goes back down

450
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,600
in diameter, but you preserve the amount of nuclear number. And so then now retraining is easier than

451
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,080
it was the first time. So I mean, this is unbelievable, but this is the old adage of

452
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,640
muscle memory, quote unquote, it's easier to regain muscle you once had than to put on muscle you never

453
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:28,720
had. And I've never heard a molecular explanation for that. But that's a very plausible mechanism,

454
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,080
right? Which is, you retain the nuclei. It looks like that's not correct. Interesting. So there's

455
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:42,960
like, it's very, it's very back and forth, is the way I'll say it. So something is there. The story I

456
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,520
just outlined to you, like, it makes intuitive sense. I got really hot on it for a number of years.

457
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,760
And then it was like some more challenging data came out and it's like, well, we don't think so.

458
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,520
I'm just gonna have to say like, this is like a like, every week, another paper comes out and it's

459
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,920
just like, okay, now we're back on it. And now we're back off. And now we realize there's subtypes of

460
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,120
land and play. And they're like, oh, shit, okay. But it will lend itself obviously to a longitudinal

461
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,160
type study. I mean, in an ideal world, you would take relatively young, presumably pliable athletes,

462
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,280
you know, in their teens and study them over time under different training demands.

463
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,280
You know, obviously the dream case is doing it with with identical twins. So that which we've done,

464
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,000
you have. Yeah. So I could just totally interrupt you and go to that.

465
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Yeah, well, actually, let's put a pin in because I want to come back to making sure people still

466
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,160
understand how these things work. So we've now established that muscle cells are kind of unlike

467
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,120
any other cell in the body. How hungry are they for energy? Yeah. You know, so for example,

468
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,280
when we look at the liver, you know, I always think of a liver as a beautiful organ, maybe not quite

469
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,800
as cool as the muscle, but but it has a special place in my heart. Because I've always argued

470
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,840
that the reason there is no extracorporeal support for the liver is we simply can't replicate its

471
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,280
complexity. Right. So for listeners, extracorporeal means outside of the body. So dialysis is

472
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,920
extracorporeal support for the kidney. You know, a vad or an ECMO is extracorporeal support for

473
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,560
the heart or heart and lungs combined a ventilator extracorporeal support for lungs. We can't do that

474
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,120
for a liver, right? If a patient tragically overdoses on Tylenol in an attempt to take their

475
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:38,080
life and they reach a point of irreversibly damaging the liver, you can't put them on liver

476
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,120
support until they get a transplant. That patient will be dead in about two days if they don't get

477
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,400
a transplant. And I think it comes down to a lot of the stuff you already talked about. I mean,

478
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,120
glucose homeostasis, one of the most important bits of homeostasis in the body, is controlled

479
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,880
with a level of precision. I can't fathom. I can sit and talk about the liver with the same

480
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,320
level of excitement that you talk about the muscles. And yet here's what's interesting.

481
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:13,200
The liver is not a metabolically greedy organ. It really doesn't on its own consume much energy.

482
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,440
The brain, by contrast, a very complex organ, an incredibly metabolically greedy organ,

483
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,320
which is probably why we need the liver to support the brain without the liver being so

484
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,480
good at maintaining glucose homeostasis. Our brain would have either needed an adaptation

485
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,880
strategy away from glucose, or we wouldn't have brains as large as we do. Where does the muscle

486
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,560
fit into this hierarchy? Where is the muscle a high maintenance organ? Yeah. So, you know,

487
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,280
what's cool about the liver is it's kind of like a professional fighter where like you can beat it

488
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,720
up a lot. That's right. You can't do much to the kidneys. That's right. They just don't have

489
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,600
sustainability. Right. So I have like a secondary level of liver because it's the closest thing in

490
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:08,560
the body to skeletal muscle in terms of like fact that it is listening and it will respond and it

491
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,640
can change. And as you said, very adaptive, right? I mean, you'll appreciate this if you didn't already

492
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:23,440
know it. When I was in my residency, we would do quite a number of live donor liver transplants.

493
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,600
So this would be an operation where an individual would donate a third to a half of their liver

494
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:36,240
to another individual where there was a really good HLA match. Well, here's what was really

495
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,280
interesting. The speed with which that portion of their liver would regenerate was so staggering

496
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:52,560
that if you didn't anticipate it with inhumane doses of intravenous phosphorus, they would

497
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,320
have an enormous metabolic crisis. Oh yeah, totally. That makes sense. Yeah. So basically,

498
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,960
there was no amount of food you could give this person to allow them to have enough

499
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,440
phosphate backbone to go and make, you know, for the DNA and RNA and protein synthesis that was

500
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,960
going to be necessary to reproduce their liver. So yeah, you just had to basically be giving them IV

501
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,280
FOS nonstop because they could say, it's like what we have to do to fibers when we're doing our

502
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,040
single fiber experiments, like you have to bathe them. You just have to have a permanent path of

503
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:34,400
phosphorus. That's right. And they could regenerate a third of their liver in two weeks. Yeah. It's

504
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,680
simply staggering. And now, of course, the caveat for the person listening is this only works when

505
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:46,640
the architecture of the liver is preserved. So once you cross into the path of cirrhosis and

506
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,720
inflammation, it's over. So unfortunately, that person whose liver has been so beat up, for

507
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,680
example, status post-naphal D, NASH or alcoholic liver disease, you get to a point where it no

508
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,640
longer has that capacity to regenerate. Yeah. You know, the kind of the nice part about the story is

509
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,560
if you fix it before that, you have a good chance. Absolutely. Like so you can mess up for a long

510
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,080
time. But if you do take that action before you hit that level, you can get, I shouldn't even say

511
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,720
this way, but like you can almost get back to scratch. Like you can get a lot of regeneration.

512
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,360
Yeah, you're right. And the kidneys, you know, being so sensitive to blood pressure,

513
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:33,040
so sensitive to the damage of high glucose, the lungs being so sensitive to smoking and things

514
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,120
like that. Yeah. I don't know. For me, I just think the liver is an unsung hero of the body.

515
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,160
Well, it's the thing that keeps you like, it's the bonk, right? Like you know,

516
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,000
there's some endurance towards like when the liver is finished, it doesn't matter how much

517
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
mental strength you have. Like it's a wrap. You are going down. If you get hit in the liver,

518
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,000
if you watch any sports, you get hit in the liver, instantaneously, you're crippled.

519
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,520
Doesn't matter. You could be like mentally, you're there, but your body will seize and shut you down.

520
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,280
So it's a very same thing doesn't happen. Yeah. I feel like that. Isn't that what happened to

521
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,560
Oscar de la Hoya against Bernard Hopkins? Do you remember that fight? I don't remember that fight,

522
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,960
but I've seen it 50 times. I've seen it 500 times. I work a lot with UFC fighters and a number of,

523
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,680
I have actually a headline fight this weekend for one of my guys. So yeah, I've seen it in those

524
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:34,400
sports a ton. I've seen a little toe, just the tip of a toe click the liver and world champions

525
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,240
just get locked up and fall to the crown. So it does not like being aggregated like that,

526
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,800
but it will handle a beating. You know, for the most part you can, you can beat it up pretty good.

527
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,480
And if you see like any blood chemistry stuff and you're looking at ALT, AST stuff and you're like,

528
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,200
ah, you're free. It'll come back to you. Like if you take the right steps, the kidney is the one

529
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,280
you see when you're like, Oh, like we're not coming back from this one. So anyhow. All right.

530
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,760
So going back to muscle. Yeah, it is. It's a tremendously

531
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,480
responsive to everything you're doing and it's listening. So your question of how energetically

532
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,960
demanding it is. Well, there's a couple of things to say about this. People will talk a lot about,

533
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,800
Hey, if you add more muscle mass, then that's going to base, that's going to elevate your

534
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:27,120
basal metabolic rate. So you'll burn more calories just sitting up. That is true, but it's not to a

535
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,720
level that you actually think it's probably like you're, I think the numbers are something like 30

536
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:39,920
calories. With how much increase in muscle mass? Like per pound. Per pound. Okay. If you think

537
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,040
it's like something like that, it's like, it's not actually level and you can make the argument

538
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:51,840
hold after three or four years. That is that extra five or 10 pounds. Okay. Like sure. But it's not

539
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,120
like, I feel like some people think it's going to go from their basal metabolic rates going to go

540
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,520
from 1500 calories a day to 2,500 because they put on five pounds of milk. So like that, that's

541
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,720
way outside the realm of what's going to happen. There are many reasons you probably want to put

542
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,040
some muscle on, but like adding the metabolic boost. And that's because the question is how

543
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,240
energetically demanding are they actually think about it the opposite. Like scallop muscle is

544
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,560
pretty lazy. It wants to be as efficient as possible because if you think about functionality

545
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,480
of physiology, you want your brain running full course as often as you possibly can, right? You

546
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,960
want continual interception of what's happening in your outside world, as well as introspection

547
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,240
going on. It's also making decisions, et cetera. Skeletal muscle is simply like a backup system.

548
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,840
It's think of more about it was like, what do you need done boss? You need something done to elevate

549
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,160
your function or on it. If not, we're going to sit down and shut up and wait to be sort of

550
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:54,160
pulled a little bit. And so what that means is if you need energy now, muscle will jump to action.

551
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,080
It'll get you going. We see this from everything from meat, right? It's like if you have this

552
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,760
energetic need to burn 200 calories, your photos start tapping, you'll start doing sort of

553
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,840
amazing. That's skeletal muscle going to tell folks what need is. This is non-exercise energy.

554
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:18,640
So it's energy you're burning that's not physical activity or exercise or the energy needed to

555
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:25,440
survive, to breathe, to digest, to go through basic stuff. So it is that other 10 or so percent of

556
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,440
energy throughout the day that accounts for people losing weight or not losing weight or gaining weight

557
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,840
that fluxes pretty well, depending on your metabolic health, depending on your total size,

558
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,480
depending on your other stuff. So if you ever see those people who are like, man, they just can't sit

559
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,960
still. Those are like colloquially the people that probably have a pretty high need. So they're just

560
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,360
burning energy kind of sitting here. Other people are more stoic physically are going to have sort

561
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:59,040
of a lower thing. This is also one of the things that explains how people can maintain the same

562
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,320
amount of physical training, like exercise performance, as well as health at tremendously

563
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,000
different levels of calorie intakes. Because we can adjust neat very quickly and your body is,

564
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,960
it's kind of like a, it's the last bit of polish, last bit of paint. So it's a huge, huge buffer in

565
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,120
there where you can increase mass. Yeah. Yeah. And depending on what you need to do, right. And

566
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,400
so we can kind of change our metabolic set point, if you will, to keep you at the same body size,

567
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,080
irrelevant of going up and down in calories. And I'm sure you guys cover that a thousand times with

568
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,760
land. So that's generally where we're at. So let's talk about contraction. How does a contraction

569
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,120
actually work and why does a contraction require ATP? What part of the contraction needs it?

570
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:50,080
Yeah. So if we go back, nerve is coming into skeletal muscle, right? And it would,

571
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,280
in some instances like the eye actually, we have what's called a motor unit. So we have a motor

572
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,760
unit across all these things. So motor unit is the nerve that's coming in, as well as all of these

573
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,520
single fibers that that nerve is innervating. So what that means is in the eye, for example,

574
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,040
you have motor units as small as almost one to one, which means there's a single motor unit coming in

575
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,080
and activating a single muscle fiber. That gives you extraordinary control of dexterity, right? And

576
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:22,400
so you have a lot of nerves coming in to control a very small number of fibers that makes you have

577
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,280
real high precision with exactly where you're controlling. You contrast that to muscles like

578
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,640
the glutes. You need a lot of strength, force production of the glutes, but very low fidelity.

579
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,840
You don't need accuracy of hip extension. There's basically just one thing. It's contract,

580
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:43,360
not contract. I mean, do it with as much force as possible, but... Or not. Yeah.

581
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,800
That's basically the only dimension you have to regulate is what is the force and speed of

582
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,040
contraction? Whereas with the eye, which is a great example, I'm glad you made that contrast.

583
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,440
Our eyes have insane fidelity too. And of course you have multiple interocular muscles. So it's,

584
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,120
you know, you have all of these muscles above, below on the side of the eyes and the amount of tuning

585
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,360
that has to happen to allow humans to be able to do what we do so well, which is very subtly pick

586
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,400
things up with our eyes. Yeah. If you contrast that to like your fingers, which we need to have,

587
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,960
it's the second highest level of fidelity we have to have. The eyes are still in order of magnitude.

588
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,640
Higher in terms of fidelity and accuracy. It's not even close. Like I need to be very precise

589
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,400
with my fingertips, but my eyes are on a whole new level of precision of where we have to be.

590
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,520
So if there's one to one or one to two in the eyes, it could be thousands per motor unit

591
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:50,320
in the glutes on off, on 50%, 20%. So you can stand erect while having some sort of like 20%

592
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:56,400
level of glute contraction to full hip extension, vertical jump explosion, squat, deadlift.

593
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,080
God, that's so, that's so fantastic. Okay. Continue. So nerve comes in.

594
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,160
So nerve comes in and does that. Now here's a couple of other layers. Without going too far

595
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,280
into nerve, you're familiar, I'm sure, with said principle. So you have specific adaptation for

596
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,280
close demand. There's another principle in here called Henneman size principle. So Elbwood Henneman

597
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,760
is one of my favorite scientists. And his principle basically says there's low threshold and high

598
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,720
threshold motor units. And what that means is there are some motor units that are very easy to

599
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,080
get turned on and some that you have to just aggravate the shit out of them to get them to turn on.

600
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,320
Let's make sure people understand what that means in terms of what's an action potential. How does

601
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:42,960
a nerve actually deliver its signal? Yeah. So it's, we have this fun interplay between chemistry,

602
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,680
electricity and chemistry. That's exactly how contraction works, right? So you have to go from

603
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,000
a life, electrical signal to chemical signal back to electrical signal. So what happens is you've got

604
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,480
sodium and potassium and chloride are your main players, right? And chloride is a negative charge.

605
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,880
Potassium, of course, is positive and sodium is positive. The fun way to look up this and pay

606
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,800
attention to this, if you ever forget here is, Peter, you're probably more familiar with this

607
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,600
than I am, but look at patient assisted suicide with Dr. Morrachian, right? You give a giant

608
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,920
bolus of potassium to somebody and they're just going to slowly stop. Their heart's going to

609
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,480
slowly stop protracting. Why? Because the amount of potassium intracellular is going to become

610
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,160
fairly equivalent to the amount of extracellular potassium. And so the change in gradient

611
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,880
electrically between the outside of the cell and inside of the cell becomes neutral. And so no

612
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,920
action potential is what this thing is called. No, no exponential curves. And so what you need to

613
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,960
have happen is a change in electrical volt from outside the cell to inside the cell. And typically

614
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,440
we're talking like negative 30 millivolts intracellular is kind of a number. And once enough of

615
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,480
the sodium potassium start moving in the correct directions, then the electricity changes because

616
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:01,280
our positives moved more negatives and you get the idea. And boom, we hit this split of this switch

617
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,800
and this is what we call all or none. And so skeletal muscle fibers can't contract at different

618
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,360
levels of force. What I mean is once you flick them on, they go on fully and that's the only way

619
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:19,440
they can contract. And so the analogy we use here in our undergraduate classes is the light switch.

620
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,400
So once you hit that certain threshold of millivolt, the muscle fiber contracts as hard

621
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,080
as it possibly can. There is no weight. There's no dimmer switch here. You can't go 80%, 85, 50.

622
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,080
It's a hundred percent once you get to that action potential, right? You actually see

623
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:41,440
the millivolts just rocket back up and there's this whole cascade of recovery. This is what your

624
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,920
sodium potassium pumps are doing to try to reset that gradient, put them back in the right direction

625
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,960
so you can have another contraction. Again, this is actually what explains tetany. So if you contract

626
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,200
that fiber multiple times in a row before it gets back to reset and it just feels like it's in an

627
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,200
isometric contraction or it's not actually how it works, but it's going to feel like that.

628
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,680
What actually totally off the top of it, but what actually happens is you have so many muscle fibers

629
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,160
and they're contracting and relaxing at such a fast rate to your muscle, it feels like the whole

630
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,560
thing is just locked up, but they're actually flicking on, flicking off just at a really high

631
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:18,640
rate of turnover. But anyways, so that's in general how you're getting a muscle.

632
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:26,000
By the way, just so folks understand, explain to folks how despite an all or none action potential

633
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:33,520
and an all or none contraction of a single fiber, you can still get variable degrees of strength.

634
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,600
Again, whether you're talking about at the level of the muscle.

635
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,080
Yeah. So this is the next part. This is why we had to bring up Henneman's size principle.

636
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:50,880
So within these motor units, you have sizes. Now what's interesting is most of the time in

637
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,840
normal situations, all the muscle fibers in that motor unit are of the same fiber type.

638
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,160
So all your, if you had, let's just say we had two motor units, one of those motor units is slow

639
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,000
twitch and one of those motor units is going to be fast, rich fibers at interface. So if we had five

640
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,520
fibers in that motor unit or 500, it doesn't really sort of matter right now. We have a couple of

641
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:21,040
factors actually coming on, but they're going to be of all like type generally within that same

642
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:27,360
motor unit. So the only way that we relegate force production is this. We have to know that all five

643
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,120
of those muscle fibers, once they get turned on, are going to contract at full speed. So the only

644
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,920
way we actually change how much force we're creating a whole muscle is by altering how many

645
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:42,160
of these motor units get turned on. So the size principle tells us we're going to turn on the low

646
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:48,400
threshold units first. And so if you go to do what you just did, so you reached over and

647
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:54,080
grabbed a glass of water, it's probably best we don't turn on our high threshold, high force

648
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,280
production, generally larger, not always, but generally larger motor units that have generally

649
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,920
fast rich fibers that are generally bigger. Number one or two reasons why you don't want to do that.

650
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,600
Number one is we produce unnecessary force. So instead of slowly touching that glass of your lips,

651
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,680
you'd smash them off your face because there's no way to, you can't go down. So if that motor

652
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,920
unit can produce five pounds of force and you need two pounds of force, there is no way to go

653
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,360
backwards. So you always start at the smallest unit possible and turn on more motor units,

654
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:30,640
give more force production required. Secondarily, it just burns energy. So fast rich muscle fibers

655
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,880
are more metabolically demanding than slow rich muscle fibers. And so you're going to waste gas

656
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,160
doing that. And this is exactly why your car starts off in first gear, second,

657
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:46,480
et cetera, et cetera. We lose efficiency as we go up, but we gain performance. Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,400
So, so cars actually, so let's let's get, yeah, yeah. So let's use that example when you're

659
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:57,200
talking, just going back really quickly to the athlete. So, um, how quickly is that response

660
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:06,640
modulated when I want to deadlift something. Yeah. So you can, you can see this in real life.

661
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,080
You can actually see this. I have a video of a deadlift actually from a friend of mine

662
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,680
doing this where, um, so the initial stuff that's going to happen here, are you going to activate

663
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,400
slow, sorry, lower threshold motor units, which are going to be almost exposed to the slow rich

664
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,760
fibers. The only way that we really know to increase that is through force production demands.

665
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,440
And this is going to, like, we're going to come back to this when we get to fiber type stuff

666
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,160
eventually for aging. Uh, and some of the stuff that came out even this week that you may have

667
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:41,440
not seen yet, but, um, the challenge with fast rich muscle fibers is they are only then based

668
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,840
on this logic activated under high threshold demands, which are high force demands. You can

669
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:54,080
do anything to activate and then the data will show this on aging. You see virtually no reduction

670
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:59,200
and slow to its fibers with aging. You see no reduction in size. In fact, there is some,

671
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,680
more than a few papers showing a hypertrophic effect of slow, slow to the fibers of age.

672
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,200
There is no loss in VLO. There's no loss in specific tension, which is like force per unit

673
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:16,720
of size. There's no loss of power. So it just appears to be very easy with any level of activity

674
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,920
to maintain and preserve health of sulfate fibers. But because fast rich fibers require

675
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,840
force production and you generally don't get high force production and activities to daily living,

676
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:35,200
then those fibers go unutilized for long stretches of time. Eventually they go away. And so what we

677
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,960
see happen is this really interesting thing called fiber type grouping, where the nerve will basically

678
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:48,000
say, okay, that fiber is being like not used. And so that, that whole motor unit will decay and the

679
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:55,200
fibers will be preserved. The other neighboring motor units will actually grow new extensions,

680
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:03,120
activate some of the previously gone motor units, and then convert those fibers into whatever fiber

681
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,840
type happens in that previous motor unit. So in general, what we see happening here is slow

682
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:13,760
to fibers start absorbing or slow to motor units start absorbing fast, which fibers and bringing

683
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,680
them to their own motor unit. And so we see these large patches of single fiber types throughout

684
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:26,640
the muscle. And so the last part of that puzzle is in a motor unit, those fibers are connected by the

685
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,320
same neuron and they're the same fiber type, but they're not laying next to each other. You don't

686
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:37,200
want them in the same spot. They're sort of dispersed throughout the muscle. And so that gives you

687
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,320
smoothness of contraction. And so one of the things that happens is if you start punching like

688
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:47,520
the entire right side of your bicep is one motor unit, the entire left side is when you contract

689
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:53,760
that motor unit alone, you get super spastic out of control and you get twitchy and unregulated

690
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:00,400
movements. And so when we see this fiber type grouping occur with aging, it's almost exclusively

691
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:05,920
a problem of fast-traged fibers and not loss of slow-traged fibers. And so that also explains lack

692
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:14,400
of fidelity as well as potentially some problems with fine unit movements. And what is the

693
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:21,520
heterogeneity of fast and slow twitch mixtures within different areas? So presumably the eye is

694
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:29,120
all slow twitch. It doesn't particularly require much force and it- It doesn't require much force,

695
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,480
but it does require a lot of speed. Yeah. Interesting. So you need to be able to dart back

696
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,840
and forth quickly. So I actually don't know the- Okay. Well, let's look at a big skeletal muscle,

697
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:43,280
like the lats or the glutes. Is there- So we have two things you have to pay attention to here is

698
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:50,400
we have a huge amount of person-to-person variation. So you and I- Within what bracket though? Give me

699
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,920
a sense of like presumably everybody has at least 20% of each. I'm making that up, but is there-

700
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,920
Yeah. So let me do the second part and we'll come back to that first part. So there's actually,

701
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,840
as you're alluding to a second ago, there's also tremendous difference between muscle to muscle.

702
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,480
And so some muscles, if we look at it, like if we compare my soleus, your soleus,

703
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,440
you might be 90% slow twitch in your soleus. I might be 70. And that would be a large variation

704
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,120
in that muscle. If you look at animal models, cell culture, any murine, like you're going to

705
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:29,280
see a hundred percent slow twitch in a soleus. And the reason is because we walk, the soleus has

706
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,600
got to be a majority slow twitch muscle fiber. We just spend too much time ambulatory to risk

707
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:41,920
any inefficiency in that system. A hundred percent. If you look at the shank in general,

708
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,080
you've got two primary muscles of movement there. The soleus being the smaller one,

709
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,160
they both attach at the bottom of your foot. That's your-

710
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,040
The two of these.

711
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:54,400
The one that goes through there. If you were to take your foot and your toe and like point it

712
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,920
towards your face and you reflect your calf, that one that pops up, that has that kind of U shape,

713
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,320
if you have a nice calf anyways, that big one that pops up to the middle, that's your gastroc,

714
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,960
the one that kind of sits behind, it's underneath the very bottom where your calf stuff kind of

715
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,320
ends and it goes in that long piece. That's the soleus. And the gastroc is almost the opposite.

716
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:20,160
It is almost exclusively fast twitch, but not nearly as exclusive as your soleus is. So the

717
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,000
soleus is what we call postural or anti-gravity for the exact stuff you mentioned. It needs to stay

718
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,880
up and it needs to be on. And in fact, you can actually have a soleus contracted for hours

719
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,680
and be totally, totally fine. And you won't even realize it for the most part. It's actually good

720
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,160
metabolically, but you would not realize it. If you contracted your gastroc for more than a few

721
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:46,640
seconds, we're probably going to feel the burn pretty quickly. So the variation in something

722
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:52,160
like a soleus could be that. I think probably if you saw somebody who's 30% fast twitch and a

723
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:58,240
soleus, that's a very, very high number. I wouldn't be surprised if I saw somebody 95 though.

724
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,600
If you contrast that to a muscle like the VL, so the vastus lateralis, the outside quad muscle,

725
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:12,640
as you know, but throughout the audience, now the variation gets extraordinarily large. So in

726
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:20,800
general, the VL is like what we typically say is 50-50 fast-twitch flow twitch. And to the record,

727
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,800
it gets far more complicated than fast-twitch flow twitch, but we're just kind of keeping it at that

728
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:30,880
level for now. We have shown actually in our lab a couple of things. So one, we biopsied a whole

729
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,440
bunch of people who are Olympians and world caliber, national caliber in our lab, men and women.

730
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:45,360
And some of those individuals are 80 plus percent, 85% fast-twitch. And by the way,

731
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:50,560
just did you also do VM and why is there a difference between VL, VM and intermedius?

732
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:58,000
Yeah, just due to access. Generally access and safety. A lot more potential things to hit

733
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:05,280
in the medial. Nothing out the outside. By nick, anything, we have problems.

734
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:14,880
So you could be up to 80% fast-twitch on your VL if you're... And by the way, is that true

735
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,080
across all sports? Like if you had the Tour de France champion, would you expect him to,

736
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:29,120
even though he's the best of the best and his VL is a monstrosity, would you expect him to have

737
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:35,360
that high a fast-twitch? So in some of the folks we biopsied in the modern space,

738
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,480
they are as high as 90% slow-twitch in the VL. Okay. So that's, yeah. So that's...

739
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,440
That's what I was like, it's basically zero to zero. You can run the whole gamut of composition

740
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,200
in the VL. And we're back to the same question, which is, if you had a time machine and you

741
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,040
could go back and biopsy them as five-year-olds, we really don't know what they looked like then.

742
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:01,840
Well, this is what our twin study did. Rather than biopsy them, five-years-old,

743
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,040
we got monozygous twins. Who presumably had enough differences in what they were doing that

744
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:14,240
you could see a signal if there was... About 35 years difference of training. And what did you see?

745
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:21,040
So, and if we compare this now that I can go back until... Please, you've been in labs,

746
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,280
you'll appreciate this. One of our graduate students who'd been in our lab for probably

747
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:30,400
three or more years was sitting next to my colleague, Jimmy Bagley, and they're pulling

748
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,120
muscle fibers, right? And sort of like the things that come up when you're staring at a microscope,

749
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:40,480
pulling out individual muscle fibers with tweezers for hundreds of hours on time, like your brain

750
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:45,920
goes into weird spots. And so she was sort of just telling him, oh yeah, like my dad's a twin or

751
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,440
whatever. Oh cool, whatever. And he's like, oh yeah, like monozygous. Like yeah. So monozygous

752
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:57,040
means their DNA is exact. So not just brothers that got born at the same time. So you have genetic

753
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,240
replication. So we have that kind of relocked. And Jimmy was sort of like, oh cool. Did they exercise?

754
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,920
And she's like, oh yeah, well like, I think I can't remember which one. He's like, well, my dad

755
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:14,240
does an exercise, but my uncle has been competing in Iron Mans for 35 years. And Jamie was like, what?

756
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,320
It's a dream experiment.

757
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:22,960
Wait, wait. So let me get this straight. You have identical twin parents or father. One of them has

758
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,880
been 30 plus years of documented endurance exercise. The other, what's he do? She's like,

759
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,200
no, he's never exercised. And we're like, and you've been in my lab for three years.

760
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,200
And this is the first we're hearing about this.

761
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,520
This is the first we're hearing about this. Like you're, you're fired. You're not graduating.

762
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,720
So we were able to pull them in the lab and bring them in. And so he was one of these classic

763
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:49,040
endurance nerds. Every workout had been documented for 30 years. He's got 50 journals

764
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,240
written down. So we knew the caloric expenditure. We knew that miles. We just had everything.

765
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,320
And phenotypically, how different did they look?

766
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,280
Almost identical.

767
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,120
Even with all the training, they still looked, I mean, I'm saying not in the face, of course,

768
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,840
but just muscularly, how did they appear phenotypically?

769
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,400
No, I know you're saying they're almost identical. The only exception was

770
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:17,280
the, the non-exercising twin was a little bit less lean. I think he had,

771
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,880
I can't remember exactly, something like three or four more kilos of body fat.

772
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,360
I said, no, maybe that kind of amazing too. Just, it really speaks to the hereditary

773
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,200
nature. Well, yeah, yeah. So I want to come back to that because that's what's important.

774
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,080
But at the surface, think about that, right? You have these two guys that are genetically

775
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:46,000
identical, presumably both looked good, right? And one is, by all intents and purposes,

776
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,720
a fanatic around exercise. The other is a couch potato. But on the outside,

777
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:58,160
they look relatively equivalent. Tells you a couple of things. One, body habitus is remarkably

778
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:06,000
hereditary. I mean, it is, I believe, more hereditary than, it's certainly on par with

779
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
height and eye color in terms of how hereditary it is. The second is what you're about to tell us,

780
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,640
I suspect, which is that the outside is but a fraction of the story.

781
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,680
So here's what we did. I got super excited and I was basically like, I'm going to take every

782
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:32,240
measure possible. It's this DEXA scans, this is vertical jump, VO2 max, blood chemistry,

783
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,400
muscle biopsies. We did psychological evaluations, we did IQ tests, we just did

784
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:45,120
everything we could possibly do. By the way, you created just a random IRB to do this?

785
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:53,920
Oh, yeah. I mean, we did it. We took time to design the study, put an IRB through the whole

786
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,040
How long did it take just so people understand the pace at which science moves from the microscope

787
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:06,800
discussion until you've got these guys in your lab? Maybe eight months. Oh, wow. That's really

788
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:13,360
fast. You already had the funding, I assume. Yeah, I didn't care. I'm like, I'm paying for this.

789
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,520
You're paying yourself good. We're going to pay this out of my pocket. Yeah, like this is for sure.

790
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:23,200
100%. In fact, I literally did pay for their plane flights out of my pocket. I didn't want to deal

791
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:28,080
with the stuff. I was like, just book the flights right now. We got to schedule the work. Put it on

792
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:35,920
my credit card. I don't care. I'm not missing this chance. So what did you see? So the what's

793
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:43,440
interesting was that again, body composition wise, the untrained personess again, five, six pounds,

794
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:48,560
more fat masks, something like that, maybe three kilos was too high. I can't remember. So I'm like,

795
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,800
oh, that's interesting. What was the difference in on decks? So what was the difference in muscle mass?

796
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,760
Like a hundred grams.

797
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,920
You're at the detection limit of DEXA. So they're essentially way beyond. They were almost identical

798
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:12,800
and totally muscle mass. Right now, interesting. The endurance guy did not lift at all. No

799
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,240
strength training was strictly running cycling. So like a very classic. Can you imagine just the

800
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,600
the Gedanken experiment of triplets where you had a third guy here that only lifted weights

801
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,800
and you just imagine I can like this was like an hour of her thesis defense.

802
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,520
This was that question right there. Okay. All right.

803
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:42,000
We we actually did a another study in Stockholm, Sweden with lifelong skiers.

804
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,280
I don't get to do around here, but these are people who are world champions, the 1940s and

805
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,840
50s and cross country skiing, Olympic gold medalists and didn't stop competing. Now they're

806
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,480
in the age of 85 plus up to 92 years old and we're still competitive skiers and compare them to

807
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:04,000
age matched healthy folks over here in America. So I've spent a little bit of time in this like

808
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,240
aging athlete. Yeah. And I actually wrote a little bit about that, that cohort in my book.

809
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:15,200
The ski. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's insane. I could tell you a lot more behind the scenes on that.

810
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,360
I'd love to. Yeah. Let's come back to it. Walking into the hospital across the street and just like

811
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:26,480
jumping off the curb because there was ice and you're like, Oh, you're in 90. And you just

812
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,880
decided to jump that curb for fun. Like when no one was watching you, because we could like see

813
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,720
them from the window coming in. I'm just like, just so just like, uh, one guy finishing a video

814
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,800
to max sitting on the chair, taking like two breaths and goes, I didn't understand the test.

815
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,880
Let me try it again. I'm trying to get back on the bike. This is like 12 seconds after

816
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,640
you had to max and a whole bunch of other stuff like that was incredible.

817
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,360
Okay. So back to the twin study. So that was, that was identical. In general,

818
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,760
you could categorize some things. So I'll kind of make this a little bit shorter.

819
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,960
If you looked at muscle quality, so this is echo intensity and an ultrasound,

820
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:12,240
this is vertical jump. This is leg extension strength. It was either identical or it favored

821
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:20,080
the non-exercising twin, right? Everything else that you would classically associate as an

822
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:26,480
exercise adaptation favored the exerciser blood lipid panel, blood pressure, body composition.

823
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,520
Certainly VO two max was significantly higher resting heart rate. Like all the classic

824
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:39,920
textbook endurance exercise as a B and C it stacked up exactly as you'd think the neutral stuff,

825
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:47,840
total muscle mass. That was basically on point. And then blood glucose was favored for the

826
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:53,600
exerciser, like all that stuff you'd predict. But just to make sure I understand the non-exerciser

827
01:15:53,600 --> 01:16:03,360
was stronger, stronger, better jumper, higher quality muscle, more power. Again, go into,

828
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,920
go into the higher quality against make sure I understand that beyond the metric driven stuff.

829
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,200
Was that, is that, is that a subjective assessment of muscle quality?

830
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,720
No, no, no, no, no. So there's a, you can actually measure this via ultrasound.

831
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:20,240
Okay. And so this is like a measure of, it's called echo intensity. It's a measure of,

832
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:29,040
it's akin to measuring how much intramuscular fat is inside the actual tissue. That's what,

833
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,880
that's what echo intensity is kind of basically telling you. So you're saying the exercising guy

834
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:40,720
had more intramuscular lipid. Right now, but just to play devil's advocate, isn't that an adaptation

835
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:46,480
to his endurance training where he wants to have more intramuscular lipid because he wants to have

836
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,240
more logs near the fire. He's burning those logs. Totally. Yeah. And you wouldn't have to

837
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:57,680
dig hard to find support for that. And I think that's different from the intramuscular lipid

838
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:03,280
we see in the diabetic, for example, or in the insulin resistant. There's a level when you cross,

839
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,200
right? When there, when there's no exercise there, then there's a different reason that that happens.

840
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:12,000
Yeah. But in terms of functional output, but still what's interesting to me is that the

841
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:19,840
strength metrics also favored the non-exerciser. Yeah. It was all favored to neutral. Yeah. Like,

842
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,800
like either some of the metrics were similar or not statistically different, but like

843
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:31,760
they hedge towards a non-exerciser. So you could say at best they were neutral to favoring

844
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:37,120
the non-exerciser is I think the most fair way, but there was not a metric there that favored

845
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:42,640
the exercise on that side of the house. So what is your biopsy related? Yeah. Let's talk about

846
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:47,440
the biopsy. It gets very different. So I'll give you the quick version. There's a more interesting

847
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:54,080
version. The non-exerciser was almost identical to what you'd see in the literature and what we've

848
01:17:54,160 --> 01:18:00,640
done a ton of times where you have something like it, you're fairly mixed in terms of phenotype.

849
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,240
So you've got some percentage of fast, which some percentage of slow twitch, but in fact,

850
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:09,040
he had about, if I remember correctly, something like 20% of his fibers are in what we call this

851
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,520
hybrid format. And so I sort of loaded this earlier. There's fast rich fibers and slow

852
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,280
rich fibers, but the story goes much deeper. That's not really how the whole thing plays out.

853
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:24,000
So these hybrid fibers are a single individual cell. So one muscle fiber that co-expresses fast

854
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,720
and slow twitch. And in fact, it'll express that in different areas of the length of the fiber. So

855
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,280
it'll be exclusively fast, which in one portion, fast and slow in another portion and exclusively

856
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,320
slow twitch in another portion, et cetera. Let's make sure people understand what the

857
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:43,600
difference is between a fast and a slow twitch fiber. I want to come right back to where we are,

858
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,840
but I just want to make sure we haven't lost that thread. Yeah. In general, there's a lot of ways to

859
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:53,760
describe it, but the easiest way is to describe it by the name. So fast twitch means that the

860
01:18:53,840 --> 01:19:00,080
twitch or the speed of contraction is higher. And so those, these fibers can contract and

861
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:05,680
squeeze together through the mechanisms. We haven't got to yet. We'll get there. Myosinactin

862
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:12,000
at a much faster rate. Having said that the fast rich fibers tend to be larger, though not always,

863
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,080
and certainly not in endurance training individuals and definitely not with aging,

864
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,320
that they tend to be almost, they almost always are more glycolytically driven. And so they're

865
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:28,240
going to have more of the enzymes responsible for anaerobic glycolysis. They're going to have more

866
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:32,720
glucose in the cell. They're going to have less intramuscular triglycerides,

867
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:37,680
and they're going to be having, they generally have more phosphocreatine. Slow twitch fibers

868
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:43,120
are fatigue resistant, which means these are the ones that they can contract kind of all day long

869
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,840
because they don't use as much glucose. So they do use quite a bit still. They are much better at

870
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:55,520
using fat as a fuel. They tend to have more and larger mitochondria. And the downside is they

871
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:01,120
don't contract with as much velocity in general. So that's the functional, that's why we call them

872
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:10,000
twitch. And just to be clear, the force difference between them is, it doesn't matter. It's just

873
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:17,520
velocity or is there a force difference as well? So the, yeah, no, so a couple of things. In

874
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,320
large part, force production from muscle fibers is determined mostly by size cross-sectional area.

875
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,840
So getting the fiber bigger is the play to get it faster. Having said that, power is markedly

876
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,280
different. And so if you're talking about- Because power is based on velocity as well.

877
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,480
That's yeah. You times multiply the force by the velocity. So if you use this metric that we'll use

878
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,520
in single fiber experiments called specific tension, which is sort of like relative strength.

879
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:50,320
So you take the size portion out of the equation. What you're going to see is a true slow twitch.

880
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:57,040
So these are also called type one fibers. If you compare those to a type two A, so that's a fast

881
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:03,920
twitch muscle fiber, you're going to see something like five to six X power between these two. So it's

882
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:09,600
not- When you normalize for size. Yeah. And you normalize for cross-sectional. If you go to the

883
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:17,040
two X fibers, which is a special class of fast twitch fibers, now you're talking 20X, that power curve.

884
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:26,560
And that is mostly explained by more metabolic apparatus. What's enabling the speed? Why does

885
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:33,360
the two X fiber go faster? Yeah, it's all has to, in fact, the way that we differentiate muscle

886
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:39,120
fibers in a laboratory is we measure what's called the myosin heavy chain. And so to kind of actually

887
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:47,200
come back to micro anatomy here. So the way that muscle fibers work is this is all in a 3D sequence.

888
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,800
So you can imagine that cylinder. I'm going to explain it to you in 2D to see you understand,

889
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,840
but this is actually occurring in 3D. And so what happens is you've got two of these microfilms

890
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:01,840
called actin and myosin. Now, what happens is they're overlapped, so they're not touching each

891
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:08,240
other. And you've got myosin kind of laying in the middle and it's this big thick tube. And it's got

892
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:14,080
these heads that flick off the top of it. Right now, these heads reach up and they extend again

893
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:19,120
in 3D, but if just think about it 2D, they reach up and grab on what's called actin. All right. And

894
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,240
so the idea when you contract the muscle is the myosin will reach up and they're going to reach

895
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:28,480
out sort of outward. So if you're watching this video, you're seeing my hands kind of reach up

896
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,920
and away from my body, like I'm stretching my arms, like I'm doing a big T, if you will. And my hands

897
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:39,120
would then grab onto the actin. And then if I were to squeeze my hands and bring my hands closer to my

898
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,480
face, that's the myosin is actually then pulling the actin closer together. So what actually happens

899
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,640
in real life is those start stacking on top of each other. And that's why when you squeeze your

900
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:53,920
bicep, it actually glows larger vertically because those muscle fibers are stacking on top of each

901
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:01,040
other and that's actually elevating the size. And so what determines force production versus velocity

902
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,120
is what we call cross bridges. So the amount of time that these myosin heads grab onto actin,

903
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:12,080
that little place of connection is called a cross bridge. The more of those cross bridges you have,

904
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:18,080
the more effectively you can pull the actin closer to each other. The more effectively you do that,

905
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:23,760
the faster the contraction, the more forceful the contraction is going to be. So primary thing

906
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:31,600
explaining force production is the amount of cross bridges. So the thicker your myosin, the

907
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:36,560
more likely you are to grab actin, the faster, the stronger the hold, if you will. So the better

908
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,480
connection your hand has to that thing it's grabbing onto rather than you can imagine like a

909
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,720
couple of fingertips on it and trying to pull something closer to you versus having your whole

910
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,200
hand wrapped around it, a strap on it, chalk on it. And like you're going to be able to rip that thing

911
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:57,520
down quickly. Now there are six actin that surround in a circle each myosin in human

912
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,640
skeleton muscles. So again, a picture of that 3D structure. So you can imagine if I'm standing up

913
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:07,600
in a room and I'm myosin and six people are forming a circle around me, like they're going to

914
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,080
jump me or celebrate me or whatever, that's what it looks like. And my arms can sort of reach out

915
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,640
and no matter where my arms are, there's going to be somebody that I can grab. And you only have two

916
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:23,120
arms still in this. You only have two myosin filaments. You have a time. Okay. Okay. So you

917
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,320
have one myosin. I'm sorry. You only have two heads or how many heads do you have?

918
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:35,040
The jilly. Okay. So you have billions of heads to grab onto six potential targets. So you're always

919
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:40,160
going to grab a target. You're going to grab one, right? Now you can't increase the amount of those

920
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:45,840
actin that are around you, but we do see that in other animals. So this is one of the reasons

921
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,200
that explains why like fruit flies, spiders and things like that can contract with so much more

922
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:57,680
force relative to humans is they might have eight or 10 or 12 or 20 myosin or actin per myosin.

923
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:02,320
And ants, which we always think of as like further size being insanely strong. Totally. They'll do

924
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:08,960
that. So, so evolution's tool to make things stronger is give more actin because you already

925
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,040
have an infinite number of myosin heads. The more things I can give you to grab onto the stronger

926
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:18,000
you are, the stronger you're going to be. Yeah. You realize there's somebody out there using

927
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,160
CRISPR right now trying to figure out how to double the number of these things in humans, right?

928
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:32,880
So I'm not going to say this officially. All I'm going to say is, well, officially the world knows

929
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:38,400
about the bare muscle studies that we've worked on. So there have been bare tissue come through

930
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:44,320
and under my microscope, put it that way. Bare tissue is actually quite unique. So they actually

931
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,960
have a, so humans have that 2A and they have that 2X. Which is formerly 2B, right?

932
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:59,280
Incorrectly identified as 2B. That's correct. Most other animals do actually have in fact 2B

933
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:06,320
and the 2B is even faster than the 2X and bears have a lot of them. So this is one of the other

934
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:12,240
reasons why not only do you have that, they simply have a fiber type that is much faster

935
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,960
than any of the fastest ones we have. Cheetahs and other cats like that have like 20 to 60%

936
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:26,880
of these 2B fibers. It's extraordinarily high amounts. And in those, do they have more actin

937
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:34,480
targets? I think actually, I think cats are pretty close to six to one, but we could fact check that

938
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:40,400
one. But I'm pretty sure that part of it's fairly, it tends to be fairly similar, similar kind of

939
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,600
mammals. It's when you get to the insects and things like that, I think when that number jumps off.

940
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:49,840
But my comparative physiology is not the sharpest. So don't trust me there. So

941
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:57,440
that's a great description of the micro anatomy. And I want to remember. Let me finish the speed

942
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:06,720
thing. So what determines the speed? So on those little myosin, there were kind of connects to the

943
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:11,840
actin, it's called the myosin head. Okay. Now, part of that is a bunch of stuff that you guys

944
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,680
don't need to know about. But a part of that is called the heavy chain. So there's a light chain

945
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:23,840
portion and a heavy chain. All right. Now, on the tip there, the way that we get a muscle to contract

946
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:30,640
is ATP. So what happens is the myosin are kind of loosely connected to the actin at all times,

947
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:34,800
but in order for it to grab and pull, you need a strong connection. And for that connection to

948
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,720
happen, and for that to be able to pull it together, it requires energy. So pardon the somewhat crude

949
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:48,320
analogy, but the way that it kind of works is if you imagine cocking a pistol. So in order to

950
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:55,600
actually cock the pistol versus fire the trigger, the squeezing the trigger actually produces, it

951
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,880
takes a lot less energy than cocking it back. If you've ever cocked a thing like it, actually,

952
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,840
you have to pull pretty hard. So the energy that we need actually for muscle contraction is not the

953
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:10,080
pulling together. That's actually almost passive. It is the cocking back part that takes energy,

954
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,880
right? And so that energy comes from ATP. So on the little tip of that myosin head is an enzyme

955
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,640
called ATPase. As you know, you hear ACE, you think kinase, like you think like something enzyme

956
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:26,640
that's going to work. That's the molecule that hydrolyzes ATP. That splits ATP rather, right? So

957
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,040
to make that simple. So what you have to do is actually invest in ATP.

958
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,560
That gives you energy, use that energy to cock that myosin back into place. And now it's kind

959
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:41,600
of sitting there, but it can't bind strongly until calcium comes into the picture and gets released

960
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,680
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. That has to come to the equation. It has to cause this

961
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:50,320
conformational change and act in and move these T tubules or that comes from T tubules and you have

962
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:55,360
some other things around. Once those things get moved around by the calcium and the myosin is

963
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,280
like, oh, boom, it connects to something. And then it just almost subconsciously snaps as hard as it

964
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,800
possibly can. And that's why you can't regulate force production is like, it's just going to catch

965
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,920
and snap, catch and snap. In order for that to go back, you actually have to invest more ATP.

966
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,760
This is also a side note, what explains ritamortis. So this happens, it gets contracted,

967
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,640
you don't have the energy to then pull it back in. So then you stay in this locked

968
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:23,120
sort of skeletal muscle contraction position. So now the speed at which you can do that,

969
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:30,560
that ATPase thing, that's what determines single muscle fiber contractile speed.

970
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,080
That's also that myosin heavy chain is what we measure in the lab. And that's how we determine

971
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,280
fast switch versus slow switch. So if you were to use a technique we use called gel electrophoresis,

972
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:47,200
basically you put a gel between two pieces of glass and you just pour gel in there and it gets

973
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:52,160
like solidified, just like hair gel, like a little bit thicker. And then you put each individual

974
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:58,400
muscle fiber in its own vertical lane. And then you put a little bit of positive charge on the top

975
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,400
end, a little bit of negative charge in the bottom end or inverse doesn't matter. And then you

976
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,560
actually put a little bit of chemical bath around muscle fiber that has a charge. You turn the

977
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:12,160
electricity on, positive goes to negative, et cetera. And so those fibers run down vertically

978
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:18,720
through the gel. We hit stop at a certain time point and the smaller ones have gone further

979
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:24,400
because smaller molecular will go through the gel faster. And so we stop, basically we put it,

980
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:29,760
we develop it like you would develop a picture, like old school photography stuff, literally the

981
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:36,320
same silver nitrate, et cetera, that you use. And we can see the ones that have gone further down

982
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,480
are slow to it's the ones that once say up higher are fast switch. And of course we use molecular

983
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:45,600
weight markers to confirm all that, but that's effectively what we're looking at. So what that

984
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:53,200
means is the myosin heavy chain molecular weight determines fiber type and that regulates its twitch

985
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:58,800
ability. The more, all of those and the faster those heavy chains work, the faster ATPase can

986
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,160
operate, the faster the whole thing can contract, the faster the muscle fiber contracts. And there

987
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:09,680
you go. And that's why muscle fiber type is not predicated on signs. It is specific to either

988
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:16,080
metabolic abilities in the old days, or now more specifically twitch velocity. So I guess all of

989
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:21,600
this now brings us back to a better position in, in, in which we can understand the biopsy studies

990
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:28,640
in these identical twins. So if you, if you look at the fiber profile of the untrained twin, it lines

991
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:33,760
up very close to what you'd seen a textbook, right? So it was around 50% slow twitch and about 30% of

992
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:41,440
these fast twitch 2A form, but then about 20 or so percent is hybrid 2A or 2X. 2A. So here's one of

993
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:47,760
the things that's interesting. When you get into the 2X conversation, there are clearly humans have

994
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:54,480
the ability to express 2X. It's just extraordinarily rare. And so what tends to happen is this.

995
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:59,840
If you find somebody that has what we call pure 2X fibers, so these are single fibers that are

996
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:06,320
expressing only 2X, a couple of things have happened. They've, number one, they've probably

997
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:12,240
had that muscle fiber de-innervated for decades. That's really the only time we see it. In fact,

998
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:17,200
if you look at spinal cord injury folks who, you know, had a denervated thing for decades,

999
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:23,920
they're as high as 50 or 60% of their total fiber type being 2X. And so this seems to be the

1000
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:30,080
default strategy of if you don't activate or utilize a muscle, it eventually is going to fall

1001
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:40,320
to 2X. Why? We have absolutely no idea. I could guess. We don't seem to know. We see it sometimes

1002
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,280
in older folks. And again, 2X, sorry, 2X is the hybrid, single fiber hybrid.

1003
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:54,320
2X is a pure fiber type. It is the ultra fast. Oh, okay. Okay. It is the one. So any hybrid is

1004
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:01,440
going to be called something like there is a one 2A hybrid. There's a 2A 2X hybrid, and there's

1005
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:09,920
even a triple hybrid, one 2A 2X. It has all three fiber types in the same cell. Those are, those are

1006
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:19,120
fairly uncommon. A one 2A hybrid and a 2A 2X hybrid are very, very common. A pure 2X by itself,

1007
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:26,480
though, is extraordinarily rare. In fact, we've done hundreds of thousands of individual fibers

1008
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:35,440
in my lab and have probably seen in total 20 or 30. Pure 2X fibers, you're talking generally

1009
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:42,320
something like 0.1% of fibers, something like that are pure 2X. Now, if you dive in the

1010
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:47,680
literature here, you're going to get confused very quickly because a lot of people don't use

1011
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:52,400
detailed enough laboratory methodologies to differentiate these. And so they're going to

1012
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,720
see, oh, there's all kinds of 2X fibers. They're really not. They're very clearly 2A 2X fibers.

1013
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,320
They just didn't run high fidelity enough to actually differentiate between hybrids. And so

1014
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,320
you'll pick up 2A 2X fibers as having some portion of 2X. And so it's a difference between,

1015
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:14,320
does that fiber contain 2X versus is that a purely 2X fiber, which is sort of a semantic

1016
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:21,280
difference. But in all world, it's a big deal. If you find somebody with a high percentage of 2X fibers,

1017
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:30,080
something odd is going on. The only exception here is there's no data really on truly fast

1018
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:34,800
people. We have a lot on powerful people. We have a lot on kayakers and bodybuilders and

1019
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,560
weightlifters. But as we discussed at the beginning, that's actually not true.

1020
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,160
Meaning we don't have data on sprinters?

1021
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:41,840
No.

1022
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,160
Why?

1023
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:54,400
Great question. It's hard to get these folks in the lab, I guess. People haven't been interested in

1024
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:59,520
it. It's not a thing. We just don't have them. The only thing we have is there was a case study.

1025
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:05,280
There's a case study done on a guy who I think he still owns a world record.

1026
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:12,240
It's not hard to figure out his name, though. I can't technically say it. 110 meter hurdles,

1027
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:16,560
I think, and 60 meter hurdles at the time had a world record of both, I think. Still has one of

1028
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:22,800
them. He's the only one I know. And I actually, I was a graduate student at the time, so I didn't

1029
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,440
run the study, but I certainly had my hands on fibers plenty of times. And he had something like

1030
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:37,120
24 percent pure 2x fibers. I'd like to see that replicated.

1031
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:45,440
So the untrained guy was 50 percent slow, 30 percent 2A, 20 percent hybrid AX.

1032
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,760
2A2X.

1033
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,880
2A2X, yep. And then what was the trained cardio only trained twin?

1034
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,840
About 95 percent pure slow twitch.

1035
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:02,720
Okay. So right there, you have the explanation for why he was weaker. He just couldn't generate

1036
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:08,800
the force. It's a couple of things. So it answers the handful. Number one, do they change?

1037
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:15,520
Yes. We know this is highly malleable now. Yeah, not even close. We actually know that

1038
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:20,160
there's data on nutrition. There's nutritional aspects that will alter fiber type composition.

1039
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:24,880
Anything that's going to go activate PGC1 alpha and that whole cascade is going to activate

1040
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,920
increase a switch of fibers. Like this is going to happen, right? There's actually a study that came

1041
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:35,360
out very recently on resveratrol doing it. Not in humans, but like a very reasonable dose 5 grams

1042
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:41,200
of resveratrol, I think in cattle. Just like not that much at all for a 2,000 pound animal.

1043
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:46,240
Cause significant changes in fiber type profile. And there's a whole host of nutritional interventions.

1044
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,440
The question of, okay, does it change the physical activity? Like it's been answered so many times

1045
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:57,760
for so many decades now. It's just like very clear. And in our case, okay, how much, how much

1046
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:02,240
can it really change an important amount? Well, I don't know what these people's default is. Because

1047
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:10,400
one could argue the untrained guy was actually in a, in an adaptation state. He would have,

1048
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,640
yeah, he had a higher state. Yeah. And he, he, he deviated away from his potential.

1049
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,920
Right. Because one thing that seems to be very clear is these two A2X fibers are generally associated

1050
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,200
with four health. And so we see this concentration go up. Whereas any kind of physical activity or

1051
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:31,680
space flight. A 2X by itself is not. A 2X is basically irrelevant because they just don't exist.

1052
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:36,880
Okay. Got it. And if you have some, if you have them, it's generally bad news. So you don't want

1053
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,440
to train into them. So the ideal scenario here is two A, those seem to be the place you want to

1054
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,400
train into. Um, if you do any sort of physical training, those hybrids tend to go down, especially

1055
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:51,040
two A2Xs, they kind of go away. And so I'm not surprised that that the trained individual had

1056
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:55,840
none of them. Um, and also not surprised that the untrained one. So it lined up pretty textbook. So

1057
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:03,520
the magnitude of change is meaningful. Um, so the case study, all that. What's, what's your hypothesis

1058
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:14,800
if you had a third brother, a triplet who was a, um, let's see who was a weight lifter.

1059
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:22,000
Or a power lifter. The distinction actually don't think would matter a ton. You're going to get the

1060
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:31,520
same answer. I would not be surprised if that third was 70% pass switch to a, um, and 30% type one.

1061
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,400
Yeah. With probably very few hybrids. If they're trained now, the one distinction is the two A2X

1062
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:43,280
fibers tend to be a little more responsive to a little bit of workload. And so you have to hit

1063
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:47,360
sufficient audience to really get them to go all the way away, but it's not that much. So if you're

1064
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:51,760
just like kind of like a laissez-faire lifter, you'll still have some there now, but if you're

1065
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:56,560
training seriously, um, those things are going to be going away. Yeah. So, so I don't really think,

1066
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,960
given enough time and exposure, I don't really think that there's a limit to the plasticity

1067
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:06,400
among fiber types. Um, even within a normal human condition. Now this was 35 years.

1068
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1069
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:14,640
So like, you know, do we have a sense about the window in which you are maximally susceptible

1070
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:21,040
to it? So if someone listening to this is 50 years old and they've kind of been sedentary a lot of

1071
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:28,880
their lives, but because they listen to this podcast, they've now got the motivation to

1072
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:35,600
become big time exercisers. How much can they, you know, bend the arc of their fiber curve?

1073
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,640
So fiber type is actually really quite cool because it doesn't seem to matter what age you are.

1074
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:45,920
So training studies in 70 year olds, we see dramatic changes in fiber type in six weeks,

1075
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,400
eight weeks, certainly. And the magnitude of change doesn't seem to differentiate. In fact,

1076
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,760
the way that you want to think about this is it's kind of like an asymptote.

1077
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:59,520
The less trained you are, the faster things, the faster the initial adaptation,

1078
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:05,520
the closer to your edge. So if you're a weightlifter, in fact, we saw this differentiated.

1079
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:11,200
So with our world caliber lifters compared to national caliber lifters, the world caliber

1080
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:16,400
lifters had been lifting at a very high level for like eight or so years, but the national

1081
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:22,000
caliber had been lifting more like four years. They were close to fiber type, but the national

1082
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:28,480
calibers had more fast-rich fibers. So what this tells you is initial changes happened very quickly,

1083
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:35,040
but getting from that last few percentage up took years for that second group. But we will see this

1084
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:39,680
again four to six weeks to see a demonstrable change in fiber type composition is, and it

1085
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:45,360
doesn't seem to matter with age. In fact, as you age, it probably gets easier because your level of

1086
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:51,040
untrained is so high if that situation is there. One other thing I want to ask you about on the

1087
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:57,120
microanatomy side, Andy, is explain, you sort of have talked about it indirectly, but if a person

1088
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:03,680
hasn't maybe caught it, can you just explain how hypertrophy fits into this? So when a person wants

1089
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,800
to have bigger muscles, what's happening at the cellular level with their muscle fibers?

1090
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:15,840
Right. So there's an interesting discussion here. The easy answer is when we generally say

1091
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,400
hypertrophy, what we're referring to is diameter or cross-sectional area. And so if you remember,

1092
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:25,680
if you think about the muscle fibers being that cylinder, the width of the cylinder just expands.

1093
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,400
And so that circle gets larger is the way to think about it.

1094
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:36,080
And a crude analogy is getting fatter means each adipocyte is getting bigger. It's taking on and

1095
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:42,560
storing more triglyceride. Yep. Yep, exactly. So from a skeletal muscle perspective,

1096
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,560
the diameter gets larger. There's actually interesting work. We actually have some tissue

1097
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,400
on its way to Auburn right now. Because one of the things that's been interesting is like a

1098
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:58,880
bro science thing for years of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy versus contractile hypertrophy.

1099
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:05,680
And so what this is really positing is, is the change really coming from fluid retention,

1100
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:11,600
basically? Or is it actually enhanced of the contractile tissue, which in this case would be

1101
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:18,880
active in myosin? Seems to have some initial work there. That's a little bit of both. And it happens

1102
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:26,800
the different phases of training. So sorry, is the question, do different types of training

1103
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:32,400
increase sarcoplasmic versus contractile hypertrophy? Or is the broader question, you know,

1104
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:40,320
hey, is a bodybuilder a bodybuilder because their sarcoplasmic reticulum is huge, but their

1105
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,840
contractile units are not that much bigger than the average person? I'm not sure I want to make

1106
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:48,560
sure I understand the question. Yeah, so it's close, not the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It's what

1107
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:52,480
we call sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. So this is just being increased in diameter with additional

1108
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:59,040
fluid. So it is close to what you're saying. Okay. So in other words, does this thing even exist? In

1109
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,720
other words, or is all increases in muscle size through strength training, assuming it's like a

1110
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:08,240
normal positive adaptation. That's sort of weird thing. Is it actually happening because myosin

1111
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:12,160
actin are getting thicker? I see. I got it. You can't add. That's amazing. We don't know the answer

1112
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:19,200
to that question yet. We don't. More data have started coming out. Wow. But even a few years ago,

1113
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,520
the idea that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy was a thing was thought of as like garbage rosines. Meaning

1114
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:32,960
the idea, the sort of assumed belief was anytime muscles got bigger, they were getting bigger in

1115
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:40,000
the contractile units. Correct. By the way, I'm not shocked that that was the default hypothesis.

1116
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:46,320
I'm shocked that it wasn't definitively known. It was a technology issue. Okay. It was an assay

1117
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:51,360
problem. Like figuring out how to actually measure this. When you take a muscle fiber. Even with an

1118
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:55,600
electron microscopy, you couldn't do this? That's not the problem. It's the standardization of fluids.

1119
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:01,440
That's the issue. When you sample the tissue, it's how do you lock the fluid into place,

1120
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:07,120
basically? Correct. How do you take this cell out of it, living human? And preserve its fluid

1121
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:11,680
architecture without contaminating it. I got it. And you couldn't do that with liquid nitrogen

1122
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:16,880
immediately. That flash freezes. So if you get crystals in there, you actually lice.

1123
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:22,240
You screwed the whole thing. Got it. Beautiful. Just because I'm such a freaking nerd, I can't

1124
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:28,240
stand it. How did you guys solve this problem? Well, I didn't solve it, first of all. Mike Roberts,

1125
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:33,200
out of Auburn, has produced a lot of really interesting work in this area. His lab is

1126
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:37,760
extraordinary. But they just figured out they were able to take an assay from a colleague of

1127
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:44,000
his, figure out how to preserve it, and liquid nitrogen is actually fine. But then from there,

1128
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,880
you have to thought correctly, and you have to do it. So he troubleshot this whole thing for a

1129
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,440
couple years. I see. So you accept the crystals that'll blow up the size because of course they

1130
01:44:53,440 --> 01:45:00,160
don't. If you freeze them correctly. Yeah, but it's how you thought that... Yeah. Okay. So cool.

1131
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:06,160
Like this. So it gets very detailed. And I hope there's some high school college kid listening

1132
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:11,920
to this who's studying chemistry, who's realizing just how cool and interconnected all of these

1133
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:18,160
worlds are. Chemistry, biology, physics, they're just so linked. Yeah. Yeah. I always joke that

1134
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,920
there's only one thing in this world. There's only one science. It's just math.

1135
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:28,880
As much as I hate math, the chemistry is math. Energy is math. It's all just biomechanics is

1136
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:35,200
math. It's that. Math and reductionism. But that's it. Those are the two things.

1137
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:42,560
Yeah. So to go back, what the question is, and here's where the exercise scientist

1138
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:51,440
came up comes in. Why is it a bodybuilder can have more muscle, yet they're not stronger than

1139
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:56,160
a strong man or a weightlifter? How does this actually happen? This is where this whole thing

1140
01:45:56,240 --> 01:46:02,080
comes about. How is it that my hypertrophy can exceed yours but somehow your strength? And the

1141
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:10,640
easy sophomore answer is, oh, neurological adaptations. Okay. Fine. Sure. But there's

1142
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:15,920
nothing happening intracellularly? Well, I don't think that's correct. And in fact,

1143
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,640
it doesn't look to be the case. And so there is some sort of combination because here's the

1144
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:25,920
juxtaposition. There's a thing called lattice spacing, which is there's an optimal distance,

1145
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,960
between that myosin and actin. In other words, if I was trying to produce a powerful contraction,

1146
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,720
but I was buttered up next to each other, I can't actually squeeze that hard because there's nowhere

1147
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:40,480
to go. If I'm too extended, then I actually can't. Yeah. So it's the same idea as preload in a heart,

1148
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:46,000
right? Which is 100, 100%. Preload is going to determine stroke volume, like everything

1149
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,040
incoming in, right? So this spacing, if you're going to start adding contractile units one way

1150
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:57,920
or the other, you have to preserve spacing somehow. So the kind of the idea, yeah, the idea

1151
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:06,560
is it will exceed, it will expand hypertrophically. But if it actually compromises your, because

1152
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:12,960
they're going back to math, I promise you, there's a mathematical optimization for the exact strike

1153
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:18,480
distance between actin and myosin to not be overextended or under extended and to have that

1154
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:23,680
perfect preload for maximum contraction. And if your hypertrophy train, this is now,

1155
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:28,720
I'm totally making this up, but if your hypertrophy training interfered with that and compromised it,

1156
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:35,680
you might gain size at the expense of potential strength. Right. Or if that hypertrophy was coming

1157
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:42,000
simply from excessive fluid and not actually contractile units, then you would actually have

1158
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,520
a larger muscle. And when I say fluid retention, I'm not talking about like acute fluid retention.

1159
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:53,520
I'm not saying like you're bloated today, you've water loaded. I mean, just there's enhanced fluid

1160
01:47:54,400 --> 01:48:00,480
in a homeostatic balance inside the tissue because diameter has gotten larger, but it wasn't met with

1161
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,880
an equal amount of increase in contractile units. So if that number gets off. Yeah. I think another

1162
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:09,520
physiologic point that's worth explaining to people is how much people are familiar with the idea that

1163
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,520
two thirds to 70% of our weight, right? I stood on the scale this morning,

1164
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:23,040
like that number on the scale, two thirds to 70% of it is H2O. Yeah. And then people say, okay,

1165
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:29,760
well, wait, how can that be? Because I get that my blood plasma is water. That can't be where it

1166
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:37,200
all is. No, most of it is in the cells of our body. And the muscle is of course, no exception,

1167
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:43,680
given that it's such a ubiquitous cell. Totally. And in fact, given that it occupies the vast

1168
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:50,320
majority mass in your body, giving the fact that in order for it to store its primary unit of

1169
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:54,640
energy, it needs to bring water with it being glucose. Right. And just tell folks how that

1170
01:48:54,640 --> 01:49:01,200
differs from like what the, again, going back to bodybuilding, you know, I love following Jay

1171
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:05,920
Cutler on Instagram because I was just such a fan of his as a bodybuilder. And he's just one of

1172
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:11,760
these guys who in retirement is still like training hard, paying attention to his nutrition.

1173
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,680
And it was an interesting video. So he went into like In-N-Out Burger and he was like,

1174
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:19,680
it's my cheat day today. I'm going into In-N-Out Burger and he places this monster order. But what

1175
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:26,720
caught me was how much he said no salt, no salt, no salt, no salt. So he was like,

1176
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:33,280
two burgers here, fries here, but no salt, no salt, no salt, no salt. Clearly this guy knows

1177
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:39,200
something about the effect of sodium on fluid retention. That's a different fluid than what

1178
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:45,680
we're talking about now. So yeah. Well, yes and no. In the sense of like, he probably has

1179
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:49,840
an either direct or indirect understanding of if you smash down seven grams of salt right now,

1180
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,960
like bad things are about to happen in a lot of areas. Like more specifically,

1181
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:02,800
if you just look at, we're getting sort of maybe after it, but if you look at hydration

1182
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,720
and dealing with the athletes that I deal with, a weight cut is a huge deal, right? Like managing

1183
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:16,800
a 15 or more pound reduction in water over a course of 48 hours and then putting that back in.

1184
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:24,560
If you don't understand being hypoosmotic or hyperosmotic or isosmotic, like you're going to

1185
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:31,120
cause a whole host of problems from kidney issues to diarrhea to bloating to all kinds of problems.

1186
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:36,720
So you have to actually understand what you put back in them has to be the same thing as what's

1187
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:42,400
intracellular or you're not going to drive fluid. You're not going to drive fluid into tissue. And

1188
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:47,760
you get it in a situation where guys are peeing and girls are severely dehydrated. They're peeing,

1189
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:53,040
yet they put very little fluid actually back into tissue because blood volume got so large and

1190
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:58,640
expanded so quickly. They have a sense to excrete because total volume gets too high,

1191
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:03,680
quote unquote, but they didn't actually balance electrolytes. And so nothing goes intracellular,

1192
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:09,520
which is where you're trying to get it to outside of organs once your organs and functional organs

1193
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:14,160
rather. And are there any rules of thumb on that? So, you know, we were talking before the podcast

1194
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:21,120
started how, you know, I had food poisoning and in a span of like two days, I lost seven pounds.

1195
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:27,760
And my weight is about the most stable metric in my life. It just doesn't fluctuate a pound. So

1196
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:35,360
to lose seven pounds in two days, basically due to the fluid losses of being sick and having to go

1197
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:40,000
to the bathroom about every seven minutes, coupled with not really wanting to eat during that period

1198
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:47,600
of time. What is your best guess as to how much I mean, let's just posit that much of that seven

1199
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:54,720
pounds, six and a half of it is water. What's the ideal strategy to replenish that in terms of

1200
01:51:55,280 --> 01:52:03,040
hyper, hypo or isosmotic? If I'm going to try to replenish that in the form of liquid.

1201
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:09,040
Yep. Handful of things. Number one, you need to go slowly. Yeah. Right. So you got to make sure

1202
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:17,280
that you don't get excessive. So I don't want to pound four liters of worth of four grams of sodium

1203
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:22,640
in the first six hours. I'm feeling better. Yep. So number one, you want to shoot for something

1204
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:28,800
like the neighborhood of 110% to 125% of fluid, what weight like that's cause you're going to

1205
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:34,960
lose some to your, what's going to happen. So let's say you lost seven. Like my brain is like,

1206
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:40,240
okay, we're going to go to eight and a half, nine pounds, like something like that. Like you want

1207
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:44,240
to round this and call this a gallon. Okay. Like we're going to go down. All right. We're going to

1208
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:49,200
bring that in over the course of three hours or two guys before I've lost much. Is a pound,

1209
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:56,160
a quarter gallon. Well, four liters in a gallon ish. Yeah. A little over a couple of gallons. Right.

1210
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,760
So you're going to be, you don't want to bring that in. Well, yeah. I mean, a gallon is,

1211
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:06,720
you got a gallons, four liters, a liters kilo. So you're talking four kilos.

1212
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:12,960
So, and so you would do that over how many, you could do that over two days. No, no, no, no,

1213
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,200
like three hours. Oh, you could, you can, you can, you can bring it once, once your GI system

1214
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,880
settles down. So you would have fighters that would, I guess they have to, if they're going

1215
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,440
from a way into competition, they've got to bring that in. No, no, no. Yeah. We for sure, like,

1216
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:31,200
for sure, last week guy in Abu Dhabi, a hundred, weighed in 136 pounds,

1217
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:37,520
there's 152 pounds within probably five hours. And what was the osmolarity? With no urine,

1218
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:42,000
like no, no diarrhea, no GI. What was the, what was the osmolarity of the fluid he took in?

1219
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:49,280
Um, so it depends the guy going through it this week as well. We actually measure that. So we

1220
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:53,120
actually will measure, run a basic sweat test and you can figure out sodium concentrations.

1221
01:53:53,680 --> 01:54:00,320
And then the amount that they get back is actually dependent upon them. So that number can fluctuate

1222
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:04,960
depending on if they're a high salt, low salt sort of sweater. It also depends on how much salt

1223
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:11,440
we've had to pull out the week of or not. So obviously if we don't pull out salt five or six

1224
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:19,040
days away or like anything bananas like that. But if you have seven to 8% of your body fat,

1225
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:24,480
you have to lose or sorry, seven, 8% of body fluid of your body weight and fluid you have to lose.

1226
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:29,440
Like we're going to take some salt out for a couple of days just to get a salt out.

1227
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:36,080
Tell me how many grams per day they're down to in sodium zero. You're going to get down to zero

1228
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:40,800
on those last couple of days. So you're going to get down to like a classic example is we might

1229
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:48,160
have them at like, uh, two and a half grams, kind of like fight week per day. It's like not

1230
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:54,720
unreasonable, but the day before like water cut day, it's zero. It's as much as like you're boiling

1231
01:54:54,720 --> 01:55:00,640
chicken to get as much possible stuff out of there. Um, you're eating as much like as low as,

1232
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:05,360
as close to zero as we possibly can for that 24 hour period. And that's, that'll have,

1233
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,440
ideally you don't have to go that low. But sometimes you have,

1234
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:11,120
that's a bigger impact than cutting calories, which you don't really want to do at that point.

1235
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:16,720
Yeah. Yeah. I don't care about calories. The calories are irrelevant at that point. It is

1236
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:22,720
simply physical weight of food. And this is a fluid manipulation here. Uh, if we can keep them

1237
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:28,000
at like a gram, cause I last say like cool, but a lot of the times you're staring on the barrel of

1238
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:34,320
an eight to 15 pound water cut on a day, like you just need every advantage.

1239
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:38,000
I'm sorry. Eight to 15 pounds of water you can cut in a day.

1240
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:45,440
Oh yeah. Yeah, for sure. In a guy that starts out as little as like 160 pounds. Like if you're

1241
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:51,840
taking, if you're trying to get 160 to 147, you're doing that in a day. You can't, it's not ideal,

1242
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:57,040
but you can. Okay. Let's make it ideal. If you did it, would two days be ideal to do that?

1243
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:06,400
Now. So ideally in the situations you start off, um, you, you come into fight week in the proper

1244
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:12,400
situation. So you need to come into fight week hydrated on normal or like even maybe slightly

1245
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:17,200
higher salt, normal or higher carbohydrate. You need to come in healthy. You need to come in

1246
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:21,600
recovered, not over-trained all that stuff because you have, like you have to play a whole bunch of

1247
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:27,360
games here Monday through sort of Thursday, you're going to start getting as much of this off

1248
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:31,920
passively as you possibly can. And so you're going to typically keep carbohydrate very low,

1249
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:36,000
50 or less grams, sort of depending on what they're doing. And you're going to complete

1250
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,440
glycogen that alone is going to start helping you pull some water. And so you've got to passively

1251
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:44,720
do it. You can play games with fiber. And so you have these low residue diets last couple of days.

1252
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:49,840
And so you can make sure you're not holding on to food in your gut. That can buy you a couple of

1253
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:56,160
kilos, depending on the size of the person. And so ideally, for example, if you came in Monday,

1254
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:05,360
a fight week at 170 pounds, hopefully we can kind of get you down to like 164, 165 by Thursday

1255
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:12,480
with like very, yeah. And now you're, you're talking like we've got nine to do over 24 hours.

1256
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:17,440
Well, you're going to float a couple throughout the day, just urinating and stuff because you're

1257
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:22,800
being very hydrated. You're going to float one or so overnight, this because of that. So really,

1258
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:26,320
there goes three right there. So now you're talking like we've got to do six or seven

1259
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:34,320
of like active water dropping in that situation. So that really is a 15 pound week, but it's not

1260
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:39,520
that bad. Okay. But where do those six come? Those six come just from taking straight water pure. So

1261
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:43,600
that is the sodium complete sodium restriction. Well, you're going to have to, you're going to

1262
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:47,200
have to add in some sort of sweating component. So you're going to have to do

1263
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:54,000
sauna or cardio. Yeah, something like that. If you're already down, the ideal situation is you do

1264
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:59,520
a little bit of physical activity, maybe to burn any last little bit of glycogen without getting

1265
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:07,200
like too terrible feeling. And then from there, ideally, it's sort of like, well, you'll see a

1266
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:10,320
lot of what's called a mummy wrap. So you basically lay down and you put a bunch of blankets on

1267
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:15,840
yourself. It's like very easy to regulate blood pressure and make sure you're okay. You know,

1268
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:20,560
the risk of passing out and you'll sweat like a pretty good amount. And then weigh in is Friday.

1269
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:27,200
What time? Morning. So nine o'clock in the morning. Okay. Usually. A lot of times if we

1270
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:32,320
actually do this best, you don't do much of that the night before you wake up the next morning and

1271
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:37,760
you're say four pounds over and you can actually sweat out four pounds pretty easy in a sauna,

1272
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:43,280
20, 30 minutes. Like something like that. And then fight is Saturday night. So you've got,

1273
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:50,800
you know, 18 hours plus to put it back on. Oh wait. Yeah. More like 30, 36 because you're

1274
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:58,320
going to, yeah. Yeah. And typically if we do this again, correct. Um, it's that all these,

1275
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:02,560
all these scenarios don't always play out, but it's, it can be a quite chaotic. Um,

1276
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:07,200
but yeah, you would, you would ideally be back to your normal Monday weight within four to five

1277
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:12,400
hours after that weigh in. And so you're only touching that final scale number for a very

1278
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:17,040
short amount of time. Um, so you're, you're kind of faking the scale. So you're back to that normal

1279
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:23,120
fight neighbor. Uh, and then, um, by the next morning, like you're certainly well back normal.

1280
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:28,960
Now the only difference, the only thing here is like recovery muscle glycogen in 36 hours is

1281
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:34,720
close enough. Like you can get, if you, if you do this correctly, you can get a pretty good way.

1282
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:40,160
You can actually get body weight back. No problem. The difficult part is getting brain fluid back.

1283
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:44,080
Um, I'm not totally convinced that gets all the way back in 36 hours.

1284
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:49,520
So that's the like little bit of a challenge that you have, but there's just no way around.

1285
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:54,320
So is there an advantage to be made for a fighter who I'm just making up the weight of 147,

1286
01:59:54,320 --> 02:00:01,920
but just pick a weight, right to live, train and show up at 150 instead of 160. So that,

1287
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:08,720
okay, the drawback is he's going to be in the ring at less weight. But the advantage is he went

1288
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:13,760
through less metabolic fluid shift in the two days prior. And maybe he's actually just

1289
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:20,160
physiologically better. So there's actually a good amount of research on that, uh, of looking

1290
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:26,000
at exactly what happens then doing performance testing, um, pre and post. It's not that bad

1291
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:32,400
actually from a performance perspective, as long as you stay within certain ranks, uh, if you get

1292
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:37,600
excessive, then yeah. Um, there's been a number of folks look at, uh, if you follow the UFC, look

1293
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:44,480
at Frankie Edgar. Um, he's won multiple world championships, significantly undersized. Right.

1294
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:51,360
So that, that works in general though. It starts to become challenging because in the sport of MMA,

1295
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:57,200
the, the weight classes are so large in boxing, you've got a weight class every four to seven

1296
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:01,760
pounds. So if a guy is really six pounds, everything use of that big deal on boxing, you know,

1297
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:06,400
if a guy is 15 pounds, however, you know, grappling sports, it's, it's, it's just,

1298
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:10,720
and then you'll see this, like he held me against the cage. I couldn't, she just held me down. She

1299
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:17,840
didn't. Ideal situation is nobody cuts weight. I did situation is that's all gone,

1300
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:22,000
but how do you ever do that? Because somebody will be like, well, I'll take that advantage.

1301
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,600
So ideally if you do it right and you can come into fight week at 6% over fight weight,

1302
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:33,920
it should be no problem. Um, performance-wise you should get there other than like the pain and the

1303
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:41,920
acid is to deal with you start getting to 8% fight week. Okay. You it's 10% fight week. Like,

1304
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:46,960
all right. I guess it's going to be really, really challenging. Um, but yeah.

1305
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:53,120
All right. Let's bring this all back. Cause I, I know I'm guessing, you know, that, that

1306
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:58,720
we've gone probably a lot deeper into the physiology, the anatomy, the micro anatomy

1307
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:02,800
of the muscle, but I think it's worthwhile. I think this was an investment that was worth

1308
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:09,840
making because now it becomes a lot easier to talk about some of the things that are effectively

1309
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:17,440
the application of this. And I really want to kind of go back to, um, how we started talking

1310
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:25,280
about this, which was through the lens of different types of athletes that are effectively the beacon

1311
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:34,080
of excellence in anything that has to do with muscle. So we talked about a power lifter,

1312
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:41,920
power lifter, despite the bad nomenclature is ostensibly the strongest athlete at the

1313
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:48,880
all out max one rep. Don't care how long it takes movement. You then go to that weight lifter who's

1314
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:56,640
also doing a one rep, but boy, he or she is also got to be incredibly coordinated. And therefore,

1315
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:02,560
by definition, because of the nature of the movement, incredibly explosive, but it's just one

1316
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:10,160
rep, the strong man, um, he's, you know, throwing boulders and having to pick them up and throw them

1317
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:16,160
again and again, again, insane amount of strength, but you, you're not just relying on one energy

1318
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:21,040
system. You've got to also have a little bit of endurance, both muscularly, cardiovascularly,

1319
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:29,280
the CrossFit, you know, athlete, also very strong, also agile mobile has the explosivity, but not,

1320
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:34,640
you know, basically isn't as good at anything as those first three, but has something that none of

1321
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:39,680
them have, which is a greater degree of endurance. I think we looped in the bodybuilder, which

1322
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:44,880
aesthetically looks like, you know, better than all of them has bigger muscles than all of them,

1323
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:49,920
but has to meet no other requirement. And then I think I like that you brought in finally the

1324
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:59,280
Sprinter, which is the pure, you know, you could argue the highest ratio of power to weight and

1325
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:08,000
locomotion optimized. Okay. I will never be half as good as any of those six. I think there's six,

1326
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,600
right? One, two, yeah, there's six of them. Um, and most people listening to this don't need to be,

1327
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:22,240
but we probably want bits of each of them in us. Right. So let's now talk about hypothetical

1328
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:31,120
ways to train. And let's, I did this with Lane and people really liked this approach. Um,

1329
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:35,920
so maybe we'll try to do the same thing. Let's go through some hypothetical case studies, right? So

1330
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:41,520
person comes to you and says, Andy, I want you to design a training program for me. Here's what I

1331
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:49,040
look like now. Here's what my goals are. And the goal is a no holds barred approach to what they

1332
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:55,120
need to do. In other words, don't, don't, unless I specify it as part of the problem, don't hold back,

1333
02:04:55,120 --> 02:05:01,600
you know? All right. So we'll start with the easy one, which is the untrained individual,

1334
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:10,400
who comes to you and says, okay, I bought it. You know, I'm, I'm all in on this. Um,

1335
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:15,440
I'm willing to, to go to the gym. You know, Peter's all we already got me doing a couple

1336
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:20,640
hours a week is zone two on the bike, but I don't even know how to approach this strength training

1337
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:28,400
thing. I'm willing to, I don't know, put three hours a week in the gym. I want to get bigger

1338
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:35,600
because I, you know, I had a DEXA scan and it really showed that my ALMI was about the 40th

1339
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:41,760
percentile. And I really, you know, I looking at the literature, I think being at or above the

1340
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:47,280
75th percentile for lean mass is a better place to be. So that's where I'd like to be in a year,

1341
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:53,360
two years, three years. Um, but I also want it to matter. You know, I want to be stronger. I want to

1342
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:58,960
be able to do stuff when I get older. I don't just want to get bigger. I want to be able to, um,

1343
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:04,880
never enter a competition. I'm not here to enter the strongman competition, but like I never want

1344
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:10,000
to hurt. I want to be able to chop wood in my backyard. I want to be able to carry stuff around.

1345
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,560
I want to be able to travel with a backpack on. Any, any other questions you have for me before

1346
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:20,240
you designed my program, Andy? How many days per week did you say? Um, I, I could be up to going

1347
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:27,120
into the gym like three days a week, an hour at a time, three days total. Okay, cool. So you've

1348
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:32,800
basically described every one of our executive clients and our rapid health optimization program.

1349
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:38,960
So like, so I can nail this one. Um, I obviously spent most of my career with professional

1350
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:44,880
athletes, but we deal with this problem all the time in rapid. So here's what I would say. You've

1351
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:52,320
already got zone two stuff. Yep. We got to study state. Great. Copy that. Um, here's what you need

1352
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:56,960
to pay attention to. You described muscle was insufficient. So we got it in our brain,

1353
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:00,080
right? A macro thinking we've got to put on muscle mass. You also said they're untrained though.

1354
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:04,880
And one of the things you're going to see quite clearly. Oh, sorry. I sort of left out. Um,

1355
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:11,280
like I, I was active in high school and college. Like I, it's not like I've never done anything,

1356
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:16,640
but you know, I've been working really hard at my job, started a family. And so the last 10 years,

1357
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:24,160
my only exercise has been, um, like activities of daily living, which includes sometimes hiking and

1358
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:28,880
playing with my kids. But yes, I haven't been in the gym. I haven't been in the gym in a decade.

1359
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:34,640
Perfect. Yeah. You still describe everybody in rapid health optimization. No problem. So the way

1360
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:38,240
that I'm just going to walk you through sort of, I'm going to break the fourth dimensional wall

1361
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:42,960
here. My brain and maybe thinking, all right, we need hypertrophy. This is a base and foundation

1362
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:47,840
of everything. You're going to get stronger by doing hypertrophy at this stage of your training.

1363
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,080
Like we talked earlier, those are not always coupled. You can get stronger without getting

1364
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:56,880
more muscle mass very clearly. And you can get really a lot of muscle without optimizing strength.

1365
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:00,880
We talked about that at the end of those spectrums. You're not, you're at this end of the spectrum,

1366
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:04,560
the opposite. Those are going to be basically linked at this phase in your training.

1367
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:09,280
So we don't have to do both. You can do one and get both adaptations at the same time. Because

1368
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:15,440
I'm so low on the curve. Anything is going to give me a bit of both. In fact, we can get that

1369
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:20,640
from not even lifting weights. Because in fact, of our training studies, you'll see that you'll see

1370
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:27,600
equal adaptations and muscle size, hypertrophy from even steady state cycling. Initially,

1371
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:35,680
for six to eight weeks, you'll see equal all of our concurrent training models and studies show

1372
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:39,920
same thing. Like not only is there not interference and interference effect at this stage, it's a

1373
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:44,400
complimentary. In fact, a study came out more recently showing six weeks of endurance exercise

1374
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:51,040
steady state cycling prior to hypertrophy actually enhanced end result muscle growth.

1375
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:57,920
So spending time initially getting physically fit before trying to add muscle mass for someone like

1376
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:03,440
this, it's a very fruitful investment. Great. So the fact that I've been doing my zone two for

1377
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:11,200
two months actually has you pretty happy. Super happy. Okay. Okay. I'm also thinking,

1378
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:16,480
all right, you mentioned longevity, physical function as we move down. You also mentioned,

1379
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:21,840
you said three years from now or something, which tells me your mind is really thinking about long

1380
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:27,680
term investment. That's right. Peter has me committed to, this is not about looking good

1381
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:32,800
in my bathing suit in six weeks. I'm not in a rush. Copy that. Right. So one of the things

1382
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:39,520
that you'll see very specifically with aging is a loss of physical function. And that's more geared

1383
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:45,840
for power. In fact, the rate of you've probably covered this before, rate of loss of muscle mass

1384
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:52,480
as you age is something like a half to 1% per year. Loss of muscle strength

1385
02:09:53,440 --> 02:10:01,360
is double the triple that loss of muscle power is triple that. And so what are you saying? You see a

1386
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:07,120
very precipitous drop in muscle power. And why is that happening? So a little bit of loss of speed.

1387
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:11,920
Aha. So preserving the fact that you can do this, you can go look at the world records

1388
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:17,840
of all sports across age groups. So if you look at like track and field, what's the world record

1389
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:22,480
in the a hundred meter dash and what's the world record for the 30 to this, what's the world record

1390
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:27,760
for the 40 to 50 year old range, 50 to 60. And what you'll see is strength sports like powerlifting,

1391
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:34,880
the world record through age, it doesn't go down that much. The world record in speed and jumping

1392
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:42,880
sports just falls off a cliff. So it's preserving speed. In addition, my friend Greg Grisicki

1393
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:48,800
just published a paper this week and a journal of physiology, a blue ribbon journal in our field,

1394
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:53,680
right? So high as you get. And this was actually looking specifically at single fiber contractile

1395
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:58,880
function changes with aging. And the data here are extraordinarily clear, have been along with that.

1396
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:04,080
You see very little loss of function in siltered fibers through aging, regardless of exercise or not.

1397
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:10,160
I sort of mentioned this earlier, but you see a dramatic reduction in fast rich fibers,

1398
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:18,560
and you actually don't see a drop of power. And so there's nothing internal to the muscle fiber

1399
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,640
that's going down. So what other way to say this is if you take a loss, that's the problem.

1400
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:30,480
It's the fiber size. The atrophy of fast rich fibers is the almost exclusive.

1401
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:36,880
The problem with aging and muscle. You have got to maintain fast rich fiber size.

1402
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:42,720
Now there are some loss of total fibers, but that is actually very difficult to find scientifically

1403
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:48,560
counting total amount of fiber fibers in a live human muscle is extraordinarily difficult.

1404
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:52,880
So what really what we're after here is anytime I'm thinking

1405
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:56,960
longevity, I'm thinking primarily absolute force and power

1406
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:07,840
has to be preserved. And this is a faster fiber atrophy issue. This is a target. So these are

1407
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:13,360
the things spinning in my head. So how is this three day a week combination interlock? Okay.

1408
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:18,240
And sorry, just to make sure we translate that Andy, because I think that was so important,

1409
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:25,680
what you just said, you're basically looking, I'm 50 and you're looking down the barrel of my life

1410
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:29,200
saying you want to live another 40 years and you want to be functioning.

1411
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:37,040
The most important thing I can do for you in the gym is not focus on the things that you're going

1412
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:45,280
to get for free. It's focus on the things that are declining so rapidly. And I will as a corollary

1413
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:51,440
to that, get a bunch of other stuff for free. But I have to focus on the atrophy of your fast

1414
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:57,680
twitch muscle fibers because it's already happening and we need to save that off. And we need to put

1415
02:12:57,680 --> 02:13:04,640
in the gym systems to support the reversal of that process. Because if I just ignore that,

1416
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:10,480
you know, I might as well be that highly exercise twin guy who's, you know, doing all his cardio,

1417
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:14,960
but at the end of the day, he can't jump off the curb. He can't, you know, he's going to be this,

1418
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:21,040
the hyper cardio athlete who's still a decrepit person in the last decade of their life.

1419
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:29,360
To make it even better or worse, those fibers require specific types of training.

1420
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:36,160
Unless you specifically do that, you just don't have any chance of those tissues. The other tissues

1421
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:44,720
aren't as like hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is pretty non-specific in terms of your training

1422
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:49,120
application. But if you want to make sure that you're targeting fast twitch fibers, like this,

1423
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:54,320
this requires very specific protocols or like, have no chance faster, slow twitch fibers are going

1424
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:58,800
to get activated with any activity of day to day. They're going to get activated with any amount

1425
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:03,760
of physical strain, whether you're doing intervals, zone two, zone six, that doesn't matter, right?

1426
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:08,000
Tone 28, pick whatever you want. So that you're good. It's the fast twitch fibers that require

1427
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:13,600
intention. And that's why I, I, makes a big deal of it because you can't accidentally get those.

1428
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:18,960
Yep. That's right. It's sort of like what we say in fighting is like, you can sometimes accidentally

1429
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:24,320
knock somebody out. There are fluke punches. There are no accidental submissions. Like there's no

1430
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:32,720
fluke arm bars. Like you have to know what you're doing there or not. So coming back to our avatar.

1431
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:37,600
By the way, I love that line because I often say that to especially my female patients who are

1432
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:44,320
completely untrained, borderlining on cactic, afraid of lifting weights, you know, they just

1433
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:49,680
want to do yoga all day. And when I say, look, we have a problem here, you're osteopenic,

1434
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:57,360
and you're so weak, I am worried for your life. And they say, I just don't want to lift weights

1435
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:02,960
because I just don't want to get too big. And it's like, I have good news for you. The myth,

1436
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:07,440
the myth of accidental muscle has been fully debunked.

1437
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:16,560
Me and every other guy out there can tell you we're waiting for it to happen. It hasn't happened.

1438
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:23,520
The odds that you're going to wake up and think, God damn it, I'm too muscular. It's just,

1439
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:28,080
it just won't happen. The vast majority of us sitting around hoping and praying and devoting

1440
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:32,160
most of our waking hours and not waking hours to this goal that you think might accidentally happen.

1441
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:40,720
You're good. You're totally safe here. All right. So we know we have to preserve

1442
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:45,600
past which muscle fibers for the longterm. We know we have to take care of VO2 max.

1443
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:50,720
This is another, I'm sure you covered this in depth, important thing for long Kevin.

1444
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:57,600
All right. But we got some constraints. We also have to be considerate of, I have not trained in

1445
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:05,040
10 years. I'm going to get very sore very quickly. And if I become too sore, that it dissuades

1446
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:09,440
further training. Now I'm going to lose you. I bought in, but that shit was too hard. I was so

1447
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:14,320
sore. I couldn't even walk. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. I think in your show with Holly,

1448
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:19,840
she talked about making sure you start with a very low volume, like, like way lower volume than you

1449
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:26,320
think. We have time. Like we just need to move. I'm going to be very cautious of eccentric movements

1450
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:33,920
because they will, they will generate more soreness than relative. And the last part before I give you

1451
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:38,400
some direct answers is we want to start building movement patterns that we're going to need over

1452
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:44,560
time. And so this is an investment. We can get all that done by doing the same sort of training.

1453
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:49,280
We're practicing movement patterns. We're getting that stuff grooves. So we don't pick up injuries

1454
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:53,840
later. We're not getting excessively sore. We're building some muscle mass because we're going to

1455
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:59,360
get that anyways. And we don't need that. So if this was a six month program, because you can't

1456
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:03,520
write the same program for the next 50 years, right? What's the first six months, I guess is,

1457
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:09,840
if that's your question, right? So who's out of the way. I would probably stick to fairly similar

1458
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:18,000
to what Holly said initially, which was, okay, something like one to three working sets

1459
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:26,960
of probably four exercises a day, something like that. We want to spread those across upper, lower,

1460
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:30,480
and kind of some different movement patterns. And we want to practice the compound movements. I'm

1461
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:36,880
not going to isolated single joint movements yet. I'm going to, let's learn how to do a goblet squat.

1462
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:41,120
Okay, this is a squat. You're going to hold the dumbbell sort of in front of your chest. Great.

1463
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:46,800
We're going to learn to do a hip extension. We're going to learn to do a basic overhead press

1464
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:53,440
or some bent rows, things like that. And I'm going to spend 30 minutes on those things. I don't even

1465
02:17:53,440 --> 02:18:00,800
really care about tracking progression at this point. We're going to track. Did you get to get

1466
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:06,080
the movement pattern down? Right? Did you brace as our spine in the proper position? Are you breathing

1467
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:12,000
through your nose and through proper positions? Is your neck in the right spot? Great. All this

1468
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,800
foundational stuff that feels like not a big deal at all right now, because it shouldn't be.

1469
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:21,520
But we're making sure boxes are checked so that when we start progressing low later,

1470
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:27,520
that neck doesn't start getting irritated. We're just being in that position. We're going to do

1471
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:31,840
that, right? Okay. So we're basically completely optimizing movement patterns. We're making sure

1472
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:40,080
we don't hurt ourselves. We're learning new skills, right? We're learning skills of exercise.

1473
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:44,480
Let's now go to the next six months. So I come back to you, Andy, and I say,

1474
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:51,520
you know, this has been great. Like this is not as difficult as I thought it was going to be. I

1475
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:55,840
really, I've kind of enjoyed going to the gym. And honestly, like I even see a little more

1476
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:01,920
definition in my arms and my legs and I'm a little hungrier. So I've been eating a little bit more.

1477
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:07,920
I haven't lost any weight or anything, but my pants fit a little bit better. I'm, I'm, I'd like

1478
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:13,920
to take this up a notch. I can't commit more time though, Andy. So I'm really kind of, you know,

1479
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:18,400
three 60 minute spots is all I can get. Cause I still got to, you know, get my kids from school

1480
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:27,360
and work is just as demanding as ever. But how do I increase the desire to be even bigger and even

1481
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:33,680
stronger and even more functional? Great. So now we have to start investing that 60 minutes in the

1482
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:37,920
three workouts into different sections per workout. So we need to start doing something

1483
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:43,680
to start addressing power and speed. I'm going to give that the first 10 to 15 minutes though.

1484
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:47,600
We don't need to go nuts now, but we need to introduce those movement patterns

1485
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:52,320
and those velocities and those that tissue tolerance that we call it. So your ability to

1486
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:57,920
land and absorb, it's not creation of power, but it's the backend. How did I stop that movement?

1487
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:02,800
How did I land from it? We're going to continue to invest in, in the muscle growth. Now we can

1488
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:07,040
start pushing the pace a little bit. And then we're actually at the end, starting investing in

1489
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:12,240
either muscular endurance and or interval stuff. So if we're still continuing to do zone two,

1490
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:16,400
that's great, but we haven't worked on getting heart rate up coming back down and regulating

1491
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:21,440
that whole piece. So what's that look like? The first 10 or so minutes of all three workouts per

1492
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:26,320
week, we're going to do something in basic movement patterns. So let's imagine a box jump,

1493
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:31,200
right? We'll do a box jump. We're going to jump from the ground and land on a box that's say 18

1494
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:36,240
inches in the air, right? We're going to practice that movement pattern. I want you landing on the

1495
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:41,120
box, not on the ground that reduces the eccentric landing because you're going to be absorbing way

1496
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:45,280
less. So you're not going to get out of sore, but you're going to have to pop a little bit. You're

1497
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,960
going to have to jump to get up there and we're bracing that movement pattern. I'm going to

1498
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:53,600
probably do something. How are you determining that height Andy? 18 inches seems really high to me.

1499
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:59,280
How do I know if I shouldn't be 12 to start? What, what level of fatigue? How many times would I do

1500
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:06,160
this so that I can gauge how high it needs to be? There should be no fatigue. This is simply about

1501
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:11,840
high. This is load tolerance. This is load tolerance then. Low tolerance and it's introducing

1502
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:17,760
power. So you're going to start learning how to move fast, but you're going to do it and it's

1503
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:21,840
the safe thing where you're not going to pull a hamstring. And just to be clear, Andy, I, you know,

1504
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:26,320
I, I don't, I don't need to compete in sports. I don't play basketball anymore. I'm not,

1505
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:30,400
are you sure you need me doing this? Cause all I'm trying to do is I just want to be able to pick

1506
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:36,240
up my grandkids in 30 years or 20 years. Yeah. A hundred percent. So in order to pick up your

1507
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:41,120
grandkids, you need to not be in the hospital, right? You need to be not living in an assisted

1508
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:45,120
living home. Do you know what puts people in assisted living home? Falling and breaking the

1509
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:50,480
hip. The connection between morbidity and mortality with a hip break is extraordinary after the age

1510
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:59,360
of 60. It's not even 90. It is 60 ish. Um, reason, large reason people fall is they actually don't

1511
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:05,360
have foot speed. What do you mean? If you catch yourself, your toe on the corner or you slip,

1512
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:10,240
you have to have the foot speed to be able to put your other foot on that foot back out in front of

1513
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:17,120
you in the proper position. Then you have to have the eccentric strength to stop that fall. And so I

1514
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:21,200
need foot speed to get there and I need eccentric strength to brace the fall. So you don't land and

1515
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:25,600
break your hip. That's what's going to keep you playing with your kids when you're 60. Got it. So

1516
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:32,400
even though, yeah, so it's not, even though I don't want to be a quote unquote explosive athlete,

1517
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:38,240
I still have to kind of train like one in some part, and I'm asking for 10 minutes of your workout.

1518
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:45,200
Okay. Right. So I want to keep you there. Um, you can imagine the, I can continue to give you examples

1519
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:50,080
and analogies, but this is, if you want to go for a hike again and you, you trip, or you need to be

1520
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:55,280
able to get up and do a little scramble, you know, your, your, your 10 year old grandkid is going to

1521
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:59,600
want to go up that rock. Like you got to have a little pop to get up there too. I'm going to be

1522
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:02,960
able to pull yourself like all these things, right? That's what's going to keep you from going. So what

1523
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:08,000
are some, I'll just sit down here and wait. You go. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Uh, I had a patient once

1524
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:14,080
say something that I loved. Um, I asked him kind of what were his goals for aging and he said,

1525
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:23,120
to always be able to go to my kids and grandkids. And he meant it both micro and macro, right? Meaning

1526
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:27,360
I never want to be in the position where I can't get on an airplane and travel and go wherever they

1527
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:33,440
are. And I never want to not be able to go physically in the moment to where they are. I,

1528
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:37,680
I thought it was just a very elegant explanation. The second part is brilliant. Yeah.

1529
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:41,760
That's so good. Because that's the example there. I'll wait here versus no, I'm going to come with

1530
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:47,360
you up that little rock. Yeah. It's, it's the water slide. It's, I don't want to climb up those

1531
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:54,240
stairs. It's seven of them, but like, it's all the little stuff, right? Um, I have two little kids,

1532
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:58,640
so I'm very, I'm very in the world of like what a four year old will do. So what are some other

1533
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:04,000
things that we would do in that first 10 to 15 minutes? So I love the idea of the box jump with

1534
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:10,240
landing on top. So you don't have that huge eccentric de-ce, massive deceleration. Um,

1535
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:15,120
what about the bounds, skips, things like that would all be in there. Yep. Yep. Medicine ball

1536
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:19,760
throws are great. Medicine ball slams are great. Medicine ball tosses up in the air high as you can

1537
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:24,800
go as far as you can go behind you. Um, these are re-informing reinforcing movement patterns. You

1538
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:30,880
built the previous six months, proper hip extension versus low back extension, et cetera. It is also

1539
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:35,440
doing what we call triple extension. So you're simultaneously explosively extending the hip knee

1540
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:40,160
and ankle. And this is a very important human movement pattern. Um, you can do that without

1541
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:48,240
jumping and landing by throwing a medicine ball. If you go to, to, to plyometrics, um, you have to

1542
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:53,120
be a little bit careful here. Plyometrics are totally safe for all ages, as long as you account

1543
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:59,440
for volume. You just can't do too many of them, uh, at too high of an intensity, in this case,

1544
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:07,840
eccentric load. So, um, jump rope, a five minute jump rope is just plyometrics right now. When you

1545
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:12,000
go single leg to single leg, you start increasing risk. Like, so if you're gonna jump from your right

1546
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,520
leg and land on your right leg alone risk, but two leg to two leg is very easy. I mean, for

1547
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:26,080
for Pete's sake, you can play hopscotch. Hopscotch is just two-legged plyometric to single leg to back

1548
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:29,520
forward progression lateral. I can say it's a wonderful little exercise. Isn't it interesting

1549
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:37,440
when you go to a playground and watch kids play to realize the, they're not being told to do this,

1550
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:43,840
just the inherent ability that they have to be explosive. And as you said, how that deteriorates

1551
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:50,480
with age. Like you just can't imagine watching a group of 40 year olds sitting around just deciding,

1552
02:25:50,480 --> 02:25:54,800
let's go play this fun game where we jump around. I mean, you do that if you're playing a sport,

1553
02:25:54,880 --> 02:26:00,400
you do that if it's part of your pre-programmed workout, but it's not the equivalent of neat,

1554
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:05,440
right? Where you just, yeah, it's not spontaneous. Last one I love is actually,

1555
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:11,680
don't get thrown off by this word, but I love sprinting. And I just, just, just give me 70%.

1556
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:19,520
You would be surprised of like, whoa, it feels like great slash terrible. But if you can get on

1557
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:26,480
like a wood way or a controlled situation like that, and you can just do some like 70%

1558
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:30,000
for just getting through the motion, kind of a temple is what you've, you're a runner. Like

1559
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:35,440
you've caught that type of stuff for very short distances. I'm talking like a 15 seconds,

1560
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:42,080
just kind of stride it out. Okay. Slowly come back down. Wait a minute or two, fully recovered here.

1561
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:47,200
Okay. Ready? Roll back into it. Two, three, four seconds. And then give me, pick it up for five

1562
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:53,920
seconds, six seconds. Okay. Slowly back down. Just getting used to handling movement and being

1563
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:59,040
an athlete and moving and not being, everything is locked into a position where it's structured

1564
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:04,800
and secure and all that stuff. So I really, really like movement, athletic movement and,

1565
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:12,240
and multiple planes for people. The last example I'll give you is just back to like high school

1566
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:17,600
and middle school sports. Give me, we're going to play 10 minutes of basketball, go to the court,

1567
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:21,440
we're going to shoot, grab it up and down. Like we're going to play racquetball as our warmup today.

1568
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:25,600
We're going to play badminton. You go over there, I'll get over here like two and two bad, like you

1569
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:30,480
can do a lot of little different things that are going to be multi-planar. It's going to be speed,

1570
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:35,040
agility, quickness at this point. So you're going to get change of direction. All this stuff is the

1571
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:39,360
foundation piece you need to get to when we actually do some speed and agility drills next year,

1572
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,560
or wherever we're going to get to, right? Like, which is going to be part of your plan.

1573
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:47,840
So those are all a bunch of examples. I would recommend doing a different one each day of those

1574
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:53,040
three. So it's Mondays, we're going to do med ball stuff. Cool. Wednesdays, it's going to be

1575
02:27:54,240 --> 02:28:00,960
pickleball. And then Fridays, we're going to do, you know, some, some, some jump stuff and some

1576
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:06,480
medicine ball horizontal throws. Like whatever the case is, maybe, or it can be jump rope. It's going

1577
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:13,200
to be hopscotch, you know, things like that. Some, I'm not against bounding broad jumps.

1578
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:17,840
I typically want to start here two on two. So two leg leave, two leg land for this person,

1579
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:22,080
but they can be, you don't have to be forward. They can be lateral jumps. They can be combinations.

1580
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:28,160
They can be all kinds of things. You honestly be surprised. Like I want to say this too loud in

1581
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:34,320
case somebody hears, but that stuff's actually kind of fun. Like it's pretty fun. You're going to

1582
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:40,080
get a lot of giggles. Like I haven't jumped like this. Yeah. Like it's like, they're going to feel

1583
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:45,840
weird and it's going to be way different than what they're thinking. This is like training

1584
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:51,760
thing is like you'll get some giggles. So that would be my, that's your opener. That's 10 to 15

1585
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:57,120
minutes. Okay. Now we're hot. Now we're ready. Okay. Now we're going to move into a strength

1586
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:01,520
training. And so what I would still do is keep the same structure, total body on all three days,

1587
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:06,080
because here's what's also going to happen. Once a month, you're going to miss one of those days

1588
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:11,440
for more. Your kid's going to get sick. I got too busy at work. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1589
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:16,960
If you do body parts splits, you'll start missing all day. You're going to miss chunks. So I like,

1590
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:21,200
in these situations, these people, I want whole body every day. You're going to recover just fine.

1591
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:28,560
I would do a different rep range. So I would do something like Monday is going to be say three

1592
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:36,000
to four sets of five to seven reps. You're going to be able to go heavier. You're going to have a

1593
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:45,040
minute and a half rest between each one. Wednesday. What RPE do you do there? Seven to eight. Okay.

1594
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:50,480
So meaning just for folks listening at the end of that, you're finishing with maybe two reps left

1595
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:59,920
in the tank. Yep. Yep. Like I want to like for the working sets. For Wednesday, let's go 15 to

1596
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:06,000
20 reps per set. Right. So now you're actually going to have less, you're probably going to

1597
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,880
drive less soreness because you're activating probably less faster drivers. You're going to

1598
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:16,400
get more of a pump. You can actually like push the repetitions and you can work harder and probably

1599
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:21,120
get a little bit less sore and you'll feel more of an acute satisfaction for a lot of people. Right.

1600
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:27,760
Like you feel the feeling in your wrist has gone down a little bit. And then the third day,

1601
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:36,080
you could go really wild and you could do something like isometrics where you're just holding

1602
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:42,560
positions. Very good for joint, very good for connective tissue and very good for just doing

1603
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:46,560
something different. All three of these are equally effective for hypertrophy. So your gains

1604
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:50,880
and muscle size are going to be identical across the board. And now you've introduced three different

1605
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:56,000
elements. Let's talk a little bit about isometric. I'm now going to deviate from my patient into back

1606
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:02,160
to being Peter and interviewing. We didn't talk about it, but everybody's probably heard of an

1607
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:07,360
isometric. It's force generation or muscle contraction without movement. Big part of my

1608
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:15,360
recovery from shoulder surgery. I had a labral repair a while ago and this was the first thing

1609
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:26,320
I was permitted to do was begin humoral extension inflection without movement. And interestingly,

1610
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:31,760
I hadn't really spent much time doing isometrics outside of that with a few exceptions. There were

1611
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:37,440
some dedicated a lot of isometric deadlifts I was using as a precursor to deadlifting, just a great

1612
02:31:37,440 --> 02:31:43,920
way to sort of warm up. But I don't think I was actually aware that isometric training could

1613
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:49,280
generate or elicit the same hypertrophy response as isotonic or movement based contraction.

1614
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:57,680
Why is that the case? How does one know where to be in the range? So for example,

1615
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:04,960
if I do a bicep curl, I can get every range of the bicep. But do I know if there's an isometric

1616
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:12,560
benefit to being here versus here versus here? Yeah. So are you 10% flexion, 30% flexion,

1617
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:19,600
110% flexion? I have so much to say on this one. We're good for two and a half,

1618
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:26,640
three, we go into the three hours. I will say this, we're clearly going to do a part two of

1619
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:36,240
this podcast. So we'll think. There's a whole show on this area because of this. So you actually

1620
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:43,120
sort of invertedly asked what's actually driving muscle hypertrophy. And it's not the workout per

1621
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:48,480
se, it's the stimuli, right? So then what are those stimuli? That's a whole conversation. And the

1622
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:54,560
reason hypertrophy is training wise in terms of what reps to do, what type of exercise I consider

1623
02:32:54,640 --> 02:33:00,160
to be the least scientific interesting is because it takes the least precision. Because the mechanisms

1624
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:06,080
are so spread across different areas, that it's sort of like you can go from A, B, or C. You don't

1625
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:11,120
have to have all three, you can also have A and B, or you can have A and C, or you're going to get

1626
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:18,480
there. The muscle is very much listening to that signal. It's not so much for other things. And so

1627
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:24,560
it's very easy to kind of land accidentally in hypertrophy range, as long as a couple of things

1628
02:33:24,560 --> 02:33:31,440
happen. As long as sufficient overload occurs, like you're going to get there. So this overload

1629
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:37,280
can happen over time. It doesn't even matter how you achieve the overload, more volume, more reps

1630
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:42,880
per set, more weight, extra range of motion, like all these things are different strategies for

1631
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:49,040
progression. And if that happens, you're going to be in a pretty good spot. So barring the

1632
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:53,040
mechanism session is we're just going to get so far down the road here, we're never going to come

1633
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:58,400
back and answer your patient question. But that's one thing to think about. So isometrics,

1634
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:04,480
the shorter answer is they're going to be activating a number of those same mechanisms.

1635
02:34:04,480 --> 02:34:08,240
So you're going to cause the same amount of hypertrophy. Where do I be in that range of

1636
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:10,880
motion? Well, there's no answer there. This is the primary downside.

1637
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:11,920
Presumably.

1638
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:18,000
Certainly mix it up. In general, muscles respond best to being at the highest stretch.

1639
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:23,600
So if you can have that thing at the highest level of extension generally, but it kind of

1640
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:28,640
depends on the muscle, you're going to generate that you're putting more effect. You can actually

1641
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:33,600
take a muscle fiber and hang it vertically and hang a weight at the end of it, and it will grow.

1642
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:41,520
So being stretched that long is a very strong signal to grow. And so when you generally train

1643
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:46,400
a muscle over a large range of motion, you're putting the muscle on a larger stretch. And so

1644
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:54,080
that signal alone activates that whole anabolic cascade for hypertrophy. So my default, if you're

1645
02:34:54,080 --> 02:35:00,400
going to do an isometric is to do it closer to the end range of motion of, of where it feels the

1646
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:06,000
most tight, if you will, not the finished position, but it very much depends on what,

1647
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:13,200
what you're after, because the thing that gets tricky here is many muscles are single joint.

1648
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:17,120
And so if you look at the soleus, as we talked about earlier, that crosses the ankle joint only.

1649
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:22,640
But if you look at things like the gastroc, it crosses the knee and ankle joint. So putting the,

1650
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:27,520
the, the soleus in the right position is only dependent upon the ankle, but in the gastroc,

1651
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:31,920
the right position is dependent upon the ankle and the knee. And so if the knee is flexed,

1652
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:37,840
you're never going to get the, the gastroc to contract properly. You can't get a full contraction

1653
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:41,520
of the gastroc and reflects knee. You have to have an extended knee and extended ankle,

1654
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:46,160
because it's going to just get short on one end of that spectrum. And same thing happens with

1655
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:53,360
So translation, a seated calf raise only works the soleus, a standing calf raise works both

1656
02:35:53,360 --> 02:36:00,000
gastroc and soleus. Correct. The same thing with like a tricep push down versus an overhead tricep

1657
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:05,040
extension behind neck, right? Now you're talking to triceps muscles across the shoulder joint

1658
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:09,680
are not going to be put on stretch when you go behind the neck. And so that's why I recently

1659
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:17,680
saw a study that looked at tricep extension in a flexed versus extended humoral position. And

1660
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:23,920
the difference in muscle mass was significant when the arm was up, when the humerus was flexed.

1661
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:31,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. We see this at the hamstrings. We see this at the glutes,

1662
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:37,440
like muscles like to be put on stretch. Well, they don't like it, but they respond to it. Yeah.

1663
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:43,280
You get the better, you get the better compensation. Now that changes in a situation like what you were

1664
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:48,480
dealing with because like example I use oftentimes, like imagine somebody who's kind of

1665
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:53,200
getting like a nagging elbow pain. They're like, man, like every time I do a lot of bicep curls,

1666
02:36:53,200 --> 02:37:00,000
this stuff, my elbow just gets me like, Oh, okay, great. Hmm. Can we actually train the biceps

1667
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:06,080
without aggravating the elbow? Hard to do because no matter which break your radialis,

1668
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:10,240
my sister's break, like they're all going to cross the elbows. What if that's a nagging shoulder

1669
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:15,840
problem? Aha. Well now if we do like a preacher curl, which is when your arms out in front of you,

1670
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:20,640
you're shortening the biceps part that crossed the shoulder joint and you can still work across

1671
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:25,280
the elbow joint and it will not aggravate your shoulder. If you were to do like an incline curl

1672
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:28,880
where your shoulder and arm was behind you, you're putting it on stretch across your shoulder joint.

1673
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:33,840
Now those bicep curls are going to aggravate your shoulder, like theoretically. So going back to

1674
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:39,840
isometric question, it depends on your specific surgery and whoever you're obviously talented

1675
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:44,320
therapist or whoever was running that had you on, I'm sure they were putting you in a position

1676
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:50,160
to get a little bit of activation in the joint that they wanted, but not actually aggravate

1677
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:55,920
and let the thing recover. So that that's the angle you pick is dependent upon a number of factors.

1678
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:59,920
It could be sports specific. So if you take the case of like a power lifter,

1679
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:05,760
like you may just want to train in your final position of your squat and get very used to being

1680
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:11,360
strong there, going extra depth is only just going to make you worse as a lifter because you're now

1681
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:16,240
traveling further distance and you got to do more work. So there's no easy answer. That's one of the

1682
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:21,680
reasons why we generally frown on isometrics is they just take a lot of intention where if I

1683
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:26,960
generally just say do a normal full range squat, then you don't have to guess. So if you were,

1684
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:32,880
but if you had an athlete who said, look, even at this stage, I'm really willing to do a little bit

1685
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:40,400
of isometric. Let's say using the squat as an example, you're going to load the bar in a low

1686
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:45,520
position. They're going to stand under a weight that is much heavier than that they could ever

1687
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:49,440
lift and basically push up against the bar. I mean, how are you doing an isometric squat, for example?

1688
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:55,760
So you can do this in a number of ways. So you can do a bench, you can do squat. So typically what

1689
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:59,280
we'll do is you'll put the barbell in the rack. And so you can imagine like a squat.

1690
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:01,360
But when you raise the arms of the rack, yep.

1691
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:05,920
Yep. And you have safety pins that run horizontal or perpendicular to the ground, right?

1692
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:11,760
So instead of putting the bar on top of those, you put the bar below them. And so you just lift up

1693
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:16,960
against the rack and nothing moves. So you can set your position, whether you're putting it behind

1694
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:21,280
your neck, the squat, whether you're putting a bench below it, and you just push up on those.

1695
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:25,760
We actually have these built in the lab and on the bottom is a force plate. And those allows us to do

1696
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:29,760
an exercise or movement called... Yeah. So that's how you can tell how heavy they're pushing.

1697
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:35,360
Right. And so we can measure force produced into the ground at various positions.

1698
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:40,800
Does isometric offer any other advantage over safety?

1699
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:47,840
Yeah. There's a ton of advantage to it. The advantage is you have less degrees of freedom,

1700
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:55,200
less moving parts. So if I get you in a position, say in a squat, and your spine looks good,

1701
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:58,960
and everything looks good, there's a very low likelihood you're going to get out of position.

1702
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:03,440
If I ask you to do a... the back squat is extraordinarily complicated.

1703
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,600
There's a lot of moving parts. We have degrees of freedom at the ankle, knee, hip, low back, ribs,

1704
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:16,560
shoulder, neck. And an isometric, nothing moves. All we have to do with is compression.

1705
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:22,720
Sometimes compression is aggravating, axial loading being specific, but axial loading is also

1706
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:27,120
fantastic for moment of mention. So the reason I threw isometric in for our client, kind of

1707
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:32,160
running back to us, you were talking about... You mentioned that as one of the problems. It's like,

1708
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:37,520
okay, great. We know we can smash actually on these people with very low risk and get a lot of

1709
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:41,680
stimuli there and not have to worry about getting in position at different parts. And we have this

1710
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:47,520
thing called the strength curve. When we do a typical isoponic movement, so same with like a

1711
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:53,120
normal lift of a normal dumbbell or something. You're only going to be challenged in the areas

1712
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:59,360
in the range of motion where you're the weakest. So if you look at our study on lifting with bands,

1713
02:40:59,360 --> 02:41:06,480
like heavy bands from a deadlift, you're going to lift at the very, very bottom and you're going

1714
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:09,920
to have very low load. In fact, like you could have as much as a 40% reduction in load at the

1715
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:15,040
bottom, but when you come up and you start crossing the knee joint and you start gaining mechanical

1716
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:20,720
advantage, it becomes extraordinarily easy, but the bands start getting heavier. And so the actual

1717
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:24,880
tenicity that happens without the entire thing is fairly equal, if not, well certainly greater at

1718
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:29,680
the top. So you can train that whole area of the strength curve with things like this is why people

1719
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:36,080
use bands and chains and things like that is to be able to produce more resistance in areas where

1720
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:42,560
they're stronger and they're not being held back by the weakest position that they're in. To wrap

1721
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:46,400
that up, then you can actually then train that. So then you can go into that weakest position and

1722
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:52,480
do an isometric in that weak position without having to put a whole bunch of load on your body

1723
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:58,320
like you would need to get. Getting to and from it. Yeah. Right. So it's nice because with people

1724
02:41:58,320 --> 02:42:04,160
like this, you could put her in like an RDL position, like a hinge position, which is a kind

1725
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:08,720
of a complicated movement and just be like grab and pull and nothing moves and they can pull as

1726
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:13,520
freely and as hard as they want. It's very difficult for people with a low training age

1727
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:20,080
to truly express maximum force output on a free range motion because there's too many variables

1728
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:26,160
and in the right position is my back safe. Am I losing my balance? If I just say grab this par,

1729
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:30,960
pull on this bar as hard as you possibly can and nothing's going to move, people can just go. So

1730
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:35,520
walk me through how you do that for an RDL, for example, you're going to do kettlebell, dumbbell,

1731
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:41,760
barbell, RDL. Barbell. Barbell. Yep. Set the barbell in the squat rack, put it underneath

1732
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:47,920
and set the height of those safety pins to whatever height feels comfortable for you.

1733
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:52,640
And so you'll then get in there and do that RDL and you'll pull up against that bar and nothing

1734
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:57,280
will move and your back will feel comfortable wherever that range of motion is for you.

1735
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:01,120
Your glutes can be there. Your feet can be in the right position. We get total foot,

1736
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:04,080
big toe activation. You're doing this two foot down.

1737
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:10,960
Yeah, you do one like it, but you would most likely start the same two footed. Just to develop

1738
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:17,840
for this person. In this goal, we're trying to let them express peak force output and feeling

1739
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:20,800
comfortable. And how long do they need to stay in that isometric position?

1740
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:28,240
Three seconds to, some of the times with our athletes, we'll go up to five minute isometric

1741
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:35,120
holds. Up to what? How much? Five minutes. You can do like, we'll do rear foot,

1742
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:39,280
elevated split squat, hold isometric hold from up to five minutes,

1743
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:47,520
which presents a tremendous neurological challenge. Yeah. Yeah. I'm generally up for

1744
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:52,080
things that are ridiculous. I don't know that I could do it isometric hold for five minutes.

1745
02:43:52,560 --> 02:43:58,160
Yeah. You've probably done like, you've ever done like super high volume lunges or split squats,

1746
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:02,400
like hundreds. Yeah. Like I did a four minute set of split squats the other day.

1747
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:06,960
Yeah. Okay. So just get into that position for your foot, elevated just a little bit.

1748
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:12,880
And just hold it for two minutes to see. It's a fun task. You'll enjoy it.

1749
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:17,680
Yeah. No, I'm sure I will. What are they, where are you creating the resistance for them? You're

1750
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:22,000
just, again, same thing, bar over shoulder. In that particular scenario, you don't need any.

1751
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:26,080
I see. Time will be your resistance. Oh, in other words, it's isometric only in that you're

1752
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:31,600
just holding a position. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Because you're holding, it's like doing a wall

1753
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:36,880
squat. It's like a better version of the wall squat. So you can go for a long time. So to kind

1754
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:41,760
of come back here, you're replacing here. That's what's interesting. Yeah, this is interesting

1755
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:46,640
because I never, so I can really see now how you could create a full day of isometrics. It's

1756
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:52,480
if that's, if you want it to go down that rabbit hole, it's easy that one of those days is purely

1757
02:44:52,480 --> 02:45:01,440
isometric. Oh, yeah. I mean, in this situation too, even holding, not that I'm, you could hold a plank.

1758
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:05,040
Yeah. That is an isometric exercise, right? It's the one that people love.

1759
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:13,920
Holding a hip extension position and just making sure you can actually continue to have your glutes

1760
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:19,280
on utilize. You mentioned the squat earlier. So you can do this in a couple of ways. You can

1761
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:24,880
actually go all the way down and truly hold that bottom position. That is challenging though,

1762
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:31,760
if people don't have the right position. If you do, it's a, or you can close, it's a great way

1763
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:36,720
to build it. So I wouldn't be opposed to that if they're close and doing, okay, 30 seconds,

1764
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:42,720
but here's the difference. I would cap that as failure, not when they quit or get fatigued,

1765
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:45,520
but when they break position. Yeah. When their form changes, that's exactly right. Yeah. We,

1766
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:51,600
this is one of the tests we do with our patients and the, the, the, the excellent grade is two

1767
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:59,680
minutes in a full 90 degree squat. 90 degree. Yeah. Or no, better than 90, lower than 90,

1768
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:06,000
right? So like parallel, thigh parallel squat. Sorry. So why is like parallel? That's just the

1769
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:12,160
standard we picked and, but the failure, as you said, if you, you know, the goal is two minutes,

1770
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:18,480
can you go two minutes and you, you fail not when you give up, you fail when you basically

1771
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:24,960
shoot your butt out, lunge forward, you know, make a compensatory movement that is beyond that.

1772
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:29,280
Yeah. But we use that as a really nice, we use that as a great test of strength without having to

1773
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:36,800
put people at risk. Totally. Yep. Yep. So you could, you could easily generate that day. You can also do,

1774
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:42,640
so one of the things we haven't talked about yet is it's important that you're moving in multiple

1775
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:47,280
planes. And so there's, there's three major planes of movement, which is frontal, sagittal,

1776
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:51,520
and transverse, right? Which basically means you need to be moving like up and down, like a squat,

1777
02:46:52,320 --> 02:46:56,240
or you need to be moving things away to you and towards you like a bench press.

1778
02:46:56,800 --> 02:47:01,440
And you also need to be moving things laterally. So like a lateral lung, as well as twisting and

1779
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:06,000
rotation. And so you want to pick a few things in these areas. The other thing you want to keep in

1780
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:14,080
mind is single leg versus either split stance or unilateral. And so there's no perfect number you

1781
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:18,320
have to hit here, but you would want to select something across those three days where you're

1782
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:23,520
not doing everything is two foot supported. So you mentioned one footed already else, you could do

1783
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:28,880
step ups, you can do split squats, you can do rear foot elevated split squats. There's a single leg

1784
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:33,120
press, single leg extension. There's just a lot of ways you can do that. So you'd want to keep kind

1785
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:37,440
of an eye. I'm not going like, all right, it's everything I'm using barbell and everything I'm

1786
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:41,680
using to like, okay, maybe that's not a deal. So maybe I'm going to use a kettlebell over here,

1787
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:48,000
because I can actually do this. This is moving over here with the rotation or press. Okay,

1788
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:51,200
great. But now I'm going to pick dumbbell for this movement and this movement over here,

1789
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:57,120
I'll use a machine. Lovely, great. And now you're in a really, really nice position where you're not

1790
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:01,440
getting held back so much by technical demands. This person is only six months in a train.

1791
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:06,640
You don't want their whole day being learning how to do a movement. And then boom, that 60 minutes

1792
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:10,480
goes down. But you also don't want to be like, well, these are too hard to let's just stay on

1793
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:14,800
machines the whole time. That's right. Like, it's not a long term investment, right? So we want to

1794
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:22,800
invest a little bit in growth. You know, 20%, 60% isn't what you need to be here. 20% long term

1795
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:29,440
development. 20 other percent is fun. Like, that's how we generally think about that 60-20-20 split.

1796
02:48:30,400 --> 02:48:34,400
So that's how we split it. So the last piece here to wrap this thing up is I would finish every

1797
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:42,960
session with something that either gets close to a max heart rate or is a personal pain point.

1798
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:52,720
So this is where I always close off with Katsu and there's some intense pain. But my last thing

1799
02:48:52,720 --> 02:48:59,520
is always two minutes of BFR on the air bike, which combines two beautiful personal pieces of pain.

1800
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:06,800
Yeah. So it is, what's the thing that they love to hate? What's the area that they want to grow?

1801
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:12,400
They hate their triceps. Okay, great. Like we're going to finish the session with a tricep blast.

1802
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:16,880
We're just going to smash it. They did just feel like, yep, okay, I got the thing done. One thing

1803
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:21,920
people hate is when they're not listened to. And when they come in, they're like, I want to get my

1804
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:27,040
glutes in to get stronger or whatever. And you're just like, they're working them, but they're not.

1805
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:35,040
So it's the double down concentrate on that. Yeah. And it's one little session. It could be whatever.

1806
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:40,960
We used to do this on Saturdays with the NFL players because Saturdays were mostly a recovery

1807
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:46,000
regeneration day, which means they would never show up. And so it was like, hey, Saturdays are

1808
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:51,040
a gun show. We're doing nothing but biceps and triceps. Like we would just do, and we would put

1809
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:56,080
who showed up to you pick one, you pick one, you pick one, you pick a tricep. Like everyone got to

1810
02:49:56,080 --> 02:50:00,560
pick one and we just do these ridiculous made up circuits, just like things. And then it would all

1811
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:03,760
just get super pumped in their arms. And it was like, all right, now go to your 45 minutes,

1812
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:07,840
go see your PT, go see your athletic trainer. And like, yeah, you're working on it. So like,

1813
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:11,440
people are people. Give them a little bit of what they want.

1814
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:16,880
And just make sure in one of those days we touch high heart rate, one way or the other.

1815
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:22,800
And when you touch high heart rate, a classic way that one might do this would be a Tabata type

1816
02:50:22,800 --> 02:50:28,400
exercise where it's basically four minutes of, you know, intense work. What are some, what are

1817
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:31,520
some ways that you might recommend getting high heart rate in there? Do you do it? Do you want to

1818
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:36,080
do it with jumping? Do you want to do it on a bike, on a rowing machine? What do you like to use?

1819
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:42,720
We typically want to keep away from eccentrics. So, you know, I don't love, this is where CrossFit

1820
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:46,960
is done very poorly, right? It's just like you're putting your in a position of fatigue in very

1821
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:53,520
risky situations at a lot of times, right? So something that's for this individual,

1822
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:57,120
again, I'm going to clarify that comment was regarding this individual, he's probably not a

1823
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:03,280
great thing. Like, rather individuals, it's fantastic. You should totally do it. Yeah,

1824
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:08,720
air bikes are fine, rowers are fine here. If you really want to, you can actually do specific

1825
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:14,720
breath hold manipulation. So if you just alter breathing, so this is CO2 tolerance, CO2 can get

1826
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:21,600
very, very high. You can deal with the suck without doing any physical work. This is all the stuff

1827
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:27,360
we've done at XPT Live in the pool. You know, we've done like you can do a lot of stuff with

1828
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:32,560
with weights underwater and just changing what you're doing with ventilation. And you can get to

1829
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:37,040
a level of pain very quickly that requires very little physical trauma. So, you know,

1830
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:42,800
there are lots of ways we can play that. Simple examples would be do a 10 second sprint on the

1831
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:50,000
bike and then go into a breath hold. Like you want to see your heart rate shoot up incredibly fast.

1832
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:53,200
And then you're going to come back out of that. You've got 30 seconds, but you're going to go

1833
02:51:53,200 --> 02:52:01,200
nasal only recovery breath. How long breath hold, by the way? Well, you're going to see the goal is

1834
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:09,200
max. Okay. In other words, yeah. So go 10 seconds all out breath hold until failure. 30 second

1835
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:16,880
recovery nasal only. How many rounds of that? Let's see if you can get three. Okay. Like one

1836
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:20,880
might be the answer though. Like you might go like I'm not even close ready to do this again.

1837
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:26,160
Two might be there. You can also do that inhale hold prior to the sprint. So you can do an inhale

1838
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:33,600
hold breath in hold and then hit that sprint. Yeah. I mean, there's just a ton

1839
02:52:35,120 --> 02:52:39,840
of ways you can get to playing with CO2 tolerance, if that's part of the equation. And again, you'll

1840
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:44,880
see your heart rate get up to damn near maximum. That doesn't require much physical work. So if

1841
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:49,600
you need to spare joints, you can do spare soreness, you can do spare energy, but you want to get that

1842
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:57,360
signal soon. There's lots of tricks that way you can play. So Andy and listeners, I think we have

1843
02:52:57,360 --> 02:53:01,760
some really bad news and some really good news. The really bad news is we've probably been talking

1844
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:08,480
for three hours and I think. We've got one case study. Yeah, we've got one case study done and

1845
02:53:08,480 --> 02:53:13,920
we haven't talked about a ton of physiology that I had in my 10 pages of notes here. What's really

1846
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:21,520
sad is I had 10 pages of single space notes that I wanted to talk about and we got into the first,

1847
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:28,320
I'm not being facetious, we got into the first half of the first page, at which point I threw it

1848
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:34,640
over and totally rerouted everything we were going to talk about based on your answer. And we have

1849
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:40,960
nine and a half pages of notes plus a whole bunch of questions that we got that we didn't get to here.

1850
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:46,800
So the bad news is there's zero chance we're going to finish this podcast now. The good news is I hope

1851
02:53:46,800 --> 02:53:52,800
you will come back and we can do this again relatively soon so that listeners can have a part

1852
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:58,720
two of this discussion, hopefully within a month or two months of part one. Is that something you're,

1853
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:03,600
I'm going to put you on the spot and ask you this, you're willing to give us another episode here?

1854
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:09,280
Well, I think we can. I'll talk to you. People talk to my people and then we'll figure it out.

1855
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:15,760
All right. Andy, this has been super interesting. I literally will be putting a few of these things

1856
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:21,440
into practice tomorrow for me in the gym. And if I'm putting things into practice that are in just the

1857
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:27,120
purview of the guy who's never exercised, I can't wait to get into kind of more my phenotype,

1858
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:30,800
which is, hey, I do exercise, but how do I take it to the next level?

1859
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:37,280
Yeah, there's a lot of interesting things we can do when we get to that fun conversation.

1860
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Everything from like, if you want to see behind the veil of professional athletes, you want to see

1861
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,720
what they really do for sleep. You want to see if they really do for nutrition. You want to see if

1862
02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:50,240
they really do for training. We can go down that route too. Yeah. Well, Andy, this has been amazing.

1863
02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:56,880
Thank you very much for your time, your expertise, and I'll see you again in hopefully a month or

1864
02:54:56,880 --> 02:55:00,080
two. That was good, man. Thank you. All right.

1865
02:55:07,280 --> 02:55:14,080
Bye.
