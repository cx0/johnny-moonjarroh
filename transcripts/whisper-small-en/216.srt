1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,360
Hey, Josh. Great to see you again. It's been, I don't know, I was trying to think about

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,840
this the other day. It was about three years ago, I think was the last time we saw each

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,280
other in person at that, some sort of conference in New York, a cancer metabolism conference,

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,200
I think, right? Oh, yeah. The New York Academy of Sciences,

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:35,840
I think. Yeah, it was great. And we somehow wound up at some kind of mediocre bar in Brooklyn. And

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,520
it might have been the dorkiest concentration of people talking about autophagy and metabolomics

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,400
and all sorts of things. Oh, yeah, yeah, that was actually the ACR Brooklyn conference. That's true.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,520
Well, you know, it's really funny, just recently, I've interviewed a few of our classmates from

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,480
med school, Max Dean and Karl Deseroth. And I think Karl and I were reminiscing about how you,

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,520
me and Karl all started our surgical rotation together in the same day. And I, it's almost 25

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,800
years ago, and I remember it like it was yesterday when we were all sitting in the room practicing

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,840
sewing with our big goofy knots and things like that before we all got divided up into our

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,680
surgical rotations. Do you remember that? I definitely remember you. I really do not

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,080
remember Karl from those days, but I certainly remember you practicing a lot while I looked

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,480
and said, oh, I guess that's what you're supposed to be doing if you want to become a surgeon. The

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,680
thing I remember most clearly is being in surgery with you. And it was like the very end of surgery

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:47,640
rotation. And finally being given the bovee and immediately making a mistake. And, you know,

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,200
then I got the nice lecture, you know, we're happy to pass you on this rotation as long as

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,880
you promise never to use, you know, a knife or bovee again. So, so remind me, whose lab did you

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,680
do your PhD in? I did my PhD with Hardin McConnell, one of the great physical chemists together with

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,800
Mark Davis, the immunologist. And so tell me and tell the listeners a little bit about what project

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,960
you worked on for your thesis. My thesis was about the physical chemistry of T cell activation.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:27,560
And so at that point in time, people had discovered that different antigens could activate T cells

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,600
differentially. And so I was really interested in how that happened. And so I studied the process

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,320
of antigens turning into peptides that could bind to MHC and then how the kinetics of the interaction

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,760
between the peptide antigen and the major histocompatibility complex protein MHC.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,000
And then the interaction of that complex with the T cell receptor determined whether people

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,840
have productive or failed immune responses with the hopes you could then manipulate those processes

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,000
to promote better vaccination or disease clearance and also to potentially treat autoimmunity.

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,160
And did you also have an interest at all in cancer? Because of course, this would be one of

31
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,880
the hallmarks of how immunotherapy would be effective in eradicating cancer.

32
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,880
Shows how bad a prognosticator I am. At that point, I really felt that immunological

33
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,480
prosciutistic cancer didn't hold that much promise. And so I was really more focused on

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,960
infectious disease and autoimmunity. So shows you what I know. It's wonderful to say that the world

35
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,240
has turned out to be a lot better than I dreamed it would be on that dimension.

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,880
No, but it's such an interesting topic. I had Steve Rosenberg on the podcast last year,

37
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,840
and it was just a beautiful and fun recap of how the immune system works in general. But we were

38
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,800
talking about it obviously through the lens of cancer. And I think the part that will forever

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,000
humble anyone who tries to think about how amazing the system is, is that these things have to be,

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,920
you know, 9 to 11 amino acids long. I mean, the peptides have to be just the right size

41
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,960
to be presented and then to be recognized. And that just doesn't seem to leave a lot of

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,000
margin for error. I mean, it is really a tuned system. Do you have a sense of why evolution

43
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,080
ended up with such a narrow fragment of peptides that were recognizable,

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,600
as opposed to a broader range or as opposed to just a range that's different? Like why wasn't it

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,960
two to three or 150 to 160 amino acids? Like, is there a chemical reason? Because of your

46
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,960
background in chemistry, I feel like you'd be more equipped to offer a teleologic explanation

47
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,280
for this. Yeah. I mean, I do have an intuitive sense on this that, you know, our bodies work on

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:54,440
the scale of, you know, billions of immune cells and billions of immune receptors that are made

49
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,680
through recombination. And that naturally pairs with billions of antigens. And so you just think

50
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,000
about this number nine and you think about the number of amino acids, right? There are 20 amino

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
acids. So you're talking about 20 to the ninth power of presentable peptide antigens. And so

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,880
these things are all tuned to be on the same scale, this kind of scale of billions and-

53
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,320
Tens of billions in that case, yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So if you did it, if it was like a three peptide,

54
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,520
it's really a small number actually. There's not enough information there to,

55
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:35,160
you know, selectively respond to a virus, you know, or a bacteria. And if it was 25 peptides,

56
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:44,120
it's too much. There's too much information there. There's extra information anyway. And this system,

57
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,400
I think, was built to work on minimal or just the right amount of information. Yeah. That's super

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:00,040
interesting. So at what point during either your PhD or the end of medical school where we met up

59
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,280
in the clinical portion, did you make the decision that you wanted to be a full-time scientist as

60
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:15,000
opposed to a physician scientist? You know, I applied to do an internship knowing that I really

61
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:24,760
loved research, but I guess I decided as I did more and more medicine that medicine is such a

62
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,240
noble profession, but it involves a lot of doing the same thing right over and over again,

63
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,120
a lot of following the standard of care, even for the most creative physicians, and that ultimately,

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,120
like my passion is to come in and try to do something different every day to think differently

65
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,440
than people ever have before. And so that's what really led me to research. I love the patient

66
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,960
interaction part of medicine. It was the doing things right part that was challenging for me

67
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,160
sometimes. Yeah. No, I think those of us that chose the more medical side of things can also

68
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,640
speak to the frustration of how creativity can often be stifled in medicine. And that's

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,800
in large part for good reason, but I think it comes at a cost as well. And I think I'm sure

70
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,520
on this podcast I've told stories about how frustrating that was in surgery, at least surgery,

71
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:24,280
probably more so than most other disciplines tends to sometimes at least frown upon creativity and

72
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:32,440
novel approaches to problem solving. Now, if I remember correctly, before you joined the faculty

73
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,160
at Princeton where you are now, you went into industry straight from medical school. Am I

74
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,480
getting my facts right? Yeah. So I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with one of the

75
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:51,480
great early biotech entrepreneurs, Alex Zaffaroni. And so he and I started a company when I was

76
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,520
straight out of medical school that was focused on fast drug delivery. So what could you do by

77
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,240
being able to deliver medications non-invasively on the time scale of giving an IV push in the

78
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:10,680
hospital? And so we did that through inhalation of small molecules kind of building on the concept,

79
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,440
obviously, that if you smoke something like a cigarette, you get incredibly rapid access to

80
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,480
the systemic circulation. And so we built that company, Lexa Pharmaceuticals still exists,

81
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:31,640
has one FDA approved drug. So that was my first job. What drugs were you targeting with that?

82
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,480
You know, our initial focus was migraine. Unfortunately, we never found the drug that

83
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,480
had the perfect combination of safety with rapid delivery and efficacy for migraine. The drug that

84
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,640
ultimately got approved was for acute agitation. And so there's a set of hypnotic for acute

85
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,920
agitation. And I'd say it's really wonderful for the patients who get it. They come in in the ER.

86
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,280
Something people don't always know about agitated patients is like they're agitated, they're

87
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,960
frustrated, but they also want to stop being agitated. They don't want to act like that. And

88
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,160
so they're very eager to most cases to take a puff of something and calm down in a couple minutes.

89
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,720
It's wonderful for them. So this is kind of an unusual path, right? I'm guessing that most

90
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,640
people who experience that type of success that you had would want to keep doing it over and over

91
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,280
again. I mean, hence the term serial entrepreneur. What made you decide to take this lateral step to

92
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,560
go into academics, which would have made a lot more sense if you'd done it coming straight out of

93
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,280
your PhD. You know, I think I was lucky to get the chance to go straight from that job into a

94
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,480
faculty position at Princeton. That's a rare opportunity to have. Because you didn't do a

95
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,440
postdoc in there unless they considered your industry as sort of a grandfathered postdoc.

96
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:58,600
Yeah, it was a very, very weird version of a postdoc. And it united me with my wonderful wife

97
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,960
and at Princeton on the faculty here and turned out well.

98
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,000
So you show up at Princeton and they put you on a tenure track position,

99
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,960
which means they're giving you the types of resources to now start solving whatever

100
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,440
problem you want. What was the first problem that you said, I want to build a lab around?

101
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:26,360
You know, one thing that I learned actually doing Alexa was about drugs because we studied

102
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,320
every medication in the pharmacopoeia for whether it could be a candidate for rapid delivery. Could

103
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,920
you make a benefit by delivering it rapidly? And one thing I noticed is that so many of the most

104
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,760
important medications work via metabolism. And then starting out my lab, I realized that there

105
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,960
were relatively few labs looking at metabolism broadly compared to other, you know, really

106
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:55,000
important areas of science like immunology or cancer or neuroscience. And so I started my lab

107
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,040
with a really simple question. Could we measure the classic metabolites that you read about in a

108
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:07,320
biochemistry textbook in one shot quantitatively? And so that was the starting point for my lab.

109
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,760
And I guess the second question that we always had in our mind is can we measure

110
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,840
the activities of those metabolic pathways? So how fast are those metabolites flowing? Where

111
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,200
are they coming from and where are they going? I had lunch or dinner actually with one of our

112
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,840
mutual friends, Navdeep Chandel, who was also a previous guest on the podcast three or four years

113
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:36,440
ago, maybe a week ago. And he was here in Austin for a talk. And we were talking about how in the

114
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,240
late 90s he said, and he was obviously studying metabolism, he said if you were to rank me,

115
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,480
meaning Nav was ranking himself right, he said you were to rank me and my work.

116
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,280
Just across the spectrum of the stuff scientists were doing, he said I'm bottom 10 percentile.

117
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,720
You know, I mean, nobody found metabolism interesting. It was this was sort of the,

118
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,480
I forget the term he used, but like this was basically the corner where the kids went that

119
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,760
nobody wanted to play with. If you weren't doing genomics, if you weren't doing this other sexy

120
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:19,240
stuff, immunology, you were really an uninteresting person. But he just found that interesting. And of

121
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:27,560
course today, as we're going to discover, this is where the action is. So, you know, Nav was talking

122
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:34,840
about that in the 90s. We're now in the early 2000s. Was it still a little bit of that stigma

123
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,560
that Nav described that he was kind of under where he was like a totally underperforming,

124
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,880
you know, loser in his own words? Or was that transition already starting to happen where

125
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,440
people saw, wait a minute, there's something going on here?

126
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,440
You know, Nav was so funny. And I don't think anyone who's ever met Nav thinks he's a loser.

127
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,920
I'll say that right off the bat first. You know, but I will say that, you know,

128
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:08,040
metabolism as an area was definitely out of favor. And it was a really strange thing because

129
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,920
you had the academic current that metabolism was a solved problem, right? Krebs was, you know, the

130
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:23,720
culmination of metabolism research at the same time that metabolic syndrome was becoming worse

131
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,400
and worse and worse in the population. And I would say when I started, it was still not a real

132
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:36,920
popular topic, metabolism. But I think two things were beginning to shift. One is the fact that

133
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,200
people realized that, you know, genomics as a standalone was not going to solve health problems,

134
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,000
that it was really going to have to be supplemented by other technologies that looked at biochemistry

135
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,800
broadly. And metabolomics proved to be one of those that I think has been enduring, will be enduring.

136
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,040
And the second is that, you know, the metabolic syndrome epidemic just kept becoming more and more

137
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,120
obvious. Yeah. So this is kind of where your training as a physician becomes relevant because

138
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,440
perhaps more so than somebody who didn't spend four years also doing medical school,

139
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:19,000
you saw the clinical problem that was sort of kicking you in the face, even if it wasn't top

140
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,520
of mind to a scientist. Yeah, I think it's really true. You know, I just benefited so much from the

141
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,920
breadth of biology and medicine that you learn in medical school. And I mean, it allowed me to start

142
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,280
my lab working on bacteria, which I had never worked on at all as a PhD student because, you

143
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,000
know, you learn bacteriology is one of the things in medical school. And that was like the perfect

144
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,360
starting point for building these technologies with a view all the way to metabolic syndrome and

145
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,040
ischemia reperfusion injury, right? These huge medical problems. But I really wanted to start

146
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,880
somewhere tractable where we could get, you know, firm proof of concept. So for somebody listening

147
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,520
to this, which let's assume that they have a greater attention span than somebody you're going

148
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,440
to walk into at a cocktail party, but obviously not necessarily the depth of understanding of

149
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,400
everything we're about to go into. How would you explain metabolism to that person?

150
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:25,000
Metabolism is the process that converts the food we eat into usable energy and the building blocks

151
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,640
our body needs to grow or regenerate itself as well as waste along the way.

152
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,560
And so now how do you layer on the omic piece of that, which is really what we're starting to talk

153
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,480
about when people hear the word genomics, they sort of understand what that means. But I think

154
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,760
when people hear the term metabolomics, it becomes a little harder to understand. So how would you

155
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,400
now layer in that in the context of everything that you're now beginning in your lab?

156
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:00,120
Yeah. So, you know, the bulk of activity in metabolism that makes most of our usable energy

157
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,560
involves something like a hundred metabolites. And so the first thing we really wanted to be

158
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,760
able to do was measure those hundred metabolites really well. So tell people some examples of

159
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,080
those, Josh, because I mean, I think we take it for granted, but like glucose would be an example

160
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,960
of a metabolite. What are some other metabolites that are important to understand if you're trying

161
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,360
to study this system? Yeah. So all the amino acids are other fundamental inputs that we get from the

162
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,840
diet. Like glutamine is a great example. That's a very important circulating nutrient. Other things

163
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,280
that come in, you know, from the diet, if you have vinegar, you have acetate or else your microbiome

164
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,840
can make acetate that goes in the body. Fats are obviously important input metabolites. And then

165
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,720
there are sets of intermediary metabolites. These are things that are like glycolytic intermediates

166
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,640
that people may have heard about in biochemistry. Fructose bisphosphate is a famous one of those.

167
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:05,960
Pyruvate, lactate that a lot of people hear about from exercise. Members of the Krebs cycle,

168
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,400
like citrate is a famous one that exists in our circulation, obviously in citrus fruits.

169
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,320
So these are classic examples of metabolites. And then they're the kind of more effector or

170
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:25,160
energy holding metabolites like ATP, NADH, NADPH. Got it. So I kind of interrupted you there,

171
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,640
but you were kind of explaining how first you begin with sort of this survey of all of these

172
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,640
metabolites. Yeah. So we want to be able to measure all of these. These are kind of the core

173
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,200
components of metabolomics. And part of the beauty of metabolism as a system is that

174
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:51,240
with some modest variation, there's almost a singular solution on earth to how metabolism

175
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,560
works. And so when we learn to measure the metabolites in E. coli, at the same time,

176
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:04,920
we were really learning how to measure metabolites all the way up to human. And so there are these

177
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,160
basic components of protein and eclaic acids, basic intermediates like fructose bisphosphate

178
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,080
that exist at all of these levels. And if you survey relatively comprehensively, there's on the

179
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,000
order of a thousand of them that have clear biological function. So it's a big problem,

180
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but it's a problem on the scale of knowing all the kids who go to your high school,

181
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,200
not a problem of knowing everyone in the phone book in New York City. So it's a problem

182
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,800
that's right at this interface between the human scale and the computational scale.

183
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,360
So I wanted to ask you about that. You already kind of anticipated perhaps almost a question,

184
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,640
which is, do we think we have the complete solution set here? I mean, we clearly know

185
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,360
all of the amino acids. We clearly know all of the intermediate steps and intermediaries period

186
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,440
of the Krebs cycle. Do we think that that means we actually know every single

187
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,880
metabolomic element or is there a chance that there are others out there that we don't know

188
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:15,000
because we haven't looked for them or they're very short-lived, for example, and we haven't

189
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,520
stopped and looked at reactions closely enough or studied the kinetics hard enough. I mean,

190
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,800
this is almost a naive question in a way, but I've never actually thought about it until now.

191
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,400
Yeah, it's a great question. And we keep discovering new metabolites. So, you know,

192
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,240
groups around the world keep discovering new metabolites. I would say it's an interesting

193
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,600
yin and yang because there's this steady accumulation of new metabolites, but I don't

194
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:48,520
really think there's been a completely new and obviously important metabolite yet this century.

195
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,600
So I think at some level in terms of the metabolite finding part of the problem,

196
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,760
things were wrapping up around the time of Krebs, the most important part of the work anyway.

197
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:08,520
But in terms of undertowelinating how the system really works and how we can choose the right

198
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,560
diet to be healthy given our genotype, given the disease we're fighting, we haven't scratched the

199
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:20,760
surface yet. How many of these metabolites are really tightly regulated, a la glucose,

200
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,360
versus not that regulated at all? They can kind of fall to zero and they can,

201
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,000
meaning how many of these things can change by log orders all over the place and how many are

202
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,080
regulated so tightly that if you just fall a little bit out of that range, I mean, one of the

203
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,600
things I try to explain to people when I explain regulation and homeostasis is I love using pH as

204
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,080
an example because the pH spectrum runs from basically zero to 14, neutral being seven,

205
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,720
but anybody who's taking care of a patient in the hospital knows that 7.4 is where we live as

206
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,920
an organism, almost unsurvivable to have an acidosis that goes below seven or an alkalosis

207
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:15,560
that exceeds about 7.7. I mean, so for a system that runs basically zero to 14, the fact that we

208
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:24,280
can't as a species survive from outside of 7.6 or 7.7 talks about something that is so tightly

209
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,440
regulated. So in that field of metabolomics, which ones behave like pH and which ones don't?

210
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,080
Well, you know, pH is such a great example, right? And you have this giant logarithmic scale from

211
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:44,440
zero to 14, right? And so even when you talk about 7.1 to 7.4, you're talking about something

212
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,760
of a two to three fold change. It's about a three fold change in acid concentration. That's right.

213
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,120
And I think a lot of metabolites that are the important ones live typically in that two to

214
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:06,200
three fold range as being the preferred range. Some of them, there's a lot more active regulation

215
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,760
like glucose. Some of them, there's kind of relatively passive processes that tend to keep

216
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,960
them in that range. Then of course, there are all sorts of other metabolites that may be some cool

217
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,920
secondary metabolite that's made by a plant and some of us eat it, some of us don't eat that plant.

218
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,000
And so some of us may have a lot, some of us may have none. But for the big ones,

219
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,960
the biochemistry tech book ones, I think, you know, this kind of a few fold range in the bloodstream

220
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:41,960
is a common healthy place to be. Are there common and consistent tools that the body uses to

221
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,360
regulate? Are there principles that the body just adopts over and over and over again in the form of

222
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:53,400
this regulation? Yeah, I think there's one most important principle and that's when it's there,

223
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:00,760
use it up. And so, you know, in a physics speak, you could say this is a

224
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,360
linear consumption of circulating metabolites or in chemistry speak, people call this mass action,

225
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:16,280
just whatever mass is there, you tend to take it in. And so you eat a lot of what you eat after a

226
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:22,200
little bit of processing enters the bloodstream. And then it's the job of tissues that need these

227
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,360
ingredients to use them and use them at first blush in proportion to their availability in the

228
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:36,440
blood. Are there examples where that regulatory mechanism is not the preferred way to manage them?

229
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,640
Well, there's a lot of regulation layered over top of that in order to make the body work. And,

230
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,840
you know, the most important regulatory hormone in mammals, I'm pretty convinced is insulin.

231
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,560
Right. And, you know, there are two ways to look at insulin, I think. And there's the probably the

232
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:04,520
way that comes to mind first to you, which is insulin is a hormone that acts to control

233
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:13,640
elevations in blood sugar. And it does that at the highest level by promoting uptake of glucose

234
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:22,120
and preventing production of glucose. But there's an alternative way to look at insulin. And that's

235
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,920
that we've evolved mainly to be able to survive lack of nutrients. Okay. That this was the strong

236
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:39,640
selective pressure on animals and mammals and that storing fat is very precious. And that insulin

237
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:47,160
is a hormone that says you don't have to use fat right now. Okay. And so it senses that there's

238
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:55,880
enough carbohydrate around and therefore it's safe to not release free fat from your adipose tissue.

239
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,360
Does that mean that you think that an equally important role of insulin is not just the

240
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,280
disposal of glucose into muscle and the cessation of glucose production in the liver,

241
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:16,440
but you're saying it's equally important as a signal to stop lipolysis to keep your fat in its

242
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,200
fat stores. Meaning save this for a rainier day because you actually have the glucose here that

243
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm going to deal with. Yeah. That's certainly how I look at insulin right now. And I think

244
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:37,240
there's little doubt that, you know, biochemically and medically the suppression of lipolysis is a

245
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:44,280
primary, perhaps the primary, you know, function of insulin. So kind of going back to the broad

246
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,880
strokes of metabolomics, you alluded to it briefly without, I think using the term, but

247
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,440
what do we know about the flux of these things? Because when I think back to my, even my

248
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,600
biochemistry 25 years ago, you know, Stryer's textbook, which is, you know, the classic textbook,

249
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,240
at least it was then, I imagine it's one of them still today. We really studied it in a static way.

250
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,720
And I'm guessing that that's one of the first questions you went after, right? Which is what's

251
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,600
the movement? What are the derivatives with respect to time of all of these things? So

252
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,760
maybe expand a little bit on this idea of the of fluxomics.

253
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:38,440
Yeah. I mean, metabolism is a system in action. And I think this kind of static view of metabolism,

254
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,560
which is probably never a view that Stryer ever had in his mind, but that got codified in the

255
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:53,400
textbooks is one that killed metabolism in a way as a topic of excitement. And so, you know,

256
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,880
metabolites are intermediates in the process of converting what we eat into usable energy

257
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:08,280
and protein biomass and these things. And so they're really, you know, relatively low in abundance,

258
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,400
and they're flowing very, very fast. So they're completely different than parts of our body like

259
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,400
neurons that are going to sit there maybe for our entire lifetime. Okay. Here, the metabolites are

260
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,360
meant to be made and used somewhere on the time scale, depending on the metabolite of roughly a

261
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:32,920
second to, you know, roughly an hour maybe for metabolites in the bloodstream. And so all the

262
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,800
action is in the flow. And so it's really understanding where things are coming from,

263
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,720
where they're going, where we can learn about how metabolism works.

264
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,000
Let's again, just use glucose because one, it's ubiquitous, everybody gets it. It's

265
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,200
essential for life, but it also offers, I think, a beautiful portrait in velocity.

266
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,880
So I just had my blood drawn yesterday. I draw my blood about every two months. And

267
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,120
so, you know, tube of blood comes out and let's say my glucose on that, because that's a snapshot,

268
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,160
right? That's in that moment outcomes, five tubes of blood, and it's going to look for a whole bunch

269
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,440
of things. But one of them is glucose and my glucose, because I did a finger prick at the same

270
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,560
time, my glucose was 89 milligrams per deciliter. Can you explain to people what that actually

271
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,560
means? What does it mean that my glucose at that moment in time was 89 milligrams per deciliter?

272
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,240
Well, I'm sure you were smiling about it. That is like it's a super healthy blood glucose in

273
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,800
terms of a level. But when you think of that absolute amount of glucose, right, if you took

274
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,960
all the glucose in your bloodstream at that level, that's a few minutes of glucose or energy.

275
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,560
For the body, right. So yeah, it's probably four or five grams of total glucose. Exactly. Yeah.

276
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,520
20 calories worth. Exactly. So that has to be constantly replenished in order to feed

277
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,000
your brain and the other tissues like activated immune cells that depend on glucose.

278
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:14,680
Now, this is what to me is remarkable. If I had done that same test, Josh, and I had come back,

279
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,240
let's make the math easy and say it was 90. We'd still say, great, you're healthy. You're

280
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,000
fasting glucose is 90. Now let's say I had come back and it was 180 milligrams per deciliter,

281
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,600
my fasting glucose. There's a disease that I would immediately now know that I have that disease is

282
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,280
called type 2 diabetes. What's the absolute difference in the amount of glucose in my

283
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:44,360
bloodstream? It went from being 5 grams to 10 grams. Seems like a really trivial amount.

284
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:51,480
Why is it that the body in the person without diabetes seems to be able to keep it at, you know,

285
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,440
80 to 100 milligrams per deciliter overnight while you're fasting, but in a disease that's going to

286
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,720
more than double your risk of mortality and increase your risk of cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

287
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:11,400
cardiovascular disease. I mean, it's really a problem for your health. It's only doubling

288
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,720
the amount of glucose in there and it's still a relatively trivial amount that needs a constant,

289
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:23,480
constant update. How can we explain this delta of that seems so trivial in the absolute amount

290
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,880
that could be consumed in just an extra couple of minutes, but yet the steady state is still

291
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,440
off by this factor. What's going on? Why? Yeah. I mean, when you think about why is that a disease

292
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,160
problem with only a two-fold excursion, then you think that, right, the system has been built to

293
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,920
have about the most circulating glucose that you can have safely, right? And I think a lot of the

294
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:57,160
really important metabolites have been kind of pushed to the edge this way, right? And so we know

295
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,160
that there are deleterious, you know, protein modification reactions, like oscillation reactions

296
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,160
that occur when glucose gets above this point. So we kind of in evolution pushed right up to the

297
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,560
highest and non-problematic glucose. We didn't do that for a lot of other metabolites and that's

298
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,360
why there's not a lot of, you know, part of why there's not a lot of other diseases like diabetes.

299
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,840
So that's part of the answer is that, you know, evolution didn't build a lot of wiggle room for

300
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,720
your glucose to safely rise because having that, you know, good amount of glucose circulating is

301
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,200
really valuable, right? You know, every time your heart pumps, it's sending that amount of glucose

302
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,400
to tissues and that's productive. On the flip side, obviously, there's a broader set of

303
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:53,960
derangements in the body to produce this two-fold excursion in glucose, right? And so, you know,

304
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:01,000
this has to do with, you know, things going wrong in fat and fat handling and so that's part of this

305
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,400
whole metabolic syndrome that leads to the full set of downstream health consequences.

306
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:15,320
It's so interesting that the body doesn't just, again, I think this speaks to why the flux problem

307
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,800
is the more interesting problem than the static problem because if you just think about this

308
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:28,040
example in the static context, you would say, okay, well, at 704 and three seconds a.m.,

309
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:36,280
your blood sugar is 190, but three minutes later, if nothing changes, meaning if your liver doesn't

310
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:43,960
put too much glucose back into circulation, you'll be fine. So the problem is not that your blood

311
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:50,520
sugar is too high in that moment. The problem is the liver assumes, I mean, in part, that that's

312
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,360
the right level and it continues to do it because at that moment when you're not eating, that is the

313
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,080
only source by which glucose is getting into the bloodstream. So we're maintaining this elevated

314
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,240
cycle, right? It's everything from gluconeogenesis, hepatic glucose output. I mean,

315
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,840
all of these things continue to stay unregulated and I think that's only really appreciated when

316
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,560
you think of time and the passage of time. Yeah, I think one thing that's really interesting

317
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:23,160
is that you can have, depending on the details of how processes are tuned, the same amount of

318
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,520
production and the same amount of consumption and these have to be balanced for your glucose to stay

319
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,320
anywhere close to steady, okay? So in a diabetic production and consumption or balance and a healthy

320
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,280
person production and consumption are balanced and they can even be the same amount of production

321
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:46,200
and consumption. But it can just be that you need a higher amount of glucose to achieve that same

322
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,880
balance of production and consumption in the diabetic and that reflects often, in my opinion

323
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:03,480
at least, underlying issues with how fat is handled that you either need more glucose to induce

324
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:13,240
more insulin in order to suppress lipolysis in the diabetic, right? Or more glucose to

325
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,160
out-compete fat to get burnt in tissues. And so ultimately I think a lot of what's setting

326
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:25,400
blood glucose is competition between glucose and fat. This is a very old idea called the Randall

327
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,640
hypothesis. But I think there's a lot of truth to it. We have a lot of new data that's consistent

328
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:40,040
with it and so I think a lot of these issues come back to making room for glucose to be burned by

329
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,320
controlling the amount of fat that's being used by tissues. So can you state for folks the Randall

330
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,840
hypothesis? I'd love to actually talk a little bit about the more recent data because as you said I

331
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,840
mean this is I mean this is over 50 years old, isn't it? You know I'm a terrible historian so I'm

332
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,960
going to trust you on that one but you know I think the essence of the hypothesis is that

333
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:11,080
fat is somewhere between a preferred and the preferred fuel for tissues and there's competition

334
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:19,800
between carbohydrates, classically glucose, and fat for burning and so when fat is available then

335
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,760
glucose tends not to be burned effectively and that's a possible cause of diabetes.

336
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,920
Now of course when you say fat you don't mean fat within adipose tissue, you mean

337
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,360
fat within you mean fat that's available for use? Fat that's available for use and so that can come

338
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,760
in multiple forms. The simplest way to think about it is free fatty acids that are floating in the

339
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:49,720
bloodstream and that may be the most important form of it but there's you know also adipose

340
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,880
stores within tissues not subcutaneous white adipose which is typically a healthy place to

341
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,200
store fat molecules but you can end up with what people call ectopic fat for example droplets of

342
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,880
fat building up in muscle and when those are there they can compete with carbohydrate for being burned

343
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:16,680
or you can have breakdown of lipoproteins from the bloodstream things like VLDL okay that we

344
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:25,080
desperately need to have broken down in order to have a good HDL and a you know a low LDL cholesterol.

345
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:33,400
Tell me about some of the more recent evidence around why that hypothesis may be more compelling

346
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:42,280
even so than when it was proposed. Yeah I mean I think we've been doing experiments that look at

347
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:49,640
you know what are things that can suppress glucose use in tissues and one thing we see is

348
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:55,000
it's just very clear that fat does this we're certainly not the only people to do this I think

349
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,320
there's a long history of this but it maybe hasn't been adequately appreciated just how fundamental

350
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:09,000
that result is and if you turn off lipolysis different ways then you rapidly induce glucose

351
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,080
consumption and if you provide other alternative fuels and we've learned that lactate is a very

352
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:22,040
important circulating fuel and so it also will compete with glucose to suppress glucose use so

353
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,880
the fact that you can have multiple different types of fuels either fat or lactate and any of

354
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,840
them will suppress glucose use really makes me believe in this kind of competitive nutrient

355
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,800
environment and that that plays a central role in determining whether you clear or don't clear

356
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,920
glucose and how high your glucose has to go basically in order to be cleared. So let's talk

357
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,280
a little bit about lactate because this is one of those things where I you know now given how much

358
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,440
I think about lactate read about lactate and we've had a number of podcasts where we get into some

359
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:01,080
detail either I was asleep through part of medical school or it just really wasn't presented in

360
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:07,400
anything other than the following. When your demand for ATP gets high enough and quick enough

361
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,640
you're going to basically take glucose and when you turn it into pyruvate rather than take the

362
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,960
efficient path of shuttling pyruvate into acetyl CoA through the Krebs cycle where you can generate

363
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,520
lots of ATP requiring oxygen you're going to take a quicker path that's less efficient but doesn't

364
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,120
require the same cellular oxygen and you'll turn pyruvate into lactate. You won't get nearly as

365
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:38,520
much ATP and you'll also tend to generate a lot of lactate which tends to gravitate with hydrogen ions

366
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,320
which tends to kind of poison the muscle a little bit and that's you know why it becomes

367
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,280
rate limiting in terms of how long you can sustain that level of output.

368
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:54,840
Maybe explain today why that's at you know the tip of the iceberg in a generous sense of the term.

369
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,960
Well I think it's all actually really important stuff. It's just only as you say part of the

370
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:09,880
picture and I think the other part of the picture is that mammals have been wired to use lactate as

371
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,480
a major circulating nutrient. It's a super super fast turnover nutrient so when you think about

372
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,360
that glucose and you're having you know a few minutes supply circulating in your blood lactate

373
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:31,880
you have even shorter supply than yet that. It's constantly being made released into the blood

374
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:38,360
stream and consumed and serves as an almost universal nutrient. They're transporters that

375
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:47,320
will carry it into virtually any cell in your body. These are the MCH or is it the the MCT

376
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,720
transporters? Yeah these are called MCT transporters or stands for monocarboxylate because

377
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,040
lactate has one carboxylic acid if you think of it as a chemistry perspective.

378
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:05,240
And so those transporters are ubiquitously expressed and they allow lactate basically to go

379
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,960
everywhere. And so it's the universally. Which by the way Josh that already differs from kind of how

380
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,120
we learned it in biochemistry class which was all that lactate goes back to the liver and the

381
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,800
Corey cycle turns lactate back into glucose and then just exports it down the glucose pathway

382
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,520
via hepatic glucose output. And you're saying I'd like to understand when that happens versus when

383
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,360
each other tissue says oh great more fuel let me take in this lactate. Yeah I think the really

384
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:42,760
important thing about lactate is that glucose penetration into tissues is actually heavily

385
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,720
regulated. It has to be heavily regulated so that if we go through a period of having low

386
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,160
carb intake there's still glucose preserved for the brain and for other cells that particularly

387
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:06,360
need it. And lactate is the universally available form of carbohydrate. And so and I give an example

388
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:13,000
like you know in a healthy heart at least in the fasted state it basically will not touch glucose.

389
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,720
But it will use lactate as free fatty acid. Would that be preferred fuel as free fatty acids.

390
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,360
It probably also gets some fatty acids from lipoproteins and it definitely uses lactate and

391
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:34,120
also things like ketone bodies. But this is like a very clear example of a tissue other than liver

392
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,040
that net consumes lactate just using it as a fuel to have access to carbohydrate energy.

393
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,640
Now lactate is a is another metabolite that I pay a lot of attention to Josh. So as regularly as I'm

394
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:56,520
checking my glucose I'm checking my lactate. And unlike glucose the range is much greater right.

395
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,280
Like the lowest glucose I've ever measured in myself is probably 50 milligrams per deciliter

396
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,280
and the highest not including the time Jerry Reven had me do an insulin suppression test at

397
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:15,240
Stanford. And I almost died actually. This is actually a ridiculous story because one of the

398
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,720
IVs got blown and we didn't know that they were pushing glucose because I was just getting so

399
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:29,720
hypoglycemic and I could feel it. You know you learn in medical school what hypoglycemia feels

400
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,400
like. And when you start sweating really profusely and this was like nothing I've ever experienced.

401
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:43,720
It felt like a bucket of water got dumped on me. So I knew oh my god I'm really and I was like

402
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,840
they got to push glucose and I could feel the IV was blown. Anyway to make a long story short when

403
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,520
they finally corrected it my glucose got up to 240 milligrams per deciliter. So like there's call

404
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:02,600
it 250 right. That's a you know a 5x range. But with lactate I mean I've measured it as low as 0.3

405
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:10,840
millimole and as high as 20 millimole. Right. So that's a 60 fold difference. Yeah that's that's a

406
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,880
big big range but it probably depends a lot on your physiological state. Well of course the point

407
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:25,000
three would be you know at rest and fasted. The 20 is you know kind of an all out two minute effort.

408
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,600
But the point here is that's a much bigger range. And is this regulated. Is there an upper limit to

409
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,200
how high lactate can go or is it simply how much pain you can tolerate in terms of what is necessary

410
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,840
to generate lactate. Like is there truly an upper limit. I'm honestly not sure. I mean you may be

411
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:51,720
you may be right on the pain side of the scale. Right. And you know this this has to do with how

412
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,920
fast its production and consumption are. So you can have that excursion to 20. And you know that

413
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,640
goes down very quickly. Cleaned up in a few minutes you know if you're actually you know completely

414
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:13,080
resting. So yeah this is a very flexible metabolite this way. When did people start to realize this

415
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:18,760
that that lactate was a fuel because I remember first reading about this in about 2011 where

416
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,960
people were starting to say hey neurons might like lactate besides glucose because at that point

417
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,080
in time there were really only two fuels that a neuron would ingest. Right. So under normal

418
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,760
circumstances it was exclusively glucose. And then George Cahill showed in the 60s. Yeah but if you

419
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,480
starve somebody you can turn up to 60 percent of that fuel stock into beta hydroxybutyrate.

420
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,160
I think it was BHB maybe it was acetoacetate but it was it was a ketone right. So you'd be maybe 60

421
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,720
40 in favor of a ketone to glucose. But that was really it. And then there were these kind of

422
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,080
whisperings in these you know animal studies that suggested no actually neurons all consume lactate.

423
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:03,960
Where are we today on that front. Yeah I think it's still very unclear which cell types in the brain

424
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,600
are the lactate consumers versus lactate producers. Certainly there's lactate use in the brain. And is

425
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:16,600
it more astrocytes neurons. Do we know. I think it's really an active area investigation. I mean

426
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:22,760
it I think I bring biases to it but I don't bring answers. You know my bias is that you know

427
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:33,080
we are a neuron centric form of thinker right. And we didn't evolve to make glucose a unique

428
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:39,800
brain fuel in order to feed astrocytes. We did it feed neurons. So I do think there's a special

429
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:48,040
neuronal dependence on glucose. But you know as a lactate goes everywhere so it probably goes into

430
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:55,720
both astrocytes and neurons as a fuel in the right circumstances and it probably can be excreted from

431
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:01,160
both as a waste depending on exactly what activities are required in the brain at that time. And that's

432
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,360
really the beauty of lactate is that allows you a tremendous degree of flexibility that wouldn't

433
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:13,800
exist otherwise. And this was actually you know thought about a lot by a guy named Brooks at

434
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:25,560
Berkeley who. George Brooks. Yeah recognized the you know ubiquitous potential for lactate as a fuel.

435
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:31,720
And I think you know we were able to contribute to that story by really showing it. Yes you know

436
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,800
using using mass spectrometry to make it crystal clear that this usage happens throughout the whole

437
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:48,280
body. So what is the evolutionary reason in your mind for why the body would allow most tissues

438
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
to love lactate as a fuel directly versus just having the liver mop it up at the same kinetic

439
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,960
rate turn it into glucose and shoot that glucose out. Is there is there an obvious reason for why

440
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,440
the current strategy is a better one. Yeah it's not an easy answer but I think there are strong

441
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,360
reasons. And I'll say that we've lately done experiments in yeast actually. And you know

442
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:20,920
yeast make ethanol as waste and people always I think assume that you know yeast face this

443
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,640
exact same choice that you talked about when you get to the level of pyruvate either do you spit

444
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:34,120
it out as redox balanced waste in humans that's done as lactate and yeast that's done as ethanol

445
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,560
or do you take the pyruvate into the TCA cycle. We see that going all the way back to yeast that's

446
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:47,880
a false choice. The default is to spit out the redox balanced waste. Okay and then you can always

447
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,360
pick the waste up and reuse it if you need energy from the TCA cycle. And so I think this goes back

448
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:03,400
to the very earliest days of eukaryotic life basically that you want to be able to run

449
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,680
glycolysis whenever you need to run glycolysis so use glucose whenever you need to use glucose.

450
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,240
That takes you to pyruvate you've created a redox problem okay because you have electrons from the

451
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,680
glucose that are not sitting on the pyruvate. And the first priority is always to solve that redox

452
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,120
problem that's achieved in our bodies by spitting out lactate. And you don't really want to hold

453
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,920
that problem within cells in your body you want to get that all the way under the circulation so

454
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:37,400
every cell in your body can work on this master metabolic challenge of keeping you know electrons

455
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:44,520
balanced. Then whoever needs energy okay and these electrons are super valuable sources of energy

456
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:53,160
can pick them up in the form of lactate. And so there's been kind of this false coupling of

457
00:48:53,160 --> 00:49:00,360
oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in the way biochemistry is taught when really our bodies

458
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,680
eukaryotes all the way back to yeast are really designed to be much more flexible to allow these

459
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,280
two processes to happen in yeast completely independently because they really can just spit

460
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,720
out ethanol to the environment in us quasi independently. So independently at the level

461
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:23,720
of individual cells in our bodies so none of them faces this pressure okay and that's really good

462
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,640
so if you have a bout of hypoxia okay you can release lactate and elsewhere in the body the

463
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,280
problem can be cleaned up. Now in our bodies it has to be cleaned up within the body somewhere

464
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:41,080
okay because we don't have any master release valve for this so all of our cells together have

465
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:47,160
to solve this problem. Meaning the way that yeast can literally eject ethanol from their cell and

466
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:52,280
get it away we can't emit lactate from our body we can emit it from a cell but it's still part of

467
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,240
the broader system. Exactly and that's when you get into medical problems like lactic acidosis

468
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,040
if you have a very fundamental metabolic deficiency or if you know god forbid someone put a bag over

469
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,520
your head and you couldn't breathe right then then you end up in this crisis of redox imbalance but

470
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,600
we distribute that problem across the body through this concentrating lactate in and out of cells and

471
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:21,560
letting whatever cells that need carbohydrate energy use the lactate. The system would be way

472
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:27,480
way less flexible if you know only the liver could clean this up and it would be also way

473
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:34,120
less commensurate with effective burst exercise okay. You know the heart is super well perfused

474
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,080
and if muscle is making less well perfused muscle that's far from the heart okay so it's hard to get

475
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:47,800
oxygen there is making a lot of lactate. Of course it's very advantageous at that moment for the heart

476
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,960
which is sitting on more oxygen than it needs to use lactate rather than fatty acids which are

477
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,000
better long-term things to store for the future anyway so it's way way better to have the system

478
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,640
designed this way. And is that regulated then locally is that regulated at each cell like how

479
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:10,040
is that decision made because how does that myocyte in the heart know the energy of the entire

480
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:17,720
system so that it can make the decision that is in the short run counterintuitive? You know it's

481
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,800
seems medically or maybe textbook med school counterintuitive but it's physical chemistry

482
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:32,120
pure intuition. Well no no yeah yeah yeah. Lactate goes up and so it gets burned. Regardless how but

483
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:37,720
how is the decision made are you saying it's just made on mass balance? Yeah it's made on mass

484
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,880
it's made on mass action and availability of substrate so there's no decision okay

485
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,320
that this it's it's pure physics basically. Yeah okay now I see what you're saying so

486
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,920
it's basically a gradient problem across the board. Mm-hmm if you have too much lactate it

487
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:01,080
flows out if you are short on energy it flows in. So tell me more about lactate I'll tell you

488
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:08,200
one thing that has I've become very interested in clinically is the implication of fasting lactate

489
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:17,240
levels in the population. So if you you know measure a person's lactate level first thing in

490
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,760
the morning you're going to see quite a bit of variability and it seems to be proportional to

491
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,720
their metabolic health. The higher that number the less metabolically healthy they are.

492
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:35,960
It's not uncommon in someone who's insulin resistant to see fasting lactate levels approaching

493
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:42,280
two millimole with no activity whereas in a healthy individual it'll be below 0.5 millimole.

494
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,840
What do you think that tells us about fuel partitioning and this problem of metabolomics?

495
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,760
Yeah well I think there's a correlation between fasting glucose and fasting lactate

496
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,600
but lactate is the kind of maybe harder to measure but perhaps even more intimately tied

497
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:10,920
to the essence of metabolic dysfunction molecule and I think you know very much the way you said

498
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:19,560
it that you know it reads out a few things you know when lactate is high it reflects the fact

499
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:26,760
that during these times of fasting when glucose is not really supposed to be being used much

500
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,160
you're still using too much glucose converting too much of it to lactate and at the same time

501
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,560
that your lactate clearance system isn't working very well and typically that's because you're

502
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:46,440
having competition between lactate and fat to be burned and you know so this all feeds into the

503
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,040
syndrome of diabetes. Now there's another interesting push observation that I've made which is

504
00:53:53,080 --> 00:54:00,440
I wake up in the morning check a lactate it's 0.4 millimole. I eat the biggest carbohydrate meal

505
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:09,960
I can ingest don't lift a finger other than to feed myself. I recheck my lactate in an hour it's

506
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:16,120
one millimole. Why did that happen? I mean we can understand the biochemistry right which is

507
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:21,000
I have more glucose to metabolize but this kind of gets back to your point of

508
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:28,840
med school biochemistry would suggest my lactate should not have gone up. I'm taking glucose I'm

509
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:34,760
making pyruvate I have endless cellular oxygen I should be running that pyruvate through the

510
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:40,280
Krebs cycle and I shouldn't see any uptick in lactate but that's exactly what I don't see.

511
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,120
Yeah I mean circulating lactate is an intermediary

512
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:51,160
mediary in glucose catabolism and that's just the way the body works it's not what we were taught in

513
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:56,440
med school. Yeah yeah and I wonder I mean do you have a sense of of how it's being taught today

514
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,960
do you do you get the sense that that biochemistry students at Princeton and Stanford today are being

515
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:09,960
taught what we were taught with respect to this sort of more rigid model of lactate and it's as a

516
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:16,520
as a metabolite? Well I'm probably chipping away at it at Princeton but you know I don't know how

517
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,640
much it's shifting at the medical education level yet probably thank god I haven't sat through those

518
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:27,000
classes at Stanford again but um I think it's something that we should see shift and and I

519
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,080
hope we see the next generation of biochemistry textbooks talk about circulating lactate as an

520
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,440
intermediary in glucose catabolism. I think that's a really fundamental thing for people who want to

521
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,920
just think about metabolism accurately to know and as you say it you can do this the self-experiment

522
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:51,400
very simply and see it. And I think it's a very interesting thing to consider from a prognostic

523
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:57,480
standpoint you know when you go back and look at Jerry Reven's five criteria for what was then

524
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,800
syndrome x and what is now metabolic syndrome fasting glucose is still one of them. You could

525
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,320
make a case that fasting lactate would be more telling. Yeah I wouldn't be surprised I mean I

526
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:15,960
think the challenge with lactate is that it is a metabolite that can get up and down faster and

527
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,840
one response to stress is to rapidly convert glucose into lactate

528
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,040
and so that's just part of your body activating but of course there are people who have stress

529
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,440
at a blood draw and because you know lactate is a little bit more fluctuating this way

530
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,960
they're going to be pros and cons medically in terms of using it as a biomarker. You know I

531
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,720
I don't think our problem with metabolic syndrome anyway is diagnosing it right

532
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,920
our problem is preventing it. Yeah although what I would argue is I think we treat metabolic

533
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,720
syndrome too discreetly and I think we come to it too late right I think we should be looking

534
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:58,760
for things far before you actually have hypertension and truncal obesity and dyslipidemia

535
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:05,480
and hyperglycemia and I do wonder with nothing other than just intuition if

536
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,560
lactate dysregulation for lack of a better word might be one of the earlier canaries in the coal

537
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:20,600
mine. I totally agree with that. I want to go back to something that we've talked about a couple of

538
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:26,920
times you've mentioned it in passing you and I know what it's about but I think it's such an

539
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,160
important part of where we're going to go in a discussion that I almost need you to go into full

540
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:39,400
prof mode and really explain two things which are obviously highly related in a moment you'll see.

541
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:47,320
The first is how the electron transport chain works. So what is what is the Krebs cycle doing

542
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:53,880
and how is that feeding into this massive generation of energy currency and specifically

543
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,080
can you talk about it with special attention to the concept of redox?

544
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:07,080
And I would encourage you Josh to take as much time as you need because the more the listeners

545
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:16,280
understand this the more they'll be able to understand NAD, NADP, NADPH, NR, NMN all of

546
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,880
these other things that people really care about but I think unfortunately they've been conditioned

547
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:29,240
into very glib understandings of these things which I think are serving no one any benefit

548
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:35,080
without actually going back to understanding the root of this problem. Now that's a great framing.

549
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:48,520
You can think of it this way fundamentally you eat three macronutrients carbs and protein and fat

550
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:59,800
and in a healthy adult first approximation every carbon atom that you eat in any of those three

551
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:10,360
forms needs to exit your body as exhaled carbon dioxide. And all of that exhaled carbon dioxide

552
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:21,160
first approximation is made in the TCA cycle and the main way that nutrients flow into the TCA

553
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:28,520
cycle to become carbon dioxide is first turning into pieces that are two carbon units in size.

554
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:39,000
And so from carbohydrate the basic flow is glucose to lactate and then lactate to pyruvate

555
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:45,720
to a two carbon piece that goes into the TCA cycle. Fat is basically composed of preassembled

556
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:51,640
two carbon pieces so they just get shopped up two carbon pieces at a time and the protein part is a

557
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,840
little more complicated we can probably skip it. So you end up with these two carbon units.

558
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:02,440
But we're worth just sort of noting Josh that protein really the primary role of protein is

559
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,800
actually the nitrogen side which we're kind of putting into these amino acids that are building

560
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:14,120
blocks. It's really less of an energy substrate but it does have that carboxylic acid on it that

561
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,080
still has to go through this cycle and be exhaled. But that's in other words that's why we'll skip

562
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:24,600
it for now because it's really not a significant energetic component right? Yeah I mean I think it

563
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:32,680
really depends on what kind of diet you eat right? If you're on a carnivore diet then it's probably a

564
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,640
different situation. Yeah it's a very interesting side discussion but ultimately you know unless

565
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:42,840
you're gaining protein mass which of course wonderful for us guys anyway when that happens

566
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:48,520
typically at least societally smiles on it you know but other than that you know whatever

567
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:54,120
amino acid carbon you take into the form of protein has to be balanced with also amino acid

568
01:00:54,120 --> 01:01:00,760
catabolism. So at that level it's not that different than carbs and fat it's just a little

569
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:08,040
different in that it can enter the TCA cycle sometimes also as four carbon pieces but a lot

570
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,840
of amino acids are broken down into these same two carbon pieces they're just 20 of them so it's

571
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:19,640
you know no one wants to hear a discussion of how all 20 of them get chopped up. So ultimately you

572
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:28,440
end up with these two carbon pieces and then they congeal with a four carbon piece and that makes

573
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,720
citrate and a lot of them one of the problems with the Krebs cycle is that it has three names

574
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:40,920
okay the Krebs cycle in honor of the amazing biochemist who played a key role in figuring it out

575
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,600
the citric acid cycle and that's named for this condensation molecule of the four carbon and the

576
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:56,600
two carbon piece citrate or the TCA cycle and TCA is tricarboxylic acid and that's because citrate

577
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:03,560
has three carboxylic acids okay so you have this cycle that unfortunately has three names but that

578
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,600
it's probably three times as important as anything else in metabolism so maybe it's fair.

579
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:20,280
So ultimately as this cycle turns it's going to spit off the two carbon pieces that

580
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:33,400
came in as carbon dioxide and in so doing it's going to take the electrons that were part of

581
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:44,840
those two carbon pieces and pass them to this famous cofactor NAD to make NADH okay and that

582
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:52,520
H stands for hydrogen right and that hydrogen is really one proton and two electrons and so this

583
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:59,960
another confusing nomenclature thing that you just can think of that H even though it may sound to

584
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:05,000
those who've taken from you know freshman chemistry like H plus like acid this is an H with two

585
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,520
electrons stuck to it so it's really what we call hydride or electrical form of chemical energy

586
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:24,360
and so then the NADH that's made from NAD there is what feeds into the electron transport chain

587
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:33,080
and those electrons then flow through a series of proteins that sit in the inner mitochondrial

588
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:40,040
membrane the mitochondria of two membranes the outer one is kind of leaky and kind of not so

589
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:46,280
important the inner one is super tight and has a ton of regulation in it and most importantly

590
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:53,720
can be used to pump protons to one side or the other and ultimately it's the pumping of protons

591
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,680
out of the mitochondria that's the function of the electron transport chain and in this kind of

592
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,160
metabolic flux way that we talked about earlier the protons that get pumped out just flow right back

593
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:09,560
in but as they flow back in they turn a turnstile and as that turnstile turns it squeezes

594
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:17,880
ADP and inorganic phosphate physically squeezes them together to make ATP the master energy

595
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,320
currency that we use to power our neurons for thinking our muscles for moving and so on.

596
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:30,680
So one of the things about this system that is just so beautiful is the transition from chemical

597
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:38,040
energy to electrical energy back to chemical energy and I you know I've tried to explain this

598
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:44,600
to my daughter she's 13 she's not fully in love with it yet but I know at some point it'll be a

599
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:51,160
more fun discussion but it really is a miracle right like so much of biology just seems like

600
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,760
it's hard to believe it all worked out but if you were going to rank all the things that I can't

601
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:02,840
believe it worked out this has got to be in the top five right it's like let's go back to the

602
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:09,640
basics again you eat a piece of bread right you're eating glucose it has these carbon to

603
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:16,680
carbon bonds and carbon to hydrogen bonds and some carbon to oxygen bonds now refresh my memory but

604
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,360
carbon to oxygen is not a very energetic bond right you know this is a another thing where

605
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:28,040
you have to be careful with the nomenclature so like CO double bonds are spectacular bonds

606
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:34,760
they're super high energy but that's where life I didn't say life that's where

607
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:41,160
physics and chemistry want to flow too they want to make these high energy bonds and in making high

608
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:49,480
energy bonds you can release a lot of energy and so those are bonds that are very energetically

609
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,080
favorable right so they're the end state it's the CH bonds as you're alluding to that start out

610
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:00,520
energetically loaded okay they're less energetically good in and of themselves so they have

611
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,000
the potential to become something better yeah it's the it's the potential that I really yeah

612
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:11,400
I'm glad you're I'm glad you're adding this level of sort of chemical rigor to this so yeah the

613
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,280
point I want to make is that these these carbon carbon carbon hydrogen bonds have this potential

614
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:24,680
that this entire cycle with three names that's so wonderful basically liberates it basically

615
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:30,360
says we're going to take that chemical energy and we're going to liberate it through electron

616
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:37,960
transferring apparati and then at the last second using that I love the turnstile analogy right

617
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:45,480
we're basically going to quickly shunt it right back into a chemical bond which is the p binding

618
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:51,160
to the a d p to make the a t p and now we have this energy currency that is going to go and do

619
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:57,800
its own thing and it has lots of different ways that it unleashes itself so explain to people the

620
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,920
difference between oxidation and reduction in chemical terms because I think people have to

621
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,400
at least hear once what's an oxidation reaction what's a reduction reaction and then why we use

622
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:15,800
the term redox synonymously with these two right so oxidation reduction are always coupled okay and

623
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:23,880
they refer to the movement of electrons and so when electrons go from substance a to substance b

624
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,880
okay the one that gives up the electrons is oxidized it's subject oxidation the one that

625
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:37,400
receives the electrons is reduced okay it's the subject of reduction let's talk about redox

626
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:44,040
pairing so you've already brought up nad and nadh so talk about how oxidation reduction pairing

627
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:49,240
works with those two to facilitate the electron transfer down this lovely chain of the inner

628
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:58,120
mitochondrial memory right so this is a pair where nad is the oxidized form nadh is the electron

629
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:08,120
holding or reduced form and it normally exists in a quite biased ratio towards a lot of nad

630
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:18,600
and a small amount of nadh and the way nature works is that whenever any parakemicals is

631
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:25,800
skewed in one direction it's favorable to turn the one that's abundant into the one that's less

632
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:33,480
abundant and so this makes nad a decent electron acceptor and so it's sitting there prepared to

633
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:40,360
pick up electrons from these intermediates carbon intermediates of the tca cycle that are

634
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:48,200
coming from carbohydrate and fat and take the electrons make nadh which then can feed into

635
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:54,040
electron transport chain and that back end has to happen fast in order to keep this ratio skewed

636
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:59,960
so you have mainly nad and not too much nadh and that's really important because when that nadh

637
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:08,360
starts creeping up all sorts of things start going wrong such as well the nadh going up will

638
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,160
drive too many electrons into electron transport chain and going back to

639
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:19,560
nov you know he's done a spectacular job showing how that leads to production of free radicals

640
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:26,360
and so when you you need the right amount of this but this is a clear way to get toxic

641
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:33,880
amounts of free radicals if you have nadh build up secondly it just gums up metabolism if you have

642
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:40,280
too much nadh relative to nad and so then you can get into problems not having enough atp

643
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:47,640
and then it can also make signaling things go awry. Now are there clinical scenarios in which

644
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,440
we see that happen or are these more typically there are things that result from toxicities

645
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,080
where you know like you know the classic thing you learn in medical school to explain the

646
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:02,120
significance of this whole system is cyanide right you know maybe tell folks how cyanide works and

647
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:07,640
I don't know if that's too extreme an example of how this system can be hijacked but but let's see.

648
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,600
Yeah I know I mean obviously you know cyanide is electron transport chain

649
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:18,680
inhibitor and so that leads the whole system just backing up a bit by bit and so you can't

650
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:23,720
then transfer electrons from nadh into the electron transport chain and so nadh goes way up

651
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:30,120
nad falls to the floor and then you have no way to make atp and that unfortunately leads to rapid

652
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,480
mortality right. Yeah and that's that's that's an interesting point because it speaks to this

653
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:41,000
again comes back to the kinetics and the flux which is it's not like cyanide kills you in an

654
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:48,760
hour I mean it kills you in seconds it's really a sobering thought. Yeah ATP turnover via this

655
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:55,560
system is on the time scale of a second and so same for nadh and so these are things you're just

656
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:03,000
whizzing through our bodies all the time and that we're constantly dependent on. Are there are there

657
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,160
less extreme examples Josh of things that will put that balance in the wrong direction kind of

658
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:15,160
chronically? I think it's a really interesting question I mean and

659
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,160
I don't want to give the misimpression that you know the right thing is to have as much nad and

660
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:28,760
as little nadh as possible right. This is a first of all it's designed to be a dynamic

661
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:36,120
system you know if you undergo intense exercise you're going to drive nadh up and this is a very

662
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:44,680
healthy context for doing this transiently metformin of course is a super interesting

663
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:54,520
medication and it's going to probably works you know mainly by slowing the conversion of nadh

664
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:59,800
back to nadh by impairing the complex one of the electron transport chain the one that does this

665
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:06,040
initial electron offloading from nadh to make nad. How well is that understood I mean this is you'll

666
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:09,720
talk to five people who study metformin and they'll tell you five different things which

667
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:16,600
I think just tells you how much we don't know but what is your view of the I don't think it's really

668
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,240
disputed that metformin inhibits complex one is it I think the broader question is how much

669
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:29,160
is that the main attraction versus kind of a sideshow right. Yeah I'll say you know there are

670
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:35,240
many people who know more about this than me but one thing that we tend to do in our lab sometimes

671
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:41,400
take these kind of famous metabolic effects like metformin inhibiting complex one and just do a

672
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,840
quick test of it and I say when we do that about half the time they look to be true and half the

673
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:52,440
time they look to be dubious and metformin was a shining star in our hands in inhibiting complex

674
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,480
one it was one of the cases where I really felt like you know it may do other things but it

675
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:02,440
certainly does what it's supposed to do there it does that strongly and I think it's probably the

676
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,320
fact that it does it in a relatively liver specific way due to the way that metformin enters

677
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:12,520
cells of the body that leads to it first of all being safe okay there are many things that make

678
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,320
it safer than cyanide but it is really crazy that you know it's the maybe the world's most widely

679
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:23,720
used medication is it some level transport chain yeah yeah and it's a mechanistic analog of cyanide

680
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:31,000
right and see if like one of the most acutely lethal substances and the most widely used drug

681
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,240
working in a remarkably similar way and so I think the fact that there's a strong liver

682
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:43,480
specificity is probably what makes it you know net beneficial for at least a subset of people

683
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:48,280
and and what's the what's the what's the change that you saw in your lab josh between so if you

684
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:54,680
go or off metformin what's your nadh to nad ratio and then on metformin how much did it change that

685
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:01,480
it depends how much metformin you use but if you try to approximate like a you do your

686
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,320
best to approximate an actual clinical dose of you know say a couple grams a day

687
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:12,760
yeah I'm not sure we did this in a way that I would consider clinically applicable so but but

688
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,920
I'll say that it's certainly crystal clear that it goes in the right direction

689
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,120
and so it doesn't surprise you that metformin would raise fasting lactate levels correct

690
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:30,280
no I mean it certainly is aligned to do that right and that's just backing up further it's

691
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,840
just basically creating more of a roadblock into the TCA is going to give you more lactate

692
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:41,880
yeah more of a road back and electron disposal basically do you think that that's a neutral

693
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,320
effect or do you think that that's a potentially deleterious effect of metformin that is probably

694
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,880
offset in a patient with diabetes by the benefits that it has on hepatic glucose output

695
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,920
that's a great question I don't think I know I mean

696
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:08,920
I think having more circulating lactate can be you know a bit of a challenge for

697
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,880
clearing fat right because they have some sort of competition so from that perspective I think you

698
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:21,240
know being in a lower state might have some benefits but then you know lactate is a valuable

699
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:27,400
fuel as long as it's not getting too high level so I'm not sure how that all plays out in terms

700
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:34,840
of long-term health interesting yeah anything you want to say about NADP and NADPH just to round it

701
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:44,760
out so people know the full story yeah these are you know super important co-factors that personally

702
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:52,280
I'm very obsessed with that are kind of they live just on the edge of what people who take

703
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:58,280
biochemistry either in undergraduate or med school learn about or don't learn about and

704
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:07,160
they're fascinating co-factors because in terms of their intrinsic chemistry all their intrinsic

705
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,920
chemistry from the energy point of view is exactly the same as NAD, NADH but they have a different

706
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:19,800
handle on them chemically that allows biology to use them in a different way and then the

707
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:28,600
ratio is maintained quite different level from NAD, NADH so NAD, NADH is super biased towards NAD

708
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:36,280
this is much more of an even pairing which means that there's much more driving force to dump the

709
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:47,320
electrons off okay rather than to absorb them up and so NADPH is really to me second only to ATP

710
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:58,280
a master energetic building material and it's the building material that's used for example

711
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:05,080
to assemble fat I mean it's the most important one so as you take pieces two carbon pieces from

712
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:11,480
carbohydrate and want to put them together to make fat you keep dumping in electrical energy

713
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:18,360
in the form of NADPH and then NADPH is used in all sorts of other really interesting ways to fight

714
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:24,280
reactive oxygen species it's also used if you're trying to kill bacteria to intentionally make

715
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:31,560
reactive oxygen species so this is where biology is freaking confusing and complicated and there's

716
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:37,800
definitely the yin and yang that you have this awesome co-factor that's so important for fighting

717
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:43,960
oxidative stress and also can be used to create boatloads oxidative stress intentionally when it's

718
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:52,440
needed first of all that was a fantastic overview of how the Krebs cycle works and specifically with

719
01:17:52,440 --> 01:18:00,600
attention to how electrons move through it and move through these redox factors which then brings

720
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:06,680
us to I think a part of the discussion where a lot of people have an enormous interest which is

721
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:13,160
I don't know go back seven eight years it started to become fashionable and it's only become more

722
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:20,440
fashionable to talk about supplementing with NAD I say that quote unquote we're going to talk about

723
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:27,160
why you don't actually supplement with NAD but is it safe to say that at least part of the impetus

724
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:34,200
for this was the observation that as we age cellular NAD levels decline and you've already

725
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,800
made a very compelling case for why NAD is important I mean I don't I almost want to avoid

726
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:45,320
the whole sirtuin side of this because I think that story keeps changing so maybe we can just

727
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,040
unless you feel strongly or compelled to get into sirtuins we can put those aside for the moment

728
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,800
yeah I love putting sirtuins aside let's let's just get to real metabolism and

729
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:09,560
yeah I you know I think the first principles in this field are great right that you know

730
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:16,120
NAD plays this super central role in energy generation that we all want to feel more

731
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:21,880
energetic whether you know you want to be a more extremely successful athlete at age 21 or whether

732
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:31,560
you want to feel at age 50 like I am or later you know like you're 21 and so you think you know if

733
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:37,880
we could just you know turn up the the burner capacity right this would be absolutely fantastic

734
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:45,960
um and then we have this data that NAD is depleted with aging although I have to say

735
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:52,520
when we do those measurements we agree that NAD is depleted with aging but it is a lot more subtle

736
01:19:53,080 --> 01:20:00,840
than you know you would think uh looking at the literature and so these are really quite subtle

737
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,760
NAD depletions you know we were talking about these ranges earlier and you know

738
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:13,080
the kind of three-fold uh range where a lot of metabolites live on a daily basis some of them

739
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:17,720
glucose that's their worst day right and as you pointed out some of them like lactate you know

740
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:24,360
they may do the three-fold all the time and then the 60-fold when you stress them uh NAD changes

741
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:30,920
we see with aging are like you know 10 percent 20 percent oh wow I didn't realize it was that little

742
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:39,320
Josh yeah so I think um and I'm not saying that in some tissue of you know an aged human there might

743
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:45,320
not be bigger effects but I think this is the first caution I would give to people thinking

744
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:55,320
that they're going to fix everything through NAD and um so you know on one hand it's a robust

745
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:00,600
finding that this is something that changes with aging that with a central metabolic role on the

746
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,400
other hand it's something that happens with a fair amount of subtlety can you explain to folks how

747
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:12,360
this is done because again I mean you know we talk about measurement sometimes a little too glibly

748
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:17,480
right so pretty easy to explain how we can measure glucose and hemoglobin and lactate

749
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,880
at the other end of the spectrum we've talked a lot about ATP but but I but I think most people

750
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,600
don't understand is it's very difficult to measure ATP it comes back to what you said a moment ago

751
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:33,320
this ain't sticking around a very long time right you're using MRS and super complicated physics

752
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:39,480
to be able to measure these things where does NAD fit on that spectrum and how do you actually

753
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:47,560
measure it yeah I mean I think the good news is that NAD unlike NADH is not like one of these

754
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:54,920
super transient metabolites and so NADH measurement is wickedly difficult but you know most of this

755
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:03,560
NADH NAD pair sits as NAD and it tends to sit around for you know hour-ish time scale oh so

756
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,160
you don't even have to you don't necessarily have to flash freeze tissue or things like that

757
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:12,680
that's right you have you have some more flexibility in making those measurements as

758
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:17,560
long as you're not irritating the tissue in a way that leads to you know massive NAD degradation

759
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:24,440
which you know people may do sometimes by accident but I think generally it's not that

760
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:31,080
hard of a measurement NAD obviously like ATP it's a tissue metabolite not a circulating metabolite

761
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:37,400
so you need biopsy specimens to measure it I'm not a master of the literature of you know NAD

762
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:47,400
levels in human tissues but my not fully informed perspective is that there probably isn't as much

763
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:53,560
as we should have okay and that's because it's hard to get biopsies from from people and if you

764
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:59,080
if you took if you take blood if you take a whole blood and you look at PBMC can you look at NAD

765
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:04,360
levels in there with relative ease or is it too complicated because by the time you separate the

766
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:13,080
PBMC you've kind of lost your window I think it's a really good question because there is quite active

767
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:23,400
NAD metabolism in immune cells so yeah I'm not an expert in this but I bet there's a way you could

768
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:28,600
develop a good protocol I haven't followed you know how good the measurements up to now have been

769
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:34,120
so most of what you've measured has been in tissue yeah typically you know we work a lot in mouse

770
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:42,280
sometimes we measure human but more typically on the cancer side and yeah there we just take tissues

771
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:49,000
and freeze them and you know extract metabolites do mass spec you're seeing a consistent clear

772
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:57,160
decline in NAD with the aging animal or human but it's I mean it's not a fold reduction it's

773
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:03,720
a percent reduction 10 percent 20 reduction and that's that's the most common thing yeah okay so

774
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:11,320
this this generates a hypothesis the hypothesis is if you restore NAD levels in the old organism to

775
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:16,840
the level that they were in the young organism the old organism will feel and perform like the

776
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:22,200
young organism that's one hypothesis another hypothesis would be if you induce super normal

777
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:28,040
levels of NAD in any organism they will feel super normal so let's assume that both of those

778
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:36,680
hypotheses are simultaneously testable what happened five seven eight years ago NAD clinics

779
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:42,840
started popping up all over the place and they started saying if you come here we'll put IVs in

780
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,280
you and we'll give you NAD so let's first explain why did they do this intravenously why couldn't

781
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:57,560
they make an NAD pill yeah so NAD and its precursors are broken down in the gastrointestinal track

782
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:07,000
and so you know if you take you know NR for example so nicotinamide riboside orally

783
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:14,280
it mainly will enter the body in the form of nicotinic acid or niacin which is a healthy

784
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:21,000
substance so there's nothing wrong with it but you know it except for maybe the epithelium or

785
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:30,200
gastrointestinal track you know the body is not seeing nicotinamide riboside and NAD just to be

786
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:35,800
clear because we're going to talk about NR and NMN in a moment but NAD there's no way to orally take

787
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:41,720
it right it has to be yeah there's no known absorption route for NAD and I think it'll get

788
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:48,040
broken down probably all the way to nicotinic acid although I'm not 100% sure anyone has proven that

789
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:54,360
but I certainly don't think it would enter the body any other way than either nicotinamide

790
01:25:54,360 --> 01:26:00,920
which is like you know a little bit closer to remaking NAD or or nicotinic acid. So what

791
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:09,400
happens when a person receives intravenous NAD what's the fate of that NAD because you know one

792
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:16,120
of the things in metabolism and biology is anytime you put something in a vein you bypass the liver

793
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:21,080
with something called the first pass effect which in your former life was very important because

794
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:26,760
when you had these patients in the ER that you were giving inhaled drugs to it's not just the

795
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,400
speed with which they were getting it it's that you didn't you could actually deliver the exact

796
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:38,040
drug you wanted not a pro drug that could be modified by the liver. So this idea of giving

797
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:43,720
intravenous NAD is at least theoretically interesting because you're putting the molecule

798
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:50,840
of interest directly into the venous system. So what's its fate? I think and you may be more up

799
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:56,920
on this than me but that you know it's going to get broken down partially right because there's

800
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:03,080
not clear uptake mechanisms known anyway to get NAD from the bloodstream into cells.

801
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,960
Nicotinamide mononucleotide

802
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:17,160
I think may be able to enter cells directly or nicotinamide riboside. So these are partially

803
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:25,000
broken down forms of NAD but that are nevertheless meaningfully closer to NAD than the normal things

804
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:33,320
that circulate in good amounts in our bloodstream and that does partially I would say short circuit

805
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:42,120
the route to cells making NAD. So they kind of can break down partially the NAD in the bloodstream

806
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:52,440
take these partially broken down NAD precursors into cells and rebuild NAD in a shortcut manner

807
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,840
that probably has a good chance to bolster NAD levels.

808
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:04,040
So in other words when you give intravenous NAD there is no transporter to take NAD into a cell

809
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:12,040
but that NAD breaks down into things like NR and NMN and in the vascular system we know that those

810
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:16,920
things can get taken up at least into some cells. Do we know which cells have the capacity to do that

811
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:22,920
or which cells don't? I don't know that I'm the best expert to ask that but I

812
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,040
yeah I think

813
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:34,840
I think certainly at least some important cell types in the body can take those up and

814
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:43,160
may be pretty broadly but I don't know off the top of my head. When the NR or NMN gets into this cell

815
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:47,800
is it relatively straightforward that it will be reconstituted into NAD? Like what's the

816
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:58,360
energetic cost of doing that or you know how easy is that and is that the favored reaction at that

817
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:03,240
point? Yeah I think it's the favored reaction which is the important thing and this is not a

818
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:11,960
big demand relatively speaking you know the big energy flow is through this NAD and NADH exchange

819
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:21,160
but the making of NAD itself is not an expensive process per se and so yeah you get these pieces

820
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:29,640
you can kind of think so NAD stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and so it's two

821
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:38,200
kind of nucleotide pieces put together and when you take an NR or NMN it's one of those two pieces

822
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:44,040
but the more interesting side and the other side comes from ATP and it's there all the time because

823
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:49,480
all your cells have ATP or you got much much deeper problems and so you just snap it together

824
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:54,680
and I think you end up with you know probably effective NAD supplementation when you go the

825
01:29:54,680 --> 01:30:03,480
IV route. In other words taking IV NAD will probably increase into intracellular NAD levels

826
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:07,640
though not directly because there's not a transporter but it goes through this sort of

827
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:11,960
circuitous route to get there so might not be the most efficient way to do it but

828
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:19,960
this certainly corrects a statement I've made in the past which is intravenous NAD is not a good

829
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:29,640
way to get NAD because we don't have a transporter that's correct but incomplete. I think that's a fair

830
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:35,240
summary from my perspective. In other words we don't really know how much if you take a hundred

831
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:40,120
units of NAD intravenously infused we don't really know how many units ultimately make their way into

832
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:46,920
a cell but it's probably not a hundred. Yeah I'm sure there's a fair amount of loss in the process

833
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:56,440
I mean there's a very interesting protein called CD38 that's I think designed to control these

834
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:07,560
kind of pathways okay and it's a suppressor of NAD levels and it works I think by breaking down

835
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:14,040
NAD that's outside of cells and mainly there's not normally in physiology NAD in meaningful

836
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:20,440
amounts probably outside of cells but there is NMN in meaningful amounts since this is a protein

837
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,320
that's super good at breaking down NMN. It still leaves you with NR which is still

838
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:34,040
so it's one step further away from being NAD but it's still meaningfully closer than your typical

839
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:40,440
physiological precursor and so I think it's positioned to as you say at least some places in

840
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:49,480
the body boost NAD. Today I think the majority of efforts to increase intracellular NAD are done

841
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:58,280
through oral precursors and the two are NR and NMN which as you said are pretty similar and

842
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:06,920
are you aware of a more convincing argument for why one might be a more preferred substrate? I

843
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:13,000
haven't particularly seen arguments that one is superior than the other. I've seen some

844
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:19,160
unpublished data that suggests one can be made more temperature and moisture stable than the other

845
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:25,800
but let's put that aside for the moment. Would you consider these two a first approximation

846
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:33,480
equivalent approaches? Yeah. Okay so now talk about something else that you said that it also

847
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:40,200
kind of news to me which is what is the effect of the gastrointestinal tract on these agents?

848
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:47,480
Yeah I mean they get broken down and they get broken down all the way to the level of nicotinic

849
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:54,120
acid or niacin basically and this is the main way they enter the body. It doesn't mean that

850
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:58,520
there can't be a trickle of them entering some other way that has a physiological effect

851
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:04,040
or that there's some local effect or some effect on the microbiome of taking them. So they're

852
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:09,320
you know biology is super complicated. There are ways that these could be doing interesting health

853
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:16,360
supporting things but I don't really think they're fundamentally different than taking a physician

854
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:24,280
prescribed niacin pill from the perspective of providing NAD precursors. Now a physician

855
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:30,920
prescribed niacin pill when people used to take niacin for hyperbeta lipoproteinemia right which

856
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:35,560
is really obviously no I mean there's probably still some patients out there who take niacin

857
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:42,200
unfortunately but it wasn't uncommon to get a real flush from the medication. Now I don't remember

858
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:49,000
what doses people were taking but I feel like it was on the order of grams not telegrams.

859
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:54,520
Do you recall how much niacin you would need to give somebody for them to experience an actual

860
01:33:54,520 --> 01:34:00,440
flush? I think it was a few grams I think that that's where my recollection is too. Okay so is

861
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:06,760
that the reason people don't experience a flush with NR and NMN because they're typically taking

862
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:11,800
you know 500 milligrams to one gram and that's simply not going to produce enough niacin to reach

863
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:17,800
that threshold? Yeah they're also kind of niacin prodrugs so they probably are delayed absorption

864
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:24,520
forms of niacin so that may smooth things out enough so they may be better tolerated but I

865
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,320
think this is how I'd fundamentally think about them is that they're niacin prodrugs.

866
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:36,600
Your lab has done some some of the flux work on this correct? What are some of the most interesting

867
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:43,800
things you've learned about how NR and how NMN when given orally end up in different tissues and

868
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:51,160
what the effect is in the liver versus the muscle versus the plasma? Yeah I think the main thing you

869
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:57,800
see is that you know these are converted to niacin they will raise niacin particularly niacin heading

870
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:03,800
to the liver out of the gastrointestinal tract so in the what we call the portal circulation that

871
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:09,960
connects you know your intestine to the liver very effectively and that you know other than

872
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:17,000
that their effect on like boosting their own circulating levels is somewhere between subtle

873
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:24,920
and vanishing. I'm still not sure which of those two it is but I think they certainly remain in the

874
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:30,520
bloodstream much less abundant than nicotinamide which is the thing the liver is normally producing

875
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:37,880
to feed NAD precursor to the tissues of the body and so there there's from what we have seen no

876
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:49,560
clear route for oral NR or oral NMN to produce circulating levels of NR or NMN that are high

877
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:56,280
enough to compete at least at a standard concentration level with nicotinamide the

878
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:03,400
physiological precursor as a way of feeding NAD precursors to tissues so basically at some level

879
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:09,720
they don't change what's happening and what most of your tissues are seeing that much if our

880
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:16,760
measurements are correct. Where do you think you could be fooled on this I mean I know that's a

881
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:21,800
question every scientist or every good scientist asks themselves that question right how can we be

882
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:27,080
fooled by our measurements. I'm sure you've thought about this where do you see this the

883
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:33,080
opportunities in this particular case to be misled. Yeah I mean it could be that you know

884
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:39,960
there are local effects of NR or NMN on like the intestine that are really important it could be

885
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:46,840
that their availability impacts the microbiome in important ways the microbiome can have big effects

886
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:54,680
on health. It could be that even though the amounts of like NR that may reach the liver or

887
01:36:54,680 --> 01:37:00,200
even lower amounts that may reach you know the heart or something are really small that there's

888
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:05,880
a subset of cells there that are really NR preferring because maybe they're really deficient

889
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:13,960
in using nicotinamide and maybe getting even small amounts of NR to those cells is meaningful so I

890
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:21,560
think these are all possibilities that we're very much open to but you know my base assumption is

891
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:28,600
that often the obvious is true and here the obvious would be you know the physiological

892
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:35,240
system just isn't that impacted by this particular type of oral supplement. Do you think there's any

893
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:41,560
chance that with chronic administration you'd see something different because I'm assuming in these

894
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:48,600
experiments you're not seeing the effect of these chemicals being ingested chronically or are you?

895
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:54,040
No I think it could be I mean human can be different than mouse okay first of all it's

896
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:59,080
another important thing that I say we haven't done these experiments in human. I think someone

897
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:08,360
if they aren't already should do these experiments in human and yeah chronic versus acute so there's

898
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:15,320
a bunch of variables that could alter things. Based on what you know now if the hypothesis

899
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:25,400
is true if giving well let's not talk about the route if restoring intracellular NAD levels

900
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:30,920
at 50 to the level they were at when you were 20 would improve some measure of performance

901
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:38,120
based on what you know today what do you hypothesize would be the most efficient way

902
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:47,000
to restore NAD levels? Yeah I mean I guess you know IV is the promising way to do the restoration.

903
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:56,920
I'm not very convinced about the first hypothesis and you know I think the big history of medicine

904
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:04,040
you and I can debate it is that things are way more complicated than people can envision right

905
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:11,240
that you know hormone replacement therapy is like one of the great examples right it didn't turn out.

906
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:15,480
Although it's being overturned well but I think you know I think HRT is one that

907
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:21,480
I think if you go back and look at the women's health initiative I think it got it wrong right

908
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:26,360
I mean I think it was the randomized experiment but it was really misinterpreted.

909
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:32,600
So is this what you thought save a bit more about that? Maybe I picked up on the wrong

910
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:37,160
thread of where you were going but I assumed what you were going to say was look the epidemiology

911
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:43,400
in the 80s and 90s was that giving women hormones post menopause was a good thing

912
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:48,200
and then the women's health initiative came along and said no it's a bad thing I assume that's what

913
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:52,280
you were going to say and what I was going to say was actually no I think that's actually

914
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:55,720
misleading I think if you actually go back and look at the women's health initiative

915
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:03,640
it was just an awful example of how to misinterpret a study. I think there was no increase in the risk

916
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,880
of breast cancer and if there was any risk increase in the risk of breast cancer it probably had

917
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:13,640
nothing to do with the estrogen that the women were given. When you actually look for example

918
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:18,200
at the relative risk and absolute risk different in those cohorts so remember the

919
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:23,960
women's health initiative had three cohorts you had your full placebos well technically it was

920
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:30,200
two parallels right so you had the placebo versus estrogen only in women who did not have a uterus

921
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:39,000
and then you had placebo versus estrogen plus MPA the synthetic progesterone. So in the estrogen

922
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:46,040
only versus the placebo there was a non-statistical significant reduction in the risk of breast cancer

923
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:51,720
so there was a hazard ratio of about 0.8 or 0.79 or 0.81 something like that but it didn't quite

924
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:56,920
reach statistical significance but trending towards estrogen actually reduced the risk of

925
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:04,760
breast cancer. In the estrogen plus MPA group there was a barely statistical significant increase

926
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:11,400
in the risk of breast cancer I think the hazard ratio was I want to say it was about 1.24 1.25

927
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:19,560
and the p-value was exactly 0.05 or 0.049 or something like that so at the surface you'd

928
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:24,200
say gosh this is increasing the risk of breast cancer and what was talked about was it was it

929
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:30,840
was a 25 percent increase in the risk of breast cancer but the you know to talk about the relative

930
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,840
risk increase without talking about the absolute risk is obviously irresponsible if you look at the

931
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:43,080
absolute risk change it was 0.1 percent it was one in a thousand and that says nothing about a lot of

932
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:48,600
other methodologic issues with the study including the fact that in my opinion a more plausible

933
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:54,440
hypothesis was that the MPA was more the issue than the estrogen but the estrogen gets all the

934
01:41:54,440 --> 01:42:00,440
attention right so estrogen causes breast cancer gets the attention and you know if you look at

935
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:07,000
subsequent studies I don't think we see that to be the case so so I'm gonna hypothesize or predict

936
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:13,160
that in 10 years I think that we'll look back at what happened to a generation of women which I

937
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:17,400
think is really unfair in that you know basically an entire generation of women got deprived of

938
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:24,280
hormones because of I think a really poorly interpreted study but your point notwithstanding

939
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:32,120
sometimes the obvious is not obvious sorry for the digression well I mean yeah but like no I mean

940
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:36,680
that was super interesting and I thought there was some cardiovascular risk data in that study that

941
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:42,280
was surprising but I it's you know it much better than me yeah I think on the cardiovascular front

942
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:48,440
there probably is a slight increase in risk with oral estrogen because of the hypercoagulability

943
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:57,240
I also think it speaks to understanding the use case today very few women on hormone replacement

944
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:02,280
therapy are given oral estrogen the preferred route of administration is is is a is a patch

945
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:06,760
you know something like a vivel dot where you're given topical estradiol and you get all of the

946
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:11,880
benefits of the reduction of azer motor symptoms the incredible benefits that you see on bone

947
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:16,840
health without any of the hypercoagulability and cardiovascular so now we actually see the reverse

948
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:21,640
now there's a very clear trend not just trend it's statistically significant there's a very clear

949
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:27,880
reduction in cardiovascular mortality yeah so that's a great example where you had to give by

950
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:34,760
the right route of administration right in order to get the net positive health benefit right and

951
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:41,880
I mean I think you know right and said to Advil another one right people knew they had a lot of

952
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:46,440
side effects but everybody assumed that they were kind of counterbalanced by the fact they were

953
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:51,240
reducing coagulability and that this was going to be cardio protective right and I I don't know if

954
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:56,680
you're going to tell me that you still believe that but no I don't most most people don't right

955
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:05,080
yeah and so so so really where you were going I think is you were saying look you might even

956
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:10,920
just reject the outright hypothesis like this idea that yeah we do observe a 20 percent 10 to 20

957
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:15,560
percent reduction in NAD levels as we age you haven't even bought the first hypothesis which

958
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:21,240
is even if I could magically deliver 20 percent more NAD to a 50 year old you're not you're not

959
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:26,760
sounding very convinced that that's going to improve quality or length of life yeah not at

960
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,480
this point in time right I mean these these things involve such complicated interplay of different

961
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,720
organ systems and it may turn out that you know NAD supplementation is super valuable

962
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:45,640
medically I am completely open to that and I would love that to be the case but I think if so it's

963
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:52,360
going to be because there are select cell types that are genuinely severely NAD depleted

964
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:58,760
and that we will need to figure out how to restore NAD in those cell types and then we may see big

965
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:04,840
health benefits so I think that would be fantastic and it's completely possible and it's possible

966
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:10,840
that the general intravenous supplementation is hitting those cells and doing that but I think

967
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:15,320
it's equally possible that it's having some adverse effect that's going to be net negative for people

968
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:19,800
and we don't know the science well enough and we certainly haven't done the clinical experiment

969
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:26,600
well enough to give good health guidance yet so two things first a statement I mean this is really

970
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,920
interesting for me because I really stand corrected and I just want to apologize to all the people

971
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:37,080
over the years that I've said intravenous NAD is not getting in your cell I stand corrected it

972
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:41,720
indirectly based on everything you're saying may actually be getting into at least some cells

973
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:51,080
the second is a question right which is how would you even begin to tackle that question

974
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:57,080
which is are there certain cell subtypes that may indeed benefit from NAD boosting

975
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I haven't really seen a single convincing clinical study in humans using either NR or NMN

976
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:13,400
that has made me excited about this and I'm not a stranger to putting things in my body without

977
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:19,000
absolute perfect information right I mean I take rapamycin I've been taking rapamycin for four or

978
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,800
five years I will be the first to admit I think we have very good evidence for that it's not perfect

979
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:31,960
it's far from perfect we're never going to have a definitive human clinical trial but if I'm willing

980
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:39,080
to take rapamycin why am I not taking NR and why am I not taking NMN and the reason is I just can't

981
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:45,240
find a shred of compelling evidence to tell me to do so and I'm in the same boat you're in I'd love

982
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:52,760
it if there was because it's a pretty easy safe thing to take so what study needs to be done to

983
01:46:52,760 --> 01:47:03,000
help someone like me a reluctant NAD or get on the NAD train you know I think we need to first

984
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:11,080
of all map better the basic pharmacology of NAD in animals and human I mean that's quite doable

985
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:17,480
and this is something that we as a field are doing and there are a lot of great people doing this and

986
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:24,200
but we can do more and better then we need to have the technologies to look at this at cellular

987
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:31,480
resolution rather than bulk resolution so this is like we're pushing very hard to develop the

988
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:39,880
ability to take a slice of tissue and say what's the heterogeneity across cells in NAD levels I

989
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:45,400
think that'll be very helpful because if we see that that's really scattershot and aging and

990
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:51,800
homogeneous and young then you have your answer that you know all that we need is for one in 10

991
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:58,920
cells at any time to be really NAD depleted and we view that 10% reduction not as some tiny wiggle

992
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:06,920
down but as one in 10 cells being on the road to a catastrophic outcome okay and so I think

993
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:13,560
there's going to be a really important measurement and I think the field will get there over the next

994
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:20,520
few years not instantly and then ultimately we need successful clinical experiments right and

995
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:27,720
I think there there have been some really persuasive experiments in animals you know with

996
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,400
for example I think there are experiments on reversing you know bad outcomes after renal

997
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:39,080
ischemia and so it'd be good if we could find niche experiments where there's a very strong

998
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:43,880
effect in animals a very quick clinical readout right you have a

999
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:50,120
ischemic renal event and you do supplementation and you get a benefit or you don't so I don't

1000
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,160
think the right way to go about it. How is it administered in that experiment I don't think I

1001
01:48:53,160 --> 01:49:01,720
remember that one. You know I may not get the details of that right so but I think I would

1002
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:07,400
just say conceptually we need to find the strongest animal proof of concept that can be translated

1003
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:13,560
into a small but definitive clinical trial and prove that this really can do something

1004
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:19,080
beneficial in the right context and then from there you can think about kind of you know

1005
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:26,360
expanding the indication to general health betterment. Who's the natural owner funding wise of this

1006
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:31,960
investigation I mean is NIH is this a question NIH is interested in I mean

1007
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:38,280
indirectly through the ITP, Rich Miller, Randy Strong et al. have already done an NR test

1008
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:45,400
in their very rigorous tried and true model as you know that failed right so NR did not extend life.

1009
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:52,760
Is NIH still interested in this question enough to continue funding it do you

1010
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:57,080
you know where is your funding for this level of investigation coming from?

1011
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:07,400
You know we mainly try to help the real NAD expert labs by you know doing the flux studies

1012
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:16,200
facilitating measurements but you know it's not the bread and butter of my life I'm probably about

1013
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:22,280
an observer at the same level as you of this this field broadly speaking. I think you know there's

1014
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:30,040
there's money at NIH for interesting science and so this is too central to metabolism and too

1015
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:35,240
much public health interest for you know. So you're not worried that you're not worried this is not

1016
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:39,400
going to run up against this? No and I think biotech is interested in this and you know there's

1017
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:45,000
very interesting ways to do this pharmacologically and so we may see those mature faster you know

1018
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:51,160
CD38 inhibitors obviously there's a whole different financial structure there right if you can make a

1019
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:59,320
patent approved you know medicine and all that economic incentive is is great for driving first

1020
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:04,200
you know science answers and then clinical answers. What are the top labs right now in your mind in

1021
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:12,760
in studying NAD and its and its precursors or ways to increase it? Oh gosh I think I'm too much

1022
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:17,880
of an outsider to get into naming names on that I'm gonna only get myself in trouble other than

1023
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:23,960
credit other than to credit Joe Bauer for being a fantastic collaborator. Yeah you'll fail to

1024
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:27,880
mention somebody fair enough fair enough. Okay let's pivot to the final thing I want to really

1025
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:33,000
get into Josh which is cancer metabolism it kind of ties in so much of what we've talked about and

1026
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,880
that's how you and I reconnected five or six years ago at a conference and then obviously number of

1027
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:45,880
times since then. So you know the irony of it is right you do your PhD in the inner workings of

1028
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:50,040
how the immune system works but you're not particularly interested in cancer at the time

1029
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:58,600
you you you you come back to academia as a metabolomics experiment as an as a metabolomics

1030
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:05,160
expert and now you've kind of wound your way back to oncology in a way. So tell me a little

1031
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:10,440
bit about that journey right how did you go from this profound interest in metabolism metabolomics

1032
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:16,840
and flexomics to realizing a beautiful application for this is in the field of oncology.

1033
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:26,120
Yeah I think you know part of it is really the human connection and I was so fortunate to

1034
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:33,320
be at Princeton which is this kind of academic bubble where I could do my experiments on E. coli

1035
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:39,880
and yeast and really set up these good metabolic measurements unmolested but then you know

1036
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:48,760
also we're close to Penn and at some point I got a call from the head of the Penn Cancer Center

1037
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:54,040
at that point in time Craig Thompson saying he wanted to visit and he just of course I just say

1038
01:52:54,040 --> 01:53:00,440
yes you know it's a simple one and that was kind of a life-changing call for me because it brought

1039
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:07,480
me into the world of biomedicine you know again basically in the context of working on cancer

1040
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:14,440
metabolism and it was very natural because if you look at the history of cancer therapy right

1041
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:22,520
you know the first great rational triumph in treating cancer was antifolates and Sydney

1042
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:30,040
Farber and you know name memorialized on the Dana Farber Cancer Center right and so this is really

1043
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:36,760
the origins of how cancer was rationally treated by targeting metabolism and it just got

1044
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:44,440
understudied for so many years and it was a very natural re-entry point for me because cancer you

1045
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:50,440
can study as isolated cells in a culture dish much as we were studying E. coli and yeast

1046
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:57,640
and so that was much more comfortable to me in you know the 2008 or whatever time frame

1047
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:02,200
than you know starting to work on mice and I'm delighted that we got back to mice a few years

1048
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:07,960
after that. What year did Craig leave Penn to go to Memorial Sloan Kettering? Must have been shortly

1049
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:17,240
after he invited you over right? Yeah a few years after I think so yeah. So people like Craig who I

1050
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:23,480
have not had on the podcast but I'd love to but Lou who I have you know when you think about cancer

1051
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:28,440
metabolism today I mean it's just a booming field right I mean I would argue and no disrespect to

1052
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:33,640
people in different fields but that cancer metabolism and immunotherapy are really two

1053
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:39,160
of the most promising and exciting areas in the field today which were two things we didn't have

1054
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:46,120
a single word about in medical school right? Yeah that's absolutely true except you know maybe some

1055
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:54,600
anti-metabolites for cancer hit in some way in the pharmacology book you know but yeah I think

1056
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,880
you know one of the most exciting things going to be interface of those two fields

1057
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,480
also and we see this with you know microbiome composition being predictive of whether

1058
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:09,880
immunotherapy works amazing work from Jennifer Wargo showing that you know fiber can promote

1059
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:15,240
the effectiveness of immunotherapy and so we're seeing that connection all soluble or insoluble?

1060
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:22,360
TBD okay so we're very excited to work on that answer and then you know

1061
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:29,720
there are different flavors of soluble fiber and so I have my pet dreams for how this may work

1062
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:37,240
mechanistically but I think it's going to be an incredibly important interface. Wow so tell folks

1063
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:43,640
a little bit about what it is about cancer cells that makes their metabolism distinct from their

1064
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,640
non-cancer counterparts but within the same tissue even like if you want to compare adenocarcinoma

1065
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:55,160
of the colon or breast or prostate and look at the perfectly normal non-cancer cell sitting right

1066
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:59,480
next to it I mean we we typically talk about two hallmarks of cancer right we talk about the

1067
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:03,720
inability to respond to cell cycles signaling so this is why these silly things just keep growing

1068
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:08,520
even when they're told stop growing and then the capacity to metastasize to basically pick up leave

1069
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:17,560
go grow in a new site but what is it about them metabolically that also is a piece of their

1070
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:26,600
signature? Well cancers tend to be glucose users and you know once you step back and think that

1071
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:33,480
you know in the fasted state in particular using glucose is a weird thing rather than a default

1072
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:40,520
thing okay and that the default thing is to use fat and lactate then the fact that cancer uses

1073
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:51,000
glucose is very distinctive and they do this in large part because they're programmed internally

1074
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,800
to basically feel like they're always seeing insulin and this is through mutations and

1075
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:00,360
something called the PI3 kinase pathway that Lou Cantley who you mentioned you know pioneered

1076
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:06,280
and this leads to the fact they're positive on this FDG PET scan so they'll constantly take up

1077
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:11,000
and phosphorylate and trap glucose or glucose analogs and this is actually the most sensitive

1078
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:19,960
way to detect most types of cancer downstream from this though there's a ton of metabolic changes

1079
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:28,520
in the cancer cells and you know the most fundamental of these is the fact that in order

1080
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:33,960
to do the uncontrolled growth they have to do uncontrolled nucleic acid synthesis

1081
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:40,040
and this is the vulnerability that was targeted initially by Farber but has been targeted by a

1082
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:46,280
lot of very important medications that are you know widely used still today you know Pematrexa

1083
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:51,320
is first line treatment for lung cancer and if you get these medications right you can induce

1084
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:57,480
mutations through you know the metabolic stress on the nucleotide system and this can make

1085
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:04,840
immunotherapy work better and so that's a very exciting part and I think that part has gotten

1086
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:10,760
understudied as cancer metabolism has you know returned to the fore there's been a lot of focus

1087
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:16,840
on fuel usage cutoff which is tough because like most cells in the body cancer cells can use a lot

1088
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:21,080
of different types of fuels depending on what's available yeah this is an important point Josh

1089
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:26,760
because a lot of people I think would hear the first part of what you're saying and their natural

1090
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:32,120
conclusion would be well wait a minute if you know you do a PET scan on somebody and it lights

1091
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:39,640
up with glucose that tells me cancer loves glucose ergo the way to treat cancer don't eat glucose

1092
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:45,880
the problem with that logic is no matter how little glucose you eat you still have plenty

1093
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:51,000
of glucose in your circulation I mean even if you're in a complete state of starvation again

1094
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:56,600
going back to George Cahill 40 days of starvation they still had three millimole of glucose and

1095
01:58:56,600 --> 01:59:02,040
their circulation 40 days out so there is no way to eliminate glucose now an argument could be but

1096
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:06,680
you're going to minimize insulin so I guess the question becomes is minimizing insulin actually

1097
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:14,680
more important than minimizing glucose but the idea of starving cancer seems potentially overly

1098
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:20,520
simplistic right based on everything we've already talked about yeah I think starving cancer is very

1099
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:26,840
very hard and as you say getting circulating glucose to go meaningfully down below you know

1100
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:36,040
the healthy 89 where you last measured yourself is very very difficult and even if you could do

1101
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:41,240
that it's not going to prevent the cancers from having access to internally stored fuel for a while

1102
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:47,080
in the form of glycogen and then ultimately into amino acid fuel and fat fuel and lactate fuel

1103
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:54,200
ketone body fuel and we've shown very clearly that cancer can use all of those things okay so

1104
01:59:54,840 --> 02:00:02,520
they're they're all valid inputs they can't replace glucose in the test tube but you know

1105
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:09,640
it's not easy to cut off the cancer fuel supply especially not without cutting off some other

1106
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:14,440
critical fuel supply the immune cell fuel supply right which would be a disaster or the brain fuel

1107
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:21,160
supply which would be an even more acute disaster this idea that there's a way to exploit

1108
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:29,240
the metabolic I don't want to say limitation but I would just say quirk of cancer in a way that

1109
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:34,680
also augments the immune system say a bit more about that because that's both fascinating

1110
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:42,440
intellectually but also elegant in that it's mechanistically in line with a bias I have

1111
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:50,920
which is cancer is really going to be hard to you know get under control so you know hoping for

1112
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:57,160
a stalemate where you use multiple modes of action is probably a better strategy than hitting really

1113
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:04,440
hard on one lever again it's a bias of mine but you know at least I can acknowledge it yeah well

1114
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:09,960
I think we're seeing a lot of moves to try to make cancer into a chronic disease where the therapies

1115
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:18,920
are not so terrible and you know certainly hitting the nucleic acid side of cancer as

1116
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:23,400
line people are trying for you know maintenance therapy and I think we need to think about that

1117
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:31,640
whole side of cancer metabolism fresh because I think there are targets waiting to be developed

1118
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:38,520
there I think you know if they create nucleotide imbalances which is a natural thing to do when

1119
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:44,440
you hit that system then nucleotide imbalances are drivers of mutations and mutations in cancer

1120
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:52,280
cells are drivers of immune response to cancer so that's one very appealing avenue so in other

1121
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:59,720
words interrupt their ability to synthesize DNA they will create more mutations more mutations

1122
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:06,840
is more shots on goal for the immune system exactly so I think that's one really exciting

1123
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:14,920
avenue another exciting avenue is to apply a very strong stress to the cancer while putting

1124
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:19,640
pressure on their fuel supply and so I think it's very hard to think that you're going to put so

1125
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:27,480
much pressure on the fuel supply okay that that alone is going to make the tumor slow or even more

1126
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:33,800
optimistically regress or something but if you come in with chemotherapy for example that's already

1127
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:40,120
targeted preferentially not perfectly right to the tumor and then you pair that with something

1128
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:47,400
like ketogenic diet which is lowering insulin lowering glucose then we at least see in animal

1129
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:53,800
models that this can be a very powerful combination we see that the tumors start to deplete glucose in

1130
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:58,200
response to the chemotherapy whether that's because their vasculature is breaking down

1131
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:02,600
or whether that's because they have heightened glucose demand because they're having mitochondrial

1132
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:08,520
damage from the chemotherapy I'm not sure but we see that chemotherapy lowers glucose in the tumor

1133
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:14,840
intrinsically and then if you come in with a diet that lowers glucose availability this becomes

1134
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:21,320
stronger all right and then you can get to really low tumor glucose and we see pretty big

1135
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:27,080
improvements in outcome in mouse experiments hopefully they'll translate to the clinic we

1136
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:33,160
have a clinical trial open on this now and what's the best tool we have besides the conventional

1137
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:38,120
and maybe it is simply the conventional in terms of ways to inter interfere with their nucleic acid

1138
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:41,800
this is synthesis is it literally just going back to old school chemotherapeutics that do that

1139
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:48,520
well for the moment right yes I mean for the moment hematrexate is probably the most successful

1140
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:57,720
clinical agent but you know uh gemcytobine and uh you know other things of this sort are you know

1141
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:05,000
all well used as part of the armamentarium but I think we need to think fresh I mean I'll say on

1142
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:12,680
this front it's really interesting to me that when we were in medical school you know I thought we

1143
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:19,400
would not see a cure in our lifetimes for hepatitis yeah and look at that and that was

1144
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:25,560
mainly nucleoside analogues I mean I remember being told like there were two things that are

1145
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:30,440
absolutely because I remember talking about this as why can't there be a vaccine for hep c and it's

1146
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:34,680
like you you'll never be able to vaccinate a flavivirus okay well that still turns out to be true

1147
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:42,360
but you'll never cure hep c and yeah lo and behold and this is just nucleoside analogues as

1148
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:48,680
the centerpiece of this right and so the fact that there's clearly untapped potential there

1149
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:55,240
now maybe that potential was maxed out you know 40 years ago uh you know when people were doing

1150
02:04:55,240 --> 02:05:00,040
this hardcore for cancer from the cancer but not hepatitis perspective but but my guess is that

1151
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:06,120
that's all chemistry that's evolved a lot and that this is a ripe area for for rediscovery

1152
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:09,320
well it's interesting you mentioned gemcytobine because of course that's you know one of the

1153
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:13,240
first line agents for pancreatic cancer and if I if I'm not mistaken you have a particularly

1154
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:16,600
keen clinical interest in pancreatic adenocarcinoma is that correct

1155
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:23,800
yeah it's the cancer that I've worked on the most uh it's obviously just a horrible disease um you

1156
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:30,200
know it's definitely one of the cancers that gives cancer a bad name it's um it's the fourth leading

1157
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:36,280
cause of cancer death in both men and women and yet by incidence it's a fraction of that right

1158
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:42,520
it's it just speaks to how lethal it is um you know the last time I looked Josh I would say that

1159
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:49,640
adenocarcinoma the pancreas is 95% lethal and I've heard people argue that the 5% who don't die are

1160
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:56,440
misdiagnosed almost suggesting that it's pretty much impossible to survive pancreatic adenocarcinoma

1161
02:05:56,440 --> 02:06:03,720
which is the worst thought in the world um so you certainly picked a tough one to study

1162
02:06:04,120 --> 02:06:13,480
yeah I mean I feel a very strong commitment to it because of a bunch of reasons and you know but

1163
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:20,840
just the fact that it's so terrible is a motivation and I think it's you know was a disease that for

1164
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:27,240
a long time people it's just so terrible we just give up and you know I don't think that's the

1165
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:33,800
right attitude for terrible diseases and you know I think the one of the hardest things in

1166
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:42,200
making biomedical progress is getting a clinical readout and you know the hidden positive and how

1167
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:47,880
terrible this disease is is the clinical readout is just sitting there itching to be improved and so

1168
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:54,680
there's the capacity to do really compelling clinical tests of any idea and it's a terrible

1169
02:06:54,680 --> 02:07:00,760
disease most of these uh you know clinical efforts are going to fail but they can be done

1170
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:05,880
relatively fast relatively cost effectively and we're seeing progress I mean that's what's so

1171
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:12,760
exciting that you know fulfurenox is progress a lot of patients tumors respond even more will

1172
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:20,520
respond if you combine uh two agents that were approved uh gem cytobine and abraxane um which is

1173
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:27,720
albium and balanform apaclitaxel uh with a platinum agent that triple combination

1174
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:34,920
produces regressions in most patients tumors um but they're not durable I mean that's they're

1175
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:43,000
not durable okay but the duration of response is terrible right now but the fact there's response

1176
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:50,600
is promise okay and I think in the anyway normally from my perspective once you can start

1177
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:55,960
seeing response you're on the road we have to figure out how to make the response durable I

1178
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:02,440
hope that's where the metabolic part becomes important it's going to be some interface of

1179
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:09,640
the metabolic part or the immune part or a yet harder hit with you know chemo radiotherapy

1180
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:16,200
earlier diagnosis these are the hopes for for fixing this is there something about pancreatic

1181
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:23,800
adenocarcinoma that you've observed metabolically that is distinct from other gastrointestinal

1182
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:30,760
adenocarcinomas I think you know colon is also a terrible disease liver is also a terrible disease

1183
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:38,280
so all the gastrointestinal you know adenocarcinomas are unfortunately really bad diseases but at least

1184
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:44,520
with those stage one can be I mean certainly stage one colorectal cancer is survivable

1185
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:49,640
a pedocellular is a bit tougher you know you're but you're better than a coin toss but you know

1186
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:56,520
again coming back to pancreatic stage one is 80 to 85 percent not survivable I've always wondered

1187
02:08:56,520 --> 02:09:04,040
what is it about pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is so difficult and is it simply that its rate

1188
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:10,920
of early metastasis is so early that stage one is just sort of a misnomer term it's not there's

1189
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:18,120
such a thing as stage one I think that's a big part of it it's kind of a soft organ the pancreas

1190
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:26,040
and you get the it's a very invasive cancer and you can have local invasions so many places from

1191
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:30,440
that site plus immediate access to the portal system that's just seeding the liver constant

1192
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:38,040
it's just seeding the liver and so it's anatomically a really problematic location for keeping the

1193
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:49,160
cancer self-contained so I think the other thing is that you know metabolically it's a very tricky

1194
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:54,760
cancer it's almost solely driven by mutations of the Ras oncogene not saying there aren't other

1195
02:09:54,760 --> 02:10:01,560
drivers but almost every patient has this Ras driver and this is an instruction manual for the

1196
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:10,040
cancer cells not just to divide but to do a bunch of metabolic things that involve scavenging

1197
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:15,400
nutrients from the environment and taking in nutrients in non-standard ways and so it actually

1198
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:22,840
instructs the cancer cells to reach out arms pull in nutrients internalize them degrade

1199
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:30,120
macromolecule nutrients from the environment and use this as kind of a garbage recycling form

1200
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:36,440
of nutrient access that that makes them very metabolically pernicious the other thing that

1201
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:43,080
we see that's really interesting in new work and mouse models of pancreatic cancer is that

1202
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:52,040
they don't have to be very metabolically active in order to be horribly lethal so the pancreas

1203
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:59,880
is a master protein producing organ and you may think insulin is most famous protein to come out

1204
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:05,320
of the pancreas right but the bulk of the pancreas is not you know beta cells that make insulin

1205
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:10,600
it's only five percent of it yeah that's right the exocrine is the real gland and the exocrine

1206
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:16,440
pancreas is just making digestive enzymes like crazy it does by far the fastest protein synthesis

1207
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:23,800
in the body the cancer turns that protein synthesis way down so it's not hyper metabolic

1208
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:30,280
it's just that it has this huge capacity to make stuff that even when it turns it down

1209
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:35,640
still has enough biosynthetic capacity to grow and divide and grow and divide

1210
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:41,960
because it's turned down its main energy consuming normal function of protein synthesis it can

1211
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:49,800
function with much reduced tca activity reduced atp synthesis rates and so it's amazing that it's

1212
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:57,880
very efficient then very very efficient so it can turn down all these normal functions and it

1213
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:05,000
still has the capacity to reproduce the cells and make these horribly invasive and metastatic cells

1214
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:13,960
which are ultimately lethal of all the epithelial cancers today for which we don't have a cure which

1215
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:19,320
is almost every one of them right shy of like a gist or something like that or certain testicular

1216
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:27,640
cancers is there one that you're more optimistic about in terms of metabolic approaches to therapy

1217
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,520
it's a great question

1218
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:31,660
um

1219
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:41,000
I mean you see pematrex said being used effectively in lung cancer right and I think you see the

1220
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:47,720
cancers with mutational burdens being the ones where you're getting the good immunotherapy

1221
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:54,200
responses whether they're ones that are particularly susceptible intrinsically to metabolic effects

1222
02:12:54,840 --> 02:13:02,840
I don't know I don't think that's going to be the standalone heart of treating any of these

1223
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:10,680
cancers I think it's more going to be a key piece of the puzzle in getting enough either drug killing

1224
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:17,720
by preventing their metabolic escape mechanisms or enough immune activity and those may be kind of

1225
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:24,280
opposites so you may need also kind of cyclic therapies where you go through rounds of

1226
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:32,760
metabolic suppression in order to keep things calm while you can and then periods of metabolic

1227
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:39,080
augmentation that are really directed at augmenting the immune system and I'm a big believer that you

1228
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:44,360
know there's metabolic limitations on immune response to cancer and that if we can overcome

1229
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:51,000
them we will have major therapeutic benefits you know you mentioned RAS in the context of

1230
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:58,360
pancreatic carcinoma RAS is rarely immunogenic in the pancreas right it's it's it's a driver

1231
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:03,080
mutation but the immune system it doesn't produce back to the way we started our discussion it

1232
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:09,240
doesn't give us a beautiful little 9 to 11 amino acid peptide it gets presented on an MHC class

1233
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:17,160
molecule right it's a great irony of this whole thing yeah you need more shots on goal you need

1234
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:22,680
more antigens do you have any sense of how many tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are typically

1235
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:32,920
identified at all in resected pancreatic specimens I think it's typically quite the lymphocyte desert

1236
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:38,680
there's a ton of macrophage activity in pancreatic cancer and so I think macrophage

1237
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:44,680
rewiring is going to be you know a big part of allowing lymphocytes to enter

1238
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:51,800
and these are areas where I think metabolism can be quite impactful well Josh this is a

1239
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:55,880
super interesting I hate that we're ending on somewhat a depressing note is there

1240
02:14:56,440 --> 02:15:01,480
is there anything more optimistic that we want to talk about than pancreatic adenocarcinoma beyond

1241
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:05,960
you know the statement that hey look you know this is why we have the smartest people working

1242
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:12,760
on the hardest problems but anything else within cancer metabolism specifically that

1243
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:21,400
you think boy 10 years from now like I'm really optimistic that we're going to have a new way to

1244
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:30,040
you know hack into their DNA synthesis pathway in a corrupt manner that just spits out mutations

1245
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:34,440
using kind of novel systems right you know I don't know if andy gets any sense all

1246
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:39,080
like a nucleotide it's like just something that totally disrupts them in a selective manner

1247
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:48,600
you know I think my big hope on this front is that we're going to be able to have some combination of

1248
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:56,600
directed metabolic immune supplements and diet that really work with therapy to treat cancer

1249
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:02,920
I mean cancer is such a discrete disease the clinical trials are so manageable and the fact

1250
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:08,520
that things are metabolically messed up in the tumors so incredibly clear and they're so clearly

1251
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:15,080
messed up in a way that's favoring the wrong kind of immune cells and so ultimately through either

1252
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:20,440
some sort of supplement or diet we're going to be able to reverse that and we're going to make

1253
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:26,600
immunotherapy work instead of for 10 percent of patients for a majority of patients so that's my

1254
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:33,640
uplifting thought for you is that metabolism will be part along with you know you know better

1255
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:39,640
pure immunological therapies of getting immune control of cancer over the coming decade

1256
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:47,400
and besides reducing insulin which is such an obvious strategy are there other metabolic

1257
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:55,240
levers to pull with the diet because really between ketogenic diets and cyclic fasting

1258
02:16:55,240 --> 02:17:00,840
those are kind of the two ways that you do that do you see evidence of amino acid restriction

1259
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:07,480
or any other nutrient restriction that could potentially play a role I think amino acids are

1260
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:15,560
you know complicated but they hold a lot of potential I think the type of fat can be important

1261
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:22,840
you know the saturated unsaturated fat are really different and in cancer they're going to play you

1262
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:27,080
know different roles so it's very nice work from Matt van der Heidens lab showing that you know a

1263
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:33,160
higher saturated fat ketogenic diet could be more tumor suppressive in some context because

1264
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:39,320
the tumors have trouble making unsaturated fat in the context of hypoxia say more about that I

1265
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:44,760
wasn't aware of that so Matt I know Matt's worked very well of course is is he still at Dana Farber?

1266
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:51,800
He's at the coke at MIT so he's actually head of the the coke now okay and was this in prostate

1267
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:59,640
cancer this was oh I forget what cancer background he did it and I think it was in pancreatic at least

1268
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:06,200
in part but I'm not 100 sure okay so that's super interesting so a ketogenic diet that was higher in

1269
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:14,600
saturated fat posed a greater problem for the cancer cells because they couldn't make presumably

1270
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:24,040
the essential unsaturated fats exactly so I think this is a interesting strategy I mean those

1271
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:33,240
effects were relatively subtle up to now but you know it could be part of the picture you know I

1272
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:42,680
think the really exciting part of the diet is also the parts that connect to the microbiome so I think

1273
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:49,160
the fiber part really working that out and maybe total protein matters in ways that we don't

1274
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:55,880
understand and needs to be much like you know maybe we need to not just think about cycling

1275
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:01,480
fasting and feeding but cycling you know for example there's a time maybe when you want to

1276
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:05,320
come in with a lot of carbs in the absence of protein and that may achieve something that

1277
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:11,640
creates a particular immune milieu and then you know you need protein in the right timing after

1278
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:16,040
that so there's a lot of things we can do with timing of macronutrients that can be interesting

1279
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:20,440
and it seems like an eternity before we'd be ready to study this in a human clinical trial

1280
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:26,840
because the permutations are so many so do you feel like we have high throughput animal models

1281
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:34,120
where we can test these hypotheses and say you know hey this is one way to do this and

1282
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:40,200
you know or we've looked at 10 ways to do this in animals but these are the three most promising so

1283
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:46,360
we're going to kind of go ahead and do these now. Yeah I think you know the good animal models of

1284
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:52,360
cancer are still not that high throughput and there's a lot of challenges converting animal

1285
02:19:52,360 --> 02:20:00,760
diet and human diet right and so you know we'll come out with some work showing that you know

1286
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:08,520
some of the most exciting dietary combinations are absolutely effective in animals but they're not

1287
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:14,200
effective through the mechanisms that people thought before and it's you know it's because the

1288
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:19,000
even in animals trying to get the diets aligned so that you really isolate variables is tough

1289
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:23,080
but I think the fact that we're asking these questions that haven't been asked before

1290
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:32,920
is going to build momentum and we're gonna we're gonna build this interface out over the next

1291
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:39,640
five-year period in animals and we'll do clinical work you know as a field in parallel with that

1292
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:47,640
that has an impact and has an impact on patients lives within the five to ten-year timeline I hope.

1293
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:55,640
Do you worry that the challenges of even if you came up with the right diet so let's just assume

1294
02:20:55,640 --> 02:21:02,680
10 years from now the answer is a cyclic ketogenic diet that has this much saturated fat this much

1295
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:08,680
monounsaturated fat this much polyunsaturated fat this much glucose on this day this much protein

1296
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:13,960
on that day like you the formula exists right so this is almost an impossible thing but that

1297
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:21,720
it's impossible to adhere to in the way that you know a pill or a drug or an infusion is much easier

1298
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:29,160
or do you think that in cancer because the stakes are so high adherence will be unlike it is in any

1299
02:21:29,160 --> 02:21:35,480
other field of medicine? No we have to make it simple right I mean this has to be clinically

1300
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:44,360
actionable and but you know I would go much more back to the first question that we asked you asked

1301
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:49,480
maybe when I first mentioned the potential of immunotherapy and fiber like is it soluble fiber

1302
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:55,240
is it insoluble fiber and then there really are different flavors of soluble fiber and maybe it's

1303
02:21:55,240 --> 02:22:00,440
the gammish of them or maybe it's one in particular maybe it's one isolated molecule

1304
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:06,920
that relates to that and then we have one isolated molecule tiny molecule that will more than double

1305
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:12,680
the number of complete responses you get to immunotherapy and mice one tiny molecule smaller

1306
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:21,160
than glucose okay we already have that as a as a metabolite okay and so I think we're going to get

1307
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:27,240
a to it could almost be simple supplements as opposed to whole cell dietary changes.

1308
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:33,560
Supplements the dietary changes maybe in a very acute way just the way the patient comes in the

1309
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:38,760
hospital for you know tough about a chemotherapy or a tough surgery maybe we're going to go to a

1310
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:46,840
place where we take people's glucose in the hospital almost down to zero for 12 hours you

1311
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:53,480
know with a deep ketosis and some pharmacotherapy at the time that we hit them really hard with

1312
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:59,800
chemo and 24 hours of that it's like night and day in terms of the overall effect but it can't

1313
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:04,920
be asking patients to give up eating and giving up the joy of food or another trial that we're

1314
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:12,840
starting now is a trial with sglt2 inhibitor plus a low carbohydrate but not fully ketogenic diet

1315
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:18,120
to see if it can put people in ketosis and then just looking forward to would this be a convenient

1316
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:23,400
way to get the benefits of ketosis in cancer patients while still allowing them to have a

1317
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:28,040
little bit of you know breaking bread with the family. Last question for you is totally random

1318
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:31,400
I don't know what maybe just think of this Princeton is the only ivy league school that

1319
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:36,360
doesn't have a medical school correct? I think that's right. Is there I mean that there's got

1320
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:40,920
to be a deliberate reason for that it has it's Princeton is fantastic in everything do you do

1321
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:47,880
you know why it doesn't have a medical school and is it just the proximity to Penn or that it was

1322
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:52,920
assumed that there that's where the collaborations would be? I mean Princeton doesn't have a medical

1323
02:23:52,920 --> 02:24:00,040
school because at its heart Princeton is a hybrid of a college and a university and it is an

1324
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:07,960
institution that you know has the ultimate priority under undergraduate education it's

1325
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:14,600
committed to that it's best in world in that and so I think

1326
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:22,280
in assessing how to be best in world at undergraduate education the Princeton

1327
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:29,000
administration many times has asked the question is having medicine on campus part of that and the

1328
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:36,280
answer has always been no let's have a somewhat more pure intellectual environment and keep our

1329
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:40,680
focus on doing the very best training for undergraduates and so it's a very conscious

1330
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:44,120
not a business school either and I guess it's the same argument right there's no business school

1331
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:49,960
there's no law school so that's Princeton it makes it very special and it's good to have special

1332
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:55,400
places that are you know distinct I think that's a wonderful thing. Are you at all a fan of Richard

1333
02:24:55,400 --> 02:25:03,240
Feynman's work? At a very light level I guess I would say that's the best way to put it. But

1334
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:09,400
there aren't places around Princeton that you go to see where you know he you know what eating

1335
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:13,640
club he was in or things like that you don't you don't you don't look for the old places.

1336
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:23,560
No I'm not I'm not a fan that way I guess there I read the giant biography of Oppenheimer and

1337
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:31,400
they're filming the film of that on campus so Matt Damon was apparently on campus I'm guessing

1338
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:36,760
he's playing Oppenheimer but I haven't checked anyway so but I guess I've become a small Oppenheimer

1339
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:44,280
fan after reading reading that intensive book. I have three of Feynman's books meaning like books

1340
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:49,160
that were actually his so I have his table of integrals from when he was in high school

1341
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:55,400
and then two more advanced calculus books one from when he was at Princeton and then one from

1342
02:25:55,400 --> 02:26:01,880
when he was his first professorship professorship at Cornell and that it's just they're sacred to

1343
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:07,320
me right it's like his scribblings like his notes all over these things signed Richard P. Feynman and

1344
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:13,320
like what you know what his address was and things like that so yeah I've never I've never made the

1345
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:17,320
pilgrimage to look for his eating club and things like that it probably doesn't even exist anymore

1346
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:23,800
but I just wondered if you'd been the been on the tour. No but you should come down there definitely

1347
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:33,960
have been some you know awesome Princetonians you know I guess my kids all went nursery school

1348
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:40,280
in the building where von Neumann built the first computer so you know there's it is amazing the

1349
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:45,720
amount of stuff that happened around here. Well Josh so great to see you again and I hope it's

1350
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:50,520
not too long before I see you in person again but really appreciate first of all the amazing work

1351
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:55,160
that you've done over the past 20 plus years and and sitting down to to share it with us today.

1352
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:59,160
That's been fun I appreciate the opportunity.
