00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:13,880
Hey Steven, thank you so much for coming over. As we were talking about, I don't really do many

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,200
of these in person anymore, often just out of sheer laziness, but I do enjoy it a lot more.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,160
So the fact that I know it was a bit of a hassle, you had to probably change clinic or something

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,960
today, but anyway, really appreciate you coming out. And this is a topic that, you know, I think

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,440
everybody has questions on this topic and everybody, myself included, is comically ignorant on this

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
topic. I mentioned to you a few minutes ago, the extent to my knowledge from medical school,

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,600
I remember there's an optic nerve. I remember it's a cranial nerve. I think it's even the second

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,920
cranial nerve. There you go. You're ahead of the game. I remember something called a fovea. Right.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,480
And I know there's a blind spot, but I've kind of forgotten why. So it's safe to say my knowledge

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,760
of this topic right now is probably at par with everybody's right. Well, that's, you know, not

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,200
rare, frankly, because the eye is so literally compartmentalized. We just don't interact that

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,560
much with other specialties. So it's not rare for people who are in other specialties to be very

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,720
ignorant of the eyeball. And that's fine because I think it'll help us keep the level of discussion

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,160
at an approachable level for everyone. Has there ever been a discussion about suggesting that

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,760
ophthalmologists don't need to do the four year MD degree? Like how much of what you learned in

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,240
medical school became relevant in your residency? Actually quite a lot. Honestly. Yeah. Because you

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,760
think about it, the eyeball, there's really nothing specifically magical about the eyeball. It's got

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,800
neurological tissue in the back, actual brain tissue in the back. It's got a vascular supply.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,920
There are a lot of crossovers to other medical disciplines. All of the cellular processes are

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,520
the same. We operate adjacent to the eye. I think it's important for us to have a general sense of

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,680
medical knowledge, particularly because so many systemic diseases manifest as eye problems. There

23
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,760
is a discipline of medical training or of visual training, basically optometry, which deals with

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,360
the eye, but not all of the surgical stuff. So we work in a collaborative fashion with optometrists.

25
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,480
And those are the folks who are fitting glasses, they're screening for eye disease, they're

26
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,920
handling preoperative and postoperative care. In many cases, they're treating some diseases that

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,320
are specific to the eye, like glaucoma, for example. And we work in a collaborative fashion with them.

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,520
And does everyone in an ophthalmology residency spend time operating? There's no non-surgical

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,480
discipline to this, right? It doesn't bifurcate in the training?

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,720
Well, it does, actually. There are non-surgical ophthalmologists, but I think they all start out

31
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,800
as surgeons. To become an ophthalmologist, you're really training to become an eye surgeon. But there

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,440
are, for example, neuro-ophthalmologists, which are really more neurologists than neuro-ophthalmologists

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:23,880
than eye surgeons. In fact, it's typical that they don't do eye surgery. So there are some

34
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,720
ophthalmologists who don't do eye surgery. One of my lasting memories from residency was stealing

35
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,960
suture from the ophthalmology OR at Hopkins, because I guess for people who don't know,

36
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:46,040
the number of the suture, of course, gets larger. The suture gets smaller. So an o suture is like,

37
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,520
you can see how thick it is. It's like a piece of rope. One-oh, two-oh, three-oh. By the time you're

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,560
at four-oh, it's actually quite thin. Right. We use 11-oh. Exactly. In cardiac surgery,

39
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,240
you're using a seven-oh. Occasionally, there's some guys that would sew the distal end of a

40
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:09,000
coronary artery with an eight-oh. At that level, it's already very thin. Just the slightest tug too

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,480
much and it breaks. But then in ophthalmology, you guys were at 11-oh. So I used to steal 11-oh

42
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,760
constantly every night I was on call and practice suturing with 11-oh. The thinking being, if you

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,160
can tie an 11-oh with your hands and not tear it, that seven-oh, which normally is like a piece of

44
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,160
hair, is going to feel like a piece of rope. So I used it to help me develop a good feel for fine

45
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,080
suture. Yeah. And then I also realized I'm kind of being a schmuck here. I bet this 11-oh stuff's

46
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,400
really expensive and I'm just stealing it like there's taken to the call room all night.

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,120
More likely, it was probably 10-oh. But yes, it's, I mean, our tools are little tiny tools. And I can

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,960
remember, you know, our operating room when I was in training was sort of near the orthopedic surgery.

49
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,720
The exact opposite. And you hear this black and decker stuff going on over there. And our little

50
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,840
tiny tools are very, it's just a totally different. Is everything you do under a microscope

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,000
operationally? Like you don't operate with a naked eye, right? Right. I mean, there are, right. It's

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
all under a microscope. Either, you know, just to put it in a visual for people who may not be

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,400
familiar, we have a binocular microscope. So I'm looking through both eyes and this is either

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,680
mounted from the ceiling and has controlled by my feet. So the X, Y, and Z and the zoom focus are

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,520
controlled by a foot pedal. And that either comes from the ceiling or it's on a really large stand.

56
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:47,080
And so I'm sort of sitting, I'm looking straight ahead. But so the image is here, but I'm operating

57
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,160
down here. And it's interesting because sometimes my wife will kid me, I'll come home from a day of

58
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,920
surgery exhausted, but she said, she says something like, well, I don't really get it. You're just

59
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:06,440
sitting in a chair, sort of making these little tiny movements and there's soft music playing.

60
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,320
It all seems very, very sedate. It's incredibly stressful and exhausting. You do that.

61
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,080
Although I will say in your wife's defense, she has it harder because of the kids.

62
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah, that's true. For sure. There let there be no misunderstanding about that. It's way easier.

63
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,520
Well, actually I didn't realize, I never really thought about that, but the other advantage you

64
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,080
have is you don't have that cervical flexion problem that most surgeons have when they're in

65
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,680
an open, I mean, nowadays with more robotic and laparoscopic surgery, you can be in an advantage

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,320
neck position. But we have a different problem though. And that is that people tend to, and I

67
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,840
don't want to mess up the sound and microphone, but they tend to hyper extent. They tend to

68
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,880
to bring their head forward to come up to the oculars. Yeah. And that creates a whole other

69
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,360
set of problems. So there are ergonomic challenges for sure. And I remember early on in my career,

70
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,160
I was, I was coached very carefully on how to sit, how to have your spine arranged.

71
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,560
Don't crane your neck forward and make sure that your shoulders are down. It's, it's interesting

72
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,200
because when you train surgeons and you look at them, they're all sort of raising their shoulders

73
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,920
up and they're terrified that they're going to do something wrong. So they're in a very, very

74
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:29,320
compromised and stressful position. And then they tend to lift their hands up. So they're actually,

75
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,840
and again, I mentioned earlier that these are little tiny movements. So very small positional

76
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,680
changes can have a huge impact on the outcome of the surgery. Yeah. I have a number of friends,

77
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,160
two in particular from residency who have had multiple neck surgeries, including one that

78
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,880
required such significant extent of fusion that he could no longer operate. So he trained as a

79
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:59,320
cardiac surgeon and now does cardiac critical care. So still a great career, but after 10 years of

80
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,640
training as a cardiac surgeon, can't operate anymore. Yeah. I mean, surgery, it takes a toll

81
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,360
on the, on the surgeon for sure. So when you went to medical school, did you know you wanted to do

82
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,360
ophthalmology? Not really. I think I knew I wanted to do something surgical. I wanted to do

83
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,320
something with my hands. I'd kind of always been good with my hands and I could draw reasonably

84
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,120
well. And, and, and you get, as you kind of know, you get feedback early on in your surgical, in your

85
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,040
medical career. If you demonstrate that you're decent with your hands, people say, Hey, you're

86
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,680
pretty good with your hands. You should think about something surgical or maybe not. They say,

87
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,120
have you thought about radiology or something along those lines? And so I kind of knew that

88
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:50,600
I wanted to be a surgeon. Um, and, but really didn't know what type. And it was, I remember

89
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,480
a eureka moment where the first time I looked through what we refer to as a slit lamp, which

90
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,440
is basically like a microscope to look into the eye. The very first time I looked through that

91
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,840
instrument at an eyeball, I was hooked. I knew this is what I wanted to do. And that was something

92
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,480
you did during an ophthalmology rotation or were you doing an ER rotation and somebody came in with

93
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,760
something stuck in their eye? It was during an ophthalmology rotation and I'd had some exposure

94
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,240
to ophthalmology because a friend of mine's father was an ophthalmologist, quite a famous one. Um,

95
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,080
and I'd had a background in photography when I was a little kid, so I kind of understood optics well,

96
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,800
but that was during one of those one week, you know, do a little ophthalmology, do a little ear,

97
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,000
nose and throat, do a little bit of whatever it is. And that was, that was a nice thing about

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,360
medicine is that you kind of get to taste a little bit of everything before you decide you're going

99
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,000
down a particular pathway. So, um, it's funny, I didn't really overlap with ophthalmologists. So

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,520
you guys didn't do a general surgery internship, I'm guessing, right? Some of us do that. I did

101
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,400
what is referred to as a transitional residence, uh, internship where you do a little bit of

102
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,040
everything. You do general surgery, internal medicine, you, you know, you do a little bit

103
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,040
of everything and that's, that's very helpful. Um, and the, the general surgery part, I will

104
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,480
confess that was rough. I mean, as, as you well know, um, but it was nice to have exposure to

105
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,600
a little bit of everything. So, um, that that's probably a four year residency. I'm guessing

106
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,720
when you include the internship, that's right. Yeah. And, um, back in the day when you did it,

107
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,520
how, what was the bread and butter? You, you always kind of judge a discipline by what the

108
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,720
bread and butter is of the era, right? So general surgery, if you did it in the 1960s and 1970s,

109
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,400
the bread and butter would have been Bill Roth procedures and things like that, where,

110
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,240
you know, the most common thing you were doing was cutting out half of the stomach because of

111
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,360
peptic ulcer disease and things like that. By the time I got to residency, like I never did one of

112
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,240
those, right? Because, you know, H2 blockers and PPI is basically eliminated the need to surgically

113
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,080
remove part of the stomach for gastric or peptic ulcer. So, um, at the time you went through your

114
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,760
training, right? What was kind of the, where did 80% of the volume come from? What type of cases?

115
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, still cataracts, cataract surgery, and then retinal disease. Um, you know, the scourge

116
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,600
of essentially diabetes where you had these very, very complex retinal problems. Uh, so those were

117
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,120
really the, the two main ones. So this is probably a good moment to, to sort of take a step back and

118
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,400
get into some of the anatomy and get me up to speed and everybody else by extension on what it

119
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,560
is we are talking about here, because even the word retina, cornea, these are like, I kind of know the

120
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,000
retinas at the back of the eye that like, it's just embarrassing even how much of a

121
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,280
Luddite I am when it comes to this part of the body. So, um, I can say this literally talk to

122
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,440
me like I'm a four year old. Okay. All right. Explain the eye. That's good. That'll work for

123
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,280
both of us. So, you know, it's funny. It's funny you mentioned that because I don't typically see

124
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:16,040
kids in my practice, but there is one disease state where I do see kids. And that's because

125
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,920
we did some research in that area that anyway, allows me to see kids. And when you explain the

126
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:31,240
eye to a kid and you say, well, the eye is like a camera and the film in the back, that's the retina.

127
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:39,000
And they look over at their parents. Like, what is this guy talking about? What is he talking about?

128
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,840
Film. What is that? You know, a 50 year old understands that, but literally the eye is kind

129
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,200
of built like a camera where in the very front you have the cornea, which is kind of like the covering

130
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,480
on the front of a watch. That's the thing that a contact lens would sit on. And then the next thing

131
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,960
you encounter is the pupil, which is the hole in the iris behind that is the lens. We refer to it

132
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,160
as the lens, but it's really one of a couple of different lenses inside the eye. But the lens

133
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,760
behind the pupil, then you have the vitreous cavity and then in the very back, the retina,

134
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:25,240
which attaches to the optic nerve. And that's what goes to the brain. So images come in, they're bent

135
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:33,160
by the cornea first, then bent again by the lens. And then they focus hopefully on the retina. So in

136
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:40,520
a perfectly sized eye and someone who doesn't need spectacles to see images come from, say,

137
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,440
optical infinity, which is for the purposes of our discussion about 20 feet or beyond,

138
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,240
where light rays come in parallel and they're bent so that they fall perfectly on the retina.

139
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,840
And what does that mean? Fall perfectly on the retina? Meaning, yeah, they

140
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,960
is the like, if you think about the back of the eye here, right? What fraction of the back of this

141
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,080
fear is considered retina? All of it. Everything. Yeah. All of it. The whole back of the eye is

142
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:17,560
coded essentially by retina. But there is the fovea you mentioned earlier. That's the point

143
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,440
where you cast your gaze. So the image that of the thing you're looking at falls on the fovea,

144
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:32,520
which is the very center, the bullseye literally of the of the retina. So when I'm looking at you,

145
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:41,160
images from you are falling on the fovea of both of my retinas. Now, if someone is nearsighted,

146
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:52,520
those images come into focus in a point that is not exactly on the retina. And so that that can

147
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,120
become a problem. And nearsighted, again, the way I used to remember this, because this is literally

148
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,280
how little I know, nearsighted means you see things near well. Yes, that's right. And those are people

149
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,400
like me who need either glasses or contact lenses to see things at a distance. Correct. So this is,

150
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,960
you know, typical cocktail party banter. Someone will say, I think I'm nearsighted or maybe I'm

151
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:24,600
both nearsighted and farsighted. So nearsighted means you see better up close. Farsighted is a

152
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:33,240
little trickier because farsighted people see better at far, but their far might also be kind

153
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,880
of blurry. It's just that the near vision is even worse. So that person who says I'm neither I'm

154
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,240
near and farsighted could be that's an accurate statement. That's a plausible. No, it's actually

155
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,080
probably that they're what we refer to as presbyopic, which is that they see well far away,

156
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:59,240
but their focusing ability is compromised typically through age and they can't see up close.

157
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,120
And we'll get into that. I want to get to that in detail because I experienced that a few years ago

158
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,680
in a manner that rocked my world because it didn't happen gradually. Yeah, that's exactly.

159
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,880
It seemed to happen overnight. So yeah, it's funny you say that some people

160
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,360
wake up on their 40th birthday and they say, I just can't see up close anymore. And for others,

161
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:29,000
it's a little more gradual process. But the reason that comes into play is that when we are young,

162
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
when we're born, the lens of our eye is extremely elastic. It's like a gummy bear

163
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:46,280
and it can change shape to bring near objects into focus. But as we age, and this is universal,

164
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,960
the elasticity of the lens goes down and we're no longer able to sort of zoom focus in and you

165
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,840
have to start pushing things farther and farther away or get some sort of optical aid like a pair

166
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:10,760
of spectacles to see up close. That process continues as the lens becomes less elastic and

167
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:17,400
harder, eventually resulting in a cataract where it begins to lose its optical clarity.

168
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:26,920
So now you have a lens that's stiff, hard, and starts to become opaque. So that's kind of the

169
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:35,880
cataract is a disease of the lens. Correct. And it's a natural, I guess this is kind of a gray

170
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,800
area. Do we consider this to be a natural product of aging the way our skin wrinkles

171
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:48,760
and the elasticity changes, or is it considered a pathology in the way that type 2 diabetes is a

172
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,920
pathology, not necessarily a normal consequence of aging that can be avoided? Yeah, that's a really

173
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:04,040
good and interesting way to look at it. So I think that cataract formation is a universal component of

174
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:15,160
DOE days on earth. I don't recall seeing many people in their 70s without some degree of

175
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:23,480
cataract formation. It starts to become universal. However, there are things that can pathologically

176
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,040
prematurely cause cataract formation. Some of them are sort of surprising, like being electrocuted

177
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:38,760
can actually cause premature cataract formation, but that's one sort of exotic weird one. But trauma,

178
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,760
head trauma can certainly do it. Just head trauma, not necessarily eye trauma. Well,

179
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,800
you know, the head is kind of- I mean, obviously the eye is in the head. And if the head receives

180
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,200
trauma, there's going to be a certain amount of trauma in the eye itself. Right. But point is,

181
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,760
it doesn't have to be direct trauma to the eye. Correct. Simply the coo counter coo forces of the

182
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,720
brain are presumably also being reverberated through the vitreous fluid. That's exactly right.

183
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:13,960
So if you think about the eye as a fluid containing organ and when it receives trauma, and just as you

184
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,680
mentioned with coo and contra coo injuries of the brain inside the skull, I think those same forces

185
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:27,080
come to bear on the eye itself. So I think it's more common when you do have direct eye trauma,

186
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,600
but I think even head trauma alone can predispose someone to cataract formation. Certainly diabetes

187
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,920
is a cause of premature cataract formation. Steroid use, corticosteroid use can lead to

188
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,800
cataract formation. So is the lens a vascular structure? No, it is not. And the protein,

189
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,040
if you think about the lens, it's kind of the shape and about the size of an M&M candy,

190
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,280
just like a plain- The chocolate ones. Yeah, the chocolate ones, right? You know,

191
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,840
just the ones without the nuts or pretzels or whatever they're putting inside M&Ms now. But the,

192
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,520
you know, a plain M&M candy. Yeah. And it's got a coating kind of like the candy shell.

193
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:22,280
And the protein inside the chocolate is optically clear when you are a kid. And that protein does

194
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:29,400
not turn over or exchange, but the membrane, the candy coating, the so-called lens capsule

195
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,480
can allow molecules to diffuse in and out. So a classic example of this is someone will

196
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,920
point out, Hey, you know, my vision, my glasses prescription suddenly changed.

197
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,000
It, I became much more nearsighted or I became much more farsighted in the space of a month.

198
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,400
And I went to the eye doctor and they said, wow, your glasses are totally wrong. And the first

199
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:04,680
thing I think of is go get your blood sugar checked because glucose can diffuse into the lens,

200
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:12,200
cause it to swell. And that will change the shape of the lens. The lens becomes physically bigger.

201
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,480
So it's like a thicker, more powerful lens. So it's an osmotic change, basically.

202
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:24,120
And the timeframe for that to happen is over a period of several weeks. So if the blood sugar

203
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,720
goes up, it may, there may be a lag of a month or two before the vision changes. And when the blood

204
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,520
sugar goes down, same thing, it takes weeks for that to kind of go back to normal.

205
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,840
So is again, I'm just so I'm almost struggling to organize my thinking around this. But the other

206
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,760
thing that comes to my mind when you think about an a vascular structure is what is the immune?

207
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,520
What is the immune systems behavior around the eye? Are these immune privilege sites? Are they

208
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,160
more or less susceptible to certain types of infections, systemic infections, that is,

209
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,920
obviously, I know we'll probably talk a little bit about sort of local infections, but yeah,

210
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:11,320
I mean, the eye itself is certainly prone to to damage from systemic infection. There is a blood

211
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,040
retinal barrier in the same way that there's a blood brain barrier that protects that highly

212
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:25,080
metabolically active retina from systemic disease. But the lens itself is relatively privileged from

213
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,240
an immune standpoint. It's within that capsule and it's hard for large molecules to get across

214
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,440
that small molecules can. And that's why it's going to be important from a pharmacotherapy

215
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,720
standpoint. It is. It's in for example, there is a technology there's a there's a medication

216
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:51,080
that is a lipoic acid, choline ester that is being examined as a way of softening the lens

217
00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:00,280
to maybe break some of the disulfide bonds that become a problem and become one of the reasons

218
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,640
why the elasticity of the lens is lost. So you're saying there might be a day when there's either a

219
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,880
topical or injectable substrate that could go into the lens that could delay the onset of farsightedness

220
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,840
and the onset of cataract. That's the hope. This is sort of at the moment, it's a little bit of a

221
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,720
pipe dream because it's in the early experimental phase. But human trials have begun to look at the

222
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,760
lens softening properties of this particular compound. The trick is you've got to you've got

223
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,640
to use it in a topical fashion. So putting in an eye drop and that drop has to run the gauntlet

224
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:45,000
of going through the cornea, which has lipid layers and and water soluble layers. It's got to

225
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,200
get through all that into the aqueous humor in the front and then through the lens capsule into

226
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,520
the lens to actually do its work. And that's why it's that particular drug or compound is a choline

227
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,280
ester because that allows it to get through that the lipid layer in the front through the aqueous

228
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,680
through the water soluble portion of the cornea and then hopefully into the lens itself. And that's

229
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,200
not easy to do. So the lens is a relatively privileged area both from an immunological but

230
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,840
also a pharmacological standpoint. So that would help that would help it also stay clean stay clear.

231
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, you know, it's got a you want the lens to be optically clear. Let's go back to a little bit

232
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,520
of the front of the eye. So the pupil we all recognize is the dark part. Right. And it

233
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,600
you know, we talk about the dilation and constriction of the pupil. Is the pupil itself

234
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,040
actually changing in size or is it just that the iris is moving the colored part of the eye? Yeah.

235
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:48,120
Is is it dilation means it's actually moving back and constriction means it's actually closing.

236
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,320
That's that is correct. It's the physical aperture changes in size. It gets bigger,

237
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,400
it gets smaller. So when they when you go to the eye doctor and they dilate your pupils,

238
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:04,040
they are physically opening up the pupil pharmacologically. And that's mostly so we

239
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,000
can see into the back of the eyes. And you do that by forcing the iris to move out of the way.

240
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Correct. The iris has a it almost looks like the the like the the aperture of a of a camera. Yeah.

241
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,240
And so it you know, you can either constrict it or you can make it bigger. And interestingly,

242
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,160
one of the big pharmacological, I think, frontiers that were on the cusp of seeing

243
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,080
are drugs that intentionally shrink the aperture

244
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,360
in the pursuit of increased depth of focus. So students of photography will know that

245
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,480
the smaller the aperture, the smaller the hole, the more stuff is in focus at the same time.

246
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,600
So if you can make the pupil small pharmacologically and get it into the sweet spot,

247
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,960
which is probably about one point six millimeters, you can suddenly see up close again,

248
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,800
because you've you've expanded the depth of focus.

249
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Wait, this is let me make sure I understand this. You're saying that putting the lens aside for a

250
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:14,520
moment, which is a great source of the pathology, the inability of the lens to move in and out.

251
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,520
And that call it the Z axis, if we want to give it that way. You now have another way to manipulate

252
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,840
your ability to see things close up. If you could force the aperture to be in a position that is

253
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,120
isn't necessarily dictated by the availability of light.

254
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,960
That's exactly right. So imagine it's kind of like squinting.

255
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,120
Yeah.

256
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,400
You know, if you can you squint, you're reducing the aperture through which you're looking and

257
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,240
you're filtering out optically. What's happening is you're filtering out all of the light rays that

258
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,240
are not perfectly parallel. And if you can get rid of those scattering rays that make the image

259
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:58,120
blurry and only use those parallel rays that happen to be coming parallel off of an object,

260
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,960
you can actually resolve it. You can actually see it. And that's why pharmacologically,

261
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,920
if you shrink the pupil, you could once again see up close.

262
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,760
Now, this is again, is a little counterintuitive to me because anybody who's in my shoes,

263
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,880
who's experiencing far sightedness or more, I shouldn't say that Presby.

264
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,160
Presbyopia.

265
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,200
Presbyopia knows that nothing makes it worse than darkness.

266
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,680
Correct.

267
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,320
And so you're in that rest. There's two scenarios where it wreaks havoc. The first is one of my

268
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:40,760
children has a train book that why these guys wrote a book in like six point font

269
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,000
that they know parents are going to read their kids in bed when it's kind of dark.

270
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,520
It's beyond me. There should be a mandatory 24 point font for nighttime books for little kids.

271
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,680
But anyway, he's got this one book and he even tells me before he wants that book ready,

272
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,480
he's like, daddy, go get your glasses. And then the other place is the restaurant,

273
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,600
where it's usually really lit. But in both of those situations, isn't my aperture narrowed?

274
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,840
Oh, no, no, of course not. It's the opposite.

275
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,800
So if you put the sun on something, you're going to be able to read it because your pupil.

276
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,680
So is that why light makes it different?

277
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Some of it is just the absolutely it's pupil effect alone.

278
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,920
I never thought of it as just the light. There's much more light energy available

279
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,320
for you to resolve something. So yes, there are competing forces when you

280
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,480
reduce the size of the aperture, you're letting less light in. But the only light you're letting

281
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,600
in are those rays that happen to be parallel in perfect focus. You can actually see.

282
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,200
So in the clinical trial that we performed to look at this,

283
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,440
those competing forces were examined very closely. And we found that the aperture effect,

284
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,720
the depth of focus outweighed any loss of loss from from loss of light.

285
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,320
And how long would these eye drops stay in effect? How long would they be able to maintain

286
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,040
after you put them in?

287
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,800
I think about it depends a little bit upon eye color, believe it or not,

288
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,680
because something I want to ask about in a moment. Yeah.

289
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,600
I'm glad you brought that up. Yeah. Certain eye color, like light eyes tend to react more to any

290
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:27,000
given strength of dilating medicare drop or or constricting. But about six to eight hours,

291
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,720
maybe up to 10 hours. So this would be a once a day, maybe twice a day.

292
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,960
And would this have any impact? Would it compromise your far vision?

293
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:45,240
Quite the contrary. What was really interesting is that when we looked at patients who had their

294
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,040
pupil size reduced pharmacologically, their distance vision also gets better by the same

295
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,600
principle because their depth of focus is so good. So in the same way that you can squint and make

296
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,720
out a highway sign if you're a little bit nearsighted or a little bit farsighted or have a

297
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,160
stigmatism, which we haven't even talked about yet, which I don't even know what that is, even

298
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,080
though I have one. That's right. And squinting makes that better by the same token. The

299
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,920
pharmacological manipulation of your pupil will do that as well. And by the way, I think you will see

300
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:26,440
in early 2022 commercial availability of these of the first of these drugs.

301
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:33,560
So going back to the more complicated drug you were talking about that has it's complicated

302
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,280
because it has to make its way into the lens. That's right. I can now see why that would be

303
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,320
more about the cataract issue and not about the presbyopia issue, because this would be a much

304
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,320
easier way to solve presbyopia because you only have to basically get onto the iris.

305
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah. Well, you're looking at a drug that shrinks the pupil and works in 15 minutes

306
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,880
versus something that softens the lens that might work in 15 months. So I think they're

307
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:10,440
very different markets. And while that lipoic acid cholinester is being pursued as a presbyopia,

308
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:18,440
near vision aid or something to reduce the effects of, I think their real goal is to

309
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,600
reduce the incidence or delay the onset of cataract formation, which would be really cool.

310
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,960
Yeah. Is there any clear evolutionary explanation for why different eye colors have emerged?

311
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,920
What's the advantage of brown iris versus blue?

312
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,280
Yeah, it's a protection from UV light and from visible light. And in the same way,

313
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:48,280
the different skin tones have emerged. So typically you see dark eyed people.

314
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:57,720
Clustered closer to the equator because visible light and UV light and infrared radiation are

315
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,920
really destructive. And as you might remember, this is one of the few things that people remember

316
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,800
from medical school about the retina, but it's one of the most metabolically active tissues in

317
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,120
the body, if not the most metabolically active tissue. And because it's constantly being bombarded

318
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:24,280
with radiation effectively, it's prone to free radical formation. So what's called the retinal

319
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:30,760
pigment epithelium, which is the pigmented layer behind the retina, underneath the retina,

320
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:40,600
that is responsible for shielding the vascular supply behind the retina from all of this

321
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:49,240
radiation. Because that vascular network behind the retina has a very high oxygen tension,

322
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,360
and it would be prone to free radical formation if it were constantly being bombarded by UV light,

323
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,400
infrared radiation, visible light. And that's why you see in people near the equator more pigment.

324
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,840
And that's also true of the iris as well. So the other thing I do remember vaguely

325
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,640
from medical school is rods and cones. And of course, I also remember a few other things now

326
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,200
that we're talking about it, about which part of the brain actually does the signal processing

327
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:27,640
and stuff. So let's go back to the light hitting and what are the rods and cones and how are they

328
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:34,280
processing that signal? Right. So you might remember cones are primarily for your daytime vision,

329
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:40,040
and they're clustered in the center of your visual sphere. So in the center of the,

330
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,360
near the center of the, what we refer to as the macula, which is a central portion of the retina,

331
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,440
and the very center of the macula is the fovea. Right. So that's primarily where the cones are.

332
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,800
The rods are in the periphery, and they typically are responsible more for dim illumination vision,

333
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,560
like night vision, and they're very good at picking up motion. So, you know, as predators, we

334
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,360
want to make sure that we can hone in on where prey is, but as prey ourselves, we want to be

335
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,360
able to detect, oh, that's some kind of a tiger over there. Something's moving in my periphery.

336
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,720
I need to be aware of that. So that's primarily the difference in responsibility.

337
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,440
And is each rod and each cone, is it, is each one a single cell?

338
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,800
Yes, that's right. They're each highly specialized cells.

339
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,400
Obviously they have mitochondria. Obviously they have, is there, what distinguishes them? Do they

340
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,200
have photo receptors? Like what makes them unique?

341
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,440
They are photo, they refer to as photo receptors and they have stacks of structures within them

342
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,160
that are photosensitive and that causes a depolarization, which-

343
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,080
So they work like channel opsins do?

344
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,000
They use a photon to create an action potential?

345
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:03,320
Correct. Once the photon hits that particular cell photo receptor, then there's a change in the

346
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,720
membrane and ions flow. And that's how a signal is generated.

347
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:16,840
Wow. Okay. So all of that ion flow ultimately makes its way to the optic nerve?

348
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,280
Correct. That's right. And to the brain. And most of the visual processing is in the very back of

349
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:31,640
your brain. And about half of the overall brain structure deals with vision in some capacity.

350
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:38,920
And that's why, for example, when people have a stroke, there's almost always some component of

351
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,640
visual involvement in a stroke. So you may have a droopy face on one side and then a limb is droopy

352
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:54,040
as well. But if you map out the visual sphere, you will detect some deficit in the visual sphere

353
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:01,960
from most strokes. Now, people who listen to this podcast, on various episodes, we've got into the

354
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,240
brain and people understand that I think there's sort of the brainstem, the most primitive piece

355
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,880
of our brain that is basically responsible for autonomic function. You then have sort of this

356
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,200
midbrain that sits on top of it that we call the sort of reptilian brain, a lot of emotion there.

357
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,760
But of course, what in theory distinguishes us from all the other animals is this remarkable

358
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:30,280
cortical piece that sits on top of it. And how much of the visual processing is in that neocortex?

359
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,480
Is it virtually all done there? Is any part of it done in the midbrain?

360
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,760
Yeah. Stuff like pupil responses. The autonomic stuff.

361
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,400
The autonomic stuff. Those are in the midbrain. But the visual processing and the actual mapping of

362
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:53,960
the visual sphere and even as hierarchical as parts of the brain that are specific to edge

363
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,080
detection or moving edge detection or edges that move this way or that way, that's all been mapped

364
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,880
quite elegantly and it's in the cortex. Is there a cross? Yes.

365
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,600
Is the left doing the right and vice versa? That's right. But remember, you send information

366
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,440
from your left visual sphere to the right side of the brain, but you're getting information from-

367
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,720
This is the trick. I remember.

368
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,040
From both eyes. Yeah. So both eyes, yeah.

369
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,960
Explain how that works because this, I remember in med school needing to draw this a few times.

370
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:33,000
How long do you have? It's the simplest way to think about something is that at the pituitary,

371
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,840
there is something called the optic chiasm. You probably remember where the optic nerves cross.

372
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,320
Yes. The optic nerves cross.

373
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:46,360
Right. Some of the fiber, about half the fibers cross. So if a visual deficit is in one eye only,

374
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,560
we know that it is in front of the chiasm. Correct. And if it's behind that, it should

375
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,520
affect both eyes, maybe asymmetrically, but it should affect both eyes. And that could be

376
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:02,600
very helpful in localizing where a particular problem is. Now, a lot of that's done through

377
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:09,400
imaging, but it used to be there was quite an art to this clinical exam, which sadly we've lost a

378
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:19,320
lot of. Yeah. And I do remember both in neurology and probably neuroanatomy, kind of going into

379
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:26,440
these really crazy tests that you'd see the patient performing the test and missing a certain

380
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,400
thing. And you'd think they must be faking it. There's no way you could produce such a bizarre

381
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,120
deficit in this one part of this one visual field. But then of course you see, and look,

382
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:42,360
there's a tumor and it totally explains this once you understand how the nerves cross.

383
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,880
It kind of goes back to one of your earliest questions, which is, do you think that eye

384
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:54,520
surgeons need to go to medical school? Yes, because we diagnose brain tumors. We find things

385
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:01,800
that are systemic diseases that have ocular manifestations. So you're obviously well aware

386
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,440
that your brother and I are close friends and he's become pretty obsessed with hunting now.

387
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,720
And I'll take full responsibility at least for the part of it. I did not see this one coming. Yeah.

388
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,080
Well, you'll see where this is going. So he's become super obsessed with hunting. And

389
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:25,880
one of the things that hunting teaches you is how we stack up to wild animals. So if you're out

390
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,120
hunting an elk or an axis deer or one of these remarkable creatures, especially with a bow and

391
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,040
arrow. Yeah. I was going to say, how much technology do we have access to in this hypothetical

392
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,320
scenario? So let's talk about bow and arrow hunting, where you really, I mean,

393
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,400
if you really want to reduce the margin of error, you want to be inside of 50 yards to be

394
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,320
able to take that shot. Sure. So the way I always talk about this is animals have superpowers

395
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,480
and we just have to decide as do we, we have superpowers, our greatest one being our intelligence,

396
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:03,960
which allowed us to make the bow. Right. But I generally think of the three big senses,

397
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,800
right? Which is the sense of vision, the sense of smell, the sense of hearing. And

398
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,560
there's simply no comparison in sense of smell. We basically can't smell. We're effectively

399
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,720
useless creatures in nature. Agreed. Yeah. You know, they can smell us with, if they're

400
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,280
downwind of us, they can smell us a mile away, literally one mile away. If the wind moves from

401
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:38,760
you to them, they're gone. You'll never get close to them. Right. It turns out that the closest sense

402
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,800
we have to our prey is vision. Right. It's the only thing where we're almost on par with them.

403
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,160
Now there are some animals that can see better than us. You know, if you, there are certain

404
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:57,720
types of Rams that if you break skyline within two miles of them, they'll see it. And birds. Yeah.

405
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,960
But for the most part, like this is the one sense that we have that rivals the best. Right.

406
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:13,480
Uh, is that because we both had to, as you said, be hunters and be hunted for such a large part

407
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,040
of our revolution? Is that, I mean, this is sort of teleologic explanation I'm looking for, but.

408
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,120
Well, I think so. But think, just think about this for a moment. Imagine you are in the desert

409
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,680
and there is a single candle a mile away from you and it's pitch black. There's no moon.

410
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:40,280
You can see that, but at high noon in that same desert where there may be 200,000 lux illumination,

411
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,120
you can still function and see well. So many, many, many, many, many orders of magnitude of change of

412
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:53,880
illumination. Like it's astonishing that you can function in both of those environments.

413
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,080
Well, that's actually interesting that you make that point because as it gets darker,

414
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,400
we do tend to have an advantage over some of the animals. Now it turns out to be very short-lived.

415
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,720
There's a very narrow window at dusk and dawn where I think we can outsee them.

416
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:18,200
And maybe that's the benefit we have in that we evolve slightly better to have this greater range,

417
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,720
if you will. But I've always been amazed at like, why did we not develop a sense of smell?

418
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,200
Yeah. I mean, because we effectively can't smell compared to animals. I mean, it's really.

419
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,440
Absurd how different it is. And I don't know why evolution didn't push that harder.

420
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,880
And even our hearing, I think is, you know, we're not even close.

421
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,760
Nothing compared to them.

422
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,320
Yeah. But vision, you know, and if you ask, it's very common for patients to grab my arm

423
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:51,400
as we're going into surgery and they'll say, Dr. Dell, you don't understand. My vision is

424
00:42:51,480 --> 00:43:01,000
really important to me. I've got to see. I've got to see. And we, I get that, you know, it's the one

425
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,520
sense that if you asked people which sense they'd be most willing to give up, it's the very last one.

426
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,560
Yeah. And in COVID, we saw many people at least transiently lose a sense of smell and a sense of

427
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,280
taste. And of course it's inconvenient, but it's totally survivable.

428
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,680
It's hard to function in the world as a blind person. And, you know, it's a fear that many of

429
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:32,600
us have. So it's a sense that we value very highly and also evolutionarily it's valued highly just

430
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,240
owing to the fact that so much of our brain is devoted to vision.

431
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:43,960
Yeah. This is a little bit off track, but maybe good for a PSA. When I was a kid, we did so many

432
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,880
dumb things without ever any concern for our eyes. I just don't think our parents knew enough.

433
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,280
Right.

434
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,480
And we didn't think about it. So I'd be out in the backyard chucking things around, cutting wood,

435
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,520
smashing rocks, never a thought to put on safety goggles. And now my kids who are both completely

436
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,360
obsessed with cutting down trees and like just, they're always, they're very active outdoors. I

437
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,160
mean, they just know like you're wearing your safety goggles if you do that stuff.

438
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,080
Cause I'm totally paranoid they're going to, you know, have one of these tragic accidents.

439
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,400
Do you see much of that stuff? I mean, do we?

440
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,440
For sure. And you, you know, you see a lot of eye injuries. I think injuries are one of the

441
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,720
main causes of devastating visual loss in young people. You know, if we take visual loss in general,

442
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:44,760
almost all of the big causes and movers of visual loss are senescence related or age related.

443
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,360
But in terms of vision loss in young people, it's a lot of trauma.

444
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,000
What are the most common traumas that you see?

445
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,800
You know, I think unrestrained passenger.

446
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Like is it, is it object flying into eye or is it more?

447
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,560
I think it's more blunt trauma, frankly.

448
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,120
Okay. Wow.

449
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,680
Yeah. More blunt trauma. The eye is pretty well protected with the brow and the cheek,

450
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,840
but you know, there are certain things that can get in there and can directly impact the eye.

451
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:17,160
And so I think, you know, in a young person, trauma is something you have to certainly watch out for.

452
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,760
What is the velocity at which we can't out blink it?

453
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,160
Cause the other day my son was smashing beads and he didn't want to put his safety goggles on.

454
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,120
And I was like, look buddy, you got to get these things on. And he goes, no, dad. And he's like,

455
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,120
why? And I said, because you're hitting sharp objects with a sharp object.

456
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,040
If one of them flies up and hits your eye, he goes, I would see it and I would close my eye.

457
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,560
No, you wouldn't buddy.

458
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,400
Yeah. Let's just put it this way. Those are objects are flying at supersonic speed

459
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,920
and they, you can't blink that fast.

460
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,440
So do we have a sense of like what our reaction time is to blink?

461
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,640
That is known, but I've long since forgotten what that is.

462
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,600
Because you get the sense, like if somebody's throwing you a ball and you misjudge it,

463
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,000
you're going to blink like that's slow enough that you can catch it. But, but yeah,

464
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,080
but then there's other objects where you can.

465
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,200
Interestingly, you know, I've operated on a number of major league baseball players

466
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,440
and for them seeing the laces on the ball as hitters is enormous.

467
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,240
It's their career.

468
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,560
It is their career. And it's the difference between them hitting, you know, well or average.

469
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:28,840
And, and some of these players that we've operated on have been 2020 before they had surgery,

470
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,320
but they wanted to be 2015 or 2010. And what that means is, you know, again,

471
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,160
here's another nomenclature issue. What is 2020 vision?

472
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:46,120
2020 simply means that you can see at 20 feet, what a quote unquote normal person can see at

473
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:54,520
20 feet. If you're 2010, you can see at 20 feet, what a normal person has to get 10 feet up to

474
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,440
in order to see. So 2010 is better than 2020.

475
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,640
So some of these guys want to be 2010 or 20, you know, whatever it is, 2015.

476
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,320
We've been able to achieve that with modern forms of laser vision correction because.

477
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,880
Wait a minute. How is the, isn't this now getting into the performance enhancing side of things?

478
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,920
Isn't this kind of amazing?

479
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:21,400
You know, it's interesting. Yeah, for sure. And, and I had a discussion yesterday with a guy who

480
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:28,280
owns a soccer team. And I said, have you ever had your players tested for their vision? And

481
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,880
he sort of froze and turned white, turned white for a second. And he just said, it's so crazy.

482
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,640
You say that because we put them through this barrage of tests physically to see what their

483
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:46,440
heart, their lungs, their kidneys, all that stuff. We didn't check their vision. And there are ways

484
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,160
to boost human performance beyond 2020. The theoretical limit of how well you could see

485
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:59,720
is defined by essentially the pixelation of your retina, the spacing of the cells of those

486
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,960
photoreceptors that we talked about earlier. Does that vary from person to person?

487
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:12,680
It has to, but it's somewhere in the vicinity of about 2008 or, or so. And so if you can have a

488
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:19,640
sharp enough image, you could theoretically see better than 2010. And the only way you can really

489
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:27,000
achieve that is to remove some of the optical irregularities that we are all born with and

490
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,080
somehow neutralize them along with the glasses prescription. And we can actually do that with

491
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:40,440
laser vision correction currently. So why would it be beneficial? I guess we'll talk about laser

492
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,400
surgery and maybe you'll want to park this question until then. Yeah. Why would it be beneficial to an

493
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,440
athlete who for understandable reasons needs the best vision possible to undergo laser corrective

494
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:59,320
surgery versus just using contact lenses to accomplish the same thing? Is that possible?

495
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:05,720
Yeah. So if you think about contact lenses, anyone who's ever worn contact lenses knows that when you

496
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:12,680
put in a brand new pair of contact lenses, you can see pretty well with them. And then you begin to

497
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:19,160
regard that contact lens as a foreign object. So your body just begins to attack it, coat it with

498
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:28,200
all sorts of immunological debris. You are susceptible to pollen, dust, whatever it is that

499
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:35,480
coats this, this, you know, formally pristine object. And let's say it has, there is correction

500
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:42,200
for astigmatism in that contact lens where its orientation is important. Every time you blink,

501
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,160
that contact lens moves a little bit, all of those factors contribute to optical performance

502
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,560
that is less than what you can achieve with spectacles or laser vision correction. So

503
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,440
particularly soft contact lenses do a very, very good job, but they don't give you superhuman

504
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:09,560
vision performance typically. You know, it's funny. I experimented two years ago with a stronger

505
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:18,280
prescription than normal to get me to 2015 in my dominant eye for archery. Sure. Goofed up your

506
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,720
near though. That's the problem. I just abandoned it immediately after like six months of suffering

507
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,880
because it made my presbyopia worse. Yes. Goofs up your near. So I was like, this just isn't worth it.

508
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:37,960
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. That's the challenge when you pull the image farther and farther away,

509
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,400
you're doing the same thing with the near image as well.

510
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:48,200
So let's now talk about how to correct these. Oh, I guess let's define an astigmatism since I don't

511
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,400
know what that is yet. Yeah. I mean, it's when the eye is shaped like a football instead of

512
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,360
a basketball. And when you say the eye, which part of the eye specifically? The cornea, the very front

513
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,840
part of the eye typically. And how thick is the cornea, by the way? It's about as thick as a credit

514
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,840
card, like 500 microns. Yeah. Yeah. Like 550 microns, something like that. So half a millimeter.

515
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:16,120
Yeah, exactly right. So half a millimeter. And it's typically that is the location of astigmatism.

516
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:22,200
There can be astigmatism in the lens itself, the lens behind the pupil. You probably don't remember

517
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:27,400
which one I have, do you? I do. Which one do I have? You have corneal astigmatism. That's the

518
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,800
normal one. Yeah. It's very pedestrian. You're a very boring patient. But

519
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:40,840
the... So meaning, just to be clear, I'm not perfectly shaped around here. I'm a bit oblong.

520
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:48,360
That's right. Shaped like an egg or a football, an American football. So if you're walking along

521
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,800
the laces of the football, you would encounter a fairly gradual curve. But if you took a right

522
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,480
turn and walked perpendicular, it would be very steep. And so that means that the power

523
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:09,160
differs by meridian. So you need a different glasses prescription in this meridian versus

524
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,400
this meridian. And that can... And what's the prevalence of this? It's very high. I think

525
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:23,400
60 some odd percent of patients with glasses prescription have some significant degree of

526
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:32,840
astigmatism. Why has poor vision... I was going to say, why has poor vision been allowed to evolve?

527
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:40,200
I was going to offer that maybe really poor vision hasn't. Vision that would impair your

528
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:47,800
ability to survive through reproductive age probably didn't evolve. Maybe there was a day

529
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:53,960
when the genetic variability of eyes was broad enough that a subset of people had really poor

530
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,360
vision. The type of people today who maybe we don't encounter. Right. This is a super interesting

531
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:08,680
topic and it shows you how plastic, the evolutionary or actually the adaptive component of the eyeball

532
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,480
is itself. So the length of the eye is really what determines whether you are nearsighted or

533
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,400
farsighted. When you say length, you mean distance from front to back. Okay. So anterior posterior

534
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,320
length of the eyeball, primarily that is the main driver as to whether you are nearsighted or

535
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:33,880
farsighted. Those who are in the know and are watching this or listening to it also realize

536
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,560
that sometimes it's the curvature of the cornea that contributes to whether someone is nearsighted

537
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,360
or farsighted. But let's say for the purposes of this discussion, that it's the length of the

538
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:52,360
eyeball that is the main reason why someone is nearsighted or not or farsighted. So a very

539
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:58,360
nearsighted person has a very long eyeball. Let me make sure I understand that. Okay. Very long

540
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:05,080
ap axis. You're going to have a real hard time seeing things far away. Correct. And is that

541
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:12,120
because the further something is, the harder you have a time focusing all that light. Let's talk

542
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:23,640
about the genesis of this. Okay. Right. So if most of your work, most of your visual environment is

543
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:34,520
close, then the light rays from that close object are diverging. And so they are falling behind the

544
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:41,480
retina of someone who's perfectly targeted for distance. So your eyeball is really smart. And

545
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:49,080
it says, okay, so you're telling me everything is here close up. I know I'll just grow longer

546
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:55,480
so that these near objects are in perfect focus. And that is exactly what happens.

547
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,680
Over what time scale?

548
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:04,360
Over a period of months. So if you take a young person and you exclusively have them

549
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:14,040
perform near tasks, their eye will grow longer so that those near objects are in perfect focus.

550
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,480
So if you could do an awful experiment, it's been done, take a child and not put them in a white

551
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,960
room where there's nothing that they can see that's far away and just have them play with

552
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,640
close objects that they can reach. Yeah. And you would put that kid into glasses as a child.

553
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:41,800
That's called society in 2021 is children looking at screens, near objects for hours on end and not

554
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:50,840
going outside. There are two drivers of nearsightedness in the plastic developing human. Number one,

555
00:55:52,600 --> 00:56:00,440
deprivation from outdoor light and number two, near work. So for example, there have been

556
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,680
cohorts of children. Most of these studies have been done in Asia where there is an epidemic

557
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:13,480
right now of myopia of astonishing proportions. I'm talking about 90% of the population

558
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:22,440
is now nearsighted in certain Southeastern nation cities. When that becomes such a dominant phenotype,

559
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:29,480
something is really oddly off. So this really transcends evolution because

560
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:36,440
if you can change something in years or months. It's not evolutionary. It's adaptive within

561
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:44,440
the eyeball itself. So if you take a group of children, and this has been done seven to 11

562
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:50,440
year old children, and you send half of them outside for 80 minutes during the school day for

563
00:56:50,440 --> 00:57:00,520
recess and half of them stay inside in an indoor environment for their recess, the risk of or the

564
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:08,680
incidence of nearsightedness is 50% higher, it's half in the group that went outside. So you cut

565
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:15,880
your risk in half by going outside. Now, we think that without any instruction to go and look at

566
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,680
things far away, but just by the very fact that if you're outside, there's so much more to see,

567
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:27,000
and you're going to be looking further out. Right. And this has been further studied in terms of,

568
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,840
is it just being outside or is it the light? Yeah. It's actually both, but the light is really the

569
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:41,160
most important driver of protection from nearsightedness. So if you are outside on a bright,

570
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:49,080
sunny day, you're releasing a fair bit of dopamine from your retina and dopamine inhibits the growth

571
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:57,320
of the eye. So the worst thing you could do is stay inside in a dimly lit room and perform near

572
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:05,960
tasks. That raises your risk of nearsightedness 16 fold compared to kids who go outside.

573
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,760
I'm sure there's epidemiology that would suggest that the further you are from the equator,

574
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,000
does that imply that you have a greater risk of nearsightedness just based on the light part of

575
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,640
this argument? Yes. There is some data to look at that that shows that. And not only that,

576
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:29,320
they've taken children and given them equal intervals of outdoor activity, but the ones who

577
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:35,320
had noontime outdoor activity did better than the ones who were outdoors at 8 a.m. where there was

578
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:42,920
less illumination. And we know from animal models that it is illumination that is critical in this

579
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:50,520
dopamine release. So, you know, does that mean we need more skylights in classrooms or more windows?

580
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,760
We need more natural light. Could we artificially mimic some of the sunlight by making these rooms

581
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:02,600
brighter and and prevent some of this myopia epidemic? Is a photon a photon a photon? I mean,

582
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,840
does it I mean, I don't think that it's known, frankly, Peter, whether that's the case,

583
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:12,200
because there are difference. There's a whole spectrum of light. So is the blue light more

584
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,520
important? This is tangential. And we'll talk about this. I know. But blue light, you hear all

585
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:25,560
this negativity about blue light. Blue light is critical for wakefulness, for attention, for,

586
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:33,640
I think, for preventing myopia. And by the way, when we say myopia nearsightedness,

587
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,800
it's not just the inconvenience of wearing glasses or contact lenses or having laser vision

588
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:46,760
correction when you're 23 years old. There are pathologies that are much more common in very

589
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,160
nearsighted patients compared to the general population. It's much more common to see cataract

590
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:58,520
formation in myopic patients. They get something called myopic macular degeneration. They're at

591
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:05,960
risk for glaucoma. They're at risk for tears and detachments of the retina. So it's not just the

592
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,480
inconvenience of spectacles. These are disease associated conditions. So going back to my

593
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:19,160
evolutionary question, it's quite possible that over hundreds of millions of years, any deficit

594
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,200
in vision that would have prevented you from reproducing or impaired your ability to escape

595
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,320
prey would have taken that out. So from a genetic standpoint, our vision should be very good.

596
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:35,160
And in non-literate societies, it typically was. So if you look at hunter-gatherer tribes,

597
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:43,560
there is no nearsightedness. There are no Kalahari Bushmen with spectacles. It just doesn't happen.

598
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,240
This is amazing. This suggests that because my parents wore glasses, I should wear glasses is

599
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,000
not true. Or is there an epigenetic part of this where it can-

600
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,080
Both. There is a genetic component. And if you look at siblings of individuals who

601
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,240
wear spectacles, there is a higher incidence of myopia or hyperopia.

602
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,760
But that could be susceptibility, right?

603
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,800
It could be susceptibility.

604
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,240
And then the environmental trigger is what's going to do it in anyone?

605
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:18,920
And we don't know whether parents of reading children were reading children themselves.

606
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:24,760
So it's hard to separate out the genetic component, but there does seem to be a genetic

607
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:31,320
component as well. But the environmental component seems to be way stronger and more powerful.

608
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:37,720
So if you take parents who don't wear spectacles and you put their child in a dark room and give

609
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:44,760
them an electronic device or a book or whatever it is and have that child focus it near for hours

610
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:50,040
on end, odds are they're much more at risk for developing nearsightedness.

611
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,080
So when I just think about this hood lens of my kids, so my wife has perfect vision, I don't.

612
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:01,400
What is my diopter? I think I'm minus three and minus four.

613
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,120
It's about right.

614
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:02,280
Yeah.

615
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,920
So what does that mean in terms of the 20 scale? I'm 20-

616
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,440
You're probably like, it depends on how much you squint and look at the eye chart. We honestly

617
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:17,640
don't really attach a lot of significance to the 2100 or 2080, whatever it is. You're probably

618
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,040
in that ballpark 2100 maybe.

619
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,840
But I'm clearly at the point where without contacts, I can't drive, I can't do anything.

620
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,000
Right.

621
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:32,440
I mean, I know some people who are minus 15, they literally can't, they have to put glasses

622
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,160
near the bedside.

623
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,720
That's right.

624
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,800
I'll spend the first hour of the day without contact lenses.

625
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,440
That's right. Because you could probably, things are very well-

626
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,280
It's easier for me to read without my contacts.

627
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,040
Very, things for you are very well in focus at a typical normal reading distance.

628
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,520
Right.

629
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:54,280
So your eyes have been tuned like postnatally for near work. That's in your development,

630
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,920
you must have spent a lot of time reading or doing near tasks.

631
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,680
Well, that's the thing I was thinking about. I grew up in Canada, so from a light perspective,

632
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:08,120
it wasn't so great. Two months of no light whatsoever. But I didn't watch TV much as a

633
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:15,560
kid, maybe 30 minutes a day. I was mostly outdoors, so I don't know how much of it.

634
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:22,600
But I also didn't, I'll tell you, this is funny. I didn't need my first pair of glasses till college.

635
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:28,440
So it could also be that this happened later in my life as a result of more book work.

636
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,840
For sure. So the classic example is we see law students who have great vision when they

637
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,720
enter law school and then they read for 12 hours a day and then they come in and they say,

638
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:45,960
you know, I think my vision's going. And you look at them and sure enough, they become nearsighted.

639
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:52,200
And that's not rare in many graduate school situations where there's just grinding reading

640
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,240
for hours on end.

641
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,720
So when I think about our kids, because now I just think, well, what can I,

642
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,200
it's too late for me, right? But so.

643
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,080
Get them outside.

644
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:06,680
So they are. So fortunately they live outside. But when they're inside, they're obsessed with

645
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,480
playing with Legos and trains and trucks and, you know, I mean, that's near, right? So is it that,

646
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,920
hey, there's nothing wrong with that, but you just have to make sure they're spending a couple hours

647
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,720
outside a day?

648
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:23,880
I think the data would suggest that good illumination would be helpful as opposed to poor illumination.

649
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,200
Okay.

650
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:31,000
But, you know, you don't want to discourage near activities because those are really important

651
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,480
development.

652
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,360
That was the flip true. So you mentioned that hunter gatherers or illiterate societies

653
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,800
who are out by definition outside all the time.

654
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,040
Right.

655
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,800
There's no such thing as nearsightedness in them. Do they develop farsightedness?

656
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:52,040
Not really. I think that they are fairly well tuned if we want to use that term to distance

657
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:58,760
vision, to prey hunting and things like that. So distance vision is very well tuned. Now,

658
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:04,360
there's a whole host of other problems that come into play. Once you've outlived your genetic

659
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,240
usefulness, you've reproduced and you've imparted your knowledge onto the next generation, you can

660
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:15,000
go ahead and get cataracts because you're done, you know, genetically useful, your utility.

661
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,840
So the cataract is sort of like atherosclerosis, functionally, which is it really, it's the one

662
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,760
thing that really has no bearing on your reproductive capacity, but is otherwise inevitable

663
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,800
to our species.

664
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:33,400
It seems to be fairly inevitable to our species. And I've, as I mentioned earlier, I just haven't

665
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,560
seen patients in their 70s typically that don't have some cataract formation. Now, there are

666
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:44,520
patients who are 80 that are still functioning with cataracts, but the optical clarity of their

667
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,600
lenses has degraded to the point that it's not the way it was when they were 20. Maybe their

668
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:58,600
visual needs are significantly reduced at that age. But if you took an 80 year old lens and you

669
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,440
put it in a 20 year old person, they would be shocked at how poor their vision is.

670
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,480
That's really interesting. Now, earlier you mentioned that we think that senescent cells

671
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:13,560
are at least the soluble secretory products of senescent cells are probably playing a role in this.

672
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:22,600
Well, I think in the lens, it's mostly that the lens proteins are degrading or becoming damaged

673
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:28,040
over time, maybe with UV light, because we know light exposure is certainly related to cataract

674
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:34,120
formation, as are some of the other things that I mentioned, like glucose going into the lens,

675
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:42,520
corticosteroid use. We don't know what it is specifically about trauma that causes a premature

676
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,720
loss of clarity of the lens proteins. The trauma ones got me worried because I boxed for so long.

677
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:56,200
I took way too many hits to the head. I hope that doesn't come back to, I mean, I've already been,

678
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,800
I'm worried about that for other reasons. Let's just put it this way. The cataract would be the

679
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:06,840
easiest thing to fix. Yeah. Cataract surgery today is like a four or five minute procedure

680
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,960
and it's astonishingly effective. How often does one need to repeat that surgery?

681
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,720
Cataract surgery typically is not repeated. It's a once in a lifetime deal.

682
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,080
And what you're noticing is like you're wearing glasses that are dirty. Is that effectively what

683
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,080
the patient with cataract is experiencing? I think the first thing they notice is probably

684
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:32,760
changes in their night vision, glare, halos, streaks off of lights at night,

685
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:40,600
problems with contrast sensitivity for those who can appreciate that loss of contrast.

686
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:46,200
Those are really early signs of cataract formation. So then the patient comes to you,

687
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:52,360
they're 74 years old or let's say it's sooner. They're 70 years old. More like 64 or 54.

688
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:57,560
Okay. And you're telling them, Hey, Billy, you've got cataracts. Right. We're going to just ride

689
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:02,040
this out until you tell me you've had enough. Typically we let the patient decide when it's

690
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:08,200
the right time for them to have the surgery. Once we determine that the cataract is visually

691
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:15,560
significant, there are people who elect to have their cataracts removed earlier than they really

692
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:21,480
need them removed as a means of getting rid of their glasses prescription, because now the lenses,

693
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:28,440
the implant lenses that we put in to replace the cataract have advanced in function to the point

694
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33,480
that they can fix the near vision as well as the distance vision as you know, the astigmatism,

695
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,880
the nearsightedness, the farsightedness, the presbyopia, all those things that we've been

696
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:43,000
talking about, they're all correctable with artificial lenses that we put in the eye to

697
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,000
replace the cataract. Wow. But earlier when you talked about during your residency, the bread and

698
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,200
butter was one of the pieces of bread and butter of your practice would have been cataract surgery

699
01:08:54,200 --> 01:09:00,600
that didn't involve intraocular lenses. No, it did. It did. And there's a fascinating history

700
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:08,760
about the evolution of intraocular lenses. But back in those days, the implant lenses that were

701
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:17,400
put in were simply designed to give the patient good vision with spectacles, just to replace the

702
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:23,000
cloudy lens with something that was in the ballpark of good distance vision.

703
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,480
Sorry, I need to take a step back because I'm actually kind of confused.

704
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:31,160
Does all cataract surgery involve the placement of an extra lens?

705
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:37,640
Yes, that's correct. There are exceptions to nitpickers who will listen to this, but

706
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:48,120
virtually every cataract surgery that we perform involves the removal of the cataract and replacing

707
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:52,360
it with an artificial lens. Again, you'll have to pardon my ignorance. Does that mean removing

708
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,040
the entire lens or removing a diseased part of the lens that has a cataract?

709
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,440
So remember our analogy of the M&M candy? Yes.

710
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:03,880
So we leave the shell. Right. We open a hole in the front of the shell. Yes.

711
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,760
We take out all the chocolate and then we now we have kind of like a flattened bowl. Looks like a

712
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,240
Japanese teapot flattened. Yes.

713
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:16,840
And we put the implant lens in that bowl and that holds the implant in place.

714
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:23,480
Is it a viscous fluid that gets hardened or is it a hard object that goes directly in?

715
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:27,960
It's actually a bendable plastic object and the bendability of it.

716
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,560
Is what allows it to get in?

717
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:34,680
Allows us to fold it up and put it through a tiny incision and then it opens up.

718
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,040
That was a very big advancement. When did that happen?

719
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:43,560
1980s was when that began to become. What happened before this?

720
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:50,200
So this is a really amazing series of stories, but I'll abbreviate them in the interests of

721
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:59,080
time. But in the old days, in the ancient world, if you had cataracts,

722
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:06,520
the way they dealt with it is that they would just poke the lens of the eye backward and it

723
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:12,680
would drop down into the bottom of the eye so that you now had a clear optical pathway, again,

724
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:19,080
to let light in. And this took someone who was functionally blind and allowed them to see shapes.

725
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,880
So that was better than. Right. Because you don't have a lens.

726
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,480
So there's no way you can focus. You can't focus. All you can see are shapes.

727
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:29,560
But it's basically like taking someone who has no light transmission and saying,

728
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:34,200
we're going to let an unfocused light go through. Right. So some light's better than no light.

729
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:40,760
So that's what happened in Hammurabi time. Amazing that they under. I'm always amazed.

730
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,320
We look at that now and we say that's barbaric. Yeah.

731
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,760
The fact that they knew enough to do that is kind of amazing.

732
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,360
They probably tried everything else first. And that was the one that.

733
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:54,120
They probably dissected cadaveric lenses and tried to figure this out.

734
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:59,960
Yeah. And there are there have been artifacts uncovered that I think a lot of them were made

735
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:07,800
out of gold, but they would take a gold needle and poke it through the cornea. And then it was called

736
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:14,360
couching the procedure. They would just poke the lens and it would detach from its ligamentous

737
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:19,240
attachments and then drop down into the bottom of the cavity of the eye. And you see some of these

738
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:26,280
artifacts from Egypt. This was done in China. It was certainly done in ancient Greece. There are,

739
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,840
that was how you dealt with cataracts back then. By the way, it's just worth pausing for a moment

740
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,600
to to reflect. Like, so we're, if you're talking about the pharaohs, you're talking about what,

741
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,440
5,000 years ago, right? This is not in an evolutionary timescale. That's a, that's a

742
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:44,920
pittance. My profession is an old one. And you think like it would be better to be the

743
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,840
poorest person on earth today than to be the pharaoh of Egypt 5,000 years ago.

744
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,440
Yeah. I think in many ways.

745
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:56,120
Certainly it would be better to be in the bottom 10 percentile economically today than the top 10

746
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:03,000
percentile 5,000 years ago. If the best you have to your cataracts is some guy sticking a hot poker

747
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,960
in your eye. That's right. So then you fast forward to right after World War II. And there's

748
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:19,560
an ophthalmologist in the UK named Harold Ridley. And he notices that some of the RAF fighters

749
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:27,800
would have fragments of their canopy, their plexiglass canopy shatter when they were fired

750
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:33,160
upon. And these things would actually get inside the eyeballs shards of, of plexiglass

751
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,960
essentially would be inside the eyeball. And the dilemma was, well, what do we do with this?

752
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:45,560
And he learned very early on that these fragments were biologically inert, that the eye was perfectly

753
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:51,160
happy and people could walk around the rest of their lives with plexiglass inside their eyeball.

754
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:57,240
And that's a shard of sharp plexiglass. So, and this is one of those out of-

755
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:01,080
And this is in part because the lens is so immune privileged. This is-

756
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:06,600
Well, this is a foreign object that has now entered the eye, not necessarily in the human lens. It

757
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,200
might even be in the vitreous cavity or in the front of the eye.

758
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,520
So there was something about sharp plexiglass that didn't-

759
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,720
But there's something about plexiglass. So the light bulb goes off that, wait, you can put

760
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:23,080
plexiglass, which is essentially polymethyl methacrylate, you can put that in the eye and

761
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:32,200
the body doesn't really care that it's there, doesn't mount an immune response. So in Ridley's

762
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:38,120
book, which I've read, it's really amazing, but some intern asked him, well, when you take this

763
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:44,280
cataract out, are you going to replace it with a new lens? And he looked at this young intern in

764
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:48,600
a very British fashion, I'm assuming, and just said, that's the stupidest question I've ever

765
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:53,080
heard. And then he went home and thought, wait a minute, that's brilliant. We should replace it.

766
01:14:53,960 --> 01:15:02,280
And then they lathed a lens from some spectacle maker that was about the size and shape of

767
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:11,320
the human lens. And actually threw eight of these in patients. And there's amazing footage of,

768
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:16,200
I think one of the first operations, they dropped the lens on the floor. And of course,

769
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:24,920
it's the only one they had. So they pick it up and rinse it off and they, it's fine. They put it in

770
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:34,840
and these patients did shockingly well. And this was viewed as heresy and there was 20 years of

771
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,280
your blinding people. But eventually the technology won out and it became.

772
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,400
So there were bad outcomes, presumably.

773
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:47,560
I think in the early days, for sure. There must have been for sure. And there were,

774
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,080
but like any new technology, the first iteration of it is probably

775
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,240
terrible and maybe just a little bit less terrible than the alternative.

776
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,560
And now it's a ubiquitously.

777
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,960
So I never thought, because basically I didn't realize until you said it that

778
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:08,600
polymethyl methacrylate is all over the body in terms of joints, like, and you do a, you know,

779
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,160
when you replace a knee joint, right? That the tibial plateau I think is made out of

780
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,680
polymethyl methacrylate. So presumably there's something about it that is just

781
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,760
invisible to the immune system.

782
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:24,920
Well, we don't, and we don't use that material anymore because it's stiff. It is not deformable.

783
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,280
So you had to, you had to, in the old days, you had to make a fairly large incision to get the,

784
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,720
to get this thing in first of all, to get the cataract out and then to get

785
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,960
the implant lens in to converging technologies made that go away.

786
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,760
The number one was we were able to take the cataract out through a tiny incision

787
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:51,080
because you break it and see, too, we break it up, we emulsify it essentially with ultrasound.

788
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,840
Now we even sometimes use a femtosecond laser to break up parts of it.

789
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:00,120
But the bottom line is that we can remove the cataract through about a two something

790
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:04,920
millimeter incision, which is very small, like the thickness of a pencil lead, basically.

791
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:11,960
And we can now take these implant lenses and fold them up and put them through that same tiny

792
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,600
incision. And then they can open up and be exactly where you want them to be.

793
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:21,560
Now, why is it important for the incision to be small? Well, if you make a big incision,

794
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:29,240
obviously it takes longer to heal, but it induces a stigmatism. So you want the incision to be tiny.

795
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:36,440
So does the using your M&M analogy, does the coating on the surface of the M&M grow back?

796
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,560
No, it does not.

797
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,840
So it's it's fixed. Whatever hole you put in there, they're stuck with.

798
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:49,000
Yeah, it's fixed. Now, sometimes the coating, the M&M candy shell can begin to opacify

799
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,960
after surgery, and we can treat that in the office with a laser where we can just disrupt

800
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,480
that coating.

801
01:17:55,480 --> 01:18:01,480
So this has got to be like, my mom, actually, my mom's 72nd birthday is today. I don't know

802
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,200
if she's had any issues with cataracts, but if not, she's due for them.

803
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:13,320
My dad has, he's 83. I'm trying to think, he must have had surgery then by now.

804
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,360
Odds are.

805
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,240
Yeah, odds are.

806
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,560
So I can't believe I've really talked about this with him, but is it, it must be a game changer

807
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,840
for a patient to come out of the clinic or the OR whenever that wherever these, is this,

808
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,920
do you do this in your, well, you have an OR in your office.

809
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,560
We do, but cataract surgery, we do in an ambulatory surgery center. But you know,

810
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,040
maybe that your dad didn't talk about it because it was such a non-event, you know, you go in for

811
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,240
cataract surgery and the next day you're kind of back to your regular activities.

812
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,200
But wouldn't it have been a big event in terms of his ability to see?

813
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:42,760
For sure.

814
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:48,360
Especially now that the implant lenses can correct the near vision and the distance vision.

815
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:55,000
So that in addition to the added clarity from just removing the cataract, they patients

816
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,720
typically have this benefit of not needing.

817
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,520
So this is a procedure we should all be looking forward to when it comes.

818
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,040
Like you're going to know if I would go that far. I mean,

819
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,520
it's still surgery. There are risks associated with it.

820
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,640
What are the biggest risks?

821
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:13,080
No, I think that the number one thing we think about is infection, but it's extraordinarily

822
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,600
unusual to see an infection.

823
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,160
What's the rate?

824
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:19,080
Less than one in 10,000 cases where you'll see a serious infection.

825
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,160
It's like any other surgery in the body. You look for bleeding,

826
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:27,400
damage to the inside of the eye. You have to keep tabs on the pressure.

827
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,720
It's basically everything that you would look for if you were taking out an appendix. You're

828
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,360
also dealing with in the eye.

829
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:41,080
What fraction of patients do not have a material improvement in their vision or have some

830
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:45,640
deterioration of even another subset of vision? So yes, you've taken away my cataract.

831
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:55,000
I can see better in the sense of clarity, but oh my God, I became abjectly nearsighted as a result

832
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,480
of it.

833
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:01,720
Yeah, I think that's pretty unusual because the science behind getting the prescription

834
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:05,560
correct or very close to correct is pretty advanced.

835
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:09,080
And tell me what that entails. So if I came in and right now I'm in a cataract,

836
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,360
what are you assessing microscopically to make it so I'm getting the impression not everybody

837
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,800
gets the same lens?

838
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:21,000
No, they do not. And some of these lenses are expensive. So and they involve the patient

839
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,480
having to pay some extra money to get it.

840
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,520
More money gets you what?

841
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:30,040
I mean, I think the more money people pay, the more spectacle independence they get.

842
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,200
In terms of optical quality, all the lenses are.

843
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:38,120
How much does a lens cost? Or payer, I guess, since you're doing both.

844
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,920
I'm the wrong person to ask, honestly, I don't even know.

845
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,720
But directionally, if somebody has to pay out of pocket for one of these.

846
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:51,240
If they're getting just like regular cataract surgery and there is no attempt to get rid of

847
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,760
spectacles, it's probably going to be completely covered by their health insurance.

848
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:58,280
And if they're saying I want to go premium all the way, get rid of my class.

849
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:03,080
It could be thousands of dollars out of pocket if they want to get rid of all their spectacle

850
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:08,280
and dependence. And what patients will tell us is they'll say, well, what else

851
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:11,880
do I use every waking moment of my life forever?

852
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:17,480
They could go on a vacation for a week or two and spend that money and then the vacation is over.

853
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,880
But we find that patients value, as we pointed out earlier, their vision,

854
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:27,480
they value it pretty highly and their independence, I think, is really what they're trying to preserve.

855
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,720
This is this is a I had no idea that when look at look at how much I didn't know.

856
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,960
I didn't know you were I literally this is how dumb I am.

857
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:40,360
I thought cataract surgery is literally removing the sort of crud that's in the lens.

858
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,760
And I don't know, I just naively assumed it would like the good stuff would grow back.

859
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,160
Right.

860
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,080
Never knew you were putting another lens in, let alone that you could actually

861
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,520
use the new lens as a way to correct other visual defects.

862
01:21:54,520 --> 01:22:01,880
That's right. And, you know, so the technology has evolved to the point where you can actually

863
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:08,680
correct those those those spectacle requirements. Now, many of our patients don't really care about

864
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:13,640
spectacle independence. They just want to see well. And that's easy to achieve as well.

865
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:20,520
But as these lenses have gotten better, our capabilities have gotten better.

866
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:27,160
If I needed cataract surgery today, right, knowing my diopter, the minus four, minus three business

867
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,480
with the slightest stigmatism, although I still haven't figured out how that's impacting my vision.

868
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,320
Right. I guess I sort of have it just but we'll come back to that.

869
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:41,160
If if you were going to swap out my lens, would you be able to correct the deficit of my magnitude?

870
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:45,400
We could. Yes. Yeah. Now, you know, the problem with a lot of these

871
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:56,920
eyes is they're they are attached quite firmly to people. And sometimes the patient's set of

872
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:02,040
expectations can be unrealistic in terms of what we can deliver. And so we have to really

873
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:07,560
carefully educate them on, well, what can these lenses actually do? Am I going to see like a

874
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:17,800
perfect hunter at dusk while still be able still being able to read up close? And maybe the answer

875
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,120
is yes. Maybe the answer is no. Can you tune it? Like, for example, if I said, you know, Stephen,

876
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:28,120
I don't care if I have to keep wearing contacts, I would love to not have to wear reading glasses.

877
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,480
Right. Because if I'm going to be honest with you, the reading glasses are a way bigger pain in my butt

878
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,520
than contacts because I just put my contacts in in the morning and take them out at night.

879
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,360
Right. Really doesn't phase me. Yeah.

880
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,640
The reading glasses annoy the hell out of me because I never remember to bring them to

881
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:48,680
restaurants ever. So I'm shining a phone light at my menu and putting it out here and or I'll be

882
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,920
reading the book to my kid at night and I'm like, oh, hang on, buddy, I got to go get my glasses.

883
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,080
Like that's actually more of an imposition of my life.

884
01:23:55,080 --> 01:24:01,320
Yeah. It's not an unusual request where we can intentionally set your vision for near or leave

885
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:09,000
it for near. You can certainly do that. It's just an optical calculation to set the point of focus

886
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,440
where you want it to be. You asked earlier about, well, what happens if I come into the clinic? What

887
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,120
gets measured? Yeah.

888
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:21,160
Well, one of the first things that we have to do is make sure that the surface of the cornea

889
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:28,360
is tuned up from a dry eye standpoint because that those dry eye, you know, patients, they're

890
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:33,960
the surface of their corneas. It's not optically pristine. It's a little distorted.

891
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,720
Do contact lenses make that better or worse?

892
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:41,560
It makes it a lot worse and it can throw off our measurements, which can throw off our calculations

893
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:46,840
because it's kind of pretty simple Newtonian physics, right? If you know the length of the

894
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:53,320
eyeball and you know the curvature of the front of the eye and you know the index of refraction of

895
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:58,760
the stuff that's inside the eyeball, how bendy the material is, light bendy the material is,

896
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:05,000
you can correct for as long as you know where the implant lens is going to reside,

897
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,240
you can correct for placing that image on the retina.

898
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:13,560
So the more perfect the shape of the cornea, right?

899
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:18,120
The better that calculation. That's right. And that is probably the weak link in the measurement,

900
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,160
in the set of measurements that we take, because we can measure the length of the eye,

901
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:28,040
we can measure the length of the eye from front to back very accurately with lasers.

902
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:34,360
So we can sort of, it's almost like a sonar, but with light, we can bounce a beam off of the back

903
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:41,800
of the retina and we know exactly how long the eyeball is. And we know roughly where the

904
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:49,400
implant lens is going to rest when we put it in. And if we know some other dimensions of the eye

905
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:56,600
and use the front curvature as one of our pieces of data, we can predict what power implant lens

906
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:07,720
to put in. Wow. Okay. So is there anything left on the IOL front or is there another

907
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:11,000
huge step function of technology that's going to be coming there? Because it doesn't,

908
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:19,880
it already sounds pretty remarkable. Well, in the mid 2000s, I started getting involved in

909
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:28,600
product design for a type of implant lens that could actually zoom focus front to back, not

910
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:35,560
a bifocal or a trifocal where you had different zones of focus, but a lens that could actually

911
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:46,040
move or change its shape. And I developed an implant that we put in humans in multiple

912
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:52,920
clinical trials outside the United States. And we found that we could zoom focus kind of like

913
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:59,160
the human lens would, but the multifocals, which are the lenses we've been talking about,

914
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:06,200
they're like bifocals, trifocal implants surpassed the capability of what we could achieve with the

915
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:15,800
lenses that I designed. And until someone comes out with a focusing implant lens that can zoom focus

916
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:24,920
with the same degree of power as the bifocal and trifocal implants, it's not going to be successful.

917
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:33,000
But if we had a lens that could change its shape or change its position and zoom focus seamlessly

918
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:40,440
from near to far, that would be a game changer. And I assume that there's no, you don't take the

919
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:46,040
lens from a young person who's passed away and ever try to implant that into,

920
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:52,680
it doesn't work the way a cornea does. That's right. That's right. In fact, if you violate

921
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:59,000
that capsule of the lens, the lens immediately becomes cloudy. So here's an example, let's say

922
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:06,680
that you talked about trauma. So a typical scenario is somebody is working with a weed

923
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:14,520
eater or whatever, a weed whacker. Yeah. And a piece of a shard of rock or glass or something

924
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:21,800
goes through the cornea and embeds itself in the lens. And it might even be an optically unimportant

925
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:27,960
part of the lens. Maybe it's off to the side, but once that capsule has been pierced, inevitably,

926
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:32,840
lens protein starts leaking out, inflammatory cells become-

927
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,160
You violated the privilege site.

928
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:39,240
It's no longer privileged and within days you start to see a cataract.

929
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,360
And they need a new lens.

930
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,560
They need a new lens.

931
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:41,880
For sure.

932
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,320
Do they need a new cornea, by the way?

933
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:48,920
Well, they sometimes do, but oddly enough, sometimes an object will pass through the cornea.

934
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:55,240
And because it's traveling at such a high velocity, it's usually sterile and it'll go through the

935
01:28:55,240 --> 01:29:02,520
cornea and embed itself in the lens or the iris or wherever. And some of these objects can be

936
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:10,040
left alone. But if the cornea has been damaged sufficiently that it's no longer able to

937
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,920
transmit a clear image, then it has to be replaced.

938
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:19,480
Wow. So let's talk a little bit about corneal pathology. So everyone's probably heard about

939
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,640
corneal abrasions. It's a very important reason. It's one of the few things I remember, right?

940
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:30,200
In surgery, you always tape the patient's eyes shut because you don't want an eyelid flipping

941
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,880
open in the middle of surgery and nobody's paying attention and a drape is running over

942
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:40,040
the eye and scraping the cornea. Is that the biggest insult that we think about for the cornea?

943
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,720
I mean, that's probably one of the more common ones. If you think about that eye that's

944
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:51,720
being left open in surgery while a patient is asleep and not blinking, that's sort of the

945
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:58,840
extreme version of dry eye where the cornea has completely dried out. And even if you weren't to,

946
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:05,640
if you didn't abrade the cornea, those epithelial cells would be so damaged by exposure,

947
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:14,200
just by not being continuously bathed in tears, that they would be severely damaged.

948
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:23,640
So dry eye is intimately related to corneal abrasion because you lack the lubrication that

949
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,680
normally takes place to prevent that type of thing.

950
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,040
And how much of an issue is that in our society?

951
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,200
Dry eye?

952
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:30,440
Yeah.

953
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:35,960
Oh, it's enormous. If you think about the things that cause dry eye...

954
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:41,320
I mean, there's obviously lots of medications that do it through anticholinergic side effects.

955
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:48,280
Absolutely. But think about all the antihistamines. Hormonal influences are profound in terms of dry

956
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:55,720
eye. Anything that causes dry mouth can also cause dry eye. In that sense, auto-immune conditions

957
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:00,760
can cause dry eye, so showgrins, rheumatoid arthritis. All of the connective tissue diseases

958
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:08,120
have a dry eye component to them. Perturbations of thyroid metabolism cause dry eye.

959
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:15,880
But a lot of women suffer from dry eye because I think it's mostly the influence of,

960
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:23,400
honestly, a lack of testosterone that is probably most intimately linked to dry eye. But we see

961
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:27,000
women on hormone replacement therapy that have miserable dry eye.

962
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:32,840
So you think the addition of estrogen and progesterone post-menopause could be an issue,

963
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,000
or do you think it's still just the lack of testosterone that you use?

964
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,680
I think it's the lack of testosterone.

965
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:37,720
Why do you think that?

966
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:42,680
I think it has to do with the health of the epithelial cells on the conjunctiva.

967
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:51,240
But there may be also influences on the secretion of tears from the lacrimal gland as well.

968
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:58,680
But dry eye is, I mean, I don't want to say it's universal in patients who are over a certain age,

969
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,680
but it's extremely common.

970
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:04,200
So what type of eye drops should we be using? How do we apply them?

971
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,760
Well, it really depends on the type of dry eye that you have, believe it or not, because there are,

972
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:17,560
we think of tears as just salt water, but that's really not what it is. It's really an emulsion

973
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:28,600
of lipids and mucin and all sorts of immune modulators and antibodies and all sorts of

974
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,800
things in this soup. Some of it is just what we refer to as the aqueous component of tears,

975
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:40,760
really just the salt water. But the sebaceous glands that are in the eyelids, we call them

976
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:44,440
myvomian glands, where the lashes come out of the skin.

977
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:51,640
Though the secretions of those myvomian glands can become dysfunctional, and that

978
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:59,800
means that the tears have a hard time gliding over the surface of the cornea, and that can lead to

979
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:07,640
dry eye. So all sorts of things that cause myvomian gland dysfunction, some of that

980
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:13,480
relates to diet. And some people believe that a diet high in saturated fats is more

981
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:26,440
likely to cause myvomian gland dysfunction. Certainly colder weather, like the sebaceous

982
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:33,320
glands in your skin respond better to sunlight, to heat. In a cold environment, those can become

983
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:41,240
plugged up, and bacteria can build up along the eyelid margin, causing inflammation. And when

984
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:50,200
there's inflammation, the lacrimal gland shuts down even more. So dry eye has really multi,

985
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,720
it's got a number of different causes.

986
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:00,920
Now, when I think about eye drops, I think about sort of the dropper that you try to get in your

987
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:04,840
eye, and you never get it, at least I can never get it in my eye, because I end up blinking all

988
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:10,920
the time. So then you try and drop it into the corner, and then let it sit up. But then I've

989
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:15,960
also seen like the mist, right? Yeah. So tell me about the different ways that one even applies.

990
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,680
Yeah, I think those are really the main ones. I mean, eye drops work pretty well for most people,

991
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:26,520
and that there are some mist sprays that, believe it or not, you can spray some of these, there's

992
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:34,520
one hypochlorous acid compound that you spray on the lids, and it sort of migrates into the eye,

993
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:41,720
and actually is very good for reducing the bacterial counts at the lid margin, which is

994
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:48,440
part of that inflammation cycle that is so critical in dry eye. But most artificial tears

995
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:53,560
come in the form of an eye drop. And that's okay. That's fine. And it's okay if you can't manage to

996
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:57,880
keep your eye open, or should you force it and hold your eye open? I mean, at some point,

997
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:03,800
you got to get it in the eyeball. Yeah. But that's one of just a whole bunch of strategies that we use

998
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:10,760
for treating dry eye. We add artificial tears, but we think that there's a very significant

999
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:17,720
benefit from supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids, especially high doses of omega-3 fatty acids,

1000
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:22,200
and omega-6, certain types of omega-6. Yeah, which omega-6 is it again?

1001
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:27,960
Well, it's what you'd find in blackcurrant seed oil, or borage oil, or evening primrose oil.

1002
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:37,000
That's the GLA, gamma-linoleic acid. So that is very helpful in dry eye. And interestingly,

1003
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:45,000
there was a very large randomized clinical trial looking at omega-3

1004
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,120
supplementation in pretty high doses. Do you remember how high?

1005
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:58,120
Three grams of actual EPA NDA checked. Correct. Yes. And the placebo arm was olive oil,

1006
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:05,880
which is presumed not to have a benefit in dry eye. And it showed no superiority of omega-3

1007
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:11,720
compared to olive oil. However, there's been a lot of criticism of this study.

1008
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,720
It's called the DREAM study. It was put on by the National Eye Institute.

1009
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:21,800
It turns out that if you bring people into the eye doctor four times a year,

1010
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,280
everybody gets better. Their compliance with artificial tears gets better.

1011
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,720
And were they using artificial tears?

1012
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:32,040
They were. They were able to use whatever they would normally use to treat their dry eye.

1013
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:36,760
So I guess like in the same way that if you go to the dentist four times a year, all of a sudden

1014
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:44,520
you're flossing before you go to the dentist. Both arms of the study got better. But it is our

1015
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:50,760
very strong clinical impression that omega-3s in high doses help with dry eye, primarily from a,

1016
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:56,920
I think an anti-inflammatory standpoint. Let's go back to light for a minute.

1017
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:02,840
So I've got some friends who are so fanatical about the importance of light that they never

1018
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:11,240
wear sunglasses. Now, and I'm kind of, there's a part of me that thinks light is, wow, it's got

1019
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,240
to be really important. I think about all the time I get outside and the light, it's great.

1020
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:19,480
It's great. But I also like wearing sunglasses because it's a part of me that's sort of afraid

1021
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:27,400
that too much UV light is damaging. So what's the balance of sunglasses versus not? And I want to

1022
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:31,000
talk about polarized glasses or do they matter and all that kind of stuff?

1023
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,360
Yeah. I mean, clearly there's a dose related phenomenon here. Too much light is bad,

1024
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:43,000
too little light is bad. What's the right amount? I tend to recommend sunglasses for air patients.

1025
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:49,240
Let's start with just the most obvious one. The most common site of skin cancer,

1026
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:54,360
the lower lid, lots of basal cells, squamous cell carcinomas,

1027
01:37:54,920 --> 01:38:01,720
sunglasses certainly reduce the incidence of that. Then we look at the photo aging of the lens itself.

1028
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:10,360
I think it's not a bad thing to delay the onset of cataract. And then the retina, macular

1029
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:16,280
degeneration. I think there's pretty clear evidence that UV exposure, particularly of the

1030
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:23,080
magnitude that you can get outside is associated with an elevated risk of age-related macular

1031
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:29,640
degeneration. Now, do we see this in hunter-gatherers who have otherwise amazing habits and therefore

1032
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:35,320
tend to be relatively privileged from optical pathology?

1033
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:41,960
So the confounding variable there is that northern European ancestry is a risk factor

1034
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:47,560
for macular degeneration, probably because of the lack of pigment. Because that pigment is

1035
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:53,800
protecting that very vulnerable vascularized component of the back of the eye.

1036
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:56,920
Oh, wait. So the darker your eye, the more protected you are?

1037
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:01,080
Absolutely. In the same way that your skin is more protected or more melanin.

1038
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:07,000
So light-eyed patients have more light getting in from the front of the eye.

1039
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,000
So their iris literally blocks less light hitting the lens.

1040
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:19,080
Yes. And the retina has less pigment behind it. And so the vascular supply to the retina is more

1041
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:23,480
exposed to UV light. And that's the way it's evolved because they've been in environments

1042
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:27,880
that don't have as much light available. But if you live near the equator or your

1043
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:34,200
ancestry is from that area, then you're going to have more pigment from an evolutionary standpoint.

1044
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:42,280
But I understand the fanaticism about wanting to have lots of blue light or bright light,

1045
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:49,720
but I think that it probably is fanaticism. I don't think that, at least if your goal is

1046
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:57,320
to reproduce, teach your children until they're 15 and then die, then get all the light you want.

1047
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:04,360
But if your goal is longevity or the postponement of senescence, certainly ocular senescence,

1048
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,680
I think it makes sense to protect your eyes from UV light.

1049
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:11,400
So for example, you came over here today where it's middle of the day in Austin.

1050
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:11,400


1051
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:15,560
It's a typical Austin beautiful sunny day. You're driving with sunglasses?

1052
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,560
Oh, for sure. Absolutely. 100%.

1053
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,560
Okay. So you're in sunglasses when you're outside.

1054
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:22,360
I am.

1055
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,640
After what time in the morning?

1056
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:31,560
If I'm outside and my vision is better with sunglasses, it's not worse with sunglasses

1057
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,160
than I'm going to wear sunglasses. I don't wear them at night and I don't wear them

1058
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:41,480
if it's very early in the morning. But if conditions allow, I'm going to wear them.

1059
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:49,560
We talk about with sunscreen, the importance of you're still susceptible to sunburn in the

1060
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:55,000
clouds. If you're at the beach all day and it's an overcast day, do you recommend people still

1061
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,200
wear sunglasses even if it's not a clear blue day?

1062
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:05,000
For sure. And sometimes, this came up during the recent eclipse because people were saying,

1063
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,920
okay, I'll look at the eclipse. This one was a few years ago. I'll just use sunglasses. Well,

1064
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:17,160
that's actually much, much, much, much worse because you're increasing the aperture of your

1065
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:23,240
pupil because everything is dim, but you're letting through all this very damaging light.

1066
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:27,000
Because no amount of sunglasses could block a straight shot looking at the sun.

1067
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:32,360
Correct. So I think even on a cloudy day, I do recommend that people wear sunglasses.

1068
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:36,040
Yeah. Okay. What are polarized glasses doing?

1069
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:42,840
As you know, polarized lenses are essentially, it's a lens that has a bunch of lines drawn in

1070
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:48,040
it all in the same direction so that some of the light is blocked. But in one meridian,

1071
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:53,400
all the light effectively is let through. But perpendicular to that, none of the light gets

1072
01:41:53,400 --> 01:42:00,920
through. And polarized lenses have some pluses and minuses. One of the big minuses I found is that

1073
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:10,120
a lot of the displays in your cars now, you get this really messed up cross-polarized effect

1074
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:15,400
where the light coming off of the screen is polarized. And if you look at it through polarized

1075
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:23,240
glasses, if you tilt your head, it gets brighter and darker. You cannot see it. And by the same

1076
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:28,760
token, many of the windows or winds, I don't know if it's the windshield or the side windows,

1077
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:33,560
but I've noticed wearing polarized lenses, which I only wear for fly fishing now,

1078
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:42,360
that I would get these very weird effects by tilting my head because of the cross-polarized

1079
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:47,880
effect. Essentially, you have two different polarized filters and it's letting through

1080
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,600
variable amounts of light depending upon the orientation of your head and your eye and the

1081
01:42:52,600 --> 01:43:00,680
spectacles. I have found myself more comfortable in non-polarized lenses unless I'm on water.

1082
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:07,400
The issue there is that the light bouncing off the water or theoretically a highway,

1083
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:12,680
it's all pretty much a lot of it is polarized in one direction. That's the rationale behind

1084
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:17,800
polarized lenses. And for seeing a fish, if you're a fly fisherman, for sure that's helpful.

1085
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:25,080
I fly fish for the first time last month. And I could see getting into that. That is an art.

1086
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:33,800
For sure it is. But in terms of polarization, there's no evidence that I've seen that

1087
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:40,840
polarization versus non-polarization in sunglasses helps. It's really the UV filter

1088
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:48,200
that is helpful for what we're doing in terms of protection of eye health. You could wear clear

1089
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:55,400
spectacles as long as they had UV protection and still achieve the benefit of sunglasses.

1090
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,440
Yeah, that's an important point, right? It's not the tint.

1091
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,680
It's not the tint. It's the ultraviolet protection.

1092
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:04,840
And it's the same as true in a car, right? I mean, the glass of the car is assuming you don't have

1093
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,960
tinted windows, is still getting rid of most of the UV light.

1094
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:15,160
Most of the UV, but not all. And dermatologists tell us this, that in truck drivers who are in

1095
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:21,560
North America, they see more UV damage to the left side of their face than the right side of their

1096
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:31,160
face by far. And in the UK, it's exactly the opposite. So even car and truck windows let some

1097
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:37,480
UV light in. Okay, so let's now go back to the standard situation of nearsightedness.

1098
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:45,400
So person comes in, they're nearsighted. Decision one is, I'm going to correct this with glasses

1099
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,280
versus contacts. We'll start to talk about corrective surgery in a moment.

1100
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:48,440
Yeah.

1101
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,040
Do you nudge people one way or the other? I mean, I wore glasses for the first

1102
01:44:54,920 --> 01:45:02,520
four years that I needed corrective lenses. So that meant basically college.

1103
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:07,000
Trying to think in med school. I think by med school, I was wearing contacts.

1104
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:15,160
By residency, I went back to glasses because the call, you just couldn't be predictable about when

1105
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:19,480
you were going to put them in. So I did all of residency in glasses. And then since that time,

1106
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:25,000
I've been a hundred percent contacts. Yeah, it's funny because we'll see residents or fellows or

1107
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,400
whatever, and they come in and on their one day off and they're seeing one of our optometrists.

1108
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:35,720
When did you last have your contacts out? And they're like, I think it was June 30th,

1109
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:44,680
right before my internship started four months ago. That sort of thing. And so as you know,

1110
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:53,560
residents are notoriously bad about their own health hygiene because you're so busy. But

1111
01:45:54,040 --> 01:46:02,200
to answer your question more directly, I don't really see patients for regular eye exams myself.

1112
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:10,760
But so the people who see me are seeking surgery already. But in terms of, hey, I'm at a cocktail

1113
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:16,360
party and someone says, should I wear glasses or contact lenses or spectacles? Well, the safest

1114
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:20,920
thing you can do is wear spectacles for sure. Wait, do you use glasses and spectacles

1115
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:28,200
interchangeably? Yes. When I say spectacles, I'm referring to glasses to distinguish them from

1116
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:38,680
stuff you drink water out of. So yeah, spectacles is the term of art for glasses.

1117
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:45,800
So if you were thinking of some sort of exotic type of-

1118
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:49,240
Yes, I was like, oh, there must be some glasses, but then there's a spectacle.

1119
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:52,520
It's like down at ye olde spectacle shoppy.

1120
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:58,040
Something like that. Anytime my wife talks about pushing the gas pedal, I'm like, throttle.

1121
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:02,360
It's a throttle. It's throttle application. We need some gas. No, we need petrol. Okay.

1122
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:09,080
Right. It's gasoline or petrol. It's not gas. Gas refers to natural gas. When you push that

1123
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:13,080
thing, it's throttle application. Yes. Okay. No. Yeah. We're hard to live with, aren't we?

1124
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:22,760
Okay. So spectacles and glasses are synonymous. That's the safest thing you can do. They're

1125
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:29,400
going to work every time and there's essentially no risk associated with them. There's a big debate

1126
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:36,280
about what the next safest thing is. Is it contact lens wear for 10 years where you might be

1127
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:43,640
susceptible to infection or is it laser vision correction? But I tend to say if you're doing

1128
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:49,640
fine with spectacles or contact lenses, do that. I was kind of hoping you were going to tell me,

1129
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:54,680
get laser eye surgery because there's a part of me that just wants to do it for the sake of doing

1130
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:58,680
it and getting rid of context once and for all. But you were very much in the camp of,

1131
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:03,320
you asked me a bunch of questions. And at the end, your conclusion was these don't seem to be an

1132
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:07,640
inconvenience for you. You've never once had an eye infection. You tolerate them really well.

1133
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:13,480
They don't seem to bug you. Right. And you like your near vision. Yeah. Yeah. And so if you were to

1134
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:19,640
correct your distance vision with laser vision correction and set both of your eyes for distance,

1135
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:25,880
you would lose that near vision. So until maybe I get my cataracts fixed, then we can tweak them.

1136
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:31,160
That's a whole other story. So let's talk about the advent of laser eye surgery. So I think

1137
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:35,640
everybody listening to this has heard of LASIK. Yes. Most people probably haven't heard of PRK.

1138
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:42,120
Right. Which we'll talk about. When did PRK came along first? Yeah, a little bit earlier. Yes.

1139
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:49,640
And that was when? In the 90s? Right. So the approvals for PRK and LASIK were in the mid-90s,

1140
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:57,720
1995, 1996. The first procedures were actually done in, the first procedure was PRK and it was done

1141
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:06,040
in New Orleans. And I happened to be in training there in New Orleans. And this was performed by

1142
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:13,720
a physician called Marguerite McDonald. And she did the very first treatment on a human eye. The

1143
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:22,280
way this came about was that eczema lasers, which are the kind of lasers we use in LASIK and in PRK,

1144
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:30,440
which stands for Photorefractive Keratectomy. Eczema lasers are and were used to etch microchips.

1145
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:38,680
And an engineer at IBM realized that you could change the curvature or you could make cuts in

1146
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:45,880
human tissue. And because of the nature of this ultraviolet laser, there was essentially no

1147
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:55,560
bystander trauma to the adjacent tissue. So the tissue could be etched or cut. And because it

1148
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:03,320
generated no heat, there was no immune response generated typically. So that these incisions or

1149
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:10,440
whatever it was, they would heal without scarring. And I can remember vividly looking at the very

1150
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:18,120
first patients that were in an FDA clinical trial that had PRK. And I was astonished that

1151
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:23,400
you could look at them under a microscope and you could not detect that surgery had been done. That

1152
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:28,840
was really a revelation for me where I just saw these eyes that looked like normal eyes. And the

1153
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:36,200
only difference was the patients could see. So the first eyes were treated in 89 and then that led to

1154
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:43,000
FDA approval in 95. And the treatment in 89 was part of clinical trials, Emes. For sure.

1155
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,360
It was part of a clinical trial. So let's explain what PRK does before LASIK. Yeah. So the way it

1156
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:55,560
works is that you have the cornea, again, like the glass on a watch, the thing a contact lens

1157
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:02,920
would sit on. And let's say that the person is nearsighted. The cornea in that person is a little

1158
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:10,440
bit too steep to focus the light perfectly on their retina. Another way of looking at it is that-

1159
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:14,440
And again, the cornea is about two millimeters thick? No, it's about a half a millimeter thick.

1160
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:21,800
It's about 500 microns, maybe a little more. So either the cornea is a little too steep or the

1161
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:27,800
eyeball is a little too long, probably a little of both. We can't change the length of the eye.

1162
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:31,880
By the way, the length of the eye is the one that we talked about being somewhat malleable during

1163
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:37,800
development. That's right. And is the corneal shape hereditary? Is that the hereditary component

1164
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:43,560
of vision? The corneal shape doesn't seem to change that much throughout life. It's the length

1165
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:48,920
of the eye that changes, unless there's a pathological condition that changes the cornea.

1166
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:54,760
So since we can't change the length of the eye, what we can change is the curvature of the front

1167
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:59,880
of the eye. And if you think about it, you don't have to change the curvature that much. Think

1168
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,120
about how thin a contact lens is. How thin is it? I mean, I know I can feel it, but I don't know

1169
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:11,640
what that is. Is that also about half a mil? No, it's less. I honestly don't know. I don't

1170
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:16,520
work in that world, but it's pretty thin. I mean, it's like a little piece of cellophane. If you

1171
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,360
think about like an AccuView disposable- Yeah, it probably just feels thicker because of all the

1172
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:25,960
goo on it. Yeah. So I'm sure someone will correct me and say, you should know how thick a contact

1173
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:32,440
lens is. I don't, but it's thin, right? It's pretty thin. So it's just that little curvature

1174
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:38,760
that needs to change in order to focus the light on the right. And just to use an extreme example,

1175
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:45,080
so you take somebody who has a very minimal degree of nearsightedness. So let's say their

1176
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:51,080
diopter is minus one, then you contrast the lens that they would wear to the lens that's someone

1177
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:59,880
who's near blind at like a minus 10. Is the minus one creating more of a bend or less of a bend?

1178
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:06,520
Meaning is it a bigger curve or a smaller curve? So the person who's minus one, their cornea is

1179
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:14,520
less potent in bending light than the minus 10 person is. That minus 10 means their eye is 10

1180
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:23,000
units too strong and we need to reduce the power of the eye. So how would you fix that with a laser?

1181
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,920
Well, first of all, how do you fix that with the contact? So their lens has to look-

1182
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:36,280
The curvature of their lens has to be effectively flatter than their eyeball. So you need a larger

1183
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:40,760
radius of curvature or a flatter eye. I got it. Okay. So you would actually build up the outside

1184
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:46,040
of the lens. Exactly right. Okay. So it's even easier to explain with laser vision correction.

1185
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:53,240
So let's take a crude analogy, which is that the cornea is made out of wood and I have some sand

1186
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:58,520
paper. Well, I can sand down the center of the wooden cornea and make the flatter. To take

1187
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:04,680
the flatter off. And I'm removing some sawdust goes away and now that is flatter. And so it's

1188
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:10,920
less powerful in bending the light and I can focus that on the retina. So in your minus one

1189
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:17,640
example, we would remove about 20 microns of tissue. That's not a lot. You figure out human

1190
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:24,280
hair is about 50 microns. So like less than half of one human hair's thickness.

1191
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:31,400
And PRK does that directly. With an eczema laser on the very front part of the cornea. So

1192
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:39,240
we, the way we do it is that the very front coating of the cornea is called the epithelium.

1193
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:44,840
It's a very thin layer. Kind of like how thick is the epithelium there? So it's a,

1194
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:50,440
it's about again, about 50 microns, something like that, 50, 55 microns. So

1195
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:58,840
it's got a basement membrane. It's, but it's about call it 50 microns. So we remove that layer of

1196
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:07,800
cells with, the way I do it is with a solution of some eye drops of alcohol. And it just sluffs

1197
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:12,680
right off and it grows back. Just like isopropyl alcohol. Yeah. You could use that or ethanol.

1198
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,520
So you anesthetize the eye before doing that, obviously.

1199
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:21,640
That's a practice builder. Thank you for that tip.

1200
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:22,600
How do we get the repeat?

1201
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:23,720
I have a line known as coming back.

1202
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:28,680
When are we on the eye first? That'd be really good. Yeah. So you, you anesthetize the eye

1203
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:34,600
and then you put some alcohol solution on the front of the cornea. You remove that epithelial

1204
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:39,960
layer, which is going to grow back in the same configuration. And then you use a very

1205
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:44,440
carefully calibrated laser to change the shape of the cornea.

1206
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:47,640
Again, dumb question. The laser's coming at what angle?

1207
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:52,280
It's essentially effectively perpendicular to the, to the corneas. The patient's laying

1208
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:55,560
down flat. They're on their back. And you put something into wire their eyes.

1209
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,720
We're holding their lid apart for them. Are they sedated?

1210
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:02,520
They're there. I mean, I honestly give people Valium because it's just sort of an intimidating

1211
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:08,120
minute. You know, it only takes a minute. Here's what my fear would be in doing it is like my

1212
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:13,400
desire to blink would be so overwhelming. I'd break the little eye barrier. Of course I wouldn't,

1213
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:17,320
but I'd end up moving my head and you'd zap the wrong part of my eye and I'd be blind.

1214
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:21,800
That's everyone's fear. You know, it turns out Valium is undefeated.

1215
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:30,840
It's just a question of how much, but the, the, it's a very good drug. And, and so,

1216
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:36,600
but to address what you, you brought up several things there. First is a lot of patients fear

1217
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:43,720
that they'll do something to goof up the surgery. And there are a number of reasons why that really

1218
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:51,560
can't happen, but let's go through the procedure from the beginning. Long before this patient ever

1219
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:58,920
laid down on this gurney to have this laser treatment done, their eye was digitally mapped

1220
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:05,720
using what we refer to as a way front sensing device. So think about this. We

1221
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:12,840
send in a very narrow beam of light with a laser and we look at how it bounces back from the cornea.

1222
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:20,840
It bounces back in a distorted fashion. So we send an ideal ray of light in or multiple rays of light

1223
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:28,760
in, and they bounce back into distorted fashion. The amount of that distortion allows us to map

1224
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:34,760
the, so you do a topo. It's much more than an autographical map. It's the entire,

1225
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:39,560
optical pathway of the eye from the retina to the back and all the way to the back and front.

1226
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:45,240
So we look at the entire distortion pathway and there's more than one way to do this, by the way,

1227
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:52,040
there is a topography based way to do this as well, which is very effective. But the one I'm

1228
01:57:52,040 --> 01:58:00,440
describing to you is sort of the easiest one to think of. We send in a known uniform beam of light

1229
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:05,880
uniform beam of light and look at how it bounces back from the back of the eye. That tells us what

1230
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:11,640
are the distortions present in this eye? How much nearsightedness, how much farsightedness,

1231
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:16,680
but also all of these physics terms of, we didn't do this in me, right? You only do this in someone

1232
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:21,400
who's going to be a candidate. We may have done it in you just for grins, but we, you know, we

1233
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:28,920
diagnostically, this is part of our workup for laser vision correction. And we look at how that,

1234
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:37,640
how the, this particular eyeball, you know, Peter Attia's right eye distorts light as it goes

1235
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:46,840
through the optical pathway. This technology was developed for telescopes that have to contend

1236
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:53,880
with atmospheric distortion. So the way this works is that telescopes, and I'm talking about like

1237
01:58:54,520 --> 01:59:01,480
Keck, the best ones in the world, they send up a diagnostic laser into the atmosphere.

1238
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:08,760
And the distortion that that laser is encountering is adjusted for in real time

1239
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:17,880
with a deformable mirror, a very thin mirror. And that allows them to essentially correct for the

1240
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:23,640
distortions of the atmosphere in real time. And those are constantly changing. We have the benefit

1241
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:30,440
of not having to deal with real time evolving distortion, but we can take a snapshot of what

1242
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:37,800
are the distortions of Peter's right eye. And then we can build them into the laser vision

1243
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:43,080
correction that we do on Peter's right eye. Part of doing that means that we have to be able to

1244
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:51,560
track your eye. So we have to lock onto and register your eye with the, with the equipment and any

1245
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:57,720
movement that you make, part of your fear was I'm going to mess it up. Well, the laser can track

1246
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:03,560
far more rapidly than you can move your eye. So while you're doing this, patients eyes can be

1247
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:07,800
moving. They can. And it doesn't matter because the laser is moving. I mean, it's sort of annoying

1248
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:12,360
when they, you know, so we tell the, we coach them, Hey, look at the flashing light. Yeah. But

1249
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:17,560
that's really just to keep them in the ballpark of where the tracker can lock onto them. I like

1250
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:24,120
knowing I'm not the only one that has this ridiculous fear. It's not a ridiculous fear.

1251
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:30,440
Secondly, it's universal. When I say to patients, Hey, I'm not going to let you do anything to mess

1252
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:36,120
this up there. Thank you. Thank you for saying that. That was the thing I was worried about.

1253
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:41,320
Because you know, you don't want someone to laser your eye and you looked off to the side.

1254
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:47,080
Oh, disaster. Not only are you blind, we also gave you a brain to. That's right. So the laser

1255
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:55,480
will not fire unless you are within its range of tracking and it will move faster than you can

1256
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:04,120
move. So PRK is, I like your analogy, basically changing the shape of this via the mechanism of

1257
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:08,840
like kind of, it's not sanding it off, but it is vaporizing the tissue. It's vaporizing the tissue.

1258
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:14,120
And it's a laser that's sort of scanning around the cornea where it does a little treatment here.

1259
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:20,040
And then we know thermally that we don't want to do another shot right next to that one. So we move

1260
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:25,880
over here and we want to let the tissue cool down for a few milliseconds. And then we go over here.

1261
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:31,000
So the laser dances around. How many minutes approximately does it take? Does it take longer?

1262
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,200
The worst the prescription is. Yeah, for sure. So like minus two, it might be 15 seconds.

1263
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:40,520
That's it? Yeah. Maybe it's, yeah.

1264
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:45,880
So minus 10 would be how long? Like a minute or so. It depends on the laser. It depends on the

1265
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:50,040
overall treatment size, how much astigmatism and how many.

1266
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:54,280
Oh, you're fixing the astigmatism as well. And all the little distortions, how much

1267
02:01:54,920 --> 02:02:02,520
coma, trefoil, all these, these are physics terms that I didn't really think I would become fluent

1268
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:09,080
in. But all these little optical distortions that the optical physicists are very familiar with,

1269
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:14,520
we measure and do our very best to eliminate with laser vision correction.

1270
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:20,040
So the whole procedure is what? Half an hour by the time you get the eye,

1271
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:25,160
get the, put this thing in the eye, put this thing in the eye, give them their volume.

1272
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,280
For PRK? Yes.

1273
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:30,520
Two or three minutes plus the volume time.

1274
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,560
You know, it's the procedure. So take your volume an hour before.

1275
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:37,720
Or maybe it's, yeah, it's like half an hour. We have them chew it up and then it works pretty quickly.

1276
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:45,160
Okay. So talk about the recovery from PRK because one of the things I remember you saying when I was

1277
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:53,000
sort of humming and hawing about this was the biggest drawback of PRK is the recovery takes

1278
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,320
longer. But you otherwise, I think really talked about PRK as the gold standard.

1279
02:02:57,320 --> 02:03:03,720
You know, I think it's the only reason I might've said gold standard was that it came first.

1280
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:10,200
It was the first procedure. And if you look at PRK and LASIK, which we'll get to in a bit,

1281
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:16,680
if you look at those procedures, say 30 days later, they're indistinguishable in terms of results.

1282
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:25,160
But the LASIK patients get their way quicker. So PRK, now I've removed your epithelium. So now

1283
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:32,040
you have this, let's say it's a seven or eight millimeter diameter area of your central cornea

1284
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:40,360
that has no epithelium. It's like having a big corneal abrasion, essentially. Luckily, we have

1285
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:47,960
drugs, drops that can reduce the feeling of the foreign body sensation dramatically.

1286
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:53,720
So we put those drops on the cornea, put a contact lens over the eye like a band-aid. It's really

1287
02:03:54,360 --> 02:04:01,480
like a just a regular soft contact lens. And then the epithelium begins to heal from the outside in.

1288
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:08,200
And that takes 30 days? No, that takes about four days. But here's the thing. It's like,

1289
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:15,640
if you were to have a cut on your arm, it would heal over, but you'd still be able to detect where

1290
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:22,600
that cut was because those cells have not fully remodeled themselves. So the cut heals over or the

1291
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:27,320
defect in the epithelium heals over in about four days, maybe less.

1292
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:28,760
And then you take the contact lens off?

1293
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:34,440
You can take the contact lens off then, but the vision is still not perfect yet because those

1294
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:44,280
cells have to reorient themselves like a bunch of orderly bricks in a brick wall. And when the cells

1295
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:52,200
first cover that defect, it's a very thin disorganized layer of cells that have accomplished

1296
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:57,800
their mission of sealing the defect and preventing you from being susceptible to infection,

1297
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:04,280
which is their job, to quickly cover the defect. But then the body can turn its attention to

1298
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:07,880
reorganizing those cells in a more- So you do one eye at a time, obviously.

1299
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:15,800
Not with PRK or LASIK, no. Because the level of vision, typically we do both eyes on the same day,

1300
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:22,920
because the level of vision is probably about 20, 30, or 20, 40 within a day or two.

1301
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:32,440
So when I say the visual recovery takes a while, you get pretty good pretty quickly,

1302
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:39,240
but that last little bit takes several days. So you probably could drive a couple, maybe

1303
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:44,280
two, three days later, but you wouldn't have 20-20 vision at that point.

1304
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:49,800
So LASIK, the only thing I know about that is there's a flap involved.

1305
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:50,200
That's right.

1306
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:57,400
So presumably you're not shaving off the epithelium, you're cutting a flap, and how much of that

1307
02:05:58,040 --> 02:06:03,640
tissue you take off determines the shape of the new cornea when the flap comes back.

1308
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:09,640
Right. So the laser that does the vision correction, all the little distortions,

1309
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:13,080
the nearsightedness, the astigmatism, that's all the same laser.

1310
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:19,160
So that part of the procedure is identical. But instead of doing that on the surface of the eye,

1311
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:28,920
now we're using a step before that where we create a flap in the cornea using a different type of laser.

1312
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:36,200
So we use a femtosecond laser to create about, let's say, a 100 micron flap.

1313
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:38,440
So we are now under the epithelium.

1314
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:40,680
So you've taken 20% of the cornea up?

1315
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:48,520
That's right. About 20% of the cornea up. And now think of it as, in our analogy where we were

1316
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:55,560
sanding a wooden eye before, now think of the cornea as a book. And in PRK, I'm removing the

1317
02:06:55,560 --> 02:07:01,320
first 10 pages of the book. Now I open it to page 100 and I'm taking out 100 through 110,

1318
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:08,680
and then I close the book. The beauty of LASIK is that because that tissue removal is sequestered

1319
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:14,600
under that flap, the body doesn't perceive that anything has been done. So it's very typical for

1320
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:21,400
patients who have LASIK to be 2020 the next morning. And so that's the appeal of that procedure.

1321
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:27,480
And that's why LASIK was developed post-PRK, presumably as a way to get around the healing

1322
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:28,440
process of PRK?

1323
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:34,360
Yeah, it was sort of a technological race. And the way it developed was interesting. And some of it

1324
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:41,160
was in pursuit of more rapid visual recovery.

1325
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:46,360
So what percentage of corrective eye surgery in the United States today is PRK versus LASIK?

1326
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,520
I assume the lion's share is LASIK.

1327
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:55,400
Yeah, I think it changes, but it's probably about 80 to 85% LASIK. And not to confuse things,

1328
02:07:55,400 --> 02:08:01,880
there's another procedure called SMILE, which is a very small, but perhaps growing segment of the

1329
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:09,000
market. And we can talk about that in a sec, but the lion's share of it is LASIK. And there is a

1330
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,400
but a significant chunk PRK. And we actually-

1331
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:13,960
Are there more risks in LASIK than PRK?

1332
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:20,760
Well, the risks are different because the risks of infection with LASIK are lower because you don't

1333
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:21,080
have this hope-

1334
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:22,120
You don't take your epithelium away.

1335
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:28,120
That's right. But you introduce another step in the procedure where you now have a flap

1336
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:35,480
and that flap can, if it's not performed correctly, that can lead to problems.

1337
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:43,320
I think there is a little bit more dry eye issue with LASIK compared to PRK as well. Because when

1338
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:51,000
you create that flap, the way tearing works is that a signal from the front of the eye goes to

1339
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:59,400
the lacrimal gland, which then secretes tears. If you create a flap, you temporarily sever some of

1340
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:05,240
the nerves that are sending the signal. And eventually over time, those nerves typically

1341
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:13,480
regrow back and you reestablish that feedback mechanism. But I think you get more dry eye with

1342
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:22,280
LASIK than with PRK and for longer. That is a controversial statement. There are people who

1343
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:28,840
have data to show that they're equal, but I think they both result in temporary dry eye in most

1344
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:34,200
patients. Some patients have dry eye for really long periods of time after both procedures,

1345
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:39,480
but the majority of patients are kind of back to their baseline in about probably 60 to 90 days.

1346
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:42,920
What about night vision or low light vision?

1347
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:53,560
So that s fascinating. In the early days of LASIK and PRK, the weakest part of vision was night

1348
02:09:53,560 --> 02:10:00,280
vision. And that was because the shape of the treatment that we did and the diameter that we

1349
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:07,240
treated was limited. So we couldn t really treat the peripheral part of the cornea that comes into

1350
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:14,200
play when your pupil gets big. So if you are treating a central part of the cornea that is

1351
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:20,920
smaller than a big pupil at night, you're going to see halos from that untreated peripheral part of

1352
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:30,120
the cornea. Over the last, like, I don t know, from the 90s to now, the treatment beam patterns

1353
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:37,080
have changed to address that issue and to treat that peripheral cornea differently. So now,

1354
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:41,480
night vision complaints we find to be pretty unusual with laser vision correction.

1355
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:43,560
Is there a difference in the cost of these procedures?

1356
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:50,040
I mean, for us, no, but I m sure there are some surgeons who charge more for one than the other.

1357
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:58,840
The added step of LASIK adds some cost, but PRK has more post-operative care, frankly,

1358
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:05,640
because it requires more visits to see these folks. But we price them the same.

1359
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:10,120
What are the, and how much does it cost, by the way? I mean, it s direction,

1360
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:12,200
it s probably come down a lot in 20 years, right?

1361
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:17,160
You know, I don t think that it has. I think it s been pretty stable. I think that you can,

1362
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:22,680
I think it s probably about a couple thousand dollars per eye is about the average in North

1363
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:29,720
America that you ll find. What are the exclusion criteria? Like, who is not a candidate for either

1364
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:36,040
one? Yeah, there are certainly contraindications, some of them relative, but some of them are

1365
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:41,720
absolute. I ll give you an absolute one. There are conditions of the cornea where the cornea is

1366
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:48,920
biomechanically unstable, where the cornea is actually has a tendency to bow forward

1367
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:57,240
in a pathological state. And that means that the cornea is not, it s a moving target, essentially.

1368
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:04,520
So, further biomechanically weakening the cornea makes no sense, and doing either procedure would

1369
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:11,880
do that. There are patients who have irregularities in their astigmatism that cannot be measured or

1370
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:18,600
corrected with any laser vision correction. There are patients that have certain autoimmune

1371
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:22,920
diseases that maybe render them as poor candidates for laser vision.

1372
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:25,160
Based on the risk of healing?

1373
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:32,680
Based on the risk of healing or perhaps the, just the overall health of the eye. And that sort of

1374
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:40,520
extends to people who have other eye diseases like cataract or maybe glaucoma or retinal pathology.

1375
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:46,280
You are typically operating on healthy eyes when you re doing laser vision correction. So,

1376
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:50,280
if there s some other issue involved, you might not be a candidate.

1377
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:57,560
And is there anything that, like, well, I guess given the differences you ve explained,

1378
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:00,680
why are 15% of people still opting for PRK?

1379
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:05,480
Well, there are certain patients where that s a far better option. So, we talked about how you re

1380
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:11,640
removing pages from a book. Well, what if you have a really deep treatment that you need to do,

1381
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:16,920
and the book is sort of thin to start out with? Maybe it s better to begin on page one than to

1382
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,520
begin on page 100. So, sometimes. So, the stronger the diopter and the thinner the cornea that might

1383
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:27,720
move you more towards PRK. Sometimes the thickness of the cornea will dictate it. Sometimes it might

1384
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:33,800
be related to someone with pre-existing dry eye. And we re thinking, well, we have data that these

1385
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:39,000
two procedures are about the same in terms of dry eye, but our clinical impression is that LASIK

1386
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,520
makes them a little drier. So, maybe let s do PRK on this particular individual.

1387
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:49,960
There used to be some restrictions in branches of the military.

1388
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:53,160
Right. I remember that you couldn t have a flap in your eye if you were a pilot.

1389
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:59,400
That all went away. So, pretty much all the aviators and pilots can now have LASIK or PRK.

1390
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:03,880
In fact, the military is one of the largest providers of laser vision correction now

1391
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:11,880
in the United States. But there are a couple of holdout special forces branches where they don t

1392
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:20,200
want you to be, I think, maybe an army ranger. And that has to do with getting poked in the eye

1393
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:29,560
and the possibility that a flap could be damaged. And some of this is sort of vestigial lore and

1394
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:34,280
it s hard to change the military s rules. Yeah, but they ll just say PRK or nothing.

1395
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:40,520
Yeah, but I d say that the overwhelming majority of the branches of service allow either treatment

1396
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:48,760
and certainly all the commercial airliners, they allow PRK or LASIK. But with the caveat that you

1397
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:54,280
have to get to the point where you can pass the flight physical. And the same thing is true of

1398
02:14:54,280 --> 02:15:00,360
people who want to be pilots or aviators. If they need to have 2020 uncorrected vision to be a pilot,

1399
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:03,800
they have to have 2020 vision after laser vision correction.

1400
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:09,720
Is it pretty much a given that you can at least get someone to 2020 after laser corrective vision?

1401
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:14,520
I mean, the way the lasers are built today, it s typically the case that you can get them to

1402
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:20,760
2020 or better than 2020 as we were describing before. And if you take them to 2015 and they

1403
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:28,440
have presbyopia to begin with, does it get any worse or is it just that now they re noticing

1404
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:31,880
it all the time because they never get a break from it? They never get to take their glasses off,

1405
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:39,640
their spectacles, so to speak. Well, if you nail it perfectly so that their prescription is 0.00,

1406
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:45,880
I think their distance vision will be phenomenal and their near vision will be whatever it is based

1407
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:51,720
upon their age. So if they re 50 years old, they re probably going to need some near correction,

1408
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:59,160
some spectacles for reading. If they re 41, 2, 3, 4, maybe even 45, they may not need

1409
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:04,760
glasses for close up. And then you mentioned this smile procedure. I haven t heard of that. What is

1410
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:12,840
that? Yeah, it s an interesting procedure. It s using a single laser, a femtosecond laser. And

1411
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:19,640
this is, I want to go back to the book analogy where we opened the book to page 100. Well,

1412
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:28,680
imagine if you could somehow create a little tunnel down to page 100 and snatch out pages 100

1413
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:36,120
through 110 while keeping the incision really tiny and perform it through a very small keyhole

1414
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:43,640
procedure. That procedure has gained some traction outside the US and in the US. It seems to be an

1415
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:52,440
effective procedure. What problem is it solving given how effective LASIK is? I would say the

1416
02:16:52,440 --> 02:17:01,720
problem it was designed to solve was dry eye. But I think the problem it really solved,

1417
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:08,680
especially outside the United States, was needing two lasers versus one. So maintaining and.

1418
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:17,240
But you could do one with PRK. You could do one with PRK. But then you have the prolonged recovery

1419
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:24,040
time. So the idea was could you get LASIK like velocity of return of vision. With a single laser.

1420
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:29,080
With a single laser. And maybe along the way, reduced dry eye. Yes. There are pros and cons

1421
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:37,240
to smile. The technology is evolving. I have not seen any data that shows that smile is in any way

1422
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:45,080
better than LASIK or even equal to LASIK frankly. But it seems to be a very good procedure. Are you

1423
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:51,000
doing it? I am not performing smile and doesn't mean that I won't in the future. And there are a

1424
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:57,480
number of competing second and third generation versions of smile that will come on board. And

1425
02:17:57,480 --> 02:18:01,160
if one of them ever rises to the point where I think it's better than what we're doing, we'll

1426
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:08,520
offer that. We didn't talk about glaucoma yet. I know every time I go to an optometrist or even

1427
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:14,920
when I came in saw you, is that the one where you blow the air at my eye? Well, that's sort of a

1428
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:20,040
that's just an intraocular way of measuring the intraocular pressure that we don't use,

1429
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:26,360
but it has the advantage of not requiring the patient to be touched with anything. So you can

1430
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:32,040
indent the cornea with a known amount of force from an air puff and look at how it optically

1431
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:38,040
deforms the disadvantage to the air puff. And it's not really considered a, I don't think a gold

1432
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:46,120
standard of measuring pressure is that if you blink really quickly and squeeze, then you can

1433
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:51,880
have a false reading with that type of air puff tonometry. And we typically don't use that.

1434
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:55,960
So how do you measure intraocular pressure? We measure it with two ways, both of which

1435
02:18:55,960 --> 02:19:00,920
indent the cornea, physically indent the cornea after. So that's why you anesthetize the.

1436
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:05,800
After you anesthetize the eye with a known amount of force. And then you look at the amount of force

1437
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:11,000
required to cause a certain amount of, of indentation. And what's the definition of glaucoma?

1438
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:17,640
Well, the glaucoma is probably about a hundred different diseases, honestly, but they all share

1439
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:23,640
the final common pathway of damage to the optic nerve, the nerve in the back of the eyes,

1440
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:28,360
the cranial nerve that you mentioned at the beginning, that is somehow related to pressure.

1441
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:36,840
So a pressure related optic neuropathy. Now what's odd about glaucoma is that there are people who

1442
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:42,520
have totally normal pressures with relation to the population, but that pressure is too high for

1443
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:46,520
them and they can develop damage to their optic nerve.

1444
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:52,440
And the symptoms of glaucoma, are they all this? I mean, is it always some change in vision? Is

1445
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:56,040
that what would bring someone to attention? If they weren't getting a screening test?

1446
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,760
It's funny, you just sort of like triggered a memory of mine. I had a patient, I was,

1447
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:06,760
I was in training years ago and I was explaining to a patient that, you know, glaucoma is totally,

1448
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:14,520
has no symptoms at all. You wouldn't notice it at all. And, and yet if we don't find it,

1449
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:18,440
it could be really bad. And the patient said, well, if it has no symptoms, what do I care?

1450
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:22,280
You know, like what's the point? And what I should have said was it has no symptoms

1451
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:29,400
until the very end. So in what happens is that your peripheral vision is damaged and most people

1452
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:35,560
will not detect a slight reduction in their peripheral vision, particularly if it's segmental.

1453
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:39,480
There's just one little area off to the side that they're, that they can't see,

1454
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:46,680
particularly if the other eye is covering for that area. But as glaucoma progresses,

1455
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:50,120
it can affect central vision and then it becomes symptomatic.

1456
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:54,920
How much of a problem is this in the United States first of all, and then in the rest of the world?

1457
02:20:54,920 --> 02:21:00,200
Well, luckily glaucoma has become much more treatable. So the pharmacological management

1458
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:07,720
of glaucoma has gotten way better. And there are numerous laser procedures that can treat glaucoma

1459
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:14,680
and what are referred to as minimally invasive glaucoma procedures, or it stands for, you know,

1460
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:22,920
MIGS, minimally invasive. Basically the management of this has gotten way, way better.

1461
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:28,040
What are like the, what's the 80-20 of this? 80% of them are caused by what basically?

1462
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:37,560
Yeah. So 80% of them are caused by what we refer to as garden variety, chronic open angle glaucoma,

1463
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:44,840
which means that it's the glaucoma is not a function of the anatomy of the front of the eye

1464
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:51,640
being too crowded where the fluid can't get out. It's more a problem of overproduction of fluid

1465
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:56,920
inside the eye and the pressure is too high inside the eye. The vitreous fluid? No, it's the aqueous

1466
02:21:56,920 --> 02:22:03,800
fluid. And what causes that? Is that endocrine? Is that, do we not know? We do not know. I think

1467
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:12,760
this has a multifactorial pathogenesis. There are certainly family history components to this where

1468
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:17,640
we see it run throughout families, but it's not like inheriting. Does this run in parallel with

1469
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:22,680
diseases like type 2 diabetes or is it uncoupled completely? No, not really. It's not really

1470
02:22:22,680 --> 02:22:30,200
coupled with diabetes. There's some, there's some relationship to hypertension, but, you know,

1471
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:37,640
blood pressure, but ocular hypertension, we refer to eye pressure being too high.

1472
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:41,480
You know, you see it in patients who are not hypertensive at all.

1473
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:51,160
Wow. The lifelong incidence is what? I think you got me there. It's, I honestly don't know,

1474
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:56,440
but it's common or it's very common. We, every eye surgeon sees glaucoma patients daily,

1475
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:06,200
multiple glaucoma patients daily. So presumably like any neuropathy, if you catch it early enough,

1476
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:11,640
it's fully reversible. And if you catch it too late there, you, you damage it or is it, because

1477
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:15,480
this is not a central, this is a central nerve, not a peripheral nerve. So I don't, yeah, it's not.

1478
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:20,600
Yeah. I think it's, it's, you can arrest the progression, but I don't think you can undo

1479
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:25,560
the damage that has occurred. So once there's been optic nerve damage, it's not like sciatica.

1480
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:31,160
No, I don't think so. I think once there's been damage, we expect that damage to remain. So it's

1481
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:37,800
not unusual for a patient to have what we refer to as a visual field defect. So a little area

1482
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:44,920
missing from their field of vision. And our goal becomes to prevent that from defect from getting

1483
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:48,520
any bigger. And you can typically do that once you identify it.

1484
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:52,600
At what age does it start to become enough of a concern that we should be screening for it?

1485
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:56,280
Yeah. I mean, I think everybody, when they go to the eye doctor for a yearly exam,

1486
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:02,280
gets screened for glaucoma. They're, the appearance of the optic nerve is examined as well as the

1487
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:05,640
pressure. And those are probably the two most important things to look for with glaucoma.

1488
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:08,760
So if you're screening annually, you're, you're being checked for it.

1489
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:09,400
You're in good shape.

1490
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:16,440
Yeah. You're being checked for it. The incidence does go up with age. And so in the fifties,

1491
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:20,280
it's much more important to pay attention to glaucoma and beyond.

1492
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:23,720
And presumably in the developing world where people aren't going to get eye care,

1493
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:27,240
or even in the United States, if people don't choose to get eye care or can't afford to get eye

1494
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:31,080
care, it's a bigger risk because they'll only present when they have symptoms.

1495
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:33,000
That's right. That's exactly right. Yeah.

1496
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:42,520
All right. So to summarize, you know, again, we think about kind of the longevity of the eye is

1497
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:45,800
a pretty important thing, right? If you want to figure out a way to live to a hundred,

1498
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:50,520
you, we, we spend a lot of time thinking about, well, you've got to really, really delay the

1499
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:54,520
onset of atherosclerosis. You have to have a very aggressive strategy around the mitigation of

1500
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:59,800
cancer, Alzheimer's disease and all of these things. But it's these other things, teeth,

1501
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:03,800
ears, and eyes that I don't think get enough attention, right? I mean, it's, you don't want

1502
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:07,080
to get to be a hundred and have no teeth and you don't want to get to be a hundred and be deaf and

1503
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:10,440
you don't want to get to be a hundred and be blind. Yeah. Those all sound bad.

1504
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:15,320
Yeah. So I mean, the things I'm picking up, unfortunately for many of us listening to this,

1505
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:21,640
we can't go back and change what we did as kids. We can certainly make a change in our kids. So we

1506
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:27,080
can make sure that they are outside in natural sunlight. Right. I don't put sunglasses on my

1507
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:31,880
kids. Should I be doing that? Yeah. I mean, probably, you know, it's trying to get a kid

1508
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:38,360
to wear sunglasses is tough. I, we can't come up with better toys. Like my kids love trains. So if

1509
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:43,640
I could figure out a way to tell them that wearing sunglasses was train like, right? This would be

1510
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:50,680
good. Yeah. It's tough. I mean, you see kids who are snow skiing, for example, and they're,

1511
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:56,920
they should be wearing goggles because those have built in UV protection. Um, so that typically

1512
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:01,400
works, you know, for that type of thing. But gosh, when they're water skiing, they certainly can't

1513
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:07,000
wear glasses. If they're swimming, they can't wear sunglasses. Uh, there's a certain goggles

1514
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:12,280
these days are pretty good. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I that's, it's hard to get my kids to wear

1515
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:19,400
goggles, but you know, there's a certain amount of just UV exposure. I don't think it's possible

1516
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:25,240
to avoid. So the trade off is when in doubt, keep them out. Yeah. No hats are important as well. We

1517
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:30,120
didn't really talk about that. You know, I think that that's a very good and effective way, but

1518
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:35,240
it's not enough because a certain amount of light bounces off and hits the bottom of your cheek and

1519
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:41,160
goes right into your eye. So it's, so for those of us that are now adults, basically, we've kind of

1520
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:47,880
cast our lot, uh, with respect to that malleable period of changing the, the length. Well, you know,

1521
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:52,760
we didn't really talk about like what nutritional supplements might have some of the fact. And it's

1522
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:59,800
interesting because we know that with cataract, that vitamin C deficiency is associated with an

1523
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:05,400
elevated risk of cataract, but it's been shown really conclusively that vitamin C supplementation

1524
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:10,440
to super normal levels does not protect against cataract formation. And the things that have been

1525
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:17,560
looked at, I know a C and E basically antioxidants have been looked at. They've had no effect on, on

1526
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:25,080
cataract formation. There is a little bit of mixed, weak evidence for lutein and zeaxanthine

1527
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:31,720
as possibly being protective for cataract. Also antioxidants, right? Yes, that's correct. And

1528
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:37,960
you know, the macular degeneration, we didn't really touch on that very much, but that's a,

1529
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:44,680
a huge problem. Um, you may have seen in the drug store, they sell arids,

1530
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:52,760
AREDS formula for macular degeneration. That stands for the age-related eye disease

1531
02:27:52,760 --> 02:28:00,760
study. That was again, a national eye Institute initiative. And first they looked at, um,

1532
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:05,560
CE and beta carotene with zinc and a little copper. I guess they put the copper in because

1533
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:12,120
they were worried about copper deficiency with zinc supplementation. Um, and then they

1534
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:17,480
got concerned about beta carotene. So they did another study where they took beta carotene out

1535
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:24,040
and put in lutein and zeaxanthine powerful antioxidants. And what they showed was that

1536
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:31,400
you could delay or reduce the conversion of mild macular degeneration to severe,

1537
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:37,560
but it had no effect on severe disease. And it also interestingly had no effect on people

1538
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:43,000
who didn't have macular degeneration. It didn't prevent them from going on to get it. But I think

1539
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:48,200
most of us believe that there's something there. There's some signal embedded in that noise.

1540
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:53,560
Is light also a big risk for macular degeneration? It is. It is. So again, it's this dose thing. We

1541
02:28:53,560 --> 02:29:00,280
want enough light so you don't become nearsighted, but not so much that you're frying your retinas

1542
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:08,600
and giving yourselves cataracts. Um, but I do think that some form of, of broad spectrum

1543
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:15,800
antioxidant protection makes sense. We don't really talk explicitly about screen use. Yeah.

1544
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:19,640
Is there, I mean, you talked about it a little bit in that study in Asia where,

1545
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:25,000
but I don't know if that was specific to screen use or just could have been just as much reading.

1546
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,400
Yeah, it was not specific. Yeah. It wasn't specific to screen use. So when we know about

1547
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:35,720
phones specifically and computers. Yeah. So, you know, this is a super interesting, obviously

1548
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:42,360
topic and, and everything from people ask me about blue blocking glasses. They ask about,

1549
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:48,520
am I damaging my eyes? Am I going to get macular degeneration? Because I'm looking at a computer

1550
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:56,040
screen for 10 hours a day. I'll start with the easy ones. Uh, the amount of UV radiation coming

1551
02:29:56,040 --> 02:30:02,120
off of screens is sufficiently low that there has been no evidence at all that it's going to

1552
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:08,200
cause macular degeneration. Um, in the same way that you can't get a sunburn from a screen.

1553
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:13,720
I mean, the amount of blue light that you get from going outside is many, many, many orders of

1554
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:20,920
magnitude greater than what you can get from screens. Um, but I do think that blue light can

1555
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:27,080
mess up your circadian rhythm. And you know, it's, if you take someone and expose them to blue light

1556
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:32,760
at noon, that's great. If you expose them to that at 11 PM and then you try to go to sleep,

1557
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:38,760
that's messed up. And it's almost like we're running this gigantic experiment with humans

1558
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:45,720
where they think about like you have a turtle. Let's say you take a species of turtle that

1559
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:52,680
spends 90% of its time in the water, 10% on land. And we take that and flip it. Now it's 10%

1560
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:58,280
in the water. And then we look at these turtles and we think there's something weird going on

1561
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:04,040
with these turtles. Yes, they're surviving, but we've got them in a very altered environment

1562
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:09,720
compared to what they were evolved to deal with. So giving people blue light from a screen that's

1563
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:17,960
bright at 10 PM, 11 PM, and then asking them to go to sleep is a problem. So, you know, I really

1564
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:22,920
try to limit it's not clear that it's damaging their eyes, not damaging their, their retinas,

1565
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:28,440
or they're giving them cataracts, but I think it's messing up circadian rhythms. So although it is

1566
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:36,920
hard to disentangle that from the total amount of light that they're seeing, which is also unnatural

1567
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:41,960
and what comes with it, which is the stimulation. Right. You're thinking. Yeah. I mean, you know,

1568
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:47,880
there seems to be a difference between watching TV and checking email before bed. Maybe none of them

1569
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:53,480
are, maybe neither are ideal, but one seems demonstrably worse, at least for me. Yeah. I

1570
02:31:53,480 --> 02:32:00,840
think that's pretty universal. People feel that way that passive watching a TV is different than

1571
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:06,440
I'm going to, I wonder where Winston Churchill is buried. You know, you go down some wormhole and

1572
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:12,600
you're just, you know, you're just seeking information that takes you on these journeys. But

1573
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:23,080
one thing I do, I do have software embedded in all of my PCs that changes the color temperature.

1574
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:29,080
Like Flux or something. I love Flux. You know, and Flux is free, by the way, I think, for end users.

1575
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:34,280
And it will take the blue light sequentially out of your monitor as the day goes on,

1576
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:39,800
as the evening goes on to the point that it's like super amber as you get ready to go to bed.

1577
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:44,600
I really think that's great. Anything else we should be thinking about? I mean,

1578
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:49,240
the big takeaways for me have been the importance of sunglasses, artificial tears,

1579
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:54,200
taking your contact lenses out as frequently as possible. Right. So don't,

1580
02:32:54,760 --> 02:33:00,040
don't sleep in them and stuff like that. I know it's not your field, but do you have a point of

1581
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:05,000
view on daily versus the ones that, I mean, it just seems to me daily is if you can afford

1582
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:10,280
them make more sense than the two week ones that you have to wash every night. Yeah. So, you know,

1583
02:33:10,280 --> 02:33:16,280
I think the most important thing is that you just get them out of the eye. We really don't like

1584
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:24,280
extended wear contact lenses. So whatever type of contact that is, as eye surgeons, we tend to see

1585
02:33:24,280 --> 02:33:29,560
a selected sample of patients who are the problems, the people who have sight threatening

1586
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:35,720
infections from sleeping typically in contact lenses. So yes, I realize there are millions of

1587
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:40,040
people who sleep in their contacts and don't get infections, but the people who end up in my,

1588
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:49,000
you know, office have had problems and some of them quite devastating problems. So I'm not a

1589
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:55,400
big fan of sleeping in contact lenses in general, but if you're going to sleep in contact lenses,

1590
02:33:55,400 --> 02:34:01,480
I'd rather they be a perfect pristine new pair every single time and get them out as, as quickly

1591
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:08,440
as you possibly can. So yeah, I talked about eye protection. Yeah. Again, I think we're a little

1592
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:14,360
more aware of that now than when we were kids. The other thing takeaway for me is not to be so

1593
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:20,360
afraid of cataracts. They're inevitable and you can actually, there's a potential silver lining,

1594
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:27,240
which is not only the improvement of your vision, but potentially the correction of other age related

1595
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:34,520
visual changes. It is interesting that once word got out in the community that this was something

1596
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:40,840
that could be done, you do see people coming in asking for cataract surgery, I think a little bit

1597
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:46,040
sooner than they otherwise would because they know that this added benefit is a potential

1598
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:52,840
possibility. So, and you know, in the old days when we did not have intraocular lenses or the

1599
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:59,320
generation, a couple eye surgeons before me did not have intraocular lenses, you'd have to wear these,

1600
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:06,760
what were called cataract glasses, these super thick lenses that were very, very powerful and

1601
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:11,640
magnified everything and didn't really work all that well optically. So in that context,

1602
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:16,280
Wait, you wore those post cataract? Post cataract, yeah. Cause there were no implant lenses. Oh wow.

1603
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:23,240
And your prescription was typically about a plus 10. So you know that a minus 10 is a very,

1604
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:28,520
these people can't see without these glasses. That's right. And so these are like the Coke

1605
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:32,680
bottles that, and that's where glasses and spectacles meet. Do people even know what

1606
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:37,720
Coke bottles are anymore? So the bottom of a Coke bottle is a really thick piece of glass. And this

1607
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:43,640
would magnify your eyes and make your eyeballs look enormous. And then you would have this,

1608
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:50,120
all sorts of optical distortions because it's very hard to make a super powerful magnifying glass.

1609
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:57,400
With a long enough focal length. Without peripheral distortion. And so you in that

1610
02:35:57,400 --> 02:36:03,320
context would put off cataract surgery as long as humanly possible. So that's really not the case.

1611
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:08,040
Cataract surgery one and done. I mean, you said it is, it should be, but do people ever need

1612
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:14,040
re-operations? I mean, it's not unheard of where someone will have an implant lens put in that

1613
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:19,080
isn't functioning the way it should. And that can be replaced. Is it difficult to get the old lens

1614
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:25,400
out since you can't use the same technique to melt it away? Not really. You can just fold it,

1615
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:32,280
pull it out or cut it in half. So it doesn't get re-epithelialize or the crispy or whatever,

1616
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:37,000
the candy coating of the M&M doesn't stick to the new lens. A little bit, but you can free it up

1617
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:43,560
and take it out. You can swap out an implant lens. It's something that we don't do it. It's not like

1618
02:36:43,560 --> 02:36:49,640
changing your shirt, but you can certainly do it. It's another operation. One other question I had

1619
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:56,920
on the laser surgery, I forgot to ask was how stable does your prescription need to be?

1620
02:36:58,440 --> 02:37:02,040
Because if I understood correctly, again, there's two things that are driving that, right? There's

1621
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:06,760
the length, which presumably that's the part that needs to be stable. You don't want the length to be

1622
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:11,000
changing. That's right. But the shape of the cornea you're actually fixing. So if there's anything

1623
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:15,000
that's changing there, do you care? Well, there's really three variables. If you think about it,

1624
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:21,560
there's the cornea, the retina, the length of the eye, I shouldn't say retina, but the length of

1625
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:29,320
the eye and the lens itself. So we know that the lens is going to continue to change throughout

1626
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:36,360
life, but typically not until you're in your 50s, 60s, 70s when cataract formation will start to

1627
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:44,360
affect the light bending power of the lens. The cornea should not be changing. That would be a

1628
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:48,600
sign up. You just have to make sure this length is fixed. That's right. And typically that,

1629
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:53,080
unless you're someone going back to law school or you're reading 30 hours a day,

1630
02:37:53,960 --> 02:38:01,240
that is typically finished changing in the early 20s, like around 23, 24. So does that mean our

1631
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:06,760
prescriptions shouldn't be worsening much as we age? They really should not be worsening unless

1632
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:12,200
you're developing some cataract formation. Okay. Yeah. I think mine have been stable for about

1633
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:18,680
15 or 20 years. So that means I'd be safe to have laser eye surgery from the standpoint of stability

1634
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:22,600
of prescription. From the standpoint of stability of the prescription, that's right. And then at

1635
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:27,480
some point in your future, and we tell patients this, at some point you're going to start to develop

1636
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:34,200
some cataract formation and hopefully the boxing won't have any effect on that. UV exposure, you

1637
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:40,680
won't have any effect on that. Genetics will be in your favor. But if you're a

1638
02:38:42,280 --> 02:38:47,800
I didn't mention radiation is another, we see people who do fluoroscopy, like health professionals

1639
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:53,480
who are involved and exposed to ionizing radiation. I mean, if you're the tech, if you're the ship

1640
02:38:53,480 --> 02:39:01,880
captain who smokes on a boat that's carrying nuclear waste and you're diabetic, you're going

1641
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:08,600
to get cataracts. A lot sooner. A lot sooner. Yeah. Yeah. So that last thing I want to talk about was

1642
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:15,560
are we ever going to have a day when just as we look at hemoglobin A1C today, which is a pretty

1643
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:23,000
crude, unimpressive way to assess glycosylation. Right. I've ranted on this elsewhere, so I

1644
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:27,320
won't waste your time with my rant on why I think hemoglobin A1C is not especially helpful outside

1645
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:36,760
of extremes. But I don't know why. I just think the eye is the most sensitive end organ to excessive

1646
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:43,480
glycosylated hemoglobin. And it's also one of the few things you can look directly at. Yeah. So

1647
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:48,600
you know, I know when I was in your office, just for giggles, I wanted to have you do like

1648
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:54,280
basically an angio of my eyes, noninvasively. Noninvasively. And I thought that was really cool.

1649
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:59,560
I like knowing that I had beautiful little vasculature back there. Your capillary network

1650
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:05,000
was the envy of everyone in the office. Really, really good. No, but what's so cool.

1651
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:09,320
What stands in, I mean, is there going to be a day when everybody's doing this every year and

1652
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:14,120
when we see changes there, we say, you know what? I don't care what your, your hemoglobin A1C might

1653
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:19,320
only be 5.5. Right. You quote unquote normal. Right. But that might actually reflect higher

1654
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:25,160
turnover of RBCs. And in reality, there's a problem. You know, so one of the really interesting

1655
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:29,160
things about the eyeballs that is a transparent organ as you point out, so you can just sort of

1656
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:34,920
look in and see what the problem is. It's not like, okay, there's belly pain. We need to do

1657
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:40,280
some testing. Yeah. It's like this plane where you have to use more complicated tricks. That's right.

1658
02:40:40,280 --> 02:40:45,480
You can just look in and, and because for example, we have a layer of brain tissue

1659
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:52,360
readily available for us to observe, including its capillary network. So we can look and see,

1660
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:58,760
are these capillaries damaged, which is something you see in diabetics? Are they

1661
02:40:58,760 --> 02:41:05,560
exudating fluid? Are they leaking fluid? And that's a very early sign of diabetic retinopathy.

1662
02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:13,880
Could you, for example, image the lens and determine is glucose leaching into this lens?

1663
02:41:13,880 --> 02:41:19,480
Does it contain more glucose than you would expect a normal individual to have in their lens?

1664
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:27,000
Might that be a screening technique for, for diabetic disease? But I think probably yes.

1665
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:34,840
And what about the fact that diabetes manifests primarily as a microvascular disease in so many

1666
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:40,680
end organs, and you can actually directly visualize this microvascular disease occurring.

1667
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:46,200
So if it's in the eyes, probably in the kidney, it's probably in the toes. And those are things

1668
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:52,920
that we can directly observe. And again, it's not binary, right? So it's not, you know, we,

1669
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:59,240
we make a diagnosis in a very binary fashion when the hemoglobin A1C hits 6.5% person has type 2

1670
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:04,840
diabetes, but you know, at 6%, we just say they're pre-diabetic and at 5.6%, we say they're normal.

1671
02:42:04,840 --> 02:42:09,480
But of course, if you understand everything we're talking about here, that couldn't be further from

1672
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:14,200
the truth. It's not like a person's going to be perfectly pristine, and then they're going to be

1673
02:42:14,200 --> 02:42:21,240
diabetic. This is a spectrum. And I just think that this to me is a much more interesting way

1674
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:26,840
to go about gaining kind of a foothold in our understanding of a person's metabolic health,

1675
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:31,720
is to sort of create this as now a new standard, right? This is something I'm going to create as

1676
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:37,960
a standard for myself, right? Which is, I want to make sure that these, you know, nearly invisible

1677
02:42:38,680 --> 02:42:44,600
arteries and capillaries are perfect. And when they cease to be, it's going to prompt investigation,

1678
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:49,080
right? Whether it be lipids, whether it be glucose, whether it be any other thing that we can,

1679
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:53,800
that, you know, blood pressure, right? I mean, all of the things that can damage a microvascular

1680
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:59,560
system, this becomes a beautiful window in which we can look at them. What is the cost of doing

1681
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:05,000
that test? If a person said, I just want to. Yeah, it's super inexpensive to do, but I honestly

1682
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:13,000
believe that we would see perturbations in the glucose migration into the lens way sooner than

1683
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:21,320
we would see architectural changes in the retinal microvascular. I think that the first. You measure

1684
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:27,800
that via pressure or shape as well. So the technology to measure glucose in the lens doesn't

1685
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:33,240
exist commercially, although it's being studied. You could look at how the lens

1686
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:40,680
essentially reacts to light that you shine into the lens with a particular wavelength and determine

1687
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:46,040
how much glucose there is in that lens. And is that abnormal compared to a normal population?

1688
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:54,440
But looking at the retinal vasculature, we can do that with ocular coherence tomography or optical

1689
02:43:54,440 --> 02:44:01,000
coherence tomography, I should say. And we can image in a noninvasive way the capillary network.

1690
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:04,600
But again, I think that's going to have the changes there would happen after.

1691
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:09,240
But I bet you see a lot of damage there in people who are unaware of their metabolic state.

1692
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:14,200
You do for sure. And it's not the canary in the coal mine. You're saying the canary in the coal

1693
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:19,080
mine is actually going to be the lens distortion due to the osmotic effect of glucose in initial

1694
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:25,080
diagnosis and screening. Yes. But what happens very commonly is that a diabetic will come into

1695
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:32,840
us and say, my sugar is well controlled. My doctor told me I'm under great control. And we look at

1696
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:38,600
their retina and there's no way they're under great control. They have fluid exudating into

1697
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:46,520
their retina. There are what we refer to as hard exudates. There are micro aneurysms in their

1698
02:44:46,520 --> 02:44:51,960
capillary vasculature. These are signs that their diabetes is out of control. And then we'll say,

1699
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:58,040
I'm glad that your A1C was normal. Would you mind going back to your doctor and mentioning that

1700
02:44:58,040 --> 02:45:05,560
we see direct evidence of problems with your microvasculature and it's probably all over.

1701
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:07,880
And how did the endocrinologist receive that news?

1702
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:12,200
Yeah, typically they will accept it. They'll say, okay, well, for this individual,

1703
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:18,040
that level of A1C is not acceptable. Yeah. And they've been typically very receptive because

1704
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:22,520
they know we can directly visualize. I mean, look, this is sort of my soapbox,

1705
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:28,040
but I really think that ophthalmology should be more integrated into medicine than less because

1706
02:45:28,040 --> 02:45:33,400
you guys do in some ways operate sort of outside of what the surgeons and the internists and

1707
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:37,400
endocrinologists do. Obviously, here's an example where you're kind of saying, look,

1708
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:43,160
I'm seeing something and it's important to your systemic health. I think there should be more of

1709
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:47,560
an integration of this. I think, again, you said it earlier and I think people might not have

1710
02:45:47,560 --> 02:45:52,360
appreciated what you just said. You get to directly look at the brain. You get to directly

1711
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:58,920
look at the central nervous system in a way that a gastroenterologist can directly look at the colon.

1712
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:05,880
Right? That's why colon cancer screening is so freaking effective. You get to look with the naked

1713
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:11,480
eye directly at a polyp as it becomes cancerous. That's one of the reasons I didn't become a

1714
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:19,320
gastroenterologist. And we are thankful for them because of all they can save us from. Absolutely.

1715
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:25,080
No doubt. No doubt. But it is amazing that we have the ability to directly observe

1716
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:30,280
brain and the vascular tree. And so that's very, very helpful.

1717
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:35,240
Steven, this has been super interesting to me. I was a little intimidated coming into this one

1718
02:46:35,240 --> 02:46:38,680
because I didn't have the amount of time I normally have to prepare for this and try to get

1719
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:45,080
up to speed on the topic. So I came in blind and ignorant, but you did a masterful job of

1720
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:50,120
accommodating my ignorance and I learned a hell of a lot and I'm sure everybody else did.

1721
02:46:50,120 --> 02:46:52,120
Well, thanks for having me, Peter. Really appreciate it.

1722
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:57,640
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1723
02:46:57,640 --> 02:47:01,800
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring

1724
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:07,000
you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure

1725
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:12,280
members get back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits

1726
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:17,960
include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every

1727
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:23,160
topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show

1728
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:28,840
notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

1729
02:47:28,840 --> 02:47:34,600
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

1730
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:39,960
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release

1731
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:44,360
every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

1732
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:49,640
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

1733
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:55,240
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

1734
02:47:55,240 --> 02:47:59,800
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

1735
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:04,440
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member only benefits,
