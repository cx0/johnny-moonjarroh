00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,200
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,680
So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
this? As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,560
important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,880
selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,560
something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads,

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time, and that is to create

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,480
a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you both simple and

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,720
honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,080
for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,680
simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,200
back more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,920
notes, including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
for each episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,000
of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,440
getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,040
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,320
consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Damon

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,400
Hill. Damon is the 1996 Formula One world champion. And even by the standards of Formula

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,920
One world champions, Damon's career was incredibly interesting and took place during a brief but

48
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:32,520
intense tumultuous period in Formula One. He was Iartan Sena's teammate during the tragic year in

49
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,480
which Sena's life was lost. And he went on to have legendary battles with Michael Schumacher. Now,

50
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,240
you might be thinking, if you're not a Formula One fan or a racing fan, why would you listen to this

51
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,600
episode? Well, I want to address that upfront and say that this is really not an episode about

52
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:55,000
driving. Basically, the driving, the racing, all of that is really a substrate or a vehicle through

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,880
which we discuss the journey of Damon's life, which was given a tragic jolt when he was 15 years old

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,600
and his father, the legendary Graham Hill, two time Formula One world champion, died in a plane crash

55
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,600
that he was flying. And I think it becomes very clear when you read Damon's incredible

56
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,040
autobiography, Watching the Wheels, which I can't recommend highly enough, how much of an impact that

57
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,760
had on Damon, something that to this day, it's clear has still shaped and forged so much of who he is.

58
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,440
He's very open in this biography about his depression. And it was when I read his book

59
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,720
for the first time about a year ago, that I realized I just had to interview Damon. And this

60
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,840
interview did not disappoint. He was incredibly open, incredibly forthright about the struggles

61
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,640
that he has had, the inadequacies that he has felt, and the journey that he's been on to basically

62
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,400
break the cycle that he felt he would have passed on to his kids had he not figured this out. Of

63
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,880
course, we do talk quite a bit about racing and we go into great detail. And I think that in many

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,200
ways, Damon's account of what happened that tragic day on May 1st, 1994, when Iartan Senna died at

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,040
Imola is probably the best account you will ever read. In fact, I make the point to Damon that

66
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,320
it's really his book and his account of it that probably changed my mind about the events of that

67
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,720
day. I could go on much longer about what we discuss in this episode, but I think this is one

68
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,800
of those ones where you just have to sort of take my word for it and listen to it. Again, if you're

69
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,600
not a racing fan, I don't think it matters. This is really not a racing story. It's a human story

70
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,600
that's cloaked in a racing story. And of course, if you have any interest in motorsport, especially

71
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:44,600
F1, I think the nuance and detail of his career will be illuminating. So without further delay,

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:53,240
please enjoy my conversation with Damon Hill. Damon, thank you so much for making time on what

73
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,840
is obviously a very busy weekend for you. It's not as busy. I'm not actually working for Sky,

74
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,560
which is my usual job. So I would have to be normally in quite early, but I'm working for F1

75
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,880
on a promotional basis. So I get a little bit of extra leeway. So awesome. But even so you hit the

76
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,200
ground running when you're in Formula One and just come from a promotional event for thought for

77
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,400
Formula One. And then journalists want to talk to me because there's Lewis is probably going to

78
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,600
stitch up his sixth world title. So they want to know what other world champions think of Lewis's

79
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,400
performance. So you have quite a few other various things you get involved with. Well,

80
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,840
I'm going to resist every urge to go down that path, which I would love to go down and talk about

81
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,520
all the nuances of the current day, the grid versus your errand stuff. But we'll get to that in time.

82
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,920
I honestly just want to start by saying something, which is your book is incredible and I can't

83
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,480
recommend it highly enough to everyone. So your autobiography, Watching Wheels, which came out

84
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,520
three years ago, is kind of one of these books that's sort of about racing, but sort of not.

85
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,480
First of all, thank you very much for saying that about the book. I'm very pleased. I wrote it and

86
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm pleased because it's reached people who have experienced, maybe they've been experiencing

87
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,920
depression in some way or they've had some difficulty in their life. And I just wanted

88
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:23,480
to make it clear that it's never plain sailing. If you achieve success in sport or achieve success

89
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,160
in the world, and a lot of people like to gloss over the difficult bits and I didn't want to make

90
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,840
it sound like it was harder than it was to race, but I couldn't ignore the fact that I'd been

91
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,000
through an experience and part and parcel of my experience as a racing driver was wrapped up with

92
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,920
my emotional life and having to dealt with the fact that my dad was a racing driver and then he

93
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,360
died when I was 15 and then I became a racing driver. And it seemed to me very muddled up.

94
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,800
So I couldn't just sit down and write a book about how I became a world champion, because actually

95
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,880
where does the motivation for that come from? And how do you differentiate that between my

96
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,920
motivation and my dad's motivation and how much of it was to do with wanting to do something for

97
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,280
the family name and how much of it is purely yourself? So how the hell do you untangle this

98
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:21,320
stuff? And I think a lot of people also go through these questions. It's a normal thing to do.

99
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,200
It is really not so much that you're a Formula One world champion. In fact,

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,320
that is a very small chapter of a book, of a long book. It's about a 360 page book. And there is

101
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,280
literally one chapter devoted to the 1996 season. What's amazing to me is the degree of introspection

102
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,520
that comes into this level of examination and the things that you tie back and forth and back and

103
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,280
forth, which hopefully as we get into this discussion, I'll remember some of those things.

104
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,720
It would be hard for people listening to this who don't know much about you to go anywhere to begin

105
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,800
other than to start with November 1975. I'll give a little bit of background just for folks,

106
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,440
but only for the sake of time. But I'd like you to spend as much time as possible explaining

107
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,640
your father's a legend. I remember when I was watching old Formula One videos with my

108
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,360
wife and the first time she saw Graham Hill, she was sort of like, wow, that's like a really good

109
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,160
looking movie star. And I said, yeah, yeah, he looks like a movie star, but you realize like

110
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,680
he's a Formula One driver. In fact, he's the only person to have won the triple crown of motor

111
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,560
racing, which of course prompts the what is that, you know, then I get to explain there's two ways

112
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,120
you could technically win this and he won it both ways. Maybe just tell people a little bit about

113
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,640
who your dad was and why he was so significant to the sport of motor racing. Well, he was, as you

114
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,160
say, in the sport, a legend, achievements wise, but I think also charismatic Lee and also in terms of

115
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,480
being playing up to the role of how the public expected him to be and reveling also in being

116
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,360
that person. I think he got to know himself because curiously, when my mum first met him,

117
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,120
she said he was very quiet and very shy and not the person that we got we got to know.

118
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,440
Eventually as a star of the sport and also someone who was very well known as a great raconteur,

119
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,880
a great after dinner speaker, someone who dressed impeccably, he had all his shirts made in

120
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Savile Row and his ties and he was like not a hair out of place, the mustache, the sight. I mean,

121
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,960
just I'm the mustache, right? The mustache or mustache, various ways of pronouncing it,

122
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,600
depending where you come from, but he would trim it in, you know, to, you know, millimeter perfect.

123
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,640
And that was his trademark because in the early days they didn't have a close face crash helmet,

124
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,760
so you could see the guy's face and there it was, this guy with a, you know, the wacky races,

125
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,600
you got Dick Darsley and you got, you know, all the stereotypes of that type, you know,

126
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,520
you have David Niven was very suave with a pencil mustache and they'll say you got Errol Flynn. And

127
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,000
so he was kind of in this mold, if you like, I don't know whether he was trying to be that person,

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,320
but he certainly, he didn't have to pretend to be anyone else. He had the attributes to be that

129
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,320
person. And I think he loved, he loved being that person. And so he created interest in himself as

130
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,640
a person out off the track. And I think he was a lover of life. He loved meeting people. He loved

131
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,840
communicating and he loved finding out about everything, every aspect of life in every

132
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:46,520
different strata of society. And yeah, he went at it in the 100%. What is your earliest memory of

133
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:53,560
him? So you were born in 61, 60 September 60. He won his first Formula One title in 62,

134
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,000
if I'm not mistaken. There are lots of pictures of you as a kid around. I don't remember that.

135
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,120
Yeah, of course. Like, but the legends of the sport, right? I mean, so that if you go on Google

136
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:11,080
and you go Damon Hill and there's a photograph up there at my christening with Bruce McLaren,

137
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,400
Sterling Moss, my grandfather, Jay Bonnier, Taffy Von Tripp's is there. My dad's there.

138
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,000
Tony Brooks is there. They all came to my christening. So I grew up in that. That was his world.

139
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,360
And when do I remember that? What was the first thing I remember? It's very, very difficult to

140
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,480
pinpoint it. I can't because I would have been taken as a very young child to race events.

141
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,480
And I probably didn't even didn't even know what was going on. I probably heard the noise and

142
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,640
that's about it. But I think it becomes apparent when you go to school, when you go for the first

143
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:51,000
time, you meet kids who have heard of your dad and you haven't in a way, you know, you kind of

144
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,040
who you're talking about. And then you become Yeah, and actually, the teachers are very conscious.

145
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,000
So I think you picked that up that there's something unusual about your dad. And then

146
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,680
you start to look at the world for a different prison. By the way, it was Jim Clark in that photo.

147
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,880
Oh, was it? Yes. Yes. How could we have forgotten Jim Clark? I know that.

148
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,320
Which speaks to another interesting point of your dad's era, which is how many of those guys died

149
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,720
in a car. And I think I've talked about this before on the podcast, probably my favorite

150
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,960
documentary on all of F1 is called one. I think it was came out about five or six years ago. Yeah,

151
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:40,600
I remember that one. It is just such a beautiful depiction of those transitions in that era that

152
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,480
your father lived through the Jackie Stewart lived through that these guys lived through.

153
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,240
It is kind of a miracle that they came out alive. It is statistically, I think they knew that they

154
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,160
had if there were 26 drivers in those days on the grid. Some years it wasn't unusual for them to

155
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,240
lose two. And that's like 12 to one chance of surviving. And then you start stacking that year

156
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:09,000
on year. I mean, when my dad did Indianapolis in 1966, two years before that, two guys were killed

157
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,440
in the race and they carried on racing. It was 1964. It's just terrific. And he just, you know,

158
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,680
so two years later, he's doing the race. I mean, he said he would have known the history of the

159
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,800
race. And he had got that. He wasn't going to be cowed attitude. I think that they had,

160
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,080
I sort of put forward the theory and I don't think it's anything. It's not my personal theory,

161
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,920
but I think it's quite well understood that if you were born during the war era and you grew up

162
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,400
during the war era, my dad would have just missed active service. He'd had to do national service

163
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,200
after their school, but you would have grown up knowing that guy is just a bit older than you.

164
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Would have been flying Spitfires or bombers or going, going fighting the Germans and risking

165
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:56,120
their lives for everything. And you wouldn't, people were not expected to make a big deal of that.

166
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,280
So driving racing car was seen as jolly japes, you know, seen as a, in a lot of fun and you got

167
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,880
paid and you could get killed, but you know, it's better than having to go and get shot at with

168
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,560
a cat guns. It was such a different era. And I was actually for totally unrelated reasons,

169
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,080
talking with my driving coach today about something. And I mentioned that I was going

170
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,760
to be speaking with you today and he said, you know, I wonder what his thoughts are on the

171
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,560
following. So he was telling me about how when he was doing 24 hours of Daytona a few years ago,

172
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,520
during the race prep, one of the organizers said to all the drivers, he said, look guys,

173
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,360
you all are young enough that you don't know what it was like when your probability of dying here

174
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,200
was very high, but I want you to pretend for a moment that it is that dangerous and act

175
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,640
accordingly to the other drivers. And, and what he was really getting at was in the era that your

176
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,320
father raced in, there was a bit more of a gentlemanly approach to racing. Well, I think

177
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,760
it was, you could describe it as that. I think there was a respect for the other competitor

178
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:08,040
because you knew that person was prepared to take the chance of being a racing driver and accept the

179
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,560
risks that ensued, but I didn't mean they liked it at all. It was awful for them. It was, it was

180
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:19,480
dreadful. And I think Jackie Stewart made it very clear in his book that going to a guy's funeral

181
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,120
and seeing the family every other week or whatever twice a year or, you know, guys you race

182
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,160
against, they must've felt slightly responsible themselves. So I think the gentleman thing was,

183
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,440
is more appreciation that they didn't want to be the guy responsible for losing someone else's

184
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,320
life. And I think that is, that was quite strong in their, in their day. It's interesting. You bring

185
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:48,280
up Jackie Stewart, of course, who retired after 99, not 100 grand prix, even though he had one more

186
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,480
in a season and he sat that out after Saver died, his teammate. That's interesting. Cause it'll kind

187
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,360
of come back to your retirement in a way, which was drawing a line in the sand and saying at this

188
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,960
moment, I don't have the desire to do this anymore. Even though you guys were separated by, by decades,

189
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,080
it's still interesting to me. It still was dangerous when I was doing it. Don't forget,

190
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,280
you know, it was not only a few years after Ayrton was killed, but I was still racing. So

191
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I think the risk factor, you are rolling the dice. You know that the more times you do this,

192
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:26,600
the chances of something going wrong increase and the comparison has often been drawn to,

193
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,400
to gamblers. But of course, when you're gambling, you lose money. You don't necessarily get

194
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:42,040
paralyzed or killed or burned to death. I am interested in this issue of humans being able to

195
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,280
put danger to the back of their mind. And we recently watched the amazing El Capitan,

196
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,800
film free solo. I mean, it's uncomfortable to watch in the documentary. Anyone hasn't seen it,

197
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,440
they have to see it. Yeah. It's incredible. Because this, and I forget the guy's name,

198
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,400
terrible, I'm remembering names, but this very interesting character who pulls it off.

199
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,360
He is described and sort of describes himself as a bit of an oddball. They go into his background,

200
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:17,400
his family upbringing and reasons why he might have had a difficult upbringing. And maybe was,

201
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:25,320
was that a reason for him taking these risks in an effort to identify himself or impress his

202
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:33,080
mother or show off in some way or what is it? What was the motivation for doing this incredibly

203
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,200
dangerous thing? But whatever way you cut it, he managed to put fear in the back of his mind.

204
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,800
You could not have done what he did without being able to go, okay, I'm going to put

205
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:51,160
the palpable, tangible fear. We all could identify watching this documentary, this guy clinging to

206
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,880
the side of a rock with nothing to help him. It's just terrifying to watch it, but he managed to do

207
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,000
it without- But sort of you and sort of all the drivers of the year. But let's think about this.

208
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,840
Let's think about Imola in 94 and let's not even think about Imola. Let's think about Monaco,

209
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,400
the next race. I mean, it had been 12 years since Phil Neve died. And then in one weekend,

210
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,840
you see three of the most devastating things. It's only a miracle Ruben didn't die, right?

211
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,760
But Ratzenberger dies, Senna dies in your car. And then Monaco and Wernlinger. Yeah, exactly.

212
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,440
So it's impossible to say that you were getting in a car thinking you're, I mean,

213
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,680
you're immune to that. I mean, this is about as dangerous a time as ever to be an F1.

214
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,480
Yeah, it was, there was a frequently high incidence of accidents that meant the driver got

215
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,480
hurt. So suddenly was raining. I think Nicky Lauda described it perfectly. He said, you know,

216
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,640
that God had had his hand on F1 for all this time and now he just took it off, you know, and that

217
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,560
seemed to be what it was. It was like, okay, brakes are off, guys. You know, you've had a good run and

218
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,520
now we need to rebalance the odds. And it was just happening one weekend after the other,

219
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,800
even in testing as well. And, you know, it had people like Pedro Lami's accident. And

220
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,240
actually before that, even Johnny Herbert was really killed and Martin Donnelly, who was my

221
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,400
teammate in former three, and then he got killed in Hereth. And so, so did you, I mean, when you

222
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,440
were in that car, were you, what were you blocking out of your mind? The possibility that it would

223
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:28,200
be me, I guess, I don't know. You just, you know, it's there, but it makes you concentrate better.

224
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,200
See if something goes wrong with the car, there's nothing you can do about that. But if you

225
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,080
make an error, then you pay the price and that's your fault. So you know, you do

226
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,680
concentrate a lot harder when you know that the risk of injury is great.

227
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,520
Well, before we come back to that, let's go and finish the story again for folks who aren't

228
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:56,840
familiar with, with your father. It all changes November of 1975, November 29th, if I recall the

229
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,160
date. I think the way you describe it in the book is really, really difficult to read truthfully

230
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:10,520
because you don't gloss over the little details of the night. You're watching TV with your sister,

231
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,440
your mom is in the other room and then you hear something on the TV.

232
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah. And I think what it, what it tells me and what I'm hopefully I'm telling

233
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,040
also connecting with other people who've had similar experiences, you know, we don't get

234
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,760
over things like that. It's the worst thing that you can imagine happening. I'd like to think that,

235
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,440
you know, I think a lot of therapy is about people getting over those experiences, but I don't think

236
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:46,840
you can possibly ever unremembered the emotions. What you can do is you can recognize that those

237
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:54,040
emotions had a relevance there and then at that time. And if you've locked them away and haven't

238
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:01,720
revisited them and kind of exercised them, then they come back to you in other situations when

239
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:09,320
you're not conscious of why you're feeling those, those emotions at that time. So they can be

240
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,720
reduced in that way. But if I want to go back to that moment right now, I will get the same

241
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,160
sensations that I had back then. And I don't want to put you through that. I can feel it in reading

242
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,800
the words, let alone hearing you say them. But for folks listening, I mean, you know, your father

243
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,920
was in a plane crash. And one of the things that stood out in reading it was how vividly you

244
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,640
remember your mom screaming. That strikes me as like incredibly palpable. Everything that you just

245
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,160
said a moment ago about the challenge in processing that and all those things, how old were you when

246
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,400
you finally realized that was the case? That those are unresolved issues that can't just be forgotten.

247
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,200
Yeah, I think not until I stopped a couple of years after I stopped racing, I think,

248
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,840
was one of the issues, as I just mentioned before, is your mind, you know, who am I?

249
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,640
Am I different to my dad? Because if I'm different to my dad, I have to live longer than him.

250
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:15,560
And I was 42 and he died when he was 46. So there's anxiety, creeping anxiety that comes

251
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,360
with this, you know, you're following a pattern. And you don't want to follow a pattern because

252
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,920
it's a bad pattern to get into. So you have to differentiate that. You have to change course

253
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,520
somewhere. That was one of the big pressures for me as a driver was I had a family. I didn't want

254
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,320
to put them through what our family had gone through. You talk about that on a couple of occasions in

255
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,800
the book, which was, and I don't know if it was deliberate, but you keep making the point.

256
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,880
You weren't afraid of dying for the sake of your life, but you were very afraid of it for what they

257
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,000
would go through because obviously you'd experienced it.

258
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,680
Yeah, I think I would. I mean, if it would be at all possible to be angry with oneself if one

259
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:02,360
had died. You don't want to be. Yeah, you don't want to do that. But at the same time,

260
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,920
in humans, in all kinds of situations, whether they're in the military or they are in the

261
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:15,560
emergency services or they do some other job that we as adults put ourselves in the firing

262
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,040
line somewhere at some point and our children that maybe are too young to appreciate that,

263
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:29,000
but when they become older, they will also see that. We can't go through life in cotton wool.

264
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:37,240
We have things we have to do as humans to fulfill ourselves. I would hope that by taking chances,

265
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,560
I mean, when I say taking chances, I mean calculated chances that have a benefit somewhere,

266
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,880
somehow, that my children would also not be afraid of doing those things.

267
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,720
So speaking of fear, I can't imagine what it's like for your mom to lose her husband when she

268
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,360
has three young kids, teenagers. I guess, yeah, your sisters would have been teenagers as well

269
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:05,240
at the time, right? Yeah, my eldest sister was 16, but my younger sister was only about 11.

270
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,320
And you're already at this point into motorcycles.

271
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, for fun, riding in the fields and in the woods on small motorbikes and off-road bikes.

272
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,080
I hadn't got a road license then. It's kind of amazing to me that you didn't have a

273
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:29,080
karting background. You were by your own admission very late to auto racing that you could be as

274
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,480
successful as you've gone on to be. I think just to sort of move the story along a little bit,

275
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,200
let's go to when you decide you want to be an auto racer.

276
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,000
Well, I wanted to race bikes from quite a young age. I was impressed by a friend of mine,

277
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,920
when my dad died, a friend of my dad's who was a Peter Gethen, actually, he actually raced for

278
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,480
my dad, but he was a Formula One driver. And he took me and a friend of mine down to Brands Hatch,

279
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,720
not long after my dad had died, just because he knew I liked motorcycle races. And why don't

280
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,240
you come and have a look at these bikes going around Brands Hatch. I'd never seen anything

281
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,040
like it in my life. And I'd been to so many Formula One races, literally sitting there yawning,

282
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:21,320
as, you know, Jim, Jackie Stewart goes and wins another race. He used to go past you,

283
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,720
he used to go and spend our summer holidays, we'd go to Monza and we'd be parked up in some

284
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,000
grandstand somewhere. My dad went and raced and we'd literally sit there and Jackie Stewart would

285
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,160
go past. And then about half a minute later, everyone else would go past and it would go on

286
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,120
for two hours. And you were going, you know, it wasn't, didn't do it for me.

287
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:49,080
Is that because the driver isn't using his body in a car the way he's using his body on a motorcycle?

288
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,920
I really, I think that's a big part of it. I think I, as I mentioned before, I kind of like sports

289
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,880
where I, you're the projectile. I'm the projectile, but I'm also the acrobat, you know, and I think

290
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,280
that it's very difficult to see that in car racing. And I think that's one of our big problems with,

291
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,320
with why, you know, with people appreciating that current crop of Formula One drivers,

292
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,720
they might appreciate it when they're watching the race in the wet and, you know, sometimes you can

293
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,880
see the speed and sometimes you can see their reactions, but not nearly as clearly as you can

294
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,440
when you watch a ski or you watch a surfer or you watch a guy on a MotoGP bike. It's abundantly

295
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,040
clear that they are controlling the vehicle. And I think that happened to me. So I went to bike race

296
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,880
and I saw these bikes go past and I just couldn't believe there was a guy sitting on the bike,

297
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,760
doing that sort of speed into, and having ridden a bike myself, I just thought, Oh, me do that.

298
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,480
You know, it was one of those dumb moments. You just, you can't think straight, but you just,

299
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,320
you just like the smell of the bikes. You like the noise of the engines. You like the whole thing.

300
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,800
So that was my ambition to go bike racing. And my mum.

301
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,960
What was, I was just about to say, what was your mum's reaction?

302
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,840
Well, can you imagine? I mean, to me, it seemed like a long time ago,

303
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,840
but actually it was only three years or four years ago since my dad died,

304
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,640
which is nothing in terms of those things. So I go, mum, do you mind if I, you know, race bikes?

305
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,280
And to her eternal credit and bless her, you know, she recognized the situation, which was that

306
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,240
my dad had raced. How could she deny me her own son, the opportunity of doing something that,

307
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:29,400
and she had admired my dad for his bravery and skill as a racing driver as well. So here was her,

308
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,560
a son, only a few years after the tragedy coming and saying, do you mind if I ever go out racing

309
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,680
bikes? And she said, I don't mind. I think she took a deep breath, but she said, I don't mind

310
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,200
you doing it, but as long as you do it properly, I don't know what that means. What's it mean? Go

311
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,440
fuck as fast as you can. I would just interpret it as don't get hurt, but yeah, I think that's,

312
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,480
but she knew there was no way you can stop guys and girls from doing these things. So she let me

313
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,360
do it. And I mean, she never said, no, you're not doing it, which is not the case with some drivers.

314
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,560
And Jackie Stewart being one, his mother never spoke to him because he raced behind her back.

315
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,840
She, she told him you're not to go racing. And he did. And then when he retired, he phoned her and

316
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,920
said, I'm retired. And she said, you're best off out of it. That was the end of that. She didn't

317
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,400
actually ever say a well done and winning three world championships. As far as I know, she just

318
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:27,720
was a bit still cross within for. Wow. So how did you make the transition from racing motorcycles

319
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,280
to racing cars? And given the fact that you didn't have this long lineage of karting that most of

320
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,640
your peers had, do you still think there's something about the motorcycle that gave you

321
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,120
an advantage that they were missing? No, I would have been much better if I'd done karting. I mean,

322
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,120
that would be the right route to take. I had to unlearn stuff and then had to, I think particularly

323
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,160
you learn stuff in karting about racing, which I had not learned before we were racing and the

324
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,840
tactics they employ. And I'm thinking clearly that someone like Michael Schumacher and people

325
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,840
like Johnny Herbert, they were used to these guys putting their car inside the inside and, you know,

326
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,840
chopping you up and all that stuff. In bike racing, you don't, they don't do that. They do it a bit

327
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,360
more now, but in my day, they didn't do that sort of thing because you'd go down, both go down, you

328
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,600
know. So it wasn't quite the same rg, barg in bike racing. It was more of a clean pass each time.

329
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,400
But so why did you decide to make that transition? Well, I enjoyed bike racing. I'd done okay,

330
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,840
but I'd had a bit of a, I didn't really pick it up properly. And then I, then I had to go back

331
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,440
to the beginning and start racing club racing. And I thought, well, I still love doing it. So

332
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,320
I was basically failing. I'd bitten off more than I could chew and I wasn't making any progress. So

333
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,240
I had to decide whether I stopped or whether I carried on. And I thought, well, I'm going to

334
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,360
do it because I enjoy it. So I literally bought a bike, ran it myself on my own budget and went to

335
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,600
Brown's hatch and I started winning things. And about the same time that this is happening.

336
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,440
So this is about 1980 or early?

337
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,400
1984.

338
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,760
I started winning these bike races and then somebody at about the same time had said,

339
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,680
cause they knew I'd race bikes. And I don't think my mum, my mum must have said, well,

340
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,200
he's not doing very well and it's not, it's not really happening. And they said, well,

341
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,080
you should get him to have a go in a car. So she says to me one day, a friend of mine

342
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,240
said, you can have a go at his car. He runs a race school in France. It's called the Winfield school.

343
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:30,280
And his name was Mike Knight and he'd offered you a go. And I said, well, I'm not, I haven't

344
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,080
got the money to do it. And I'm not spending any money I spend on my bikes to do this. She said,

345
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,080
don't worry, they'll let you have a go for nothing. So I thought, well, if someone's going

346
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,920
to let me drive their car for nothing, and I'm going to go for a weekend in France for

347
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,800
just for a bit of love, then I'll do it. So I turned up absolutely no real interest or plan to

348
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,200
do it. I just did it for the crack as you already say. And I did quite well.

349
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,080
What kind of car?

350
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,360
It was a Formula Renault.

351
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,160
2000?

352
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,520
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. And school car. It's the same school that Prost and

353
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,680
Tambay and all the French drivers Lafitte had been to. And one of the things they had,

354
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,240
which was also attractive to me, was fully paid. If you did well, if you won the school scholarship,

355
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,360
you get sponsored to compete in France in a championship and they'd pay for it. Renault

356
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,520
Elf would pay for it. And I was absolutely rubbish. I'm not a commercial person. I was

357
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,080
absolutely hopeless at getting sponsorship. So I was always short of cash. And so I...

358
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,880
Although I want to talk about Sega later on, 10 years later.

359
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

360
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,400
We'll come back later.

362
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,120
We'll get there.

363
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,920
So I literally was a pragmatic decision. I just thought, well,

364
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,960
this doesn't seem to be going anywhere. The car racing, the bike racing thing is struggling.

365
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,760
But just at that time, I started winning everything on bikes. I started to... I found a knack.

366
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:53,400
And just recently, a friend of mine gave me some DVD that someone had put together of some sad

367
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,160
person that stood by the side of the track at Brands Hatch and videotaped everything.

368
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,600
In those days, it was a video camera. And they put together a DVD and I was watching myself

369
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,080
before I came out here, actually, of my bike racing. I'd never even seen it before.

370
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,600
And I looked quite good on a bike and I won everything. I literally won everything I did

371
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:18,360
that season. But it happened just at the time that the car racing thing was starting to take off.

372
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,680
So I had to make a decision at the end. Okay, am I going to really seriously be able to do

373
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,240
this as a career for bike racing? What am I going to...

374
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,360
What were the economics of motorcycle racing at that time?

375
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,560
I could do a season for a cup of grand on my bike.

376
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,880
What could you make? Could you support yourself?

377
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,240
No, it wouldn't win anything. I mean, if I went to national level, you could...

378
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,080
I think some of the races, they had 10,000 pounds prize money or something. But

379
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,440
it was that or grand pre-racing. And the only real guy who made any money was Barry Sheen.

380
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,760
There was just very few people really earning a living. If you wanted to go and do the Isle

381
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,360
of Man and risk your life and you could earn a bit more money, but it seemed to be a poor equation.

382
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,920
I'm just going to pause for a moment for the listener. In the show notes, we are absolutely,

383
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,880
at this moment, going to link to the Isle of Man TT. If you have any interest in understanding

384
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,880
what we're talking about, you must watch this or you can just go to YouTube and search Isle of Man

385
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,760
TT as in time trial. And you're going to watch something that you will think is being played in

386
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,560
fast forward. It is not. And Damon, I still don't know who has it more dangerous there,

387
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,080
the spectator or the guy on the motorcycle. It is the craziest thing I've ever seen,

388
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,880
yet I can't stop watching it. Yeah. I think a lot of people feel that about it. I think they feel

389
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,480
they have mixed emotions. I've been there to watch. I haven't been to the main event,

390
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,680
but I've been to the classic TV TT and they have guys going just as fast. And you have mixed

391
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,000
emotions about it. You're watching these people. Oh no, please don't do that. You know, because

392
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,960
it looks so dangerous, but it also is awesomely impressive. And I've been around the Isle of Man

393
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,560
on a bike myself and I've gone, Oh, this is, this is kind of, there's a kind of spooky thing

394
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,880
during you on to go faster. It's very seductive racetrack. Was there any point in here, Damon,

395
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,280
is your wrestling with this to be the motorcycle guy, to be the car guy? Was anything the back of

396
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,840
your mind coming through the lens of your father and wanting to either emulate him or go in an

397
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,320
orthogonal direction to him? Was that at all part of your conscious mind at least?

398
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,960
I think there's something fundamentally genetically, there must be something in the

399
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,880
genes to make you want to do this thing, which he must have had because he talks about the first

400
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,720
time he ever drove a racing car and he knew immediately, he calls it a light bulb moment.

401
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,600
You know, it was just, he knew immediately he wanted to do that. And that was the first time

402
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,440
I got on a motorbike. I turned the twist grip and it was like a part of my brain just lit up.

403
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:53,240
And my grandma rode a motorbike. My granddad never even drove a car. So my dad's dad never

404
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:00,760
even drove a car. So where did he get it from? Well, he must've got it from his mom. And they now

405
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,720
with epigenetics and so forth, they can kind of show that patterns of experiences seem to be

406
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,120
passed through the genes. So it's quite possible that something came through that side. But for

407
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:20,520
whatever reason, I had instinctively got what it took clearly to drive a car or race a bike,

408
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,360
but the motivation to do it, I think was also to get to know my dad in the way, in the sense,

409
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:32,040
I was doing something that he did. And then you have somewhere relating to him, even though he

410
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,520
wasn't there, but was he ever not there? Is he still here now? I mean, we started off talking

411
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:45,480
about my dad, you know, you were evoking his image, you're evoking his character. He's not even when I

412
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,880
just went like that, just then that sounded like my dad. That was really, you know, it's a, it's a very

413
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:58,840
hard thing to differentiate yourself from your parents. And I don't necessarily believe it's

414
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,600
possible to be a completely an individual. I think consciously you can say, okay, this is what I want

415
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,520
to do. I'm doing something different to the motorway. My parents, I know they would disapprove of that,

416
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,520
or that's not their thing, but I like it. So that's a differentiation. That's a, that's a

417
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,800
genuine thing, but they're still there, aren't they? Influencing somehow, somewhere.

418
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,400
It's interesting that you say that. I still think this idea that driving to get to know him is kind

419
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,120
of a, it's one thing to reflect on that. I just wonder if at the time you could have even

420
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,800
consciously articulated that, or if that's just part of this incredible journey of introspection

421
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,240
that you've been on through your career, but especially afterwards.

422
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,880
Yeah, there were some parallels that have been drawn. I think I might have drawn them in the book,

423
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,040
which is that when my dad was racing, he lost his teammate, Jim Clark, and then he went on to

424
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:58,280
become world champion in 68. And so in some senses, you know, my experience with being teammates to

425
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,000
Ayrton, and then you lose your teammate, and then the team is kind of looking for a new direction,

426
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,360
and you kind of carry the banner. You, you pick up the banner and try and try to get back to what

427
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,960
we were there to do in the first place, which was win. I feel like I've been through similar

428
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,840
experiences, but my dad was, you know, had extraordinary ability to cope with tragedy.

429
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:27,240
He actually organized the race team when they were at Hockenheim with Jim Clark when he died,

430
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,520
and the guys didn't really know what to do, and he got it all together and helped them. And I

431
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,160
heard recently, Emerson Fittipaldi talking about how he had an accident once, and my dad was there

432
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,520
with Joe Ramirez organizing his extraction from the car. And you know, my dad was a very practical

433
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,600
and, you know, in that way courageous person. I'm exposed in some ways, I'm glad I didn't have to go

434
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,720
through some of the things he went through. But to be an adult, you ultimately have to be able to

435
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,880
cope with the experiences that adults deal with, you know, that's, that's not always the nice stuff.

436
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,960
So how do you manage to get into the Williams car? I know you've, I've heard the story before,

437
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,600
it's pretty funny how I think Martin Brundle was probably ahead of you in line to at least get the

438
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,640
test spot, right? Yeah. And then did he go and take the spot at McLaren or what? There's two drivers,

439
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,360
very similar names, Mark Blundell, who was the test driver. Oh, Blundell, that's right. And there's

440
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,600
Martin Brundle who was currently, who was actually actively racing, but Mark was the test driver at

441
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,800
Williams. Then he went to McLaren. So there was a slot available at Williams. And so I went to

442
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,760
Williams. And this is 92? 91 actually. So end of 90, I went became the Williams test driver in 91.

443
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,400
92, I was still a test driver. Mark had moved on to McLaren and eventually became a McLaren driver.

444
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:54,120
But when the end of 92 arrived and Nigel had left. That's right. So Nigel won in 92 and then

445
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:00,440
promptly retired to go to IndyCar. But yeah, but not until very late in the day. So Frank had let

446
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,240
Ricardo Betray's ego because he thought that he'd keep Nigel and he'd already signed Adam Prost. And

447
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:11,880
when Nigel found out that he signed Adam Prost, he said, I think he decided he was going to do

448
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,480
IndyCar. Was the implication that Nigel would be number two to Prost being one? I don't think he'd

449
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,480
already been with Alain in Ferrari. And I think he didn't want to be sharing a team with Alain.

450
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,360
So it may have been that he'd had an attractive deal from India. I don't know. But then whichever

451
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,320
way it happened, there was a space left at Williams that Frank had really kind of not managed to fill

452
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,720
because everyone else had been signed up. So Ricardo wanted to come back from Benetton,

453
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:44,840
but they wouldn't let him go. And so I was the guy there who knew how to drive. So this is for the 93

454
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:50,840
season. For the 93 season. And you had spent much of the 92 season basically learning the ropes on

455
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,720
this active suspension car. Let's pause for a moment for people who aren't steeped in formula

456
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:03,160
one to explain what a technical step forward the active suspension car of 93 was. Some people

457
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,920
describe that car, the FW15 as the most advanced car in the history of formula one for its time.

458
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,640
Being the center fan that I am, I still favor the MP4 for as the greatest car of all formula one.

459
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,480
But the case could be made for the FW15. What does active suspension mean? How would you explain

460
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:29,080
that to somebody? Okay. So it's a ride height control. So why is ride height important? So

461
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,760
it's the distance the car is held off the ground. Lower center gravity is a good thing. If you're

462
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,720
very high off the ground, then you get a lot of roll moments on the suspension, which the drivers

463
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,440
don't like. They can't change direction that quickly. But the main reason is aerodynamic.

464
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,680
So they found just after they banned tunnels and ground effect cars, they went to flat bottom

465
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,280
cars, which they thought would eradicate the dangers of having too much downforce on the car.

466
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,760
But what the engineers did eventually was sure enough, they found a way of making the flat

467
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:08,280
bottom of the car work to create more. Suck into re-effect. Suck onto the ground. And the closer you

468
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,760
can get it, and the more you can control the gap, the more effective it is. So active suspension is

469
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,640
a clear advantage over passive suspension for the very simple reason that when a car is loaded,

470
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,120
it squashes the springs and it gets close to the ground. So it means a lot of the time, the car is

471
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,320
not at the optimum ride height. It has to, it rides back up again on the springs when the car slows

472
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:37,560
down. So you get this variance in ride height. If you can keep the car at the optimum, fast or slow,

473
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,480
then you've got a huge advantage. That's what active suspension was there to do.

474
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,640
But it has a lot of other interesting side effects in that you can then,

475
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,560
you can change the attitude of the car all the time. So you could even stall the diffuser on

476
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:57,160
the straight. So you could lower the back above certain speeds. I just love it. I love hearing

477
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,920
you talk about this. So you could play with it a lot. We tried all sorts of things like making it

478
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,880
roll into a corner so it would have stagger on it, and which they use in Indy cars. So if the

479
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,320
corner goes right, you'd make the left side of the car pop up a bit and the car would lean into

480
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:15,080
the corner like a motorbike. Yeah. It's just unbelievable. So do you remember in 92 when you

481
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:20,040
were testing these features out in anticipation of the 93 season, not actually knowing that you

482
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,160
would be the driver? Yeah, I didn't know I'd be the driver. I knew that Nigel was making it a good

483
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,600
job of making it work. And I knew that if I was in that car, I would also be up the sharp end of

484
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,840
Grand Prix racing. But it was never more than a pipe dream. I honestly thought I was 32 by then.

485
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,200
Let's reflect on that for a moment. Today, a 32-year-old rookie, it's an impossible concept.

486
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,520
They wouldn't get you in. You wouldn't get in the car. I just don't think any team would put

487
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,600
someone that age in the car. I think a lot of people look at it from the point of view of what's

488
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,680
his long-term future like. They're even looking at drivers now who are, I think it's the youngest

489
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,040
average age of a grid and then he's here at Formula One at the moment. But they're looking

490
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,800
at drivers who are 28 and thinking they're old now. I mean, Sebastian is 32. It's hard to imagine

491
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:16,360
Sebastian as a rookie now. I mean, he is 12 years into his Formula One career at the age,

492
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,160
and four times a world champion at the time that you were entering your rookie season.

493
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,600
And to your point earlier, not coming from a karting background. So you could say,

494
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,400
I shouldn't have been there, Pete. Honestly, I was down and out. When I was 29, we'd had Ollie,

495
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,600
we were talking about my first child and he got down syndrome and I'd lost my drive in Formula

496
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:44,680
Three. And I had to literally, I just bought a house. We had a mortgage. Interest rates had gone

497
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:52,200
up to 17%. Can you imagine that? I mean, if you're in the field, imagine Wall Street now, 17%

498
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,000
interest on a mortgage. And I just had my first child and it turns out it's got down syndrome. So

499
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,400
Georgie and I are just working out, well, what's that mean for the rest of our life? What are we,

500
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:08,040
what's the response? And I still wanted to race cars. I mean, I was mad. What madness was this

501
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:14,520
that made me press on? Because it turned out okay in the end. There's a line here, which it's a

502
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:20,760
quote I'm sure I'm bastardizing. And it's basically like chance favors the prepared mind. The context

503
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,320
of the quote, and I can't even remember if it was Einstein or Louis Pasteur, but there was a

504
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,680
scientist who made this point. And the idea was you look at scientific breakthroughs and you think

505
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:37,160
it's an inspiration or a flash of genius. And the point is no, it's not. It's a lot of hard work.

506
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,880
It's toiling, it's failing, it's doing the experiment over and over again. It's failing,

507
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,280
it's failing, it's failing. And if you pay enough attention, you're going to see the right thing.

508
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,080
Great scientists always talk about this idea that what separates the good ones from the great

509
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,920
ones is the great ones are able to see the right thing at the right time. They're able to extract

510
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,000
from the data that which others don't see, but that requires being there, that requires being

511
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,360
in the trenches. And in many ways, I think that that's what that 92 year was. You put your head

512
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,440
down, you were in the trenches, you showed up every day, you test drove that car. You basically

513
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,400
helped Patrick and Adrian make what would, like I said, probably be the greatest technologically

514
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,720
most advanced F1 car ever. And you sort of did it without an agenda of, well, I'm doing this

515
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,480
because it's going to get me here. I mean, that's sort of my reading of it as a distance, which was

516
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,760
it was just being in the moment and putting your head down and doing this amazing job.

517
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,880
And so when the situation arose with Nigel going to IndyCar, I mean, I think Williams was

518
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,160
incredibly lucky that you were there. Well, I'd like to think they felt that, you know,

519
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,560
I think I did do a lot of hard work, but I didn't design the car. I worked with the engineers,

520
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,240
I worked with Paddy Lowe, who was a computer guy who worked on the suspension. And we did

521
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,600
play with lots of stuff that we eventually used. And I helped kind of shape a little bit

522
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,080
of traction control and stuff like that. But they have to get feedback from a driver. That's

523
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,640
the point, right? Yeah, but that's the point. Actually, it was starting to get to the point

524
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,800
where they don't need as much feedback as they used to, because they can see it on the computer.

525
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,360
So they actually were going, okay, we know what the gear change is doing. We're in control of that.

526
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,240
We know we can give you a throttle that can do this. And if you've got a potentiometer on the

527
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:35,000
throttle instead of a cable, we can make it do this. And we can see, they can see all the things.

528
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:43,000
What they can't do is put their bum in the seat and go, that's a scary feeling. It's not scary

529
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,520
feeling. The driver can't override the negative things that we're giving to him. The driver still

530
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:57,880
played a part in that sense. But what I did do was, I think I was a known quantity. And I think

531
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,240
I worked well with the guys, with the engineers. And they had Alan Prost. So it's not like they

532
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,960
didn't have anyone. They had someone in the bank. But they took a huge risk putting a guy who's never

533
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,800
done a couple of races with Brabham, but they had never run at the front in Formula 1. And then they

534
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:17,400
clearly thought, well, he doesn't have to run at the front. Alan Prost still just needs to back him up.

535
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,400
Were you intimidated by Prost? And he strikes me as sort of a pleasant guy.

536
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,760
No, he would never, not to any of my knowledge, I've ever felt like Alan would do anything under

537
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:36,280
hand. I think he was a very decent chap. And I think he was clearly very fast and I could learn

538
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,400
a lot from him. And I thought if I could beat him, then it's very much to my credit. And sometimes

539
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,800
What did you learn from him technically in terms of technical driving ability? And what did you

540
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:55,000
learn from him at the meta level in terms of philosophy? He is a very quiet guy. And

541
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,400
it was quite interesting. The things that I remember were him speaking to his wife on the phone

542
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,760
before a race. And he'd make a little phone call. And he's clearly a very affectionate person. And he

543
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:16,040
was quite happy for me to see that he didn't do that in private. And when I spoke to him about the

544
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:21,640
car or something like that, I mean, I never, I would never have gone up to him and gone,

545
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,000
Alan, how do you do this? Or how do you do that? You learn by watching the results of what he's

546
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,880
been doing. I speak to the engineers that running his car and they say the amazing thing about Alan

547
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,640
Prost is, you know, he doesn't use any brakes, you know, he's very, very light on the brakes,

548
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,200
but he's incredibly quick. Right. Very light on the brakes and very little hand movement, right?

549
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:46,120
Yeah. Was never fighting the car. No, he minimum, minimal movements. So obviously micro movements

550
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:54,360
that he's very clearly ahead of the car and able to anticipate it. And what he didn't do was throw

551
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,640
loads of things at the car. He just fine tuned it and he fine tuned himself. I think he knew he was

552
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,960
quick and I think he knew how to make a car go quick. And he knew how to race. And when you look

553
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,960
at some of those very early races, the Kyle army race with him and Senna, Senna was brutal with him.

554
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:17,320
And, you know, Alan was just, it equally tough back in that active car. He wasn't intimidated

555
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,680
either. He was a hell of a fighter, but he'd never show you that. He wouldn't out of the car. You'd

556
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,200
never know that the guy was such a formidable competitor. What do you remember about Donington

557
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:35,960
in 93? Well, what do I remember of that? I remember my brain was fried because I was

558
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,520
seeing why every time I put a set of tires on does it do the opposite of what I wanted to do.

559
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,200
And at the same time, Senna would just stick on his tires for a bit longer. And

560
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:50,040
God, that was just so embarrassing. We lost count completely of how many pit stops we'd done. I mean,

561
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,360
I have no idea what was going on. It was, and half the way through the race, you just go,

562
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:00,680
this has gone so horribly wrong. It's a farce, but you suddenly find out your second, you're

563
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:07,320
running second and you go, how the hell did I get there? I stopped six times, you know? So for a

564
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,640
guy in his first full season with the top team, it was a bit of an eye opener, but I look back

565
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,440
at that race and I just think, why did I let Ayrton through so easily? Yeah. Because on the first lap,

566
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,040
again, it's of the stuff of legends, right? How he drove in the rain and that he could pass you

567
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:28,120
and post on that first lap in an inferior car. He had a lot more experience than me. Yeah.

568
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,080
And truthfully, I just think there was nobody on the grid that was as comfortable in the rain as

569
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,000
although he was clear to say he didn't like the rain. You know, I remember in an interview once

570
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,640
where someone made this point, which is, you know, Ayrton, you're so great in the rain. And he's like,

571
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,440
I don't like this. I just practiced in it, you know? But there's a funny picture of the three

572
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,880
of you on the podium, the two of you guys in your blue fire suit, sort of like couldn't believe

573
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,240
it was particularly hard for Alain, I think, because it was a humiliating experience. You know,

574
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,840
he, I think, oh, got it. It all went horribly wrong for Alain in that race. And I remember that

575
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:10,280
the press conference as well, Ayrton kind of, he sort of made the point. He was just brutal. Yeah.

576
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,200
And it was, it was a tough one for Alain because, yeah, Ayrton could be very, very harsh and

577
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:23,800
humiliated Alain after that race. I was not one of our finest weekends as a team or for Alain,

578
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:29,240
but it was a great, they talk about it as Ayrton's greatest race. You were third that season, correct?

579
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,080
I was third that season. I was second to Alain, I think. You were second. Okay. Yeah. Which is

580
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,680
amazing. Do you know what? You better check that because I don't know. I honestly don't, I don't know.

581
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,840
But where did I finish? No, third. I think maybe I was third. You're right. Yeah, I think. Yeah.

582
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,120
You were third. Yeah. So at the end of the 93 season, was there any doubt that

583
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,200
Prost was going to retire? Was there a chance he was going to stick around until 94 or was he very

584
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,440
clear that it was one and done? I'm sure it was clear that with Frank that he knew he was only

585
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,400
there for one year to get one more world championship. Okay. So he's one and done. And then all of a

586
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:09,400
sudden, Senna gets what he's wanted for several years now, which is he has wanted to come to

587
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Williams certainly in 92 and 93. Of course, people know the backstory. Prost had an anti-Senna clause.

588
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,040
You don't get to have us both. But there's interviews where Williams talks about how

589
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:28,600
he wanted Senna in the 80s. He wanted Senna in 84, 85. Yeah, but he, you know, Frank, he gave him his

590
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,520
first formal contest. I don't know why he didn't sign in then. Yeah. I feel like I need to go back

591
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,760
and sort of watch some of those old interviews because Senna's first team was horrible.

592
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,600
And then he spent three years with Lotus before he went to McLaren. So you must have been pretty

593
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,000
excited, right? I mean, you're thinking to yourself, my first season in Formula One,

594
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm third overall. I've just been partnered with one world champion and now I get another.

595
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,360
Yeah. And before that was Nigel as well. That's right. So you've had three.

596
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,760
Yeah, completely. I was completely spoiled from that point of view. I mean, I had a chance to see

597
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,160
close up how these guys worked, which is something money can't buy. I mean, it was,

598
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,000
it's great for me. I really liked the idea of having.

599
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,760
So where were you in, so going into the 94 season, is Josh your second or third?

600
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,120
Second child.

601
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,040
Second child. Was Josh born yet?

602
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,320
Josh was born in 92. Yeah, 91.

603
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,520
Okay. So Oliver, Josh, but Tabitha, not yet.

604
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:26,920
Not yet.

605
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,120
Okay. So you have two little boys. The interest rate, I hopefully, has been refinanced at this

606
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,880
point, the 17%.

607
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,800
I think when I got the test drive, I was able to cope with the interest a little bit.

608
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,480
And then I got signed up and I was actually a full-time driver in 93. I think I was,

609
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,200
I didn't have to sweat quite so much, but it wasn't.

610
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,320
So when the active gets undone for 94, when you're in preseason testing for 94,

611
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:59,720
you are probably the only person in the world that can appreciate the difference between the

612
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,600
FW 15 and the 16. What are your first thoughts on that transition?

613
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,720
I thought it's going to be different, but it was very, I found the car quite hard to drive,

614
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,120
get a time out of and be consistent.

615
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,600
What was the clearance on that car, the ground clearance?

616
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:15,960
Wait.

617
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,240
I mean, incredibly low.

618
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,120
On the active car, it was not as low as the, sorry, on the passive car, it wasn't as low

619
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,760
as the active car. It's much higher. They had to make it quite high up.

620
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,840
But they were generating a lot of downforce and I think they had,

621
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:39,320
I think it could have been more difficult for them to get used again to controlling the

622
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,040
downforce without the active. So it's a little bit of relearning stuff they'd forgotten, I think.

623
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:49,080
Now, were you at all worried? Did you feel that the car in any way was unsafe as you embarked on

624
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,440
the first race that year?

625
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,880
No, I never felt it was unsafe. I thought it was hard to drive.

626
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,600
But I thought that's just because I'm Damon Hill and that's Ayrton Senna. So I couldn't quite match

627
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:06,600
his lap times. I just thought this is, for me, it was a new comparison and a new benchmark.

628
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:15,400
So I drove that car knowing that there was, we had work to do on setup because it wasn't quite as

629
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,000
good as it wasn't in the optimal range that you wanted it to be in. And so I think everyone at

630
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,040
Williams and Ayrton were trying to work out how he got there. But then we were also distracted by,

631
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:31,480
I think a little bit by the performance of the Benetton, which had suddenly come up on the rails

632
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,600
and was winning races.

633
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,440
So it was the first race that year, was it Australia?

634
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,200
Brazil.

635
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:38,600
What's that?

636
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,720
Brazil was second, I thought.

637
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,200
Second.

638
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:47,240
Well, they had this race in Ayrton, didn't we? Which was in Japan as well.

639
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,480
You're right. It was Brazil. Asia was second.

640
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,840
Yeah, yeah, okay.

641
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,560
So Senna's on pole, loses control of the car, doesn't finish.

642
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,040
Yeah.

643
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,440
Second race, Senna's on pole, loses control of the car, doesn't finish.

644
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,960
Well, he got knocked off, didn't he?

645
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,600
Oh, that's right.

646
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,640
Yeah. And then, so he's had nonfinishes.

647
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,480
He's had two nonfinishes. You're second.

648
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,720
I'm second, but a long way behind Michael.

649
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,000
And Michael's won both.

650
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,400
Yep.

651
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,680
So you're heading into Imola and you're on your heels. The team is on its heels.

652
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:22,920
Yeah. A lot of disquiet. I think Ayrton was having doubts about, he was quite surprised

653
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,960
at the way the team worked and the performance of the car. He was a bit baffled by that. And then,

654
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,480
there was, he was worried that maybe Benetton were doing something with their traction control,

655
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,880
they shouldn't have been doing and stuff. So there was, it was definitely off-balance

656
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,840
situation, but I was not the lead man in that situation.

657
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:50,040
Did you share Senna's belief, because he had talked about how after he got knocked out of

658
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:56,760
the Pacific Grand Prix, he was listening to, he could hear Schumacher going by and he could,

659
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,000
he claimed he could hear the traction control.

660
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,240
Yeah.

661
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,120
Did you share that view that there was something in that car,

662
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,800
either software or hardware wise?

663
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:10,280
I never heard that myself. And I, all I had to go on was that Ayrton believed that there was

664
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,720
something fishy going on, but it was not something that I could control and not something I had in

665
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:22,680
the influence over. So I pretty much stuck to, got back to work and on the car we had,

666
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:28,760
which was in testing, you do what you could to try and get a balance on it and feel comfortable

667
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,880
with it, confident.

668
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:37,560
In the same way that you probably remember exquisite detail about the circumstances and

669
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:44,120
the days around your father's tragedy, do you have that same sort of recollection of Imola?

670
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:52,920
Aspects of it, yeah. But I think it was different because I was also racing myself and I was,

671
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,600
You had to focus on what you had to do.

672
00:59:54,600 --> 01:00:01,800
Yeah. I think you don't feel shocked. When you're racing, I think you have the protective wall

673
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:07,320
around you a little bit. I think you managed to remove yourself from over feeling things.

674
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,440
Obviously when you're sitting at home watching TV, you're unprepared for something.

675
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,880
But when you go to racetrack, you're more prepared.

676
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,440
You're heightened.

677
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,600
Yeah. And also something happens, you know how to just

678
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,040
pour cold water on it and not let it affect you too much.

679
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,600
So were you shaken at all by the crash on the Friday?

680
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,800
Yeah, I was surprised at that, but you just thought, it looked horrific. But he got out okay,

681
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,920
he was concussed and he just thought, well, that hurt.

682
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:43,880
Were you of the view that the car is still safe enough, that the crash is the crash,

683
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,360
but you're protected in the car? Was that kind of your view?

684
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:51,560
Yeah, I think so. I think I believed in carbon fiber and that it was incredibly

685
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,480
strong and it's going to hurt you. Like hell, if you have a big shunt, but you should be okay.

686
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,360
Yeah. I think we did think that the worst was over a little bit.

687
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,480
Certainly wasn't anything like it was with aluminum cars that rupture the fuel tank or

688
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,560
something like that. So you... So what did you think on Saturday when Roland died?

689
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:15,320
It was horrible. It's a horrible thing. I drove because they stopped the session,

690
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,960
but I still was on the circuit. So I drove past and saw them attending to him.

691
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,960
And was your first assumption to another horrible shunt, but he's probably okay?

692
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,960
Or did you know this was different?

693
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,000
No, I didn't. I knew that that was not a good one.

694
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,360
There was something about it. I don't know what. I just looked like there was much more

695
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:39,480
city. You know also the location. It's not going to be a small impact or a place like that. It's

696
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,560
going to be pretty high speed. And I don't know. It's just something about it. And then the fact

697
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:48,120
that they stopped the session and more time goes by, then eventually you start to fear the worst.

698
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,960
And it's so eerie to see. I think I was telling you, I was in Imola this year and spent the entire

699
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,600
day there and went to obviously where Santa crashed and went to where Ratzenberger crashed.

700
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:05,720
I mean, we saw all the crash sites and it looks like the margin for error is so much

701
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,720
smaller than it appears on television. And Roland's crash, you don't really see well on

702
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,680
television. When you got back to the pit, did you go back out to qualify again or did it was a

703
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,640
session completely ended?

704
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,240
Do you know? I don't know. I don't think we didn't run the car after that. No, on the Friday,

705
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:24,200
we pulled on Saturday. On Saturday. No, we didn't. I don't think we did.

706
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,920
Because Ratzen was, he was really shaken by this. I mean, he seemed to be...

707
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:35,320
He seemed almost angry actually. I think it was derailed a little bit by or upset by

708
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:40,200
Rubens' accident. I think he was in a very high emotional state. I think he'd

709
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,080
had a lot on his plate. And I think I talk about that in the book. I think people have

710
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:53,160
wondered about his condition. And I know that he'd spoken to my wife because she was in the

711
01:02:53,160 --> 01:03:00,040
moat home and he was speaking to her about having a family. And she said, what's it like having a

712
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:06,280
family? And because she said, do you want me to leave while you get changed? And he said, no,

713
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:13,800
I just want to talk. And that was on race day. So I think he internalized a lot. I think he took a

714
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:19,800
lot upon himself. I think he felt enormous responsibility for people in Brazil and the

715
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:28,760
projects he had to do with helping young people. And I think he really felt that he had a job to

716
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:35,000
do, which he couldn't somehow racing enabled him to do. Through his racing, he was able to be

717
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,200
at and center. Then he could do these great works that he had. Did you know he took an Austrian

718
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,680
flag in the car that day? No, I didn't know that on the day. No, I only read about that later.

719
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:54,120
I have always believed that Senna's crash occurred because of a technical problem in the car. I

720
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:59,800
always thought the steering column broke. It's really your book that has probably changed my

721
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:08,760
view on that. I think the way you describe the accident coupled with your experience in that car

722
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:15,480
that has probably, not probably, it has changed my mind. And it's also made me come to accept

723
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,200
something that I think had always been a blind spot to me. You see, when you idolize somebody,

724
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,760
it's very hard to believe that they can make a technical error. You just can't believe it.

725
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:32,200
So I think if you idolize Senna, you can't really believe that he lost control of the car.

726
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:37,080
It's easier to believe that the steering column broke. And there are lots of good,

727
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,360
I mean, we create narratives. That's sort of what we do. And you could go through all of the stories

728
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,400
about how that cockpit was built and how the steering wheel was in the wrong position, but

729
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,400
they had to add an extra couple of inches to send a steering wheel. And of course, that if you look

730
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,000
at the sheer forces on that, that's going to be the thing. And you can watch the onboard camera.

731
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,440
And yet in a very unemotional way, you sort of dismantle a lot of that logic.

732
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,640
You're right. I mean, it went through it in quite a lot of detail. Well, that's because I had to,

733
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:07,880
after the event, to go back through stuff with the engineers to see if I could shed any light

734
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:15,880
on what had happened. The data I was able to see showed me what concurred with the onboard footage

735
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:22,280
was that he was putting opposite lock on the car and controlling the car. And my argument has always

736
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:27,880
been that if the steering wheel column broke, you'd put more lock on to make it work. And

737
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,480
I mean, if you imagine your... So let's explain this to people because I think for people who don't

738
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,800
drive a race car, they won't know the difference between lock opposite lock under steer over steer,

739
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:43,560
et cetera. I mean, I think you do a masterful job explaining this, but let's go back to set the stage

740
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:50,440
a little bit. Temborello is a sweeping left hand. It's a very fast left hand corner that is taken

741
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:56,200
basically flat out, assuming your tires are up to snuff. Now you also mentioned something really

742
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:01,560
interesting, which was the line that he took. You were surprised at the line he took on the first

743
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:06,280
flying lap after the safety car left. There was a couple of bumps and a couple of indents

744
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:11,080
had subsided, the road had slightly subsided close to the curb on the inside line, which is

745
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:17,640
the racing line. But I didn't like going on that line because I upset the car. For me,

746
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:24,120
we upset the car. So I stayed wide a bit and it seemed to miss the bumps. But yeah, the reason

747
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,360
I did that, because I didn't want to go where he went, not because of what happened to him,

748
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:36,520
because for me it was a harder ride, but I'm not at and center. And he was at and center and he

749
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:42,040
drove the car, he rung everything out of every car he raced. And I think that's...

750
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:48,920
You mentioned that the only real flying lap he had, which would have been what, lap six,

751
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:57,720
he had the third fastest time of the day. And that's with 65 kilos of fuel and cold tires.

752
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:03,160
Yeah, they were cold, not as pumped up as they should have been because they had to go around

753
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,400
the safety car. Was it called the safety car then? I can't remember anyway. So it wasn't a quick...

754
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,680
The super slow safety car.

755
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:15,800
The super slow safety car. So my argument is that there are really what I say and what I believe is

756
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:21,320
that I don't believe the steering column broke for two reasons. One is if the steering column

757
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:27,000
broke, then your instinct is to keep steering. And that means your hands would have... He would have

758
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,200
just... Right. So for the listener, what that means is you're describing that as lock. So if your

759
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:37,320
steering column breaks and you're doing a left-handed turn, you're going to be turning left as far as is

760
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,280
humanly possible. Yeah, because your brain will not... It's disconnected. So you know you're a

761
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:48,680
passenger, so you just instinctively put more on. And even if you don't put it on,

762
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:53,560
if the steering column broke, then there'd be suddenly less resistance to the lock that he's

763
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:58,360
putting on. And his hands would put more lock on because it's suddenly released.

764
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:06,040
But instead you saw the opposite. So explain what opposite lock is and how it's used to correct for

765
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,720
a rear loss of traction.

766
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,680
So it's the attitude of the car changes in relation to the direction of travel. So

767
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,040
the nose of the car, when it's oversteering, the nose of the car is pointing more to the inside of

768
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:23,720
the corner than, or let's say the back of the car or the middle of the car is actually at an angle

769
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,680
to the line of travel. So what happens... So is it safe if I describe that to people as when you're

770
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,720
oversteering, the rear of the car is turning faster than the front of the car into the direction you

771
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:38,280
want to go? It's more like a compass. Imagine a compass, right? A compass spins from the middle. So

772
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:44,920
if you want it to point dead north, that's good. If it starts to point slightly west of where you

773
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,880
want it to go, which is north, then in order to get the whole thing to keep going north,

774
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:55,400
you have to turn the wheel to the right. So the direction of the point of the car is to the left.

775
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,960
You put the steering lock on slightly to the right. And that means the back of the car would

776
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,920
act more like a dart. It'll actually start to straighten up. And as the car straightens up,

777
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:10,840
you put lock back on. So you point north. Understeer is when... We weren't going to understeer,

778
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,200
but I don't know. But I think initially he was understeering because he reduced throttle.

779
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,440
Yeah. I don't think it was ever understeering. I think he only ever got oversteer because he

780
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,480
was turning into the corner. So he's putting lock on to make the car go around the corner.

781
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:29,720
You don't think he ever understeered. You think this was immediate loss of rear traction?

782
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:36,040
I think it was a change of attitude because you can see from Schumacher's onboard camera that he

783
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:43,560
bought the car bottoms. And when the car hit the bumps, the car lost downforce and starts to slew

784
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,720
slightly to the back of the car, comes out to the right. So he puts a little bit of right lock on

785
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:55,320
to compensate. And then he puts more back lock. When that's settled down, he's put lock back on

786
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:00,120
to go left again. So the first one he recovered. Yeah. Well, recovered. He just did what

787
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:09,000
he expected it to do. The next one, it was even greater and you get more of an opposite lock on.

788
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,320
And it suddenly snaps to the right. And I just think at the speed he was going,

789
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:20,520
the loads he was going for, I think it's entirely plausible that it tank slappered on. We call it

790
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:26,600
tank slapper in bike racing. It was just a massive sideways. And with low tire pressures,

791
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:32,040
you would have got a lot of lateral movement on the tire and then it springs back. And at that

792
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:38,280
speed it can throw you off the track. I mean, I don't see that, you know, not detracting anything.

793
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:44,840
I think he was so motivated to win this race that I think he was putting himself right out there at

794
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:53,720
the end of the branch. And maybe even a guy like Ayrton couldn't drive that car

795
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,120
beyond a certain point without something giving somewhere.

796
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,200
And I think the way you describe it and you go into more detail in the book, we don't have to

797
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:06,200
go through it here now because I want people to read this book. It's so great. But the way you

798
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,960
talk about even being able to see like one of the radio lights or something on the wheel, the yellow

799
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:15,880
light. And so you actually have this frame of reference to actually see when he goes from lock

800
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:21,080
to opposite lock. And I think there was just something about reading your account that,

801
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,480
along with reading Adrian Newey's account several years ago, that really

802
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,160
sort of changed my view a bit and made me realize like even your heroes can make mistakes and can

803
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:39,560
lose control of the car. Ayrton lost control of the car in Brazil. And we push the cars to their

804
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:45,480
limits and ourselves thought to our limits. And my argument really in the book is that if you put

805
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:54,280
even someone as brilliant as Ayrton under a lot of stress with lots of different doubts,

806
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,440
lots of different questions, lots of different problems, and then you put them in a very

807
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:04,440
competitive situation and you expect them to perform with a clear head in the same way that they

808
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,360
have done in the past. I think something's got to give somewhere. You know, you add in the

809
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:16,040
fatality of the previous day, the emotional state, the determination to win, the fact that he's in a

810
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:23,240
different team. It's not going the way he wanted it to in the championship. If you put someone

811
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,320
like Ayrton in that situation, is he going to back down? No, he's not going to back down. He's going

812
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:34,520
to be Ayrton Senna. He's going to go and go further beyond where he's ever been before. Because that's

813
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:41,400
what Ayrton Senna was. He's not going to go, okay, I'll feather the throttle through Tamboretto.

814
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:47,960
He wouldn't be Ayrton Senna. So you write about something which is that in the days that followed,

815
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,320
the last thing that was on your mind was to go to Brazil for this funeral. Not out of any lack of

816
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,760
respect for Senna, but probably out of the need to be with your family, frankly.

817
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,280
Also, I didn't want to go to... I know. It's not all I know.

818
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,280
Yeah, it's bringing back memories that the last time you were at a funeral was,

819
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,480
you know, obviously a very traumatic experience for you. But Jackie Stewart nudged you to go.

820
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:14,280
Yep. Jackie rang me and said, are you going to Ayrton's funeral? I said,

821
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,840
oh, I don't know, Jackie. I can't, you know. And he said, you will regret it for your, you know,

822
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:25,720
to your dying day if you don't go. He basically didn't set me straight, but he made a very

823
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:31,000
important point to me, which is that you have to do this in a way. You're going to be a racing

824
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:39,000
driver. You can't, you can't just sidestep the nasty bits. He's about the most capable person

825
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,360
to say that. There's no one that could say that you had more credibility that was still alive at

826
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:48,360
that point. And, you know, in the absence of my dad being around, he was a kind of surrogate

827
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:57,160
father figure to me, giving me the right advice and impressing on me the importance of being there.

828
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:02,440
And he was absolutely right. So eternal gratitude to Jackie for that. Not something you want to do.

829
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,720
You know, you don't want to get on an airplane and go to Brazil and go to some,

830
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:14,120
to be confronted with the box they put someone in when they're alive anymore. You know, it's,

831
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:21,480
it's horrible. But when, you know, Ettin's funeral was the most extraordinary event,

832
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:26,840
you saw how he affected people. And that's what he'd lived with. That's what he'd been carrying

833
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,720
that nobody in F1 really saw. They didn't really see him in that. They thought he was a racing

834
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:37,240
driver. He was a bit nuts at times, you know, a bit over emotional, or maybe that's what they saw.

835
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,960
But they didn't see what he was- They didn't see the weight of a nation.

836
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,800
They didn't see the weight of the nation. They didn't see what he represented and he,

837
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,280
and the hope he had given people in Brazil. It's really amazing to this day. I mean,

838
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:55,720
I talk about this elsewhere. I can't meet someone from Brazil who if, when I start talking to them

839
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,680
about Senna, even if they weren't alive, right? Like, or even if they were five years old,

840
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:08,040
our nanny, for example, is Brazilian. And she was four, maybe five the day he died.

841
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,840
It's her earliest memory of life. Because that's every Sunday, that's all you did

842
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:22,680
was you watched Senna race and the country stopped for three days and more than a million people

843
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:27,320
lined the streets for this funeral. And to this day, I mean, it's like, I, if I'm in an Uber and

844
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,280
the driver happens to be from Brazil and we get talking about Senna, it doesn't matter if they're

845
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,560
20 or if they're 60, this is the single most important person they'll talk about.

846
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:45,000
Yeah, they're emotionally, you know, very strong nation. They, they're so passionate about everything

847
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:51,560
and, and they, and they loved what Ayrton had done and given them. He, they'd been through some tough

848
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,800
times and, and the football is one of the, also one of the things that lifts the nation. And,

849
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:04,840
but, but Ayrton had, had taken them to another place as well and, and was proud to be Brazilian.

850
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:11,240
And it was a very, very cool cruel blow to all those people in Brazil. You know,

851
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:15,240
they couldn't really understand what had happened. I don't think for a long time,

852
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,480
it was too shocking. My daughter wanted me to ask you this question when she knew I would be

853
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:26,200
speaking with you, which was, first of all, she was like, Oh my God, he's on TV. When I told her,

854
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,960
I was even talking to you because of course, every Sunday we get up to watch Formula One. So she gets,

855
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:36,520
she, she knows you as the guy on TV. She, she's less, I had to remind her of like all you done.

856
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,600
But her question is, were you afraid to get back in the car for the next race?

857
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:45,480
Well, because now you've got two weeks for the dust to settle. Yeah.

858
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:52,280
You've fully processed that two drivers have now been killed in the span of two days. Another one,

859
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,920
lucky to be alive. So you could have easily lost three drivers in three days.

860
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,720
Well, I'll put it, I put it like this. The enjoyment of driving had

861
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:11,880
evaporated from that point on. It was a task I had to do. So how long did that feeling persist?

862
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:17,880
I think for a good, maybe a couple more races or something, maybe certainly Monaco was a tough one.

863
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,920
I wasn't sure that I could cope with carrying all the hopes of the entire team. You know,

864
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:28,600
I was not at an Zenna as it was abundantly clear. You know, I was okay, but I wasn't

865
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,720
going to be able to do the things that they wanted from Zenna. So that was a wobbly one.

866
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:41,800
How much fear did you have of physical harm versus the pressure you're describing of,

867
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:47,400
wait a minute, like two years ago I was a test driver and now I'm the,

868
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,600
potentially the guy who's carrying the hopes of one of the most storied teams in Formula One.

869
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,240
Because those are two sort of different things. I mean, they can, they can overlap a little bit,

870
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:03,480
but one of them comes back to this real visceral concern of I can't let happen to my family.

871
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:11,080
What happened to me? Yeah, I think I did have the breaks on being pushed into

872
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:17,400
taking unnecessary risks. So you might say, okay, well you're not a proper racing driver if you,

873
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,480
that's what Edmond would say. You know, if you, if you stop taking risks and you're not a proper

874
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:25,640
racing driver, well, listen. Did Georgie talk with you about this at all? Well, I mean,

875
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:31,240
when you say talk, I mean, was your wife in this moment of, at this point it's back to being

876
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:35,960
gladiators, right? I don't think so. Cause I mean, if you're a gladiator, I don't know what it's

877
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:41,400
like being a gladiator. Basically you're trying to hurt someone else and I'm not that sort of

878
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:47,000
person. So, but in terms of the risk, I guess, yeah, you're sharing your skills and you're also

879
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,320
competing. I think that's the key thing is to actually, you want to be the first guy. You don't

880
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:57,320
want to be the second guy. So getting out there and, and racing is partly what you love doing,

881
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,920
but then when you've just had an experience like that, it, it sort of sours it a bit. And I think

882
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,400
it was just too much pressure on everyone. Did you talk with Jackie about this more? Because

883
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,240
again, in the absence of your father, who would have been the perfect person to have

884
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:17,720
talk this through with you, did you feel like I want to understand from someone who's lived

885
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:23,720
through this losing teammates, for example, this was all tight upper lip. I have to say I was

886
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:31,480
affected with the thought that because it ends accident was incredibly public, you know, and

887
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:38,200
shocking and so forth. So definitely my wife did not want to her children to see

888
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:47,000
anything like that happen to me. So protecting the kids from any potential shocking incident

889
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:55,320
was also part of our lives then I think after that and was, was I think increasingly part of my

890
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:03,000
modus of going racing. And my dad raced with three children, a lot of racing drivers in those days

891
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,240
had kids, including Jackie and so Ferrari used to say that a driver with children was a second

892
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:14,040
and a lap slower. Well, there was a lot of world champions with children. And I think that some,

893
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:21,240
in some senses, the goal is to survive. So if the goal is to survive, then you're doing the

894
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:27,080
responsible thing by performing to the very highest level you can possibly can without going over that

895
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:33,320
that threshold. And, you know, Ayrton didn't have children. You know, I think it's very easy to, to

896
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:39,080
think of as racing drivers who could get to the position where they think, well, if I get hurt,

897
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:43,800
then that's my own stupid form. You know, but when you've got a family, you think,

898
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,720
if I get hurt, someone else is going to get hurt as well. That's a slightly different thought.

899
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:53,480
And the last point I want to say about the, that weekend is something else you wrote about in the

900
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:58,280
book, which again, I think just speaks to the, the beautiful level of detail you bring to these,

901
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,840
all of these little stories that just don't get told was when you show up for Monaco and

902
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,880
the Williams truck and sure enough, there's Senna's clothing. Well, it wasn't, I mean,

903
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:12,200
wasn't expected. Yeah. It's one of those things where you talk about it like,

904
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:18,440
and it's so obvious when you talk about it, which is every day a driver goes,

905
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:24,680
takes off his street clothes, puts on his racing kit, gets in a car, but invariably

906
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:30,680
sometimes that driver doesn't come back. Yeah. That was something that a detail,

907
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:38,200
which is a really hard thing to consider, but of course gets lost in the sensational stories is

908
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:43,240
that, you know, that happened a lot with people in my dad's era and they, someone would have to go

909
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,360
and clear out their room. They'd have to go back to their room, get all their stuff, pack it up,

910
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:53,480
and take it and make sure it got back to their family or their loved ones. Imagine that. Yeah.

911
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,080
Imagine how many times that took place. They're very poignant experiences. And also even just

912
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:03,560
to think about that, you know, we, we have all this stuff around us, you know, and we suddenly not

913
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:12,040
there. The stuff somehow we linger in the stuff we have and we leave other people with that

914
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:18,040
responsibility to deal with it. Do you remember any of that from your father? Well, yeah, absolutely.

915
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:23,160
I mean, like, do you remember actively helping your mom with, I've never actually thought of it

916
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:27,640
until I read you writing about it, right? Which is this idea of like, well, there's still a drawer

917
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:32,760
full of socks and shirts and pants, you know? So what does one do with these things? Well,

918
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,720
you know, and of course then you have to decide whether you're going to throw it away.

919
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:44,040
So for a long time, I think my mom, my mom kept a lot of my dad's ties for me. These were ties that

920
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:50,600
were about 10 centimeters across. They were 1970s ties with like bright colors, but they were my

921
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:54,760
dad's ties. So, you know, she kept them quite sweetly. She kept them because she thought maybe

922
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:00,360
I'd like them not as not to wear myself, perhaps, but you know, as mementos and think, but what do

923
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:05,400
you do with the incinerator? You have to let go of this stuff. And as you look at it, you just think,

924
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:12,200
well, I could wear it, but it's a bit odd wearing your dad's clothes. You're still attached to it

925
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:17,960
because of it brings you close. It's a relic. But can you let go of it? Can you kind of go,

926
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:23,720
okay, we're going to throw this stuff away. Put it on eBay. I mean, all sorts of fans out there,

927
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:28,200
they love all that stuff, wouldn't they? But is it disrespectful? You go through all those thoughts,

928
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,680
you go through that, you just go through all these little questions and you can't find the

929
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:37,720
answers to them. You know, what is the right way forward? The other thing that's sort of interesting

930
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:42,760
about this story, at least to me, thinking about it through these lenses is I don't get the sense

931
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:48,200
from the book and you didn't, you're never explicit about this, but I don't get the sense that Frank

932
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,800
or Patrick sat down to have long discussions about this either. Is that, am I correct in assuming

933
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:58,280
that? Or were there times when they wanted to know how you were doing and they wanted to talk about

934
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,960
your head outside of the car? No, but then they have their own stuff to deal with as well.

935
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,560
So it's not all about me. They also are going through, imagine what it's like for Frank. He

936
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,240
signed Ayrton to get his race for his team. Imagine what it's like for Patrick. I can't imagine.

937
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,600
Patrick is his car and people are saying it's failed. He's having to go to court.

938
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,000
What is Adrian? I mean, how do these guys all feel?

939
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,360
Yeah, it's the, everyone had a lot of stress to do with the engineers, the guy who works in the car,

940
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:31,800
not an easy time for any of them. You know, so it's one of the contradictions with us,

941
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,840
but is, you know, we focus a lot on the driver and some ways that the public see the driver as the

942
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:44,600
public facing person, the person of most interest, you know, but it's not all about the driver as

943
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,800
well. You work with these, rely on the team. You work with the team. They went through a lot. They

944
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:55,320
were really battered after that experience and some of them still today don't want to talk about it.

945
01:24:55,320 --> 01:25:02,520
As you head into the second half of the 94 season, all of a sudden the gap between you and Schumacher

946
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,000
is narrowing. And as you head into Suzuka, I think you're separated by a point.

947
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,360
Right. What was the situation in Suzuka? I had to, he, yeah.

948
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,920
Well, if he finished ahead of you, he would win.

949
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,280
Yes, exactly. Yeah.

950
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,480
But then he crashed, trying to cut you off.

951
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,440
That was in Adelaide.

952
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,600
So in Suzuka, he-

953
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,040
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I misspoke.

954
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,480
Suzuka was the second to last race.

955
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,040
Yes, it was.

956
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:26,840
Which you won.

957
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,000
I had to beat him to keep the championship open.

958
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And you did. Yes. Okay. So Suzuka is the race that you-

959
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
He came down to match play basically.

960
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,320
Yes.

961
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,840
It was hole by hole.

962
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,960
And that you wrote something very interesting about this, which was,

963
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,560
you have this moment where you feel like you can't do anymore.

964
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:51,400
And you, in the book, you actually describe this as you call out to Eretan and you say,

965
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:55,240
like, if you're up there watching me, like I need your help right now.

966
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:59,640
And then you describe the next lap as an out of body experience.

967
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:05,160
And I'm reading that. And what you're describing sounds exactly like the way Senna described his

968
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:10,520
88 qualifying session in Monaco, which was he wasn't driving the car.

969
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,560
Like he was part of the car. The car was being driven.

970
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,720
And I don't know if that was just a coincidence that, because you didn't reference anything

971
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,400
about Monaco, but it was just interesting that you talked about having this thought of

972
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:26,200
calling out to him for help as your former teammate and then driving.

973
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,160
I think the word you used is you were possessed.

974
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,760
Yeah. That's any way I can describe it.

975
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:36,280
I mean, it was, I'm sure that there's a perfectly logical explanation

976
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,520
or one that can be described or explained.

977
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,640
Scientific terms.

978
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,320
Yeah. Biologically, you know, I think that we,

979
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:48,520
we all know that every now and then we do something. We hear people say things like,

980
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:53,560
I don't know how I managed to lift the car up or something like that to get off some kid or something.

981
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:58,280
You know, we, we have more potential than we are aware of. And sometimes it,

982
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:03,960
to release that potential, we have to play tricks with our mind and we have to say,

983
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,760
imagine that pain isn't there. And, you know, I've had stories of people who've, you know,

984
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:12,040
got dreadful pain, but they can manage to cope with it by.

985
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:19,720
So meditating, meditating and, and all these things to do with fully exploring what the

986
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:25,320
mind is capable of doing have got lots of very strange stories attached to it.

987
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:30,760
And I think people are right to be skeptical of them and, and, and question them. But if I had

988
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:37,160
tricked myself into through not deliberately, but just simply, I wanted to win that race.

989
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:43,240
I knew I had to win that race. And I also wanted us to win for Ayrton as well.

990
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:47,560
There was an element of wanting to beat the Benetton team because of this story,

991
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:54,440
this, not story, but it's this experience we'd had in 94. So I was massively motivated to win

992
01:27:54,440 --> 01:28:00,680
that race and I'd run out of steam. I couldn't go any faster and he's catching me. And I knew he

993
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:06,840
was going to, he was going to get me on the line. And I just, I just thought, okay, I need some help

994
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:12,760
from somewhere. And so I just said, in my mind, it was a kind of like, if you're there, I need,

995
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:20,920
I can need a bit of a hand. And I swear to God, it was like someone had got my foot and planted it

996
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,840
flat on the floor and I couldn't lift it off. I couldn't lift off. I'm going through the S's.

997
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:34,440
I'm going, Oh my God. And my hands are like, my hands are just correcting the car. And I literally

998
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:41,400
was disconnected from what my body was doing. And it was just like I was willing it to win,

999
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:48,920
you know, willing it just purely through thought, through some sort of telepathic kind of way. I was

1000
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,480
controlling things. And eventually I got halfway around. I said, Oh no, I got to, I'm sorry. I'm

1001
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:59,080
going to have to come back here. This is all going to go horribly wrong. And I sort of, I can

1002
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:03,400
remember literally feeling like I was coming back into the car and in at the hairpin and going,

1003
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:10,360
well, I'll take it from here. You know, I'm sure we can finish this off. And now people listen to

1004
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:15,720
this. We'll go, you're nuts. You're making this up, you know, but that's what happened. And I can't

1005
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:21,880
explain it in any other way than I just did. It was, you know, I beat Michael in the wet. So

1006
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,600
let's be honest, that'll old me beating Michael Schumacher. Someone must've helped me.

1007
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:32,440
Well, it's funny. I'll pause for a moment only to say something for the person who's listening to

1008
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:39,720
this, who isn't a diehard F1 fan. Many a pundit has actually with the benefit of the retrospect scopes

1009
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:45,560
said you're arguably one of the most underrated world champs ever. I mean, you're incredibly

1010
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:51,240
modest. You're so uncomfortable sometimes. Do you remember when they did the This is Your Life

1011
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:57,320
special about 20 years ago? I found a clip of this on YouTube. Have you ever watched it?

1012
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:03,640
No. I don't even know what you're talking about. You know that TV show, This is Your Life. Yeah,

1013
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:09,160
they got me on that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to go back and watch this because I'll tell

1014
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:15,560
you what I can't get over on that show is how uncomfortable you are being commended. Hmm.

1015
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:22,360
Think about it. The whole show is singing the praise of the person who's This is Your Life.

1016
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:26,920
They're bringing all these people out. Everybody's talking about you and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1017
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,520
You're making me feel uncomfortable. I know. I'm sorry.

1018
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:39,480
But the level of discomfort in watching you be praised by people is it's palpable to watch. Now,

1019
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:45,800
maybe I'm just a bit more tuned into that now because I've read everything you've written.

1020
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,920
But that was my reading of that. Now, I could be wrong. I'd be curious to know what your wife or

1021
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:54,600
someone who knows you well would think or what your children would think if they saw that. Is

1022
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:02,760
that just dad's countenance or is that actually dad being uncomfortable being praised in this way?

1023
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:09,160
I am uncomfortable being praised. I mean, there were times when I was in therapy,

1024
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:14,040
which I talk about in the book, where my therapist is going, I think he did really well. And I'd be

1025
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:20,600
going, Oh, no, don't say that. I want you to criticize me. I want to know how I can be better

1026
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:25,480
and what I've done wrong. And now I'm much better with that. I mean, I honestly, if someone says

1027
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,480
that was a great shot, even if it's rubbish, I go, okay, well, that was, that's very nice of you

1028
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:36,360
to say so. I really appreciate it. But I don't know. Yeah. It was, it does make me feel really

1029
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:43,640
queasy about getting compliments. I don't know why. I'm sure that's an awful failing in a human being.

1030
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,960
I don't know. I don't know if that's true, actually.

1031
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:55,480
What I do think is I think we make, we celebrate far too much people's achievements that perhaps

1032
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:00,840
they don't warrant so much celebration as we give them. I mean, what does it mean? You know,

1033
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:04,680
racing drive, they want to, you know, everyone wants to race and they want to win. They don't

1034
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:09,800
want to win for everyone else. They want to win for themselves. So it's a kind of selfish activity.

1035
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:14,520
Yeah. Every now and then you want to win for someone else and you, yeah, it's nice to do that.

1036
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:21,080
But is it so praiseworthy? I don't know. I mean, I think it depends, right? I think it depends on,

1037
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:25,800
I mean, I understand your point of course, right? You know, compared to a missionary doctor or

1038
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:32,120
someone who's, you know, out there saving a life or something like that, maybe not, but it's still

1039
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:38,280
a metaphor for life, right? It's still the substrate by which we can take lessons and expand. And it

1040
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:44,520
still pushes the boundaries of what it is that we're capable of. And I think there's something

1041
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:49,400
about that, that Senna is the most extreme example of that, that we've probably ever seen in all of

1042
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:57,560
sport where at one individual's passion and pursuit is, first of all, it's a tool by which he was able

1043
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:03,400
to help millions of people in his own country directly and financially. But I think more

1044
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:10,760
importantly, it's sort of a hope that people cling to. And, you know, in the words of David Foster

1045
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,160
Wallace, you know, we all worship something. There's a thing as atheism. So we're all in the

1046
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:19,560
pursuit and worship of something. I think also there's something that is just, maybe it just

1047
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:25,080
occurred to me, but I think also that I've learned to appreciate that opportunity doesn't come to

1048
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:31,960
everyone. And some people look at somebody who's had an opportunity and they've done something

1049
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:36,120
with it and they've done the right thing with it. And they've gone, oh, thank God, you did that.

1050
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:40,840
I didn't get the opportunity to do that, but I'm glad you did because that's what I would have

1051
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,160
liked to have done. And so when they get praised, if you get praise for something, it's not you

1052
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:51,160
they're praising, it's celebrating the fact that somebody has had an opportunity and they've

1053
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:56,120
triumphed over the something. And you're right, that's what gives us all hope that, you know,

1054
01:33:56,120 --> 01:34:02,280
maybe if we got the opportunity, we do the same or it's a generosity when you're celebrated,

1055
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,320
celebrity, I think you're people say congratulations because it's, we're celebrating something for

1056
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,320
all of us. I think that's something which I'd perhaps never really properly understood. I felt

1057
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,640
you know, a bit like a kid getting too many Christmas presents or something. I don't know.

1058
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:23,640
Well, you almost got the Christmas present in 94 because as we head into Adelaide, of course,

1059
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:28,680
now you're down by a point. If Schumacher finishes ahead of you, he wins the championship.

1060
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:37,320
If you finish ahead of him, you win the championship and he crashes and all you'd have to do at this

1061
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:42,600
point is finish the race and you win. And then something is wrong with your car. If I recall,

1062
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:48,680
it was suspension. Yeah. So what happened is we were racing hammer and tongs and a long way ahead

1063
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:53,800
of everyone else. Yeah. Cause Nigel was on pole. Nigel was on pole, but had a horrible start. It

1064
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:59,160
was basically a two-man race. Two-man race. And it was sort of Suzuka part two. We went straight

1065
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:03,800
back into the battle we'd had the previous race. I did put him under a lot of pressure, but then he

1066
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:09,960
started to creep away from me and he got so far away, I couldn't see around. It was like a street

1067
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,360
track that went around blocks. So it was 90 degree corners and he'd just gone around the 90 degree

1068
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:18,200
corner that I couldn't see that he'd gone off and hit the wall and come back on. So when I come

1069
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:23,240
around the corner, I'm right on his tail and he's coming back on the track and obviously not up to

1070
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:29,720
speed. And I thought this is my chance. I'm never going to get this again because he, he always,

1071
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:34,040
he already managed to pull away from me. So I thought he slipped up. He's got managed to get

1072
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:39,000
back on the track and I'll have a go at passing him on this corner here. So I went down the inside,

1073
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,560
but he closed the door on me and touched my car and damaged the suspension. He crashed out.

1074
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:51,160
So his race was run, but unfortunately my car was also damaged and I couldn't carry on either.

1075
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:56,360
So he'd won the championship and a lot of people were very cross about that. I'm gonna have to say,

1076
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,680
I, I look back, I, at the time I thought, Oh, what have I done? That was a stupid,

1077
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:09,000
clumsy move. I just did, but actually British of you. Yeah. Well, when I look at it again,

1078
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
it still looks like that to me, but anyway, that what I didn't know was his car was probably

1079
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:19,880
terminally damaged anyway. So if he knew that his car was damaged, then he knew he had to do

1080
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:25,640
what he did. And if he didn't know, then it was just a defensive move that worked for him. Luckily,

1081
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:29,640
I suppose, cause my car got broken. I think the hardest part of that story for me,

1082
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:35,800
sort of cheering you on is like, you're just thinking, come on guys, he, you don't need the

1083
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:40,840
suspension to be perfect. It just needs to be good enough for you to limp to the finish line.

1084
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:47,000
There ain't no, you don't limp enough for the long car. They pair things down to the bare minimum.

1085
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,640
And if one part of the suspension is buckled, it's going to just snap the moment you hit the

1086
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:58,280
brakes or put any load on it. It's going to collapse. So how does that race put the exclamation

1087
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:04,760
mark at the end of the most emotionally draining season of your life, which is the lowest low.

1088
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:12,600
And it almost, you come within literally one foot, there are 30 centimeters of width

1089
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,920
and you could have had the highest high in that season.

1090
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,560
You know, I could also have been the same fate as that.

1091
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:23,080
I mean, is that basically why, cause I've heard you in interviews in the last 20 years,

1092
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:28,360
you've never sort of complained about that race. You've, you've always had a very,

1093
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:33,320
and maybe this is, I don't know how much of this is, is just, you know, you're being polite and

1094
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:38,680
it's not your nature to versus like you really had a sanguine view of, you know what, look,

1095
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:42,760
I gave it the best I could. It's amazing that I was the second, you know, I had the second

1096
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,080
most points that season, but I don't have hard feelings about it. It's sort of the way I feel

1097
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:56,120
you describe it. I think in 94, I was, I gave it everything I had and wanted so badly to, to win.

1098
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:03,640
I, I am, I want to ask you a question. Do you, did you see, did Michael set himself up as somehow

1099
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:09,480
the villain was in some way what happened to Eartan was not his fault. But I mean,

1100
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:13,160
I think a lot of people, this is complicated. Here's the thing. I mean, I'm going to just put

1101
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:17,640
my bias on the, on the table, right? You can see my laptop over there. It's got a MP four,

1102
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:22,520
four. I mean, you've got, I'm a Senna fan, like no other. I've never liked Schumacher.

1103
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,280
I have to be honest with you. I never, I always felt he played in a gray area of the sport.

1104
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:30,760
Let's look at 94. Well, I'm the same people. I asked you that question because I sort of knew

1105
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:35,560
that that was the situation, not for you personally, but there was definitely some

1106
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:40,360
animosity towards the way Michael went about racing. Yeah. And part of that's not fair to

1107
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:46,920
Michael, right? So part of it is I think if Michael had not raced at Imola, I don't think

1108
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,040
Senna would have died. That's not Michael's fault. Another way. It's not, it's not his fault. But

1109
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:58,520
that's sort of the view that I carry, right? Was Senna was convinced that Schumacher was riding

1110
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:03,880
traction control. I probably think that's true. Remember Benetton refused to submit their data

1111
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:09,880
to F1 after that race incurred a huge fine. Several races later, they get busted for using

1112
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:15,240
an illegal fueling filter. I mean, they were always sort of doing something a little bit gray.

1113
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:21,480
So I think there are some fans that just immediately fell into a Schumacher is not

1114
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:27,560
the good guy. But you can also look at Ettin and say Ettin was someone who's very volatile.

1115
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:33,160
And if he felt that someone had treated him badly, he would almost never forgive them.

1116
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:39,320
I don't think he ever forgave Prost for Monica with ADA4. I think that was the beginning of

1117
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:42,280
the end of that animosity. And I think maybe that was a weakness.

1118
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:47,160
It is. And you know, my wife asked me about this. She goes, you sort of have a double standard with

1119
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:52,040
Senna. Like, you know, you're very quick to overlook his flaws. I don't know that that's

1120
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:59,080
true. I think what it is. I think it's how open a book he was and how volatile he was that I

1121
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:04,280
actually see as appealing. There's no ambiguity of where you stood with him.

1122
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:07,560
It's kind of Greek theater, isn't it? With Ettin.

1123
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:08,360
Yes.

1124
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:14,520
He's kind of destined. He hadn't got any choice in the matter. His life, his personality,

1125
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:20,120
the things that made him who he was, these forces were driving him.

1126
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:23,000
And you look back at some of the earlier interviews, I mean, there was an amazing

1127
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:30,440
interview with Prost in 90 maybe when he was so upset at Senna. But he made this point,

1128
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:37,240
which was like, God, Senna acts like he can't die in a car. You know, he drives like someone

1129
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,600
who's immune from death. But he said, but he's not. You know, of course, never would anybody

1130
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:47,560
imagine what that would foreshadow four years later. So yes, going back to your final race in

1131
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:54,200
94, I thought Schumacher was out to lunch. I mean, I thought that was completely unfair.

1132
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:59,640
But what should have happened was that the people who run the sport should have said,

1133
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:05,480
you can't do that. And they didn't. They didn't do that with Ettin when he crashed into Prost

1134
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,440
in Suzuka.

1135
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,680
Although I always thought that was sort of payback for...

1136
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:09,640
It's not. It's not a...

1137
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,840
I know. I know. I know.

1138
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,760
You can't run. You can't let drivers have...

1139
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,280
Yeah, you can't be mercenaries.

1140
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:19,320
No, it's not death wish or whatever that film was with Charles, but you're too young to remember.

1141
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,440
No, no, I totally remember.

1142
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:24,120
But, you know, so you can't take the law into your own hands. That's what they're there for.

1143
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:30,920
They're there to stop things getting out of hand. And they just abdicated their responsibility to

1144
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:37,080
running things properly. And, you know, that meant that opened the door for everyone in all branches

1145
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:43,800
of the sport to go about the sport in the way they saw it being executed in Formula One.

1146
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,560
Because everyone looks down, looks... They see Formula One as the pinnacle of everything.

1147
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,960
That's the way they work it. So in American racing, they're a lot tougher. It's incredible.

1148
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:58,920
They can be quite tough on drivers who are bad driving and stuff like that in the States,

1149
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,400
particularly on ovals as well, because it is very dangerous.

1150
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:04,680
So we're going to skip the 95 season just for the sake of time, because there's still so much

1151
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:11,000
I want to talk about post-retirement. But into the 96 season, you're racing very well. You've now

1152
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:17,080
got this new upstart, another son of, as you describe him, right, from my home country.

1153
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:23,160
At what point, even though it came down to the last race, so it's sort of a nail-biting

1154
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:28,280
season all over again, your form looked incredible that season, right? I mean,

1155
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:33,400
was there a part of you that was starting to accept halfway through that season that this

1156
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:38,840
is your season? Yeah, I think before the season started, it was always a one-year contract. I

1157
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:45,240
didn't know it was going to be my last season with Williams, but I knew when we got to Monza,

1158
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:48,760
by Monza, which was a bit later in the day, but I mean, at the start of the season, I thought,

1159
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:57,160
this has got to be perfect this season. I've got to not be distracted, and I've got to polish the

1160
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:01,480
job. I knew I had a chance. The car was brilliant, and I knew I had a guy who'd never done a lot of

1161
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:08,360
the tracks that he was going to go to. So no matter how fast he was or motivated, he was at a

1162
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:15,960
disadvantage to me. I had no excuse not to beat him, really. He was a good teammate. He was cocky

1163
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,040
and irritating at times, but but charming with it as well.

1164
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:23,480
What track was it, Estrel, when he claimed he could take the non-racing one?

1165
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,720
He did that at the start of the season.

1166
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,160
Like in preseason testing, right?

1167
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:36,440
Pre-season testing, he sort of sat down and was, I think he did it as a way of getting noticed by

1168
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:40,920
the team and the engineers by saying, you know, do you think anyone could overtake round the last

1169
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:46,920
corner and boasting really and catching everyone's attention in the process? And we'd sit there and

1170
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:53,480
go, guy's completely mad. What was he talking about? Anyway, did it.

1171
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:55,960
That's the amazing thing. And he couldn't have passed a better person.

1172
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:00,200
No, and he did it. And also I was I was in the post-race

1173
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:05,640
cooldown room with him as well. And Mike was very cross with him because he claimed it was dangerous.

1174
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:08,120
Yeah, the irony of that is unbelievable.

1175
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:13,000
But that's the extraordinary thing about these guys is they are never wrong in any situation.

1176
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,200
They've tricked their mind to believe they have to be right in every situation.

1177
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:22,440
And there's only one rule and it's their rule. That's the way they approach it.

1178
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:26,680
And someone told me this story about Jack Nicholas being asked in an interview once by someone,

1179
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:32,760
some get together with the public and meet the fan type thing. And the guy asked him,

1180
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:36,920
Jack, when you three putted in the Masters in whatever he said, I never three putted in the

1181
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:41,720
Masters. You know, you did. I saw you. I was there. I said, I never three putted in the

1182
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:49,480
Masters. I never three putted my whole career. You just basically explain that people who are

1183
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:55,880
that competitive and train their mind, they don't see themselves as making mistakes.

1184
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:01,160
Well, and you could almost argue that's a trait. Like that's a feature of their greatness is the

1185
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:07,000
ability to completely suppress anything that could be negative or that could reflect on them having

1186
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,480
made an error. Now, I've always found that interesting because you take the opposite.

1187
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:15,800
Like you're someone that comes in with a totally different personality, which is highly willing

1188
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,720
to accept, Oh my God, what did I, did I make a mistake here? How can I learn from this?

1189
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:23,240
Which tactically may be a mistake. Well, that's the point I'm going to make is

1190
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:30,680
the evidence would suggest both phenotypes can produce success. So I don't know that it's

1191
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:35,560
necessary that one has to be blind to their mistakes to be successful. In fact, I would

1192
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:42,040
argue that that's a harder way to live your life, isn't it? I would say that Alain Prost was self

1193
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:49,080
critical, openly self critical and, and, and willing to accept a little bit of his fallibility

1194
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:56,760
maybe. And I think that in studies with sports psychologists, they have identified the people who

1195
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:04,040
are the best people are more self-critical of themselves. So they're actually, they see

1196
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:08,760
themselves as a work in progress and they're always trying to improve. Whereas the ones that

1197
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,960
have a problem are the ones that feel they've got it all and they don't need it. They've got

1198
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:17,080
nothing else to learn. And that's a kind of harder position and it's easier to fracture. And you have

1199
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:22,120
to say in some cases where Michael was racing and things weren't going well, he fell apart.

1200
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:27,000
It didn't compute, I think in some cases. And I think he showed a certain fragility,

1201
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:33,000
but most of the time he was so strong as a competitor that, you know, his confidence

1202
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:37,800
with what gave him also some power over when everyone else.

1203
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:43,800
When that season ends, you take a Concord over to New York, you end up on Letterman.

1204
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,720
Well, they put a, they said, do you want me on the show? And they put off, yeah.

1205
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:51,240
I didn't choose to go Concord, but he was there.

1206
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:54,520
Well, it's kind of amazing. It would be only a few years, three years later, four years later,

1207
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:59,320
that plane would be grounded, never fly again. So you kind of got this surprise from Letterman

1208
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:03,480
when you were on your sort of victory lap, so to speak, right? Because he pulled out a picture of

1209
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:08,840
your dad, which again was done in good spirits. It wasn't, it was done as a way to basically make

1210
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:14,200
a point, which was you were the first person to ever win a Formula One championship as the son

1211
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:19,480
of another Formula One champion. And I don't think at that point in your career, by the way,

1212
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:23,560
anybody would say, well, of course, you know, once you're the son of a champion, it's easier for you.

1213
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:28,200
I mean, if anything, by that point you had established, you didn't have a single break

1214
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:34,280
your way in terms of being the son of Graham Hill. In fact, I think even Letterman riffed

1215
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:37,640
you about it a little bit that you still got, you lost your seat.

1216
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:42,680
They didn't help me keep my willingness drive, no. I don't think Frank saw any benefit in that,

1217
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:47,480
just having a son of around the place. So no, I don't know. I don't know whether I,

1218
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:53,080
nobody can answer that one. I mean, is it easier? Is it less easy? I don't know. A lot of the guys

1219
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:58,520
whose dad didn't have successful careers, they went on to be successful racing drivers. There's

1220
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:04,120
lots of sons of out there. Did you think about it when Josh was racing? Yeah, I did. I thought it

1221
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:08,760
must be difficult for him. You know, it must be difficult because he can't just go racing and be

1222
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:13,800
treated like everyone knew that this was someone who could potentially be a third time,

1223
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:20,280
you know, third generation world champion. No pressure, son. I think that Josh was very mature

1224
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:25,400
and could cope with that, but nevertheless, it's a factor and you kind of don't know how to deal

1225
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:30,440
with it. I don't know how you, you can't ignore it. You can't, you don't want to keep banging on

1226
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:35,560
about it, but it's there all the time. It's just a fact of life. And you're going, Oh, well, that's

1227
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:40,520
it. You know, that's now we got to get back to the racing and, and actually the only thing that

1228
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:44,760
really makes any difference and any things that thing that people really care about is where do

1229
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:50,680
you finish? So the next year, 97, you're in the arrows car and then you spend the last two years

1230
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:56,600
with Eddie Jordan, right? Yeah. Yeah. You managed to win a race in the Jordan car, right? Yeah.

1231
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:04,120
Was it hungry? No, it was spa. It was spa. So your last win was at spa. Yeah. Epic circuit. Yeah.

1232
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:08,360
But I knew when I won that I couldn't do that again. That was a two hour race in the wet.

1233
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:17,720
I'm 38 years old and it was exhausting mentally, physically, you know, it was really tough.

1234
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:21,800
And I think if I, if I'm finding this difficult now, I just, you know,

1235
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:26,200
what did you decide at the end of 98 to come back for another year? What, what did you have

1236
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:30,920
left to prove at that point? Well, I have a two year contract. So I thought the car was getting

1237
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:35,800
better and I just, at the end of 18, why would I come back? Yeah. I know you had your contract,

1238
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:40,280
but, but I mean, contracts aside, did you still have, I want, I want, you can't, it's very difficult

1239
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:45,240
to just give up. It's very difficult to go. Okay. Well, I mean, I, I've not had a good weekend, but

1240
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:54,360
or good season. I found it quite hard, but I'm still fit-ish, young-ish, you know, and I still

1241
01:49:54,360 --> 01:50:01,400
think there's a chance. And so that part of you overrides the, the one that can be utterly brutally

1242
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:09,480
objective and say, you know, you should stop now. And so I got halfway through 99 and thought,

1243
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:14,360
I can't, I can't carry on with this. I've got to stop, got to get out. And I wanted to stop at the

1244
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:18,920
British Grand Prix, but Eddie Jordan had got someone else signed up and made a commitment

1245
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:23,320
to someone to get me out of the car. And I said, well, I don't want to leave on a, you know,

1246
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:28,520
I like at least to go out, you know, saying thank you to everyone and finish my career where I

1247
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:33,800
started at Silverstone and British Grand Prix and everything. Can you, can you see your way to just

1248
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:39,000
letting me do that? And that was, then suddenly it got all complicated and suddenly I got locked

1249
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,080
into doing the whole rest of the season. So let's go to the very last race, your last race as an F1

1250
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:52,840
driver, 1999, Suzuka, right? Yeah. So by that point, I'd just gone, I had gone wrong in the race

1251
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,240
somewhere. And I just thought I'm a lap down. I've had to come in for a front wing. We got no

1252
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:03,080
chock. We're in a way out of the points. It's just, I just thought right now in a wheel could fall

1253
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:07,640
off. I could hit a bar and kill myself and then it would all been stupid, wouldn't it? Why risk it?

1254
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:13,640
So I came in. And what did you say? I said, I'm finished. What did they say? What's wrong with

1255
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:20,280
the car? Nothing. I mean, it's a lot like Nicki Lauda in, in 75, 76, right? Yeah. They're not happy

1256
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:26,760
with you if you retire a car, but screw them. Sorry. They don't understand you are putting your

1257
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:33,800
life at risk and affecting potentially, you know, your family and all that stuff. And there are times

1258
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:41,640
when it doesn't matter. This was really a crescendo for you, right? This was, it's your last race,

1259
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:47,080
but it was the moment when you finally sort of said, wait a minute, like I am now secure enough

1260
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:54,200
in my skin. I'm a formula one world champion. And on my terms today, this is enough. No, exactly.

1261
01:51:54,200 --> 01:52:00,280
I'd done it their way my whole career. I had always given everything I had for the team and

1262
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:05,400
I gave everything I had for Williams and I got the sack. And after a bit, you just go, hey,

1263
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:11,000
listen, there was a deal. They're doing a deal. You've done a deal with them. Okay. It says in

1264
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,760
the contract, you will always give the best of your performance. I gave the best. I had nothing

1265
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:20,200
left. You know, do you remember that evening or the next night you were, I guess it would have

1266
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:25,000
been probably a, were your, was your family at that race? No. So how long before you got home?

1267
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,040
Do you remember? Say two days, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. What was it like that first time you came

1268
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:34,600
home knowing you were retired? Was it the greatest feeling? Was it a sad feeling? It's a very good,

1269
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:40,440
I don't, I don't actually remember. I think I was very relieved and happy. I thought I was home

1270
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:46,360
and dry. I thought I'd escaped. That's what I thought. I actually, all of those things came

1271
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:53,720
home to roost. You know, the things you put back behind you, those fears and whatever worries that

1272
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:59,720
you, imaginings that you have, you kind of go, well, you know, you can, you can stay there for a bit.

1273
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:05,800
And then when you step out of the car, you just think, I made it. I made it out. I made it through

1274
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:11,080
in one piece. It's like getting to the top of the mountain El Capitan. And actually the worrying

1275
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:16,840
thing is whether you come back and do something dangerous again, you know, you have to kind of,

1276
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:20,600
so I did, I didn't start, I stopped racing and I thought, right, that's it. I'm not going anywhere,

1277
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:26,120
near anything dangerous for as long as I come, you know, I'm still relatively sane about things

1278
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:32,120
like that. I did do karting when, uh, when Josh was karting, I got back in a, got pumped up again

1279
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:39,000
and started racing a few guys, but took a few risks there, but generally I've been to quite good.

1280
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,680
But this is kind of interesting, right? I mean, there are a lot of people when they leave the

1281
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:49,880
peak of their profession, their identity is so wrapped up in that thing. And again, this could be

1282
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:53,960
being the F1 driver. This could be being the big shot lawyer, the big shot doctor. But I, you know,

1283
01:53:53,960 --> 01:54:01,240
I see this pattern all the time, which is people that have this inability to go from

1284
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:11,560
being at the apex to living quote unquote, the normal life. You never really seem to, I mean,

1285
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:15,560
you went through something different, which we're going to talk about, which was now that you had

1286
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:20,440
more stillness around you. I think you were able to appreciate the depression. You were able to go

1287
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:25,160
back and confront some of the tragedy of your life that I don't think had been fully processed,

1288
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:31,400
but you also didn't have as much of this struggle, it seems with your identity being

1289
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:40,600
first and foremost, a driver. I think I felt like I denied my identity by being shoehorned into

1290
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:48,680
being a racing driver. I mean, I think I did the racing. I don't think I ever thought that that's

1291
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:55,240
who I was. You know, I knew I could do it and I liked doing it. And I felt strongly that I was

1292
01:54:55,240 --> 01:55:00,200
a very good driver and I could beat people and I gave it a hundred percent, but I just thought

1293
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:07,640
that's, that's only a small, your former one wants people to be a certain way. You know,

1294
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:14,120
they want particular types of heroes and, and I just thought, well, I'm maybe I'm not that person

1295
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:20,600
and I don't want to be what you want me to be. So I've got to be me and I want to go racing the way

1296
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:29,560
I go racing. And I gave a little bit, but I also perhaps was not cut out for that role. I don't

1297
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:35,560
know. Have any of the younger drivers ever come to you as they're ending that they're entering

1298
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:41,880
the twilight of their career and asked for advice or just wanted to talk about that transition?

1299
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:50,120
Not one, not one driver has come to me and go on. I want to be a former driver. What do we do?

1300
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:57,320
It's amazing. I mean, it is, it's almost not a conversation that never happens with racing

1301
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:03,640
drivers. They hardly ever speak to anyone else, any other racing driver about getting advice.

1302
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:09,320
It's not like tennis or golf or something like that where they have coaches. It's really peculiar.

1303
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:14,920
I was lucky I had my dad, you know, my dad when I was younger, so I kind of gleaned quite a lot

1304
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:21,480
of knowledge from him, but maybe it wasn't clarified because I was only very young, but

1305
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:27,800
I did ask drivers occasionally for a bit of advice. Got some help from James Hunt once. He

1306
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:34,040
just said, I think you're doing a good job. And that was really helpful. That made me feel great

1307
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:39,960
because I thought here's a guy who's, you know, respected, actually giving me some thoughts on

1308
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:44,440
what I, what he thought I was doing. I'm trying to rack my brain to see if I've got, I also didn't

1309
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:50,200
get advice as such, but I'd used to speak a little bit to Nikki louder and. Were you close to Nikki

1310
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:55,240
at all? Only a little tiny bit, not that close, but because he raced against my dad, I kind of

1311
01:56:55,240 --> 01:57:00,520
felt like he was cognizant of that side of my life, if you like. So a bit of a connection there.

1312
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:06,600
Jackie, of course, Jackie would give advice, but as far as other people coming to me and going,

1313
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:10,680
how do you do? I think, I think probably people looked at my career and thought they don't want

1314
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:18,040
to do it like the way I did it. So they don't ask for my advice. You wrote about how you weren't

1315
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:23,720
specific as to when this occurred after retirement. So I can't tell if it was two years after or 10

1316
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:29,320
years after, but you wrote about how you were on a family vacation somewhere and you were, you were

1317
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:33,320
sort of sitting there, I think just with Oliver and you, you, you wrote that you were frustrated,

1318
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:39,880
confused and angry. And then you had this moment of sort of clarity. And I don't know if you intended

1319
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:46,200
it to sound like a turning point, but it sounds like it was. I believe you were already in therapy

1320
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:51,400
at this point. You were already speaking with a therapist and you were already confronting

1321
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:58,120
your own depression. But what is it about that moment? I mean, depression is such a depressing

1322
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:03,720
word. People, you talk about depression, you can sense people go, oh, please don't talk about

1323
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:11,400
depression. And I, my comment on depression is depression is a way of telling us we're going

1324
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:19,000
the wrong direction. So it's a profound signaling, a running out of energy, an energy that is,

1325
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:24,920
is depleting. And it's actually starting to go the other way. It's actually starting to drag you

1326
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:32,440
down. And it's because it's trying to tell you something. You are sort of doing this to yourself.

1327
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:39,000
You actually need to reorientate your perspective on things. How do you do that? That's,

1328
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:43,880
that's easy to say. And as everyone, anyone who's had depression knows, someone can't say to you,

1329
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:48,600
just cheer up. It's the most useless advice one could give. Do not understand the meaning of

1330
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:52,920
depression. If anybody thinks that that's what it's about, it's almost like you've run out of

1331
01:58:52,920 --> 01:59:01,080
ideas completely. And it's not even the buffers. It's, it's the black hole, isn't it? So the abyss,

1332
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:07,480
I remember I did actually go and see Rothko exhibition tape modern, I think it was. And I

1333
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:12,680
was looking at one of his paintings and there's usual thing. There's, there's horizons.

1334
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:20,280
So they are literally horizons, aren't there? And one of them was a very sunny looking painting.

1335
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:25,640
So it had sort of like the sun above. And then as you went down, it went darker and darker until

1336
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:30,600
it went down. And I remember looking at this painting and just going, I don't want to go down

1337
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:36,200
there. And you felt like you were on a path to there or that there was some sort of pull, like

1338
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:42,440
you didn't make a change. That's where I think you mentioned identity. And I think that is

1339
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:49,560
fundamentally important. And I think that people who have had an overwhelmingly powerful parent,

1340
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:56,920
let's say they haven't fully evolved their own identity. They haven't had the chance.

1341
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:02,600
So I'm thinking, you know, your dad's famous. And then he dies. Who are you? Are you your dad's son?

1342
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:08,280
Are you? Who are you? He wasn't around long enough to kind of didn't manage to get to that

1343
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:14,360
point where I was confirmed as me. My mum and my dad were distracted. They had this career going on,

1344
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:21,720
his, his career going on. I think I didn't fully develop an identity. I knew I had somebody that

1345
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:28,120
people responded to and my friends when I went to school, but it wasn't a fully developed

1346
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:34,360
personality. It wasn't a real rounded thing. It was, it was sort of half cooked.

1347
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:44,760
And when I stopped racing, I just expressed something that I had. Maybe I was just, you know,

1348
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:49,320
play acting my dad. Those are the sort of questions you, I didn't really achieve it.

1349
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:57,160
So to be 40 years old and to be thinking those things has got to be somewhat jarring, right?

1350
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:00,680
Because you're sort of saying, wait a minute, who am I? Like I haven't figured this out right now.

1351
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:09,160
And what if I've spent the last 20 years pursuing something that wasn't really about me?

1352
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:13,400
No, exactly. And there was, there was definitely an agenda. Part of it was to

1353
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:21,560
reconstitute the life that we had before he got killed. So I managed to get us back.

1354
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:29,720
I used the word us, but of course my mum had lost her husband and my sisters lost their dad,

1355
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:39,480
but I had a family. But in a way, partly in my mind, it was if I restructured my family,

1356
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:44,360
then we'd restructured the family that was shattered, that was destroyed. So I'd rebuilt

1357
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:50,840
this thing. So there was this, it's a misplaced concept. It doesn't apply because it's not,

1358
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:55,960
you can't put back together the family that died. My dad's not going to come back. And so

1359
02:01:56,600 --> 02:02:02,520
my kids were growing up. I was thinking all the time, well, I would have done anything to have

1360
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:06,920
had my dad back, but they had their dad. They didn't know what that was all about.

1361
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:12,680
Did you ever feel at some point that you had an obligation to them to figure this out because the

1362
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:18,920
irony of it was you lost your dad because he actually died. But if you didn't figure this out,

1363
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:23,560
your kids were going to lose their dad, not because he's physically dead, but because he's

1364
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:28,120
emotionally absent or emotionally dead and for lack of, you know, at the risk of sounding too

1365
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:34,200
dramatic. Well, and I think the more you dig in there, the more you realize that your parents'

1366
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:40,680
relationship was not as ideal as it should have been. And when you're younger, you idealize them

1367
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:45,640
and everything's wonderful when clearly it wasn't. And what you don't want to do-

1368
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:47,400
Did you ever talk to your mom about this?

1369
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:54,120
Yeah, I did actually go and start to talk to my mom about her relationship with her husband,

1370
02:02:54,120 --> 02:03:01,800
but she was quite defensive. Not defensive, but she had created explanations for

1371
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:11,640
her relationship with her husband and they'd had difficulties. But then if I started to

1372
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:14,200
criticize him, then she would suddenly come to his defense.

1373
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:18,760
And do you think part of that is just her stoic nature? You know, you write stories about her

1374
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:23,880
upbringing. I mean, you know, she almost died during the war. And then on top of that, she's

1375
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:29,080
standing there as one of the wives during the most dangerous era in the history of this sport, where

1376
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:34,840
at a one in three chance, your spouse is going to die over the course of their career.

1377
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:40,680
And they're saying all the time, this is a noble thing to be doing. Well, was it? Really? You know,

1378
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:46,280
was it that noble when you got family and stuff to, is it really that admirable that you're

1379
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:52,680
putting all that at risk? And of course, the irony is because he retired, he was home and dry.

1380
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:55,160
Yeah, he retired about six months before this crash.

1381
02:03:55,160 --> 02:04:01,480
Yeah, he was 46. He stopped. He had this team that he was developing. So everybody thought,

1382
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,320
everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Oh, he's in the-

1383
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:04,200
He dodged the bullet.

1384
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:10,200
He dodged the bullet and bang, six months later, it got even worse than anyone could

1385
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:18,440
have imagined. It wasn't just him, it was his young protege driver, team designer, team principal,

1386
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:27,720
the chief mechanic, engineer, all gone. And one big catastrophic bomb. And makes you go through

1387
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:35,160
life slightly. You're never quite sure what's around the corner. That's the horrible thing.

1388
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:45,480
If you knew in, call it 1985, right? So you're 25 years old. If you knew then what you know today,

1389
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:51,480
or if you could go back and talk to that guy then, but as yourself now,

1390
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:56,120
what would you tell the 25 year old version of yourself now?

1391
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:08,120
I would try and dispel from him a lot of erroneous notions about how the world works and

1392
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:16,120
who really cares about what you think and what you do. And I would say, just don't waste a lot

1393
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:21,640
of energy thinking about those things or trying to make an impression on people because you think

1394
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:27,960
that would help you. It doesn't work like that. You know, you just don't worry about that. If you

1395
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:33,320
got a job to do, do the job. If you do it well and you do it better than other people, then

1396
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:41,080
that will work. That will help you focus on what your things you can do, not on the things you can't

1397
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:46,520
do anything about and don't waste a lot of energy worrying about them. I probably would say that.

1398
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:54,360
And I'd also say, enjoy it. Just, you know, don't put yourself through torture

1399
02:05:55,720 --> 02:06:04,040
because you think this is something that means a lot. It does. You know, we're going around in

1400
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:09,480
circles, chasing each other and trying to come first. That's all it is.

1401
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:15,800
Yeah, it's interesting, right? You talked earlier about the nobility of this sport in the 60s and

1402
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:21,320
70s when it was basically the most, you know, dangerous thing you could have done.

1403
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:26,920
It was almost pornographic. Some people actually, I think, looked at from the one and were put off.

1404
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:33,960
They thought it's a disgusting thing. And now I can see that, that I can understand why they

1405
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:40,760
felt that way. I think that anybody in the sport at the time, or even today, we like to embellish

1406
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,360
it and make it seem like it's such a wonderful thing. And it is, it's impressive. It's incredibly

1407
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:53,320
impressive, but let's not get it too far out of context. You know, it's just a lifestyle choice

1408
02:06:53,320 --> 02:07:01,400
for a lot of people. And it's a show of brilliance in certain fields, but it's not going to really

1409
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:07,560
change the world for the better. A few people's weekends get a lot better or a lot worse.

1410
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:12,680
But do you think that there are benefits from Formula One, for example, in terms of advancing

1411
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:15,880
safety, technical achievements of vehicles?

1412
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:20,920
I think what Formula One does brilliantly is that it shows people if there's an issue or there's a

1413
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:27,720
problem, they can solve it. They're absolutely brilliant at not stopping when there is a

1414
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:32,200
challenge. They go, where's the challenge? We can't think, well, we'll do it. We'll find a way

1415
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:35,320
around it. We'll do it. That's the impressive thing about Formula One.

1416
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:42,040
I mean, Max Mosley, do you remember a couple of days after the Senna crash? He was very recently

1417
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:46,520
had become the president, but I remember this press conference and he said, you know, I think very

1418
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:53,240
aptly, the question isn't why did Senna crash? Although that's all anybody wanted to talk about.

1419
02:07:53,240 --> 02:08:00,840
The question is, why did he die? Because the reality of it is, if you took a hundred drivers

1420
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:06,520
in the exact same crash, 99 of them probably would have lived. It was a very fluky death.

1421
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:12,840
Fluky. And also the thing to consider is that, just to explain, people didn't understand there

1422
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:17,800
was a part of the suspension that penetrated his crash helmet and the force needed to do that

1423
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:24,520
wasn't that great. If he'd crashed at a very slow speed and the suspension had happened to come

1424
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:29,240
back, then we've all been in crashes like that. You know, guys, we've all crashed, you know,

1425
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:33,080
even in Formula Ford, you've got suspension arms and wheels flying all over the place.

1426
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:36,840
You don't have to be going that fast. Can you imagine just throwing a wheel at you at

1427
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:46,600
20 miles now? It's going to go through your head. Yeah. So that to me was the big step forward

1428
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:54,200
in Formula One safety, which is, yeah, there are probably just as many crashes today as there were

1429
02:08:54,200 --> 02:09:00,520
in the previous generation, but people aren't supposed to die. There's an amazing place where

1430
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:07,080
Formula One really did step up. And I think made that difference. So I don't know. I think you're.

1431
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:15,560
Then we back into that loop of when you take away the risk, do we appreciate the

1432
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:21,080
skill and the. Yeah. So do you think the pendulum has swung too far today?

1433
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:27,480
Well, you know, I don't know how you want. So I just, I.

1434
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:29,800
Cause you don't want to say there should be more risk.

1435
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:36,840
No, you don't. Well, there's a guy who constantly reminds me, he's an engineer, that there's a

1436
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:41,560
difference between hazard and risk. So the hazard is what can happen. And the risk is the

1437
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:46,360
potential of that happening. So the chance of that happening. So, you know, the chances of being

1438
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:51,480
hit on the head by a flying wheel are slim because not that many people have been killed

1439
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:58,760
despite all the flying wheels in motorsport yet. Well, we can name two, three people who've been

1440
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:05,480
killed by that just now they brought in the halo. So we believe we have eliminated the hazard.

1441
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:11,160
The chances produced, I suppose, because it's got to somehow get through the

1442
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:19,800
the halo. So we've taken away one of the hazards to someone being hurt. That's got to be a good

1443
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:25,800
thing. So we have to then replace the challenge or if we've taken away some of the challenge of the

1444
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:30,600
sport, then we need to find a way to introduce other challenges that will be appreciated.

1445
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:36,040
Whether that's, I don't know, giving the cars more power or, you know, more difficult to drive,

1446
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:40,280
or if it looks easy and it's too easy, then nobody cares. You know, they're not going to,

1447
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:45,400
they're not going to be watching. You mentioned how after you retired, you didn't even watch

1448
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,440
the next decade of racing. I mean, when Schumacher was, yeah, you knew what was happening. I knew

1449
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:56,040
what the result was going to be. So he just cleaned up, didn't he, for about five years.

1450
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:04,040
And I actually, I was at a low point with regard to the way the sport was run at that point too.

1451
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:07,560
Nothing personal against Michael, but I just thought this is,

1452
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:14,120
this is putting on a show for the benefit of just one person and a team. And I just didn't see it.

1453
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:21,240
That's what people wanted. I mean, unless you're a German, you know, or Italian, I suppose.

1454
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:27,960
Yeah. You also said something that really got my attention. I'm writing a book right now. And in

1455
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:33,960
this book, I talk about this practice of going to funerals. And, you know, it's funny because you

1456
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:38,040
had talked about how much you did not want to go to Senna's funeral, which makes all the sense in

1457
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:42,920
the world. But in the last couple of years, I've come to find funerals to be an amazing

1458
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:51,240
grounding experience and a reminder of for any individual, how insignificant we are, you know,

1459
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:56,520
like I've never been to a funeral yet where the earth stopped turning on its axis. So that gives

1460
02:11:56,520 --> 02:12:02,920
me pretty good confidence that there is no one of us who's so special or so relevant, that somehow

1461
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:08,760
our departure from this planet will change the rotational force of the earth. It'll change it for

1462
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:16,280
us. Exactly. Only for us. Yeah. And more importantly, to be a little less glib about it,

1463
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:20,920
it focuses you on sort of what matters because it's what people are talking about at the funeral

1464
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:26,280
that probably matters more. They tend to talk more about the type of person you were than what your

1465
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:31,480
achievements were. It's much more about maybe what kind of a mother you were than what kind of a

1466
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:37,800
lawyer you were. And I could help it notice this line in your book that is literally just,

1467
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:44,920
it's one sentence and it almost goes unnoticed, which is that you found yourself reading obituaries

1468
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:51,800
a lot and not of anyone famous, of people you didn't know. Tell me a little bit more about that.

1469
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:55,640
That comes back a little bit to what I was saying about applauding and celebrating

1470
02:12:55,720 --> 02:13:01,560
people in public eye who've done stuff. And you read other lives of people I'd never heard of,

1471
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:05,480
but maybe in their own career and their own field, they're well known. But you see, yeah,

1472
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:09,880
it's just, it's unbelievable the kind of lives people have and the things they do,

1473
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:14,840
modest people do extraordinary things. I remember there was a guy who was a kind of diplomat who

1474
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:19,640
managed to stop a revolution just by going up and standing in front of the guy who was leading them,

1475
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:26,120
you know, just some insignificant apparently looking guy would do something extraordinary,

1476
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:33,720
all women. And it's those stories, which I think are profoundly moving because you don't know who

1477
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:37,560
these people are, they're out there now. And you might meet them and you don't know what they're

1478
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:43,480
capable of doing in an extraordinary situation. They could be the people who suddenly do something

1479
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:49,320
really, you might have just passed them by every day of their lives. They've people of

1480
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:53,640
dismissed them as being ineffectual and they'll do something really remarkable.

1481
02:13:53,640 --> 02:14:00,120
Now, how has that insight helped you in your journey?

1482
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:11,720
I think it's made me wonder whether I'm one of those people or not. I'd still,

1483
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:18,280
I shudder to think that something might happen. I might have to kind of

1484
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:22,120
make a decision as to whether I go in a burning building or not, you know,

1485
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:26,920
but there are people who do that without even batting an eyelid. You know, you just think,

1486
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:34,520
just being a racing driver, is it that brave? It's like, I'm enjoying what I'm doing as well,

1487
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:40,360
you know, and people's capacity is well for work. I mean, some people's, they're just unbelievable.

1488
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:47,480
They can pull off in one lifetime. So human beings are extraordinary creatures. That's the right word.

1489
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:53,720
And I like learning more and more about them. I like more learning more about what we're capable

1490
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:59,960
of and what some people are capable of. I know I have my limitations, but I'm still in awe of

1491
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:07,240
people are skilled or people are educated in all kinds of ways and are able to make things happen

1492
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:11,880
as well. Some people have an amazing ability to get things done. I mean, whether it's Elon Musk or,

1493
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:19,000
you know, that guy who's doing the ocean cleanup thing, you know, it's amazing. Some people just

1494
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:25,000
have this ability to, I'm absolutely rubbish at making anything happen. I don't know why.

1495
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:31,000
I try to come up with an idea and I can't seem to get it to take hold. And then probably because

1496
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:36,760
I doubt whether it's any worthwhile. Do you think your kids would say that you've been rubbish at

1497
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:41,080
being a dad or do you think your kids would say that, I remember one of the things you talk about,

1498
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:44,840
I don't think it was in this book. It might've been in, I don't remember, maybe it was in this

1499
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:50,680
book, but you talk about how upon retiring, the thing you look forward to most was taking them

1500
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:57,480
to school. You know, this idea, which again, that struck me as a little odd because I have to,

1501
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:01,480
you know, we can't help but read the stories of other people and put ourselves in them.

1502
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:07,560
That's the nature. I think of what we do is we are so self-centered as individuals. We always tend to

1503
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:13,480
extrapolate through our own lens. And I just, there's a part of me that feels really sorry

1504
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:19,880
for someone to be at the pinnacle of a sport as an example, and then have to retire. And there's a

1505
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:23,640
part of me that thinks, God, that must be awful. Like at least I don't know what it's like to be

1506
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:30,760
great. You know? So there's joy in mediocrity because I can't imagine what it would be like

1507
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:38,440
to be the best in the world at something and then to be off that stage. And I guess I was just sort

1508
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:45,160
of pleased for you that even though I knew, because I know how the story unfolds, that there is this

1509
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:51,320
huge journey you have to go through. I thought, how much better is it that at least you have this,

1510
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:57,080
you have these four kids that mean so much to you? The world can completely change with one

1511
02:16:57,160 --> 02:17:04,520
generation. And it's all about how we nurture our children and what we advise them in and the

1512
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:10,680
opportunities we give to them. It would only take one generation of people who didn't want to kill

1513
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:16,040
anything or anyone. Isn't that kind of amazing when you think about that? That your children and

1514
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:23,080
your father are separated by only one generation and yet there's very little in common in their

1515
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:30,360
experiences. Yeah. Well, it's extraordinary the amount of change that's been in the world

1516
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:33,800
in those two lifetimes. I mean, do your kids ask about their grandfather much?

1517
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:39,640
I think a little bit. Yeah. I think they know about him, but I don't think they, maybe in time,

1518
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:45,080
but I don't think they let it rule their lives, which is the Graham Hill was a huge thing in our

1519
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:49,640
lives. All of our, apart from me and my elder sister, but not so much my younger sister, but

1520
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:55,320
his absence was a big thing in her life. But for our lives, it was all about this thing called

1521
02:17:55,320 --> 02:18:01,320
Graham Hill, which was a kind of concept which over touched everything you did.

1522
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:08,680
You borrow a quote from Lincoln. Really? Yeah. Well, so I believe it was Lincoln who originally

1523
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:15,400
said, if you have six hours to chop down a tree, was it him? Was it? You spend four of them

1524
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:20,280
sharpening your ax. Yeah. You basically paraphrase that as if you had 10 years to chop down a tree,

1525
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:25,160
you spend nine of them sharpening your ax. Yeah. The way I read that is that it took a while for

1526
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:29,000
you to put this book together. You had to really, you had to sort a lot of things out before you

1527
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:34,760
could write this story. That's right. I couldn't really put pen to paper before that until I

1528
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:43,480
felt like I knew I had a foundation or something I can write it on because I was all over the place

1529
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:50,360
with my ideas, my thoughts about things. I used to think, I used to listen to programs on

1530
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:58,360
Radio 4 about philosophy and mathematics and stuff that comes into your head like

1531
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:06,360
Godel's theory of incompleteness and Wittgenstein's where of we cannot speak there or we must remain

1532
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:12,680
silent. I mean, these things are very profound. You can only have its being or nothingness,

1533
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:18,600
which is Sartre's argument. They either is something or there isn't. How do you get

1534
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:24,680
something out of nothing? And those sorts of thoughts. And it would be, for me, I had to

1535
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:33,000
get some sort of bloody answers from somewhere. And then you realize that they spent an awful

1536
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,800
lot of time and energy trying to work them out and they were probably a lot smarter than me and

1537
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:40,520
they didn't get an answer, did they? They didn't get an answer. Nobody got an answer.

1538
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:45,240
Tell me who's got the answer, Peter. Maybe you're the man.

1539
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:52,760
No, well, I definitely don't have the answers, but I think I'm just really impressed with the

1540
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:56,360
journey. It's this journey you've been on that is really amazing.

1541
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:01,960
It's a journey that is well-worn. It's a journey that men and women, I keep saying, and women,

1542
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:10,120
all of us humans have been making for thousands of years. We've all asked that everybody's gone

1543
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:18,360
through or in every epoch, they've been wanting to know these answers. And it's natural to want

1544
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:26,360
to know those answers. And I think it's, you hear the writings and the philosophies of ancient

1545
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:33,480
civilizations, they're all fascinating and have some kernel of truth in them that somehow got

1546
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:39,560
appreciated by another group of people somewhere else without the influence of Western civilization

1547
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:45,640
or something like that. It's something that is eternal and something which is profoundly

1548
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:51,320
compelling about being a human being. I mean, I was going to mention something. So here's something,

1549
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:57,800
when I was quite depressed, I had a tree that was given to me. A tree which was given to me for my

1550
02:20:57,800 --> 02:21:05,880
40th birthday by a famous rock band person who couldn't make it to my party. And it was a piece

1551
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:11,320
tree. It was an olive tree. So I had this olive tree, which I kind of treasured and I thought,

1552
02:21:11,320 --> 02:21:16,600
I really must plant this tree and get it watered at some point. And it got attacked by aphids or

1553
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:22,840
some sort of bug. So I spent ages picking these bugs off the thing. I didn't want it to kill the

1554
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:30,680
tree, but I was killing the bugs. So I'm thinking, hang on, what do I do? Do I let them kill the

1555
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:37,000
tree? Do I kill the bugs? Do I leave it? Do I leave it be? Do I not have any involvement? What is my

1556
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:46,280
purpose here? What should I be doing? That's the kind of stuff that stops you in your tracks when

1557
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:56,120
you're heavily in those mindsets. You kind of get caught between those unresolvable questions.

1558
02:21:57,080 --> 02:22:00,680
Maybe I should just chuck the whole thing in the skip, but you don't.

1559
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:05,960
I think you're special in the sense that I don't think enough people spend time thinking about

1560
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:14,760
these things. I mean, I think these are the human questions and it's really easy to just not think

1561
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:22,120
about them. It's really easy to live a life that is unexamined. I don't think I examine my life as

1562
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:27,320
closely as I can because quite frankly, it's not comfortable. I would say, Peter, I think I don't

1563
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:32,680
do it as much as I used to. I actually now have got to the point where I go, I think that's an

1564
02:22:32,680 --> 02:22:39,000
unanswerable one. I think we'll just let that one go. And actually, it's liberating in that sense.

1565
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:45,880
I don't have to stop everything until I've got an answer to that. When you look at that same

1566
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:51,800
painting today, the painting that starts with the sun and it gets darker and darker as you go down,

1567
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:57,240
the painting that once made you think, I don't want to go any lower. Where do you see yourself

1568
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:02,520
on that painting? I'm in the sunny bit. I don't feel like I'm going to slip into that abyss.

1569
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:09,720
I think that the abyss was a complete loss of identity. I think the abyss is no identity.

1570
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:14,520
I think when you have questions about your identity and you don't know who you are. On that

1571
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:20,520
point, I would say what I've also realized is that identity is very much a compound of

1572
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:25,320
your relationship to others. And this is where it becomes,

1573
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:34,520
I think it becomes a healing thing when you recognize that who you are is what you are

1574
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:39,160
to other people as well as who you want to be for yourself.

1575
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:44,200
Yeah. Well, that's very well said. I'm not sure I could add anything to that.

1576
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:50,600
Damon, I have really enjoyed this discussion. I've wanted to speak with you for such a long time.

1577
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:55,800
And I don't remember what the first thing was that made me reach out to Luke, who was obviously who

1578
02:23:55,800 --> 02:24:00,600
introduced us and say, Hey, if there's any chance you think Damon would be willing to speak, I'd

1579
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:05,240
love it if you'd make that introduction. And I wish I could remember what it was, but I read

1580
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:10,600
something that you wrote or saw something you said in an interview. And I thought, this is a person

1581
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:18,200
who is going to have a unique perspective on a human condition. I think everything that we've

1582
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:22,920
talked about today, I think emphasizes that. And I'm really grateful for it. And I think that

1583
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:27,560
I can't stress enough to people listening to this that you don't have to be a motorsport fan to

1584
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:34,440
enjoy your autobiography. I think it's a great story about overcoming loss. I think it's a great

1585
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:40,200
story about struggling with one's identity. And I think anybody that reads it's going to get

1586
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:45,320
something out of it special. So I thank you for writing it because it doesn't strike me as a book

1587
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:50,440
that was easy to write. It was under a lot of pressure, but I think it sort of eventually

1588
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:57,800
unfolded very surprisingly to me. I think I'm a believer in things coming to fruition and then

1589
02:24:57,800 --> 02:25:02,280
there's the right time for things. And I do want to say thank you very much indeed for your kind

1590
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:10,680
words about the book and compliments. And I'm not uncomfortable in receiving your praise

1591
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:19,000
because it's lovely to actually recognize that it's communicating, isn't it? And I think that

1592
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,280
someone is connecting to your communication like that. And that's very satisfying,

1593
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:28,840
very fulfilling. So thank you very much. My pleasure. And thank you for everything.

1594
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:30,200
Thanks for being here. Thank you.
