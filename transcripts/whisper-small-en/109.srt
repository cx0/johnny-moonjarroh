00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,880
today's episode. I guess this week is John Dudley. Before I tell you a little bit about who John is,

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,880
because I suspect many of you won't recognize his name, maybe a little reminder about one of

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,800
my obsessions being Archery. Probably talked about it quite a bit on the podcast to get a

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,880
better sense of why I love Archery so much and why I think it's an amazing model system for life.

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:16,000
I think you'll enjoy this podcast. Now, John is someone who from the day I got involved in

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,920
Archery, I was very fortunate to be introduced to in terms of his work. It would be another couple

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
of years before I would meet him. He is a professional Archer. He's the host of what

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,040
I consider hands down, no ifs, ands, or buts, the absolute best content on all of Archery,

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,520
including podcasting, TV, et cetera. So the knock on TV station on YouTube, the knock on podcast,

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:48,240
his ability to teach Archery and do Archery provide the rarest and smallest eclipse I've

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,760
ever seen in performance, which is to say it's very rare that someone who is the top 0.01% of

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:03,560
a performance is also at the top 0.01% of the ability to teach, distill, and communicate that.

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,600
And somehow John manages to do that. Now, I could bore you to tears with all of his accolades. He

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,000
represented the US Archery team for many years. He's won more medals than I can count representing

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,520
Team USA. He was the rookie of the year as a professional national champion, multiple time

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,680
national champion, European Grand Prix, gold medalist, British national indoor champion, et cetera.

25
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,480
Honestly, it's just, I'll turn most of you off by reading this because this introduction will be

26
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,440
even longer than it probably is already slated to be. I was introduced to John through Joe Rogan.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,040
When I was on Joe Rogan's podcast a couple of years ago, I let Joe know just how much of a huge fan

28
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,240
I was and Joe was just kind enough to introduce us. And I had the real privilege of getting to

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,800
spend a bunch of time in person with John. So in this episode, we don't go too deep into how I got

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,920
started in archery and how I fell in love with it and how even though when I started, I had

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,720
absolutely zero intention of hunting and how over time that changed. And now I view hunting and

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,200
archery as the two beautiful bookends of this incredible continuum. John had already interviewed

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,880
me for his podcast. And so we'll simply link to some of the highlights from his podcast interviewing

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,800
me where I get into a lot of that stuff. Obviously I wanted to focus on John and his story. And so in

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,440
this episode, we talk a lot about John and his athletic background and how he made what can only

36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,520
be described as one of the craziest decisions in the history of a collegiate athlete, which is to

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,520
turn down a division one football scholarship one week into school and go and work at an archery

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,320
store for $4.10 an hour building arrows. And that's exactly what he did. We talk a lot about

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,520
life in a sense as well, because a lot of John's personality comes across in this and you get a

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,840
sense of sort of his philosophy on life, which, you know, frankly, I just find wonderful. I love

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,960
being around John, his family, and we can go back and forth between talking about these things in

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,360
life and then talking about these things in archery and how amazingly they seem to converge.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,640
So what it is that we're talking about in terms of technically improving something seems to then

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,720
converge on what the application is in life. So the last thing I'll say is we asked John to help

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,160
us curate a list of content from his unbelievable curriculum, such that if any of you listen to this

46
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
and come away thinking, you know, gosh, to listen to these two coconuts talking about archery for

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,800
so long, I at least want to give this thing a try. You will get all you need from John's content,

48
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,440
but we thought we'd simplify it a little bit by curating a step-by-step set of videos that he's

49
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,720
put together that will make it easier than trying to probably navigate from all of his content. So

50
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with John Dudley.

51
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:59,360
John, it's a little bittersweet that we are at the end of our archery camp here together.

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,520
I know that bonfire you have over there is big enough to either burn Darth Vader or start the

53
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,680
new Braveheart movie. I mean, seriously. If the listener is wondering what the context is here,

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,200
when John interviewed me, he spent, I don't know, at least a full minute griping about the fact that

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,360
I reneged on my offer to light a fire. So tonight I was like, well, I'm not going to be outdone. So

56
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:34,080
there is a fire burning that you can maybe hear through this mic. It's a little hotter than I

57
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,080
planned. If on August 8th, you hear there's a wildfire lighting across Southern California,

58
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,160
there's a good chance it started on this big fire pit of Peters in his backyard.

59
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,480
Well, look, man, it is a real pleasure to be sitting here talking with you. And I've been,

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,720
we talked about this over dinner the other day that I've been thinking so much about how to

61
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
convey to an audience that is obviously very interested in performance and health and

62
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,160
longevity, how two of the biggest interests in my life kind of come to this intersection

63
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
with one of them being archery. And there's probably nobody that's listened to this podcast

64
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,160
that hasn't figured out by this point how much I love archery. Certainly anybody who's ever

65
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,560
taken the time to follow me on social media will notice that probably maybe a quarter of the things

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,840
I post are photos that have something to do with that. So in the introduction briefly, I already

67
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,000
kind of explained a little bit about who you are, but that just doesn't do it justice. And I try to

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,040
keep the intro relatively short so that the listener can hear in sort of your own words what

69
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,720
it is, but take me back to kind of maybe some basics, right? So what does it mean to be a

70
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
professional archer? I think most people understand what it means to be a professional baseball player

71
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,400
because you turn on TV and you see people playing baseball. But what does it mean to say,

72
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,160
John Dudley turned pro as an archer in this year and for the next X years did A, B and C?

73
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,920
In the big picture, it means nothing. That's the reality. I realize I'm fortunate that there's

74
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,080
light being shed on archery right now because this was this small thing that if, what was it,

75
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,280
ESPN, the Ocho? Like in dodgeball? Archery would probably be on that if that was real. But I started

76
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,600
out learning to bow hunt from family and it was just part of the culture coming from the deep

77
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,640
south. You grew up in Mississippi, right? Yeah. I was born on Fort Bragg, grew up in Mississippi for

78
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,400
a while, then moved up to the Midwest. And I learned archery, I think when I was nine.

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,480
First bow hunt was when I was 10. And I don't know, looking back, there's been a lot of times

80
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:47,120
where I've tried to decide why I really liked it. And a good friend of mine, who is a former Navy

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,720
SEAL, retired, Andy Stump, there was this time someone was asking me the same question. And

82
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,040
sometimes I struggle with why I really loved bow hunting and archery. And he just looked at me and

83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,520
goes, have you not figured it out by now? He's like, it's all over your personality. And I said,

84
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,880
no, why? And he goes, because it's hard. He goes, that is why you do it. Because there's days where

85
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,080
you're good at it. And there's days when you're not. And he's right. There are several different

86
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,040
points in my career where I took different steps because in my career, started out learning to shoot

87
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,080
a bow, bow hunting, not being good at it, wanting to be better at it, deciding to start shooting some

88
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,120
target archery because I wanted to be a better bow hunter, realizing I sucked as a target archer,

89
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,480
wanting to be better at that, becoming better at that, then becoming a better bow hunter, then

90
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,960
kind of getting a little bit bored in the one aspect of competitive archery I was in. So I

91
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,160
jumped into another field that was a different types of targets, different distances,

92
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,840
different types of competition, did that until I kind of got complacent again. And then kind of,

93
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,440
I just every time, I don't know, I like to jump into something that challenges me. And archery

94
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,680
is one of those things where I think golfers understand that there's days where you go out

95
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,920
and you play and you feel like you feel like you had the perfect game. You feel like the next day,

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
if you go out and play another nine, you're going to do the same thing. But then all of a sudden you

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:26,320
realize, no, if everything's not clicking, I can't just do this continually. So I just have made a

98
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,200
career out of being poor at a certain aspect of it and making an omission to become good at that.

99
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:43,440
And then over the course of 33 years, I've got to the point where now I feel like I have a very good

100
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,240
understanding of the game. And I've learned a lot from a lot of mistakes. I mean, that's kind of the

101
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,720
truth of it. Well, we're going to come back to kind of a lot of the things you've learned and more

102
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,120
importantly, how you've figured out a way to teach them. But you've glossed over some things that I

103
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,640
know a lot of detail about. And I think for listeners, it will be interesting to understand

104
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,200
that. So this is the first time I've ever recorded a podcast outside. And that just me, or is there

105
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,400
like some loud airplane that's kind of... Yeah, there's an airplane man. We're outside. I know,

106
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,000
but normally I don't hear them that loud in my backyard. I don't know. I guess I don't have the

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,800
microphone normally. Yeah. It's called a microphone. It amplifies sound. We're podcasting, but we're

108
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,320
thoroughly enjoying each other's friendship. We're out here. We're drinking a protein shake that

109
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,280
hopefully your monitor gives you some kind of data that you can satisfy your listeners with.

110
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,640
Meanwhile, I've also got wine on the backup. So this is real. We're drinking Jaco's Mulch

111
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,440
and Clio wine. And everybody always wants to ask me what my favorite wine is. And this is 2012

112
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,320
bottle of Clio. Yeah, I was familiar with it. So you were an All-American and you lettered in

113
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,280
12 sports. I mean, some of the athletic stories that when you were in high school, and you're a

114
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,600
big guy. So for listeners that maybe don't know, you look like you're six foot five, kind of a wall

115
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,640
of muscle. You told me a story about a high school combine that just blew my mind where,

116
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,080
tell the story of what the coach said to all of you prospecting quarterbacks that were trying to

117
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,440
get division one scholarships. Yeah. It was at U of I, I was at a camp there that the fighting

118
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,440
a line I were putting on and I went there by myself. My team wasn't with me. It was a kind

119
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,440
of a thing where there's quite a few recruits that were all brought in there. And I remember

120
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,680
Greg Landry was there as the quarterback coach. And during that first day, there was a ton of

121
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:41,600
people down. I think we were either on the five yard line or somewhere in there. And it was the

122
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,560
first day of camp. And obviously the first day of camp, a lot of guys are jacking around as it

123
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,600
starts. And the coaches kind of gathered everybody up and he goes into this serious moment where he's

124
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
saying, we're here to look at all you, we're here to teach you, but you're here to learn,

125
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,680
but you're also here to put on your best in front of some big coaches. And he said,

126
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,840
a lot of these coaches are only going to look at you one time. And just like in any big game,

127
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,080
sometimes you only have one time to shine. And what you do with that one moment is going to

128
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,240
define what you get out of this camp. It's kind of that type of thing. And he was talking about it

129
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,520
and everything. And I was paying attention and sitting on the, I think I took one knee. I actually

130
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,240
have a picture, but it's on a little microfiche. I should try to get it and see if we can blow it

131
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,360
up. I'm pretty sure I had like a play band on my wrist and he just kind of looked over at me

132
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,080
randomly and he grabbed the ball and he just threw it underhand and he's like, you, what are you going

133
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,680
to do with your moment? And so I did all I knew how to do, which was a huck of football. So I just

134
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,160
stood up and took about two or three steps and just heaved this ball from, it was about from the

135
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,880
nine yard line and landed it in the end zone on the other side. And I just said, I throw footballs.

136
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,280
And he's just like, that was perfect. Sit down. And he just looked over at the other guys like,

137
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,520
what are you going to do with yours? And then later on they came up to me and they said,

138
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,280
what else can you do? And you know, you got quite an arm. How do you throw like that? And

139
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I always had insomnia. I've always had that. I've struggled to sleep. I've always really enjoyed

140
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,400
training. And if I can't sleep to me, I don't know, it feels like I've given myself a reason

141
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,800
to get out of bed if I go and do something. So, and it's been that way with archery. A lot of

142
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,960
times if you watch my bow builds, I'm building it crazy times in the morning because I can't

143
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,480
sleep. So I get up and I'll just start, put a record on and I'll just start building a custom

144
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,280
bow for someone and I'll do that. But back then my coach had gave me a key to get into the gym.

145
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,480
I would pull the laundry baskets out of the washer room and I would put laundry baskets

146
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,440
and opposite ends of the gym. And I would just throw footballs. I had a bag of footballs. When

147
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,800
I was a junior, my coach gave me a whole bag of footballs and I had them in the trunk of my car

148
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,680
all the time. And I would just do three step drops, throw it in the laundry basket, three step. And

149
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,240
then when that laundry basket had all the balls, I'd go over and do the other one. And then outside,

150
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,760
it was always, they're called black routes, but it was a black right route was like in my,

151
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,320
when I'd be under the center, if I ever called an audible, if I ever called black, it would be a 73

152
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,080
pattern, which is just pretty much a flare pattern. So it was a quick three step drop to outside

153
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,720
shoulder. So I would always go to the 20 yard line, put the garbage cans from the football field in

154
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,760
the corner. And I would go out there and just throw footballs, do three step drops, throw footballs

155
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,600
and garbage cans. That's just what I did. So all that stuff led up to that moment of he's like,

156
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,480
here's your moment. What are you going to do with it? I'm going to throw a football.

157
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
And so fast forwarding a little bit, you end up getting a division one scholarship to play

158
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,920
football, which is, I'm sure your parents are just over the moon overjoyed.

159
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,840
It was a little bit different. I remember the first school that recruited me was Ball State.

160
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,600
And me and my mom went there. My parents were divorced at that time. My mom was, I think I was

161
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,160
a sophomore and I really had no idea what the heck we were even doing. We went to Ball State and then

162
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,120
a lot of different things came in, but I decided that I really wanted to go to a Carolina school

163
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,520
because my dad was from Fort Bragg. My uncle was a pilot at the time. He was in Greenville,

164
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,600
Spartanburg. Most of the Dudley's were all from that part of the area. So I really wanted to go

165
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,160
there. And honestly, I really liked Western Carolina. Their offense was really, really similar.

166
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,640
I had choices, but that was really where I wanted to go. And I think if you would have asked any of

167
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,560
my family members what I was going to do, they were going to tell you I was going to play football.

168
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,240
I didn't care anything about school other than the fact it allowed me to play sports. And I played

169
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,680
sports all the time. I mean, every single semester in school, I was in a sport. It didn't

170
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,200
matter. I ran track, did basketball, did football, played tennis. It didn't matter. All I wanted to

171
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,520
do is I just wanted to play. I loved it. I loved camps too. When my parents got divorced, my mom

172
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,200
traveled a lot. She worked for Baxter Healthcare. I told you that. And she traveled a lot because

173
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,360
she was overseeing plants in Malaysia and Singapore and Puerto Rico. So she traveled a ton. So she

174
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,280
left an open checkbook in her house. And she just said, if I'm not home, just don't get in trouble.

175
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,160
Do something productive. So I just took that checkbook and signed up for every single football

176
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,160
camp I could. And I was traveling to football camps without my teams. I was just going,

177
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,520
going and being a guy without a team, just sitting there. And I loved having coaches around me.

178
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Honestly, I performed. I liked having people yell at me. I liked having a very specific purpose.

179
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,800
Like you're getting up, we're doing this from seven to nine. Then you get a breakfast. Then

180
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,840
we're going to go out and we're going to freaking run for two hours. Like I just love that. It was

181
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:23,120
awesome. And so the archery thing just blindsided me because during this whole time,

182
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,520
during all this high school sport part of my life, which when I first went into high school,

183
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,080
I had no business thinking I was going to be a good athlete because I was very skinny. I was tall.

184
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,920
My dad told me, I was like, he goes, when you ran up and down the basketball court, I always was

185
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,360
afraid of you tripping because I thought it'd be like a chandelier hit in the ground. I was skin and

186
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,040
bones. I worked hard and I grew into it. But during that time, I didn't get to shoot archery

187
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:58,240
very much. I liked it. I was fairly good at it. I would make gas money going to parties and

188
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,440
shooting. I would put eggs on the top of two liter pop bottles and I would shoot them off

189
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
these pop bottles at 40 yards. And I'd just, I'd be like, you think I can hit that? And people

190
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,880
like you can't hit that. And then I'd bet me five bucks and I would make gas money at parties.

191
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,800
I didn't drink. I drank one time when I was 10 or 11. And then I got really sick off of it and

192
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,920
just said, I'm never going to drink again. And I didn't drink until my twenties. So I would go to

193
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,800
the parties because I loved, and I would have parties, but I just, I wouldn't be the partier.

194
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,840
I would be there and I'd kind of take money off my drunk friends. And yeah, it's sort of fun.

195
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,320
The first time in my life I ever got drunk, I was 12 or 13 working at my dad's restaurant on a New

196
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,600
Year's Eve. And it was me and my best friend, Mike Douglas. We were busing tables and washing dishes

197
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,760
and the whole night we're sneaking in drinks here and there. Like we're sneaking behind the bar and

198
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,120
taking a drink of this and a drink of that. And this is the ultimate low is at the end of the

199
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,640
night when everybody's gone. It's like three in the morning or whatever. And we're cleaning up.

200
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,080
We drank every bit of remaining alcohol that was left on the table. And sometimes you'd finish a

201
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,760
drink and there'd be a cigarette butt in there and you'd be like, oops. And you'd pitch the cigarette

202
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,840
butt and just keep drinking. So we had this cocktail of booze in us and my mom, she came to pick us up

203
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,240
to take us home. She saw that we were just hammered and she was so pissed at my dad. She's

204
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:24,400
like, how could you let these two knuckleheads do this? So she drives us back home. And I just think

205
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
it's one of those, it's amazing that I could still remember something so vividly from so long ago.

206
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,680
Because 13, 12, whatever. I remember being in the back of the car and sort of understanding why all

207
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,720
those don't drink and drive commercials existed. Because I was like, oh my God. I was like out of

208
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,960
my mind. And then we got home and then she had to do what I knew she didn't want to do,

209
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,800
which was leave us there to go drive the babysitter home. Because there's a babysitter

210
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,760
babysitting my younger brother. And so now there's these two drunk 12 year olds and beyond drunk.

211
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,200
And she has to leave for 20 minutes, which is what it's going to take to drive this babysitter

212
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,680
home. And we managed to find, I don't know, a bottle of beer or wine or something in the house

213
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,400
and took it in the back, drank it and started playing catch with it, which of course resulted

214
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,200
in it breaking and smashing out of the place. And then we puked all over the kitchen. And she came

215
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,200
home to that, had to clean that up. It was a disaster. Point being, I didn't have a sip of

216
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,800
alcohol again until I was probably 22. That might be me. Mine was a blessing. It was one of these

217
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:33,280
things where I got convinced that we needed to get drunk. I went to one of my neighbors. I had 20 bucks.

218
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:41,040
Went to one of my neighbors who I remember he had a big red, like a firebird or a trans am or

219
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,160
something, a red one with teatops. He looked like he just got out of a warrant concert.

220
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,360
You know, he had like a white leather jacket with fringe down it, long blonde hair. And I went over

221
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,920
and like, Hey dude, me and my buddies want some booze. And he goes, he said house takes 50%. And

222
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,400
I go, I don't care. Just get me as much as I can get a whatever with this. And he came back with a

223
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,560
big jug of off brand peppermint schnapps. And I remember this. And then on top of that, like

224
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,400
everyone was supposed to bring something to get bombed to this event with me and a couple of my

225
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,880
buddies that were just thinking we're cool. And one of my buddies brought some snuff. And I had

226
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:34,160
never smoked a cig or nothing, but he's like just sniff it. So the first time I ever got intoxicated

227
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:41,280
was on peppermint schnapps and snuff. And I don't remember most of the night. I just remember waking

228
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,800
up and praying that God, if I make it through this, I will never do this again. And that was it. I was

229
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:57,280
like upchuck and just peppermint schnapps that was black from the snuff. And that was like, that

230
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,600
was it. So I did not party. That's the moral of the story. I didn't party. I went and I shot archery

231
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,200
a little bit on Thanksgiving. Every year we went down to Mississippi for a family Thanksgiving.

232
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,560
And I would bow hunt down there. That was my time to be a hunter. I loved doing it. And I would,

233
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,560
I would shoot my bow. I'd bowfish some in the summertime. Because at that time we lived in

234
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:25,440
Illinois and my focus was football. This is totally my focus. Well, during my senior summer,

235
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm scheduled to go to school. I actually moved, I think I went to Carolina one time. And then

236
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,520
I ended up hurting my right knee. This knee right here, I hurt this knee. And it was mainly because

237
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,880
my growth spurt was so severe that my ligaments didn't grow with the rest of my body. So they,

238
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,800
we kind of came up with a plan for me to redshirt at a JC school that ran a very similar, I think

239
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,360
the coaches were somehow affiliated, but they're, they said, this is your opportunity to learn the

240
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,480
entire playbook. You're going to rehab there. We've got some stuff there. So I was like, okay,

241
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,880
this is all cool. So as this is going down, this is in the middle of summer. I've got my bow in my

242
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:16,400
truck because like I said, sometimes I would just randomly get out and shoot carp. If I saw a car,

243
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,840
I grew up on the Fox river in Northern Illinois. And so I driving down this road and I see this

244
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,720
sign that says archery shoot. So I thought, Oh, what's that? So I went down, I turned down this

245
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,520
road. If you went there now, it almost would be like a weird way to lure someone in because

246
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,000
you're turning down these cornfield roads, like going into this place. And all of a sudden I pop

247
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,360
in, there's a bunch of cars there. And I walk up and I'm like, Hey, what's up with this archery

248
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,800
shoot? And I go, yeah, we're having a 3d shoot. And I said, what's that? And they're like, well,

249
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,840
3d targets with scoring rings. I'm like, Oh, I haven't really seen those. And it was three

250
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,320
dimensional deer targets, which now you have, and there's molded rings molded into the foam. So

251
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,640
the smaller ring is a certain score and the bigger rings, obviously, the more outside of

252
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,800
the kill zone you get the poor your score. And if you miss, it's a zero. So I go out with this score

253
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,280
card, get with this group of three guys, I don't even know. And I start shooting and you have to

254
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,760
guess the distance of the target. You have to know where the scoring ring is. I didn't have any

255
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,840
binoculars. I don't even know if rangefinders were around. So all this is going on. Well,

256
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:33,840
needless to say, after halfway through this course, I'm out of arrows. And because you've missed

257
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,160
so I've literally missed practically everything. Didn't know the distance. I grew up hunting with

258
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,160
if you can shoot a paper plate at 20 yards, you can hunt. That was our thing. And meanwhile,

259
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,440
hitting a paper plate meant go out and shoot 10 arrows if you can kind of hit it some. So I'd

260
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,080
got better than that. And I could have very specific pins to shoot exact numbers. But the

261
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,200
in between stuff like I hadn't filled the gaps, right. So I went out and just was terrible,

262
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,400
lost all my arrows, blanked a bunch of targets. The people I was shooting were was looking at

263
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,600
me like, wow, this is sad. And I said, sorry, I got to go. I'm out of arrows, I'll be back. And I

264
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,440
left. And I remember just driving up to Wilmot, Wisconsin from this Illinois shoot, the only shop

265
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,080
I knew of was in Wilmot, Wisconsin, which is where my dad had taken me to get some of my first bows

266
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,840
and drove up to this gander mountain. And I was pissed off the whole way. Like, I am never going

267
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,320
to suck this bad again at anything. And I drove up there bought another dozen arrows,

268
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,160
drove back and picked up where I left off, shot the course. And by then they were already handing

269
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,800
out trophies. I was like last in and they were already handing out trophies. And the guys that

270
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,960
were on the podium had polo shirts on with embroidery of what shop they were shooting out

271
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,120
of. And I remember the two top guys had these bright yellow shirts on it said, GAT guns,

272
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,600
Dundee, Illinois. So this was on a Saturday or a Sunday, Monday morning. I'm in GAT guns.

273
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm in there. They opened at one o'clock. I was there by 11. I just sat around in my car for a

274
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,440
few hours. And then when they opened, I came in and I was like, Hey, I went to this 3d shoot.

275
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,920
There are a couple guys that one, I want to ask them about their equipment and what they're doing.

276
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,800
And they're kind of like, Oh, yeah, it's probably so and so they normally shoot at night. So I just

277
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,960
lurked around there until people started to show up to shoot league. And then I was just

278
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,240
this kid with all these questions. Why do you have a colored bow? Why is your site have a lens in it?

279
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,840
Why are your fletching shorter? Just all these questions and went on a few days.

280
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,120
And all of a sudden, the guy at the shop, the manager, his name was Mike Donovan. He grabbed

281
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
him. He said, Hey, kid, are you doing anything? And I said, Well, yeah, I'm asking these guys

282
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,600
questions. He said, No, are you doing anything? And I said, Well, I go, why? And he goes, I need

283
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,760
your help. And he pulled me in the back room. And he said, Hey, I forgot to do these guys'

284
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,120
arrows. Do you know how to fletch arrows? And I said, No, I don't know how to do any of this stuff.

285
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,880
And he said, Okay, I'm going to show you how. So he handed me some feathers, gave me a fletching jig,

286
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,640
told me to put the feather in here, put glue down it, clamp it on the arrow, set the timer.

287
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,200
Do the next six in line. And then when the timer went off, take the clamp off, turn this little

288
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,800
dial so that it rotates zero 120 degrees to the next position, put another feather in, put glue

289
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,160
on, right? Repeat that three times. You got three fletchings on your arrow. And he's like, When these

290
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,640
dozen are done, come out and get me. So I did that. And two hours later, I came out and I said, Hey,

291
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,760
these are done. He's like, Okay, now it's like, All right, he goes, Okay, do those. And he pointed

292
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,880
over in the corner. And there was just this, like 100 tubes of them with orders wrapped up and kind

293
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:13,520
of in there on what colors they got and everything. So this went on for weeks of me just I would show

294
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,640
up at 12 o'clock, I'd jump in that little room and just start flexing arrows for this guy. And

295
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,160
then all of a sudden, he kind of told me like, Hey, we got to replace this bow string. And I'm like,

296
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,480
Well, how do you do that? At some point, as he said, by the way, you work here now? No, no,

297
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,360
this is all just pure apprentice mode. Yeah. So this is kind of where it gets good. So I think

298
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:38,080
it got good about five minutes ago, by the way. I love that story. So meanwhile, my dad is saying,

299
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,920
Hey, what are you doing for work, which I was pouring concrete in the morning for an archer

300
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:49,920
buddy, one of the guys that I was more or less stalking in this range, his name was Mike West.

301
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,880
He had West concrete. While I was talking to him, he's like, Hey, what are you doing for job? I'm

302
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
like, I don't know. He goes, Well, I need help with my concrete company. You want to come? I'm

303
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,320
like, he goes, we start early kid. And I'm like, Yeah, that's fine. And I said, I just want to be

304
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,920
in here by night. And he's like, Okay, we start early. So I was just running wheelbarrows full of

305
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,440
freaking concrete every morning. And then when it hit 1130, it'd be like, I got to get to get guns.

306
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,480
And I would leave and go there and just fletch these arrows for free. And meanwhile, several

307
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,040
weeks went by where I watched Mike hand out checks to other employees. So finally, I told Mike, I said,

308
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,160
Hey, when am I gonna get my paycheck? I remember he just looked at me with this

309
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,200
look of surprise. And he just, he goes, you want to get paid? And I go, Yeah, I've been here for

310
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:47,520
a month from 12 to 8 o'clock every day. And he just said, you can't put a price on what I'm

311
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:55,360
teaching you right now. And he was like, cold serious. And I said, that's cool, man. But I've

312
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:03,040
got to put gas in my car. So he's just like, all right. He goes, let me think about it. And then

313
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,880
he came back and he goes, I'm gonna give you four 10 an hour. And he goes, you'll have to work from

314
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:16,480
12 to eight every day. And I said, sounds awesome. And I went after about a week, I went back to my

315
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,760
dad and I said, Hey, I've got I think I want to change what I'm going to be doing. And he said,

316
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,920
what do you mean? And I go, I've got this job at this archery shop. And it's just the best. I love

317
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,600
it. And meanwhile, everyone's teaching me better shooting techniques, right? They're teaching me

318
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:40,080
shooting. I'm meeting sales reps from arrow companies sales reps from bow companies. I'm in

319
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,040
full dork mode. So I tell my dad, yeah, this is what I want to do. And my dad said, I assume

320
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:55,120
they're paying you a lot. And I'm getting four 10 an hour. And I remember my dad because he's a

321
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,720
psychologist. So he's looking at me as if he's kind of wanting to say, I really want you to make

322
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,080
the right decision right now. You're 18. I don't want to tell you your decision. And so he kind of

323
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,400
just said, I think that's a terrible decision. And like most 18 year olds, I just decided to

324
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,360
freakin run with it. I mean, is it safe to say that part of this is, you're pretty good at a lot

325
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,720
of things as up until that point in your life, athletically, how much of this is you getting bit

326
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,160
by this bug of a month earlier, you're at this 3d challenge, you're the worst guy there. And

327
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,640
there's like a lack of familiarity with being so bad at something. I mean, is that part of me

328
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,320
rephrase the question, I suspect that is part of it. Is that a small part of it? Or a large part of

329
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,120
it? I don't know, man, I think that same sort of things in you, I think that same sort of things

330
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,560
in a lot of our friends, I think a lot of our friends are very similar in the fact of, if you

331
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,920
give us something athletic to do, we won't necessarily be awesome at it. But we're definitely

332
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:08,720
gonna be above average at it really fast. Or if we're not, we will make sure we at least

333
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,800
get above average at it before we say, Yeah, that was cool. I'm gonna move on other things.

334
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,360
I don't think I've ever done anything where I just totally suck at it. Maybe there's a few,

335
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,640
if someone got me into competitive limbo, I would probably be like, Yeah, okay, I frickin suck at

336
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,880
this. I would maybe take a few lessons and I'd be like, you know what, I'm six five, I'm not meant

337
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,920
to limbo. So I gave it a try. But for the most part, I think that stuff just in competitive

338
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,000
people, like people with drive, they have drive all the time, right? I think yeah, I don't know.

339
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I mean, look, my hope is by the end of this interview, I want to understand this better,

340
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
because as much as you and I have spoken about this stuff over meals and such,

341
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,400
I find your story remarkable. I mean, I interview some really amazing people on this podcast, and

342
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,320
they're amazing in their field of a particular science or something, you know, lots of different

343
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,040
things. And I have friends who are among the best in the world at something. So you're in

344
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,280
pretty rarefied air. Like I can't compare that. Yeah, I feel like I shouldn't even be here.

345
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,080
No, no, no. I mean, I'm saying the opposite actually. Like I can't relate. I've never been

346
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,200
exceptional at anything. I've never been as good at anything as you are at Archie. Let's put it

347
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,880
that way. But I'm not exceptional. I've just, I've made it a lifetime passion to give everything I

348
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,720
have to master it. I'm not except, there's prodigies. I feel like I was born with a talent to do it,

349
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,400
because as many times as I've kind of been burnt out by it and walk away from it, all of a sudden,

350
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,200
for some reason, I come back to it. And then I do it. And I realize, man, there's a lot of people that

351
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,800
work tirelessly to try to achieve this result. And I really didn't have to put that in. And

352
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:01,120
I'm getting it. So I feel like this is what I'm meant to do. But I don't know, I feel like,

353
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,320
I feel like you're cutting yourself short, not saying that you're 100% that way, you're just

354
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,920
that way in a different light, just that way with a projectile. I mean, well, look, we could split

355
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:18,880
hairs on it. I would still argue that you, at your best, were better at your craft than I've ever

356
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,200
been at my craft or ever will be at anything that will be my craft. And that's okay. I just mean

357
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,840
that it's, I'm always interested in understanding how people, what kind of passion people bring to

358
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,840
their craft. Now packing up for a moment, you've spoken only once that I've ever heard very briefly

359
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,600
about something that I was sort of, this was a couple of years ago, I think it was on Rogan.

360
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,200
You talked very briefly about something in your childhood that you guys didn't spend a lot of time

361
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,280
dwelling on it, but it really kind of gripped me, which was what happened to you when you're about

362
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,880
nine years old with your house. We've never spoken about that. Are you comfortable talking about that

363
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,120
at all? Yeah, I'll talk about it. I mean, it haunts me. It haunts me in the fact that, so

364
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,440
just like most kids, and this, everything happens for a reason. I'm happy that happened. I've talked

365
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,920
to Joe in depth about things that are super close to me. So sometimes he's going to know

366
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,120
how far we should go down a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole doesn't really, it doesn't matter.

367
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,640
It's part of my past. And it's honestly something that allows me to, when I'm around friends that

368
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,720
have kids that are bad, not bad in the fact that they act up, but bad. Just rambunctious. Yeah.

369
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,640
I tell them, I'm like, hey, I was way worse than that. And I said, you got to just give them a

370
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,080
chance. Something will happen to where they'll change their direction. And a lot of people

371
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,520
looked at me and they're like, oh yeah, easy for you to say. And I'm like, no, man, let me tell you.

372
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,200
Yeah, right. Because at the surface, they would say easy for you to say because your son who's

373
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,440
20 is, he's like... Well, even looking at me, like them knowing me now or knowing me for the last

374
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,720
20 something or 30 something years, they would never realize that me growing up, I grew up on

375
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,800
skateboards. I grew up on BMX bikes. I grew up taking money from my mom's wallet so I could

376
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,440
go buy fireworks. And I mean, I was beavis and butthead. That's what I was. I was beavis and

377
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,440
butthead. And yeah, I played with fire when I was nine years old, called myself in sick from school,

378
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,600
was at home while my mom was in, I think, Puerto Rico, visiting a factory. My dad was at work.

379
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,680
And yeah, I started playing with matches, ended up catching something on fire in the house,

380
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,680
panicked. And honestly, I tried to use the fire extinguisher, didn't work. Guess why? Because I

381
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,920
had been playing with firecrackers I wasn't supposed to have months before that in the garage

382
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,560
and almost burned the house down. So I put them out this fire extinguisher and just stuck it back

383
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,400
up in the house without telling anyone I had completely used it. So then fast forward,

384
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,600
playing around with fire, whatever primal say what you say, we got the fire going over here,

385
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:06,960
looks cool. Yeah, house started on fire started in the bedroom. And I called my dad. He was on the

386
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,440
other side of town, middle of a session with the patient, told him there's a fire in the house,

387
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,040
it's pretty bad. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah. And he just said, What's it like in the

388
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,040
house? I said, it's just black, it's black everywhere. I put it out. There's black smoke

389
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,720
everywhere. And he just said, Get the smoke out of the house, get the smoke out of the house. So I

390
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,560
open the windows and then open the front door and just like let the air blow through. And I was just

391
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,960
kind of crying frantically running around the house, like trying to kind of prepare myself for

392
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,280
when my dad was getting ready to come home to this thing. And then by the time I went back in the

393
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,240
bedroom, it was even smokier than it was that time. And then I remember I was just like,

394
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,760
opening the window even wider and ripping the screen out. And keep in mind, I was a punk kid,

395
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,720
I was like super, I still like heavy metal, but I was into heavy metal. I was a skater,

396
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,800
I was a troublemaker. That's what I was. And I wasn't into sports, didn't like sports. My dad

397
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:16,160
was an athletic prodigy pretty much. And I know that that's probably what was in my jeans. That

398
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,680
wasn't what I wanted to do. So all of a sudden I look in that room, I'm in there and I'm trying

399
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,240
to get the smoke out. And then I look up and through the smoke, I can see there's just flames

400
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,680
all the way around the entire ceiling. And that like fell down kind of right in front of my legs.

401
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,440
Luckily, I was able to get out of the house. And yeah, the whole house burned down. The only thing

402
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,240
that we had was what was in my mom's car at O'Hare airport. And what was in my dad's,

403
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,560
my dad's car that was at work, that was it. So yeah, I mean, I dealt with this.

404
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,080
You have an older sister, right?

405
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,560
Yeah, my sister was at college. So I mean, yeah.

406
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,440
Considerably older.

407
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,200
Yeah, dealing with all of her stuff, being lost and my little brother did this and I was dealing

408
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,280
with all this stuff. And my parents were really good about, I've never asked them what their

409
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:16,080
conversation was, but they never really rubbed it in. I remember my dad telling me I was struggling,

410
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,040
dealing with it. Honestly, we were living in an apartment and my dad told me that,

411
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,160
hey, you should try to get involved with school. And I think he said something like,

412
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,400
isn't there a dance coming up this weekend or something? And I said, yeah. And he goes,

413
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,320
you should go out there, go see your friends and stuff. So I remember going to this dance.

414
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:41,360
And then one of the kids in the school ended up making a request to play burning down the house.

415
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,400
And so I ended up kind of raging out on this kid. I was never really a fighter,

416
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,640
but I went a little nuts on this kid. And then I think my parents just realized,

417
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,360
we need to get him out of this town. So we moved to a completely different town.

418
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,960
And once we got there, I told myself, I'm like, I got to make my dad proud. And I knew the only

419
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,280
way I was going to really do that was basketball, football, or golf. And so that was totally my

420
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,560
passion, was jumping in there and becoming as good as I can. And I remember when I first started

421
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,120
basketball, I wasn't like I had the size, but I wasn't natural at it. And I remember the,

422
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,960
my sixth or seventh grade basketball coach, even though I was the tallest or the second tallest,

423
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,360
I remember seeing him like kind of crack jokes that I was uncoordinated and stuff like that.

424
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,240
I kind of remember that. And then all of a sudden fast forward three or four years later,

425
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,440
when I was in high school and I was the starting quarterback for our varsity team already,

426
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,320
I remember going back to the junior high for something. And I remember running into that,

427
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,080
or maybe I ran into that coach somewhere in town and I remembered, he's like, well,

428
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,800
what are you doing with yourself nowadays, Dudley? And I just said, well, I'm coaching

429
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,400
varsity with the high school. And I remember him laughing at it. He's like, yeah, right. And

430
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,960
so like all those little things kind of, they just fueled me. So at first I just, I wanted to do

431
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,680
something to pay my parents back for being that kid that burnt the house down, literally. And

432
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:25,440
then, I don't know, just, I think it began this drive to just be fully committed to,

433
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:33,200
honestly, fully committed to training because I never had raw talent. I just had size to start

434
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,480
with. So then it just, I realized, like, if I knew every person's positions, every single person,

435
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,120
if I knew what they needed to do, every play, I would be a leader. I could look at them, you

436
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,680
know what you need to do? No. Okay. You're going to pull, you're going to come across, you're going

437
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,360
to pick up the first defense event. Like I knew every X and every O on the playbooks. And so that

438
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,360
was, I don't know. I think some of that looking back, thinking about it now, some of that probably

439
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:10,800
rolls over into just what molded my personality of going deep into this stuff. Do you ever talk to

440
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,720
your dad about your mom for that matter? But maybe your dad, just because he's a psychologist

441
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,120
by training about kind of the wisdom they had to that. Cause I know I've heard you talk about this

442
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,720
a little bit in the past and it sounds like your parents handled this as well as any parents could

443
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:31,280
have. I mean, I have to think that if a hundred parents had a hundred nine year old boys in that

444
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:39,200
situation, like 99 of those can end up a lot worse where that kid never recovers from that.

445
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,320
For example, like if one of my kids burned down the house, I'm just not, I don't know. I don't

446
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,760
know how I'd handle that. It's hard. It's hard to think about. Yeah. What's hard is not having

447
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,560
my dad losing all of his stuff from, from his military, not having any baby photos,

448
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,920
everything your parents had, like all that stuff's haunting. It is like, no one could tell me anything

449
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,240
that wouldn't make me feel bad about that. Because in the end I know that they never had to tell me

450
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,680
that. My dad's never said, Oh man, all my. Well, that's the part that amazes me, right? It's sort of

451
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,400
like that your parents had the understanding that you were going to beat yourself up in eternity

452
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,080
over that, that they never needed to vent their frustration to you. That to me is, that's remarkable.

453
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,520
And it's a, it's kind of an amazing Testament to them. And I'm sure they weren't perfect. No parent

454
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,000
is, but that may be their single most exceptional parenting moment or event. Yeah, for sure. And

455
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,760
it's another one of those, another one of those perfect examples of when negative things happen,

456
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,800
it's an opportunity to, to really change full direction or make something out of it. If

457
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,760
something blows up, there's new pieces there. You can build it in a new way because the pieces

458
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,080
wouldn't be there if that wouldn't have happened, right? It would still be kind of a solid object

459
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:11,760
that wouldn't have anything. So I've just, I've kind of taken that and dedicated myself to just

460
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,720
really want to make my dad proud in that aspect. And then kind of rolled it into, for whatever

461
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:28,000
reason, this archery thing was all of a sudden, this was the same sort of thing from the training

462
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,880
from the dedication, the competition was still there. I wasn't good at it, but more importantly,

463
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,040
the archery was for me. I think that was the first thing that was really for me again,

464
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,200
because that was what I loved, not what I think I was worried about my dad really loving. And

465
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,200
I don't know, it was in a small way. It was also when I knew people thought it was a bad idea. It

466
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,000
was a lot like when that coach said, you're never going to be a varsity player, because that same

467
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,360
sort of thing happened with archery. People told me, they're like, I asked about what's these

468
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,600
national events or world championships? You're never going to be that good. That's what I was

469
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:14,960
told. I was told that. And then a year later, I was already at my first triple crown as an amateur.

470
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,720
Two years later, I was already at a world championship as an amateur. Three and a half

471
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:28,000
years later, I was already in the pro class. And by the fourth year from that day, within four years

472
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,520
of that day, I was a rookie of the year in the pro class. So I want to just pause for a moment and

473
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,600
make sure people understand some of the nuts and bolts about this. Because if we were talking about

474
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,400
football, people would understand what the sport is and what the quarterback does and what a wide

475
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,000
receiver does and what a touchdown is and all those things. I think in archery, I mean, even it's sort

476
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,120
of funny, like how many hours a day do I do this? And my wife still doesn't actually know anything

477
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,880
about archery. We were kind of laughing about it the other day at dinner, right? No, every day at

478
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,440
dinner. You're like, let me put this in this perspective every day. And God bless her, it's

479
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,440
not from a lack of interest. It's just the reality of it is if you're not out there behind a bow,

480
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,600
looking at something at a distance and knowing what those distances are, like I don't think a

481
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,960
normal person walks through the world thinking about what is the difference between 50 yards

482
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:22,480
and 60 yards and 100 yards and 20 yards. So can you explain how the competition works? What is the

483
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,480
actual event? What does an actual event look like? There are several events, but... Yeah, there's so

484
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,880
many. I've shot on probably four or five different types of pro tours over the years and all of them

485
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,240
have different rules. The one thing that's consistent about football is you're always

486
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,240
on the same field. You always have four downs. You always have four quarters. With archery,

487
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,200
each event has a certain number of arrows that shoot. And once that score happens, some events,

488
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:57,280
when it's done, top three, that's it. Some, once the top five scores at the end of the ranking

489
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,800
round or qualification round, then the top five will go in. They'll shoot down to a winner. Some

490
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,560
have more like an Olympic style round where you shoot a ranking round. They rank everybody. They

491
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,720
rank one to 64 and then number one will shoot against number 64. Number two shoots against

492
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,800
63 type thing. And you'll have brackets and you shoot all the way down into a gold medal match.

493
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,080
And depending on the event, some events are multiple distance through multiple days. Some

494
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:35,280
events are fixed distances. The maximum is up to 90 meters. So back, they've actually

495
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,320
canceled this round here recently, but back when I competed a full feet around was 30 meters,

496
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,560
50 meters, 70 meters, 90 meters.

497
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,760
The feeder stands for?

498
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,960
Back then it was.

499
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,640
Federation International.

500
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,520
Yeah, it was French. I don't even know what it was. Now it's called World Archery. They made

501
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:02,480
it much simpler. But yeah, you would shoot rounds at 30, 50, 70, 90 meters. And then once the quals

502
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:09,440
were done, the head to heads would all be shot at 70 meters, which is 77 yards. That was for that

503
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,480
type of event. My favorite event was the field archery formats, which is multiple size, bull's

504
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,080
eyes proportion, depending on the distance that you're shooting anywhere from 20 meters out to

505
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:29,680
about 80. And you would shoot one round that had marked distance, one round that was unmarked

506
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,560
distance, and then you'd go into qualifications that were half and half.

507
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,280
So let's put some specs to this so people understand what we're talking about. So

508
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,920
most people know how long a football field is. That's just a touch over 90 meters.

509
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,520
Yeah, put it on the one yard line. Honestly, this almost goes back to me hooking that football,

510
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,160
right? So you're on the one yard line of football field. The other end zone is 99 yards away,

511
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:03,920
which is 90 meters. Okay, so a professional archer, one of the top professional archers,

512
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:11,200
can hit with their bow at that distance. If they took 10 shots, what size diameter would they be

513
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,320
able to land 10 shots inside of? This Jocko coffee cup right here is about the size of the 10.

514
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,920
So the 10 ring there is about, that's about two and a half to three inches?

515
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,160
No, that'd be wider than that. Dude.

516
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,400
Looks like about four inches max, right? That's three inches.

517
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,800
Yeah, we could look up the exact diameter.

518
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,680
But yeah, it's pretty small. So take your coffee. The Jocko coffee mug's a slightly big coffee mug.

519
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,520
Yeah, it's a larger coffee mug. But if they shot 10 shots, most, I would say,

520
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,080
most pro archers are going to hit that eight out of 10.

521
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,680
Okay, let's pause for one more moment here and now explain another distinction,

522
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,560
which we have yet to explain to the listener, which is we talk interchangeably about bows,

523
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:59,280
but if anyone ever turns on the Olympics, they're watching one type of bow, but most of what you

524
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,840
shoot and all of what I shoot is a different type of bow. Can you explain that difference?

525
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,880
So if you're watching the Olympic games, they shoot recurves. So those bows are very long,

526
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:16,640
and it's a handle with wooden limbs, which are the parts that bend, and there's a string.

527
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:24,640
That's a recurve bow. So what we're shooting is what's called a compound, which is a bow that has

528
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:34,240
round wheels on it that essentially store energy. So as you pull it back, the limbs of the bow flex,

529
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:42,640
but they also have this cam system that's, I guess for layman's turn, imagine like gears on a

530
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,320
bike where as you're going through those gears, you have the ability to make it easier at some

531
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:55,200
point. So as you pull this back, the cam rolls over into kind of a different position to where

532
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:02,000
it gets easier as you get closer to your fully extended position. That's probably the easiest way

533
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,120
to say it, right? And it's a little bit easier to hold it at full draw, but because of that,

534
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:16,080
you're also able to shoot much more poundage at the beginning of that pull cycle. So in other words,

535
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:23,280
in the Olympics, a heavy recurve shooter would be shooting about 50 pounds, because as he pulls that

536
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,600
bow back, every inch he pulls it back further, that weight continually increases as he pulls it back.

537
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:36,080
So once he gets to full draw, that in no way gets easier. Whereas ours, we could shoot a 70 pound

538
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,080
bow and as we start to pull it, it'll peak at 70 pounds fairly soon. And then it gets easier and

539
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:48,800
easier and easier and kind of drops back. You can be much more accurate with the compound bow,

540
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,320
and you can also achieve much longer distances because the energy stored is greater. So the

541
00:51:54,320 --> 00:52:00,560
typical speed, so your bow or my bow, my bow, I just know this because it's my bow is 292 feet

542
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,560
per second is what I would call the muzzle velocity. Close to 100 miles an hour. Yeah,

543
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,520
which the way I describe it to Olivia when she's watching me shoot is if I shoot 50 yards, it's

544
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,480
taking about half a second to get there. What's the speed on a recurve on an Olympian's bow?

545
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,720
Way less, like way, way less. And in the Olympics, they shoot what distance? 70 meters. Which I've

546
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,040
only ever fired a recurve at 20. I don't even understand how those guys fire recurves at 77 yards.

547
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,360
Yeah, it's impressive. They use the same type of process that I teach just with a different system.

548
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,840
And actually our US guy, he's a close, I can't say he's a close friend because

549
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:47,440
I've known him since he was a kid. I liked his dad a lot. His dad was a very well-respected person.

550
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:53,840
And I gave Brady his first recurve bow. He was shooting a compound, but he wanted to get into

551
00:52:53,840 --> 00:53:00,480
shooting Olympic style archery. So I gave him his first recurve bow and he just set a new world

552
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,040
record with it. He's won, I think, medals the last two. He's phenomenal. He's an amazing archer,

553
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,720
but he just set a new world record this morning. Wow. Explain what the world record means.

554
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,560
I think he shot a 701 out of 720. So that's the exact same scoring ring I just talked about. So

555
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,560
out of 720 points, he shot 701 in this coffee cup with that recurve bow.

556
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:29,200
So that means you get 72 shots? That's 72 shots. 72 shots. Every time you're in that exact 10 ring,

557
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:36,400
which is the inside of a coffee cup, 77 yards away, you'd get a 10. So that means presumably he got

558
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,600
nine nines and the rest were 10s or some combination there. Yeah. I mean, and what's

559
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,240
impressive about it too is a lot of times when you're off with the recurve, like if you make a

560
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,200
really poor shot with the recurve, it's really poor. So it's possible one of those was a one

561
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,960
and then set. Well, probably not with him, but yeah, it would have been easy to do out of 72

562
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,960
arrows, which is why those scores, even though people might have the pace to do that. The reality

563
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,520
is because they're shooting with fingers too. They're not allowed to shoot a mechanical release.

564
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:15,760
So it's pretty phenomenal. It's amazing to watch it, but as amazing as that is, that was never a

565
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:23,440
pursuit of mine because these guys train for four years for one event. And although there are world

566
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:31,840
champs and world cups in between sad part about archery is the money pays out a lot more in the

567
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:37,440
compound pro class than in the recurve class. And there's more people there. The cost of getting it

568
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:45,360
in is higher too. So although that's the Olympic sport, the Olympians, their paydays are when they

569
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:52,080
win medals and that paydays really only every four years. Now they'll, I'm sure they're getting

570
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:58,480
compensated to shoot, but like for me, for example, my rookie year, if I won a pro event,

571
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,720
the guaranteed payout was 10,000 by the time you got some of your contingency checks, you were

572
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,720
making 15 grand a weekend on a win. World champs were 30,000 shooter. The years were 50,000.

573
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,280
If you win the Vegas indoor tournament, which is every February that pays about 50,000.

574
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,880
Whereas with the recurve, they may make five or 10. I don't know.

575
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,920
Does anybody hunt with recurve? There are guys that'll still hunt with a recurve. Yeah.

576
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,000
I was wondering if that was also part of the reason you favored compound, which was you

577
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,120
started as a hunter, then became an Archer. The two go hand in hand. I mean, they feed off each

578
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,240
other. Yeah. Yeah. I always said, and you and I talked about this and you told me, you said,

579
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:49,760
now that I'm doing this and I've kind of became a target Archer, I went to Lanai, I hunted axis,

580
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,560
he said, I understand that saying that you have, which what I tell people is I'm a target Archer

581
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,960
in order to be a better bow hunter and I'm a better bow hunter because I'm a target Archer.

582
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:12,320
I feel like there's a very, very important puzzle piece to being ethical that involves you giving

583
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:19,360
everything you have to be in the absolute best Archer you can be and being able to know your

584
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:25,280
limitations on shots. And the reality is we talked about like when Sharon was going to run that half

585
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:32,240
marathon, she prepped for it. I just, I just decided to do it. I didn't know my limitations.

586
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,080
I just went and did it. Did I do it? Yeah, I did it. But in a hunting situation, guys that just

587
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:44,720
know how to shoot a bow and then go out and then just take those shots at animals. I feel like

588
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,360
morally there's going to come a point where if their shot doesn't connect where they want,

589
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:57,760
that's going to be hard to deal with. So I've always felt like ethically I need to know my

590
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,960
limitations because when that moment happens, I'm going to be able to make ideally make a perfect

591
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,840
shot or the more I've done it in practicing in weird conditions, the more you realize

592
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,520
this might not be a shot I should even take, even though I know I can technically shoot this far,

593
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:25,360
which you learned from me. The list of things I've learned from you, John, is unbelievable.

594
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:31,840
And we'll link in this podcast to the interview where I was on your podcast. And of course,

595
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,920
I don't want to chew up any of our time here retelling stuff I talked about there, which was

596
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:42,320
how this all spoke to me and why what you're saying resonated so much. And that's something

597
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,800
that to this day I still can't answer. You asked me that question. I gave you the best answer I had.

598
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,680
And in the end, I still don't know. I just think there are some people for whom that degree of

599
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,600
perfection is so blissful. There's such an amazing state. And you know, my wife said something to me

600
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:06,640
about six months ago, which she's never said about any of my obsessions because she's known me for

601
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,320
19 years now. And she's been through many seasons of obsession. We were talking about the anastomosing

602
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,440
and surgery and swimming and cycling and archery and race car driving and all these things

603
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,600
both past and present that are my obsessions. And she said, you get so pissed off when you're

604
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:29,840
having a bad day in your given sport. I used to call her every morning after swim practice on

605
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,480
my way to work. I'd go early swim masters, and then I'd drive into work and she'd be heading

606
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,280
to work and I was just calling and say, Hey, and she's like, I could tell from your voice how the

607
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,480
practice went. And you have to understand something here. We're talking about masters swimming,

608
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:52,320
like nobody cares, okay? Not on the national team, right? I don't have a Wheaties contract,

609
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:59,920
like nobody cares. In fact, nobody else in the pool can tell if I was one second off per

610
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:07,040
hundred that day. Like it's just not at that level. But I mean, my day would rise or fall as

611
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,920
a function of that. And the same thing, like if I'm in the simulator for two hours and I come in

612
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,920
and I'm surly and pissy, she knows, like you just didn't drive well. And she's like, I don't know

613
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,440
what it is about archery, but she's like, I've only seen you twice pissed off for shooting bad.

614
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,640
Usually, even when you, if you come in and I say, how'd you do? You'd be like, I sucked,

615
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,720
but you're not pissed. It's almost like there's a benefit to archery for my psyche that goes beyond

616
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,640
the performance. There's something about the act of doing it that is in and of itself beautiful,

617
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,960
even if I don't meet the objective. So the journey seems to matter as much as the

618
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:57,520
destination in archery as anything I've ever done. Do you feel that way? Or because you have

619
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:03,840
done it at such a high level, do you struggle more with those days or those seasons, which I'm sure

620
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:09,360
there've been seasons or months or whatever when you've been off your form? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

621
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:18,080
there's certainly times that there's been times where I have felt it, but there's also times where

622
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:24,960
I quickly realized that when I do that in archery, it makes it worse really fast. The thing with

623
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:33,360
archery is it really is a sport of Zen and clarity. You shoot better when you're trying less.

624
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:40,560
So when you get mad, you only get worse at it. And so this was something that I talked about

625
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:47,600
a lot in my training is I was really fortunate to have a coach walk by me one time. And he was a

626
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:54,480
coach. He was a well-known coach that worked with some athletes, but he wasn't one that was kind of

627
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,640
sanctioned. I don't even know how he got with some of the athletes that he was with, but he was with

628
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:06,880
a few really high level athletes. And he worked with maybe two or three in the archery world,

629
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:14,880
but he was there watching one of his guys shoot. And he kind of saw me make a bad shot on a target.

630
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,560
And I came on glued, which I've talked about this in football. If I threw an interception,

631
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:25,600
I could just run after the guy. And if I couldn't get to him, I could just hit someone.

632
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:33,440
And then, especially in high school, guess what? I played offense, defense, kicker, punter.

633
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,520
I could just hit someone. I could get it out somehow. There was release, whereas with archery,

634
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:47,200
there wasn't. So my release would be snapping an arrow over my leg or breaking a stabilizer,

635
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,680
or when the shoot's all over and I know I'm not making the shoot off around, like waiting until

636
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:57,520
everyone's walking in and freaking hammer tossing my bow through the woods and walking away from it.

637
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,960
I had those moments where I was young. Sometimes I wasn't even 20.

638
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,360
I want to go back to that for a moment, because if you're 20, that means you're only one or two

639
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:13,360
years post making this crazy decision to forego a football scholarship, to work for four,

640
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:18,480
10 an hour to try to become an archer. And so when you're breaking an arrow, snapping your stabilizer

641
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,960
and throwing your bow into the woods, are there moments of doubt where you're saying,

642
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,920
I could be the starting quarterback in Carolina. Were you ever looking back saying, no,

643
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,960
what was your self talk in that moment of anger? Something defeated me that day,

644
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,800
and it wasn't going to do it tomorrow. That's what it was like. I wasn't looking back. I was always

645
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:45,360
right there. What's happening now is what I'm focused on. And this coach told me, he said,

646
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:51,840
you're never going to be any different than you are right now until you realize that the only

647
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:58,000
arrows you have control on are those ones that are in your quiver. And I kind of looked at him

648
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,240
and he goes, do you know how to get that arrow back that's in down there in that five ring?

649
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,640
I kind of like looked at him again and he goes, do you know anyone that can pull that arrow back

650
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:16,320
to the shooting line from that target? And I just said, no. And he goes, and you never will. He goes,

651
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,840
the only thing you have control on is what you haven't shot yet. And he goes, you got to let that

652
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:30,000
go. It's the past. And that like was so changing for me because it got to the point where I started

653
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,920
just, I was talking to arrows in my quiver. One would shoot, I'd make a bad shot and think, well,

654
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,840
okay, shit, I shot a five. Now I'm going to need at least three twelves to dig out of that hole.

655
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,880
So I'd look into my quiver and be like, which one of you son of bitches want to shoot a 12?

656
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,400
Because we got some work to make up for your asshole down there. So, and I just be like,

657
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,040
are you the one? And I'd grab it. And I just started doing that and things started to change.

658
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:03,520
But what I learned about archery and what I liked about it and the reason why I went into a lot of

659
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:12,640
different techniques or form of archery is because I really liked the training aspect. I loved it.

660
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:18,960
I like prepping. I really liked to prep. So I think that's a big reason why I like to cook.

661
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,520
I love to eat at the end, but I also like when you say, Hey, let's cook. I kind of just

662
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,960
let me prep. So by the way, have I at all been successful this week in convincing you to

663
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,120
create a sub channel and your YouTube channel for cooking? Maybe.

664
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,640
I'll just interject for a moment. Those of you, obviously you've heard this in the intro, but

665
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,400
school of knock, knock on TV on YouTube. Unbelievable. Knock on archery on YouTube.

666
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,600
Is it knock on archery? I just click on the link. I don't even know what it's called.

667
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,920
If you just go to YouTube and put knock on it shows up.

668
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:57,600
Yeah. And it's not, don't put a K at the beginning. It's NOCK, just like an arrow knock,

669
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:02,560
not like you and your box. We need to be clear. We might not have the whole,

670
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,000
but your cooking is, it actually reminds me so much of my father. So, you know,

671
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,840
I grew up in a restaurant. People always say to me, like, I like to cook as well. And people

672
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,440
always ask me for recipes. Like they'll come over and have like that salmon that we had the other

673
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,520
day. And they'll be like, which was the bomb. Thank you. I appreciate that. That was the bomb.

674
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,880
And people always say like, Hey man, can you give me that recipe? And I actually finally one day

675
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,280
wrote up the recipe for that. But I know that whatever I wrote is not actually what I normally

676
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,560
make. Cause I'm always just doing it by a pinch of this, a pinch of that. If you ask me like what

677
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,720
temperature I'm cooking in that or how long, I don't know. I just watch it. I just like my dad.

678
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:41,680
I remember him literally telling me like, once the salmon starts to sweat, it's done. And I remember

679
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,280
trying to explain that to somebody once they're like, what the hell are you talking about? And I

680
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,040
was like, it just made sense to me. The oil bubbles, bro. Yeah. And so you're a lot like my dad when

681
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:58,240
my dad's here and he's cooking. It is so enjoyable because it's just, I call it street style cooking.

682
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,880
Like it's just a little bit, what do you got? Just show me what you got. I'll make it work.

683
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,080
And you are awesome, man. We have, that's what we've done. We have consumed, we've eaten really

684
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:12,080
well this week. By the way, I've lost four pounds since you've been here. Are you kidding me? Which

685
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:18,320
is crazy given how much I've eaten. Dude. But it's because like part of it is I've eaten so well.

686
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,160
Well, we fast a lot during the day. We're probably fasting a little bit longer than normal, but

687
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:27,600
it's like our dinners are super clean. And a lot of times if the entree is not that great, I'll end

688
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,480
up nibbling on my kids leftovers and crap like their mac and cheese or whatever junk food they're

689
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,960
eating. But like there's been none of that this week. So it's just like, yeah, it's anyway, you

690
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,840
do have a gift for cooking. I mean, I'm not just saying that it's really, really been a pleasure to

691
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,160
watch the way you interact and think about stuff. Like even last night, you just had that idea out

692
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:52,560
of the blue, which was, oh my God, like if you put this sugar-free maple syrup into this type of

693
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:57,760
mustard and glaze it on the salmon, like boom, we got to try that. Oh, I've gone further than that.

694
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:05,040
I woke up thinking if we infuse that, if we smoke that syrup and then infuse it into like some

695
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:11,920
frozen whiskey balls, imagine the old fashions we can make. Dude, I woke up thinking about that.

696
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,880
You have got to pursue this. This is a non-negotiable. Back to the more serious stuff.

697
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:23,600
Well, yeah, because I'm trying to get to like, so all those processes that I was talking about,

698
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:30,640
I just started to realize that I was very task driven. Like all this stuff has always been about,

699
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:37,520
it's always been about tasks. Now it's hard, I will say it's hard for me to, I can't, I shouldn't

700
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:45,520
say I can't, but it's hard for me to be at my absolute best as a performer during practice

701
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,520
because I do perform better when I, as soon as I turn around and I see people putting cameras on me,

702
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:59,920
that's a drive for me that I can perform better than. I need that push. But I did do a lot of

703
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:08,080
research and I kind of started, I read a book, I've read a book called Mind Jim and I don't read a

704
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:14,960
lot because I don't have a lot of time. Jim, G-Y-M? Yeah, because I was really trying to figure out,

705
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,720
so this is something that's been interesting to me for a long time because I really struggle with ADD

706
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:28,720
and I've been clinically tested. I went through a psychological full evaluation for my ADD and my

707
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:36,720
LD, which was a full day going through. As a teenager, as an adult? Yeah, because I struggled,

708
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,600
part of the problem was once I was working at that archery shop, I did want to still go to college,

709
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:47,200
but I realized really quick, it was, I realized I'd never really taken a book home. I just always

710
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:53,760
got passed in classes because I was excelling as an athlete. And so I really, really struggled with

711
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:59,600
that and I struggled with attention. I struggled with certain things. There's a lot of things that

712
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,240
we're distracting. So my dad's like, I'm going to take you to one of my friends. We're going to

713
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:10,880
really test you for this. So I have a pretty severe case of ADD and I have an LD as well.

714
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:18,320
And so I started realizing that... What is the particular LD? Did they define it clearly?

715
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:24,320
Probably, but I would not know unless I gave you my eval. It's kind of a thick eval and I probably

716
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:32,560
have it somewhere. So what I learned was in archery, I kind of zone out in archery. I really feel like

717
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,280
that's a big part of why I'm good at it. And I'm the same when I weight lift. Like I can

718
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,680
do something repetitive so many times that I almost get into a trance in it and it takes someone to

719
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,960
snap me out of that. And in competition, it's been that way too where I've been competing.

720
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:55,200
And for example, like a cameraman or a videographer says, hey man, sorry for bumping you

721
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:02,160
during that shot. And I'm like, when? And he's like, I bumped your elbow and I'm completely

722
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:11,760
oblivious to it because to me, I'm so zoned out on that. So I really started diving into this.

723
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:17,120
I really wanted to find out some of these people that write sports psychology books.

724
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:25,280
I was really curious if there's some type of connection between high level athletes that have

725
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:32,080
ADD. In other words, they're hyper focused. They're hyper focused just kind of by makeup.

726
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,440
And there's certainly times where if a lot's going on, I can be distracted. But during those same

727
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,240
times, I can be having a conversation with you and people can be trying to get my attention. And

728
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:52,640
equally, I don't get it. So I was kind of diving down this road of, is this ADD making me better?

729
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,480
Me getting into my own zone, because I also got to the point where during certain practices,

730
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,880
when I would practice with certain music, there were times where I could get into flow states

731
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:09,440
that were honestly that most people don't believe. I mean, I've had times where I shot

732
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:15,520
99 shots one time into the same era hole without stretching it. It took an hour and a half of

733
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:22,160
doing it. But I remember I had, I had like kind of a meditative type album playing. It was just,

734
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:26,320
I didn't even know it, but it was on repeat. Like it was on repeat on my playlist. So

735
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,240
the same song had been playing for an hour and a half and I never knew it. And then I would just

736
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:38,000
get into these flow states like that. So I started looking up, is there a connection between

737
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:46,080
people that have these types of hyper focusing? And are these people also people that get into

738
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:51,360
a flow state better? Because then at that point, I was almost at the point of retirement and this

739
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:56,240
stuff was starting to become clear to me. And I'm thinking, as a coach, if I get to the point where

740
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:01,840
I'm coaching national teams, I'm going to be looking for this. I want to be able to find this.

741
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,640
And so then at that same time, I started going into these books and I started to see

742
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:14,320
the difference in personality types between ego driven and task driven personality types. So,

743
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:23,920
and then clearly, I am a task driven mentality. I looked at a lot of times the task driven

744
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:30,960
personality type athletes are normally the ones that kind of go down at their peak levels for the

745
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,720
longest period of time. They might not peak as high as the ego driven, but as fast as the ego

746
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:42,640
driven can peak, they can also dissell. So when people are looking at, do you want the superstar,

747
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,680
the ego driven is like your route. Do you want the task driven? The task driven is what you build a

748
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,080
team off of. Yeah, it was pretty interesting to go down those. Have you looked into that stuff? Have

749
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,560
you ever dove down those roads? I have. And there's other things that I think I think about when I

750
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,320
hear people like you talk about things that shape them. So you've said already a couple of things

751
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:07,840
that I think are really relevant to my observation of exceptional performers. One of them you said,

752
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,160
you just said it outright, but a lot of people don't articulate it as directly. You love to

753
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:18,960
practice. I have yet to meet a world-class exceptional performer who didn't love to practice.

754
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:25,680
So when you talk to Lance Armstrong or his teammates, Lance's teammates will, you know,

755
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,840
spoken with at least one of them. They'll tell stories about how it just didn't matter. Like

756
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,880
when it was early season training and the ride was supposed to be a six hour grueling ride,

757
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,200
at the end of six hours, Lance wanted two more. Sometimes he would just go do it by himself. And

758
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,560
again, it's so funny to me. It just, nothing makes me sort of more annoyed that people simply want

759
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:50,240
to dismiss the natural talent of these cyclists because they also happen to use performance

760
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,200
enhancing drugs. You know, I've interviewed Apollo Ono on this podcast as well. And his

761
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:01,760
appetite for training was just unbelievable. I've worked out with Apollo and it's just so much fun

762
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:08,880
to work out with him even as a, he's 10 years post his Olympian life, but he just still like has this

763
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:17,280
complete love for training, even though he's not at that same level. And so this is, it's this love

764
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:22,880
for practice and it's this ability to practice deliberately and to practice correctly and to

765
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,680
appreciate that. And I just don't think you can get to an exceptional level without that. Of course,

766
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,680
my other favorite example of that is Zaire Tonsena, greatest driver in the history of

767
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:36,880
motorsport. And when you talk to people who were around him, who I've spoken with many people,

768
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,440
I've obviously never knew him or speak to him, but people who are around him, they all say the same

769
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:47,360
thing, which is just his attention to detail was second to none. When every other driver had left,

770
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,760
he was still there. He'd spend the night in the garage talking to the mechanics. He knew as much

771
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:58,720
about the car as they knew more than any other driver could know about the car. So the two feet

772
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,720
off each other, I don't know which one's the chicken and which one's the egg truthfully. In other words,

773
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,920
I don't know if the best of the best are the best because they do those things or if because they're

774
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:13,840
doing those things because of something else that is making them the best. Again, for me personally,

775
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,720
it's just, I've never been at that level. So, but I feel grateful that especially when it comes to

776
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,960
something like archery, I enjoy the process. I think I was saying to JR, we were talking

777
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,920
yesterday, we were out there shooting when you were working with Josh and I was like, I've never

778
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:34,480
once stopped practice shooting practice out of boredom. There's only two reasons I've ever stopped

779
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,720
shooting in the past two and a half years. And it's either I just have a time constraint, like

780
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:43,440
I have a phone call I got to get on or something, or I physically just break down. I can't hold the

781
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,880
bow any longer and my form is deteriorating so rapidly. And I never thought of that until

782
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:54,480
the other day. And I was like, man, that's really fun. That's so cool that there is something I can

783
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,480
be, that you can love that much. Because I can't say that about a lot of things.

784
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,360
Most things.

785
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,760
Yeah, most things, you can get bored of, you can only watch so much YouTube before you're like,

786
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:09,280
I'm kind of done with this. I can't watch one more Jimmy Kimmel video or whatever it is. I got to go

787
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,080
do something else.

788
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:16,800
I think those attributes are so important to just lifestyle. I mean, we're talking right now about

789
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,800
sport, but there's times, luckily I've got to the point where I work independently. We have a

790
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:29,120
business that me and my wife, I kind of do the educational side and then there's a product side

791
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:35,680
that she runs our e-commerce. But I still work independently for a lot of people as a consultant.

792
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:43,840
And having something to do and being active in that stuff, like that is part of a personality

793
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,640
type. And it's part of a personality type, I believe of someone that gets successful

794
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,800
in not just one thing, but a magnitude of things. Because there's a lot of people out there that

795
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:00,560
want to be a successful business person or they want to have a successful business.

796
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:06,640
And there's times where people will come forward and say, hey, if you do consulting or if you do

797
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,840
brand representation, what do you normally charge? And we'll talk about that. And then all of a sudden

798
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,440
they come forward and then I realized really quick, wait a minute, this is like being on a team where

799
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:23,120
the coach doesn't know what we're doing for practice. No one knows when to get here. And

800
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,600
I just tell them really fast, like, hey, this isn't the right team for me. I'm here to

801
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,320
help. It's like having that person that wants to lift with you, but they never show up.

802
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:42,400
If you're someone that has drive, you just, that's not part of your equation. That's a disruption.

803
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:50,640
And it's amazing to me how many people that have really good concepts, have really good investors,

804
01:17:51,360 --> 01:18:00,400
and then they come forward. And it's almost like if I look at it as a sport, there's no task.

805
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:08,400
The task portion or the work portion of this thing, which a lot of times having a product

806
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:16,160
reveal is that's like being at the world champs, but not having all the preparation going into that

807
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:22,000
really in the time that goes into that. And it starts to see that bloom and essentially you see

808
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,320
the fruit of that. If you don't have it, it's just, I don't know, it's not my DNA to want to be part

809
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:36,960
of that. And the amount of people that I know that fail because they are really good about the start

810
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,040
and they're really good about wanting to know how they want to finish, but they kind of lack the

811
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:47,040
in-between. It's just a destructive path. And it's unfortunate because I've seen good business

812
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,680
concepts. I've seen good people and I've seen good investors fail. And I normally see it pretty

813
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:58,800
quick where I'm like, hey, I'm out. There's another thing you've done that one can never

814
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:05,280
fully project this or convey this to people without them knowing you. But I do think there's

815
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:11,120
still an ability to convey it somewhat. And that is your podcast, even in your opening line to the

816
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:16,800
podcast says this is a podcast for all archers of all interest skill levels, independent of

817
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,800
the equipment you use this out of the other thing. And I want to come back and sort of sing the

818
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,600
praises of why your podcast is sort of one of the most important podcasts for me. But

819
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,000
there's something that you do that I know a lot of people aspire to be able to do, which is

820
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:36,640
you are someone who can sell something honestly. And that's not to say you're the same. I aspire

821
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:42,400
to it. I don't know if truthfully I convey as much of it as you do, but I know like, I just know

822
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,880
anytime I see something on your site, I can just buy it. Like I don't have to say, I wonder if

823
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:51,440
Dudley's just selling this cause he's getting a kickback on it. That's bigger than if he was,

824
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:58,320
I think that's rare. That's just hard to do. It's hard to do that because we're humans and I know

825
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:04,000
we're even subconsciously, we can be motivated by things we don't see, but do you spend a lot of

826
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,360
time thinking about the choices you make? Because I mean, I even told you this a while ago, but

827
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,160
when I was buying a target bow a year ago, I mean, I was torn between two companies and I tried both

828
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:23,200
of the bows out and I spent a lot of time and a lot of reps on each bow. And I mean, in the end,

829
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:28,720
you reviewed them and there was the one that you went with is the one I went with. I mean,

830
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,840
in the end, it was just going to come down to that. So it was that leap of faith. I probably

831
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,040
even paid more for the bow. And that's the type of leap of faith I think you take when you trust

832
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,440
what somebody has to say about something. And of course, in my world, there's different types

833
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:46,560
of products. Oh yeah. Yours is a million times worse than mine. Yeah. There's more snake oil in

834
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:51,280
my world than yours for sure. I guess what I'm getting at in a long-winded way is your credibility

835
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,680
is enormous. There's always people out. I know there's a lot of people that just,

836
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:00,320
they're incredibly jealous of the success that you've had because your success has really been

837
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,240
as a teacher, something we haven't even talked about yet, but we're going to. But the reality

838
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:09,920
of it is anybody who I've ever spoken with who's got even a half decent head on their shoulders

839
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,320
and who's honest, they can say, look, I don't agree with everything Dudley says, but he's the

840
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,960
real deal and he is honest. I mean, he is, he's credible. You can take what he says to the bank.

841
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,080
How deliberate is that for you to cultivate that? Well, it's super important. I mean,

842
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:33,600
it's really, really important. I was really lucky that when I was 18 and about to turn pro,

843
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:40,560
I went to an archery trade show and I walked by a company that I had just kind of started working

844
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:45,120
with, but I really wasn't working with them. But I walked by and I saw them in the process of

845
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,240
building their booth and I could tell they were late and this is at a trade show. So if you've

846
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:55,760
ever gone to any type of trade show, you know, you go in one or two days before people build this

847
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,880
thing. So I walked in and it was Matthews. It was Matthews archery and I could tell that they were

848
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,520
late and that they were building this new booth and it was a brand new one. They couldn't quite

849
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,280
figure out how it all went together. So I walked up and I said, Hey, do you guys need help? And

850
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,320
they said, yeah. So I jumped in there and I helped and ended up building this booth up. And then

851
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:22,080
the next day I was in there and just started talking about product to different people and

852
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,280
expressing my opinion. And then when that trade show was over, since I was already there, I'm

853
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,040
like, well, Hey, I'll help you guys get out of here. And I helped tear it down. That was just

854
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,760
kind of what you do, right? That's just part of personality types, especially the ones I like.

855
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:42,480
And the next, I think it was on the Monday, I got a call from the president of the company and he

856
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:49,600
just said, Hey, I'd love to hire you as a sales rep. You were, had unbelievable people skills and,

857
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,560
and so on. So, and eventually I went to work for that archery company

858
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:04,160
at 18 and a half or 19 years old, which was very small, very few employees, fast forward 10 years,

859
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:12,160
Inc 500 business twice, massive company. We recruited the largest ambassador team in the

860
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:20,640
history of archery, had the largest payouts in tournament archery of anybody. And because I was

861
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:27,520
internal in that company, I saw a lot of our people that we were paying to represent us

862
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:35,360
make really poor judgment calls that not only, not only made themselves look bad, but also

863
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,800
at times made the company look bad. And then also forced the company to make,

864
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,720
to make quick decisions on them to we're looking back. We were like, man,

865
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:54,480
we really need to cut this guy loose. Maybe we didn't, but at the time for him to release

866
01:23:54,480 --> 01:24:03,760
confidential information, yeah, it wasn't good. Or so because I was young and saw people making

867
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:10,080
mistakes that we were essentially hiring as pro staffers, and I was a pro staffer as well.

868
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:16,560
And then also because I was a pro staffer that worked for the company. So I was directly employed

869
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,000
by this company that employed this massive pro staff. So when I would go to an event,

870
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:29,360
I had rules on me that were 10 times everyone else's like, if I made a poor call on someone's

871
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,200
arrow, there was like a pro calling in saying like, Hey, what the heck you guys are my sponsor

872
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:40,080
and Dudley called my arrow out this weekend. I thought it was in. So I kind of started to have

873
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:47,040
to deal with that stuff. And because I dealt with all those little things, it just really

874
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:55,920
started to mold me on looking dot in my eyes, crossing my T's understanding that your integrity

875
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,040
is the archery world is very small. And these bridges, there's only a few bridges. And when

876
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:07,600
you burn them, they're burned. That's it. So the company I work for now, Hoyt, they were our biggest

877
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:14,480
competitor. And when I worked at Matthews, and I had lots of opportunities at sales conferences,

878
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:20,320
or product reveals or trade shows to talk poorly about the product, even though they had a good

879
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:24,160
product, I could have easily talked bad about them. I could have talked about about the employees

880
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:28,640
because I really didn't know them. But in the end, I always told him, I'm like, Hey, this is a small

881
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:33,600
world. There's only a few archery companies. I said, one day we might be working together,

882
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:40,640
maybe, who knows? And honestly, the day that I left Matthews, the first company that called me

883
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:45,920
was our biggest competitor. They're like, is it true you're not with Matthews? Yes, it is.

884
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:54,400
We would like to talk. And that was very clear to me that me being straightforward and truthful

885
01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:01,040
all the time, especially owning up to when I make mistakes and publicly telling everybody about when

886
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:07,600
I make a mistake about this or that, I think it's just critical. And I don't work with products I

887
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:13,520
don't like 100%. How do you handle it when, let's say you're at Matthews or you're now at Hoyt,

888
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,200
and there's a product that comes along and you don't like a piece of it? I mean, I guess maybe

889
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,840
now it's different because of who you are, you alone are a force of nature within the archery

890
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:31,360
world. But before you were the John Dudley, how did you handle that gap between, this is something

891
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:37,360
I'm not happy with guys, I can't go out and sell this product, and them say, hey man, do your job?

892
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:42,640
Well, there's two things to that. One is, if I really didn't like it, I can always shot what

893
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:48,320
I shot last year. The good thing is, they've all trusted me enough to where I'm normally shooting

894
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,280
stuff three to six months before anyone else anyway. And I normally know about it a year before.

895
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,960
And you're putting feedback into it.

896
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:01,440
Oh yeah, no question. But the other thing is, when stuff comes out, there's times where

897
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:07,360
competitors have brought out products that are definitely inferior to ones that I like.

898
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:12,240
The bottom line is, you don't talk about what other people do bad. You don't talk about what

899
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:17,120
you do bad, you talk about what you do right, or you talk about what you do better. And that's

900
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:24,640
how it always was. When I would go up and have these PR press releases in front of the media,

901
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:32,960
I would be going up and talking about what we had at Matthews that was better than anybody else.

902
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:38,480
I didn't have to say, these guys are five feet slower per second. These guys have a one inch

903
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:44,960
shorter brace height. This bow has seven percent more vibration in it. What I would do is be like,

904
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,840
we have seven percent less vibration than some of the models on the market. We've got a more

905
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:56,000
generous brace height. We come in at five feet per second faster. This bow shoots a lot smoother

906
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,800
in the hand. For me, I always feel like if you focus on either what you're doing right,

907
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:09,200
what your company's doing right, or what you want to do right, you're just going down a super shady

908
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:15,680
road to pick on the things that people might not be doing right at that time. And if it's a product

909
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:21,200
that I feel isn't right, you're just not going to see me do a review about it. I'm not going to

910
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:27,680
do a review to say it's poor. All I'm going to do is find another product to distract your attention

911
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:33,040
to something that is a better option for you. Well, it's great because again, now you are at

912
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:38,160
the point where you have the gravitas that you can just sort of curate what is the best.

913
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,600
And then that makes life a lot easier for people like me. And I talk about this a lot on your

914
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:52,000
podcast, but there's 10 different turns of complete luck that just allowed me to, from the day I got

915
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:58,960
my first bow to be sort of plugged in straight from JR right into your YouTube channel and all

916
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:04,640
of your videos and by extension and the methodology, which sort of leads me to my next question.

917
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:11,040
When did it become clear to you that you had an act for teaching, which a lot of people who are

918
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,680
exceptional at the craft are actually not the best teachers at it. So there's a very

919
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:24,320
rare overlap between people who are in say the top 1% of doing something and then the top 1%

920
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:32,000
of teaching. That's not a huge overlap. I don't really know how that came to be. I think some of

921
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:38,320
its personality, I mean, I'm a good PR person. I like communicating with people. I think I'm easy

922
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:46,000
to engage with. So I think that naturally helps any teacher or any coach. Even donkeys. I mean,

923
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:52,880
I've seen you interact with standing donkeys. I was debating whether you're going to release

924
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,760
that to your followers, but I'm hoping by the time this podcast has come out, the donkey video

925
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,920
is already out and we will just be linking to it through this podcast.

926
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:09,040
Okay. It might be. But I've also been really fortunate to be around really good coaches too

927
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:19,360
that did a great job of leading by example of teaching. And like I said, I've always thrived

928
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:24,240
to learn how to do stuff better. It was that way even about weightlifting. Like earlier today,

929
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:31,840
I was at Frank Zane's house. He's a former Mr. Olympia and Frank and I have been friends

930
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:38,480
a long time. We met because he loved archery and him and Arnold shot archery as their R&R during

931
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:46,480
their kind of golden era bodybuilding. Right. And so we met at an Arnold classic and him and I hit

932
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:51,200
it off and he kind of asked for archery lessons and I said, yeah, sure. And what was funny is he

933
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:57,920
said, well, I'm doing a bodybuilding or I'm doing a training seminar up at a gym in Minneapolis. So

934
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,320
he said, what I might do is rent a car. And I said, actually, I'll, if I can sit in your class,

935
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:08,320
I'd love to drive up. So I went up and sat into his class and I saw how he delivered and I'm like,

936
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:14,320
man, I said, you have such a really cool presentation technique. And then he just said,

937
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:18,960
well, up until the last three years of my bodybuilding career, I had to have a job as a teacher.

938
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:26,640
He's like, that's what I do. And he was perfect at it. So he gave me pointers about delivery and

939
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:32,560
how to put things in front of people to where they can see it and understand it, or you can express

940
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:39,600
it and understand it, or also how you can, if you're really good at what you're talking about,

941
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:45,360
you can find a way pretty fast to relate it to something that you know, the person you're

942
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:54,000
coaching also likes. So I didn't know a lot about you. I knew a few details. I knew you're into F1.

943
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,600
I knew that I knew you're into swimming, biking. Obviously, when I worked with Jocko,

944
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:06,960
I knew Jocko's background as a SEAL. So when I explained certain things, I might not be the best

945
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:13,200
at relating it exactly of how you do it within your field, but I can give you just enough

946
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:18,640
to where all of a sudden, hopefully you grasp what it is I'm saying, just in case I'm talking

947
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:26,000
on a level that's like outside of your world. When we talked about the speed of your shot execution,

948
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:33,680
I told you, I said, you're making a great shot, but you're making your shot at a very accelerated

949
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:41,040
pace. And so I told you, it's a lot like if you have a group of people in a car and I say,

950
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:45,760
hey, let's go 100 miles an hour, but I don't want anyone in the car to know that you did it.

951
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:53,920
I said, you would throttle at a pace to where you were continually gradual and you would be there,

952
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,240
but you wouldn't be there with snapping everyone's necks backwards. And I said,

953
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:03,200
right now with your release, you're putting your finger on the trigger and you're wanting this

954
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:08,960
shot to happen so fast, even though you're executing it properly, you're executing it

955
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:15,680
too aggressively. So I said, I want you to make this happen without letting anyone know

956
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:20,080
that it's happening. And then the next shot, I'm like, dude, that's it. And then right away,

957
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:25,680
I thought, oh, okay. I said, how much did that relate to you and your car simulator? And you're

958
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:31,680
like, oh, instantly it clicked. Well, not only that, I think what was the very, very first

959
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:38,560
thing, the very first insight was about the elbow position. We talked about this quite a bit on your

960
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,160
podcast and you put a video together. That's really nice. That explains this. And I know

961
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:46,560
that many people listening to this aren't, a lot of stuff won't make sense, but the example,

962
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:51,120
the point you were making was look right now, Peter, with your hand that's in the back,

963
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:58,720
your release hand, the elbow is probably about five to eight degrees off where it need to be,

964
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:05,280
rotational degrees. So very little, grossly looks like it's in the right spot. But at that angle,

965
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:12,240
your lats and deltoids and biceps are doing the work when you have to release the shot.

966
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,600
And you said, I want you to put your elbow here. And that was, that felt like a very unnatural

967
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,400
position to me, even though it was only five, seven degrees back. It was like two inches,

968
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:27,760
like looking from the back, it was like two inches. It's so subtle. But you said, now I'm putting you

969
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,880
in this position and I want you to notice all of a sudden your bicep is totally relaxed, your lats

970
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:38,480
totally relaxed. And now all of the stress of holding that bow and that release is on your

971
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:45,520
rhomboids, which is a tiny little muscle. And now you're going to release this arrow just contracting

972
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:51,040
those rhomboids, which by the way, we're partially being contracted before, but it was being dwarfed

973
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:57,120
by the larger muscles. And you said, and this was what really amazed me was you said, think about how

974
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:06,160
if you are driving a car, you can easily use your quads, glutes, and hamstrings to move between the

975
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:12,000
throttle and the brake. But wouldn't it be more effective if you could just sort of use the heel

976
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,240
and the toe going back and forth and the intrinsic muscles of the foot and maybe a little bit of the

977
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:22,640
calf and the anterior compartment of the leg, which of course is exactly how you drive. You drive with

978
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:29,520
finesse, you drive using the smallest muscles possible and not stomping in a binary fashion

979
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:36,080
where it's all or none, but having that gradation of the difference between a 10 pedal and a 7 pedal.

980
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:40,560
And there's a big difference between a 10 brake and a 7 brake. Yeah, I think that just impressed

981
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:46,720
me. And I, one, I got it immediately. I mean, it just spoke to me, but two, I was like, you don't

982
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:51,120
even know anything about driving. Like you're not obsessive about race car driving. It was very

983
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,080
interesting to me that you picked that up. And I guess I never realized

984
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:59,440
that you've been thinking about this so much. Because I know you've done the same with Jocko.

985
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,720
Like Jocko has talked to me about first time you told him how to shoot, like you immediately

986
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:09,680
related it to a rifle because you know, he's got more experience shooting a rifle than

987
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:15,120
virtually anybody. And you could immediately put something in those terms. And within minutes,

988
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:18,640
Jocko's like getting something that he just probably wouldn't have got for a longer period

989
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:22,480
of time if you weren't able to connect it to him. And I don't know, I think I've just always been

990
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:29,760
impressed by that. And I think your generosity when it comes to teaching is really amazing. I think,

991
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,000
look, I think everybody, I mean, to me, archery is a beautiful sport. It's one of those sports like

992
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,680
tennis where you can do it for a long time. It's not like football. You know, the reality of it is,

993
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:44,720
if you'd gone to college and you'd played football, you wouldn't be playing football today. In fact,

994
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:49,440
you might not be doing anything today. I might not be in archery today. Yeah. Yeah. And I really

995
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:55,600
hope that my kids get into it because everything you said about it, this Zen idea, this flow state,

996
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,600
all of these things are beautiful. You never want to hunt an animal in your life, which was, I

997
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,240
certainly had no intention of hunting when I started. It teaches you a lot about yourself.

998
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:10,880
And it is a beautiful metaphor for life in so many ways. This ability to understand that the only

999
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,680
arrow you have control over is the one that's still in your quiver. You can't turn back time.

1000
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:20,400
That's such an explicit thing. Your ability to teach this sport is, I think somebody could

1001
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:26,640
literally study your videos and get 60 to 70% of the total theoretical benefit that one could get

1002
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:32,000
having a great coach standing over their shoulder, which is hard to believe when you consider how

1003
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,480
nuanced the sport is. I mean, the list goes on and on, but the number of students that I have that

1004
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:46,080
I've worked with less than a dozen times that are shooting at a level that back when I competed,

1005
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:51,440
there were such a small percentage of shooters that were even at that level. You get someone

1006
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:57,680
like Jaco, worked with them for a day, coached a little bit through the phone, gave him a little

1007
01:37:57,680 --> 01:38:02,800
bit of practice. He showed up here, I wouldn't guess a lot, maybe a few times, and then took

1008
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:09,760
him to his first tournament style event in July. We went to Big Sky and I let him set up a course

1009
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:15,200
with me. I actually built a course that some of our followers were shooting and I asked Jaco, I

1010
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:20,080
said, do you want to come out and set this course? Because I said, I'll teach you why I'm building

1011
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:25,520
the course this way and what you'll learn from every shot. And he's like, absolutely. So we went

1012
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,960
out, I talked to him, told him all about different techniques, what you do, what people that lay a

1013
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:38,080
course out do to trick you and so forth like that. And he went out there and the day before the real

1014
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:45,760
shoot started, I went up with Jaco and another SEAL buddy of ours, Trevor and Sharon, my wife,

1015
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:53,040
and I said, let's go up and shoot. We won't shoot from like the competition stake. We'll move closer.

1016
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:58,320
And I said, because I just want to talk you through something. So after we did that, we shot probably

1017
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:04,320
20 or 30 targets shooting pretty close, then also a little bit further back, then further back. Then

1018
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,720
I'm like, hey, this one isn't bad. You want to try this one from the stake? And he's like, yeah,

1019
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:15,600
no problem. And then the next day we show up and I had a private event where people had booked

1020
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,560
private shooting times to shoot with me and some of my VIP friends that I had there.

1021
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:26,400
And so my intention was to shoot four or five targets with each of those groups. So the very

1022
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:34,160
first group that I shot with was Jaco and another mutual friend of ours, Andy, and the people that

1023
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:39,520
had signed up. So I shot five targets with them. Jaco was hitting all the targets and he was

1024
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:47,280
shooting them from the proper stake, which was that course that I laid out averaged 71 yards.

1025
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:55,840
It was super technical, super hard. And I told people the stake is the hardest shot here. You're

1026
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:02,720
always welcome to walk closer. There's no scorecards here. This is kind of a learning event. And

1027
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:08,400
I got to the end and I remember asking Jaco, I'm like, how'd you do? He's like, I miss one target.

1028
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:15,840
And he knew exactly why he knew exactly why. And I said, dude, that is unbelievable for you to be

1029
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:24,560
shooting at best if he was adding up his arrows to what I would do in a day training when I was

1030
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:31,520
serious about it. He might've shot three of my training days, right? And to be able to learn

1031
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:37,360
the techniques and the basics and be set up that perfectly with your equipment, and then to have

1032
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:44,080
the understanding of what you need to do. It's amazing, but I really feel like it's a necessity,

1033
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:53,040
not only to archery, but to any sport for people to recognize the fact that the fundamentals

1034
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:59,600
is what makes people good at things. And when people are good at things, they stay involved.

1035
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,640
So I've always said like, my boy Harry, he had some video games and stuff that he played

1036
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:11,360
in high school and normally for Christmas, he'd ask for video games. And I noticed really quick

1037
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:18,160
that the video games that he played all the time were the ones that he was good at. The ones that

1038
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:24,640
he didn't win and the ones that were like failed, those ones just went back in the drawer and they

1039
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:32,560
never got played again. And it's the same way. And as parents, especially now, I look at any kids

1040
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,680
and I'm like, what you need to do is you need to make this fun and you need to make sure that

1041
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:42,800
they're doing well at it a lot so that they stay involved with it. But that wasn't necessarily the

1042
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:48,400
case for you. I mean, that to me is where... But I was also older, yet I remember. So do you think

1043
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,800
that that's sort of what you're just describing is what's necessary when you're dealing with

1044
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:59,280
kids that are in their early teens or pre-teens? Pre-teens for sure. Like yourself, you're nerded

1045
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,520
out right now with archery, right? And you really want your kids to maybe be involved. So if they

1046
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,920
said, hey, I want to shoot, it's highly likely that you would probably be a little bit more intense

1047
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:17,040
with that practice, then what I would say is get the biggest bullseye possible, put one target

1048
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:27,200
that's 10 yards away, even if you're shooting at 70 or 80, and let them shoot at 10 yards all the

1049
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:32,560
time and just say, okay, you shoot for the gold and I'm going to shoot for the gold. And then

1050
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,440
they're going to hit nine out of 10 and they're always going to be beating dad, right? And they're

1051
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:45,280
going to like that. When I started archery, part of the reason why I did it and liked it, but also

1052
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:52,080
didn't get super serious about it is because my arrows were all the ones that my dad had lost,

1053
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:58,560
bent, or picked up in the lost and found bucket at the archery range. So I was just shooting

1054
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:05,280
a smorgasbord of arrows and getting a smorgasbord of results down on the paper. So it's amazing to

1055
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:10,960
me that I really stuck with it because I probably would have been more infatuated with it. And

1056
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,800
honestly, I probably looking back because naturally, I think you said it the other day,

1057
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:22,480
I went out and you made a shot and it was super peaceful in the morning and you made this shot

1058
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:28,160
and I was like, don't. And you go, do you think there's something primal about that sound?

1059
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:35,520
And I said, yeah, absolutely. Like that is a primal sound. And you were excited about that.

1060
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:41,280
You had that excitement. I feel like there could easily have been a good chance that

1061
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:49,120
me turning into this punk kid, it might not have ever happened if I would have really got into like

1062
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:54,400
going to an archery range with my dad. If I would have been good at it, really liked it, like that

1063
01:43:54,400 --> 01:44:00,080
could have been my thing. So I don't really know, but I think that's important for, especially for

1064
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:08,240
me working with kids now. And I'm pretty limited on who I work with like yourself. But when I do

1065
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:15,280
work with people, I tell parents all the time, I'm like, you can't acclimate your kid to as soon as

1066
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:22,080
he shoots, looking at you for you to tell him what the score is. I'm like, that is a really bad

1067
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:29,440
training thing for you to do. Because I'm like, you're imprinting your result, him immediately

1068
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:36,800
wanting your feedback for whether he hit or missed or she. And I just think it can't be about that.

1069
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:43,600
I tell the parents, regardless of what your kids score, watch them on the shooting line and tell

1070
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,840
them when they're shooting good or tell them when they might need to make technique changes if

1071
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:55,040
maybe they're not executing properly. I think finding that balance, I think it really helps,

1072
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:59,600
not only the kid, but I think it helps the sport, all sports, because I think people

1073
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,160
will be involved in it more when they are that way.

1074
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:06,880
Well, let's pivot a little bit to hunting because it's hard to talk about archery without

1075
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:13,200
talking about this extension of archery, which is hunting using the tools of archery. And as I

1076
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:18,000
talked about in some length, I guess, on your podcast, when I got into archery, it was purely

1077
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,200
for the desire to shoot paper targets and learn a new skill that would meet the Peter Itia criteria

1078
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:29,920
of you could spend your entire life trying to get the last 20% of value that'll be so

1079
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:35,520
incremental, no one will notice but you, which gave you a huge kick. But eventually I did decide to

1080
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:42,320
go out and hunt and it has changed my relationship with archery for reasons you've already somewhat

1081
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:47,200
alluded to. First of all, the stakes are much higher now. So now every time I miss a shot on

1082
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:52,800
a paper target, it hurts a little more. I imagine for a moment, any one of these shots I take could

1083
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:59,760
be a shot in the field against an animal. And if I miss that shot and I injure that animal non-fadily

1084
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,720
or injure that animal or cause that animal to suffer, I've made a mistake. And that of course

1085
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:09,760
is exactly what got me interested in the sport in the first place was that concept, even though

1086
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:14,320
I never wanted to apply it to hunting, if that makes sense. You've spoken a lot. In fact, I think

1087
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:20,160
that when you and Joe Rogan have spoken about hunting on his podcast, which you've probably

1088
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,720
been on Rogan like five times or something, I've heard every one of those podcasts, they're super

1089
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:31,120
enjoyable. I think you and Joe have some of the best back and forth on this because I mean, one,

1090
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:36,960
I just, I think Joe is a really smart human being and he's always good at seeing sort of both sides

1091
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:43,040
of every discussion. So it's not what a lot of people might expect, which is two knucklehead bros

1092
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:46,960
talking about how hunting is the best thing in the world. And anybody who doesn't like hunting is

1093
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,720
a hippie or something. It's not at all like that, right? It's a very nuanced discussion. So

1094
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:58,480
one of the things that you've often alluded to is the yin and the yang of this sort of tension

1095
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:02,880
that exists. So I've been thinking about how to talk about this and there's so much in my mind

1096
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,680
around this, but I'll start with just maybe explain to someone who's listening to this,

1097
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:12,640
who's never hunted, who's never thought much about it one way or the other, which is effectively

1098
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:17,200
where I was two years ago. I'd never really given it a thought. How does hunting fit into

1099
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:23,360
conservation? Like what does it mean to hunt and who decides what animals get to be hunted

1100
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:27,520
and when and in what quantity? Like, is it the wild west? Can anyone just go shoot anything they

1101
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:35,360
want? How does this whole thing work? No. So each state has Department of Natural Resources or

1102
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:41,680
Department of Game and Fish. They do a lot of studies on where that species is at and what

1103
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:49,440
the population numbers are at. And with that, they also decide how many need to be taken to keep that

1104
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:58,240
herd in proper management. And then with that, they sell those tags and non-residents often pay

1105
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:08,960
a multiplier more than the residents. And those funds end up going back into conservation to

1106
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:15,680
a magnitude of programs. I mean, if you look at national parks that you have, or if you go into

1107
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:23,360
a lot of the public wildlife areas that we have in Iowa, you'll see sunflowers planted,

1108
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:30,080
CRP grasses, you'll see row crop that's planted in there in certain times. Obviously, there's

1109
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:39,600
waterways with fish and so forth in there. And the monies from fishing licenses, that's what

1110
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:46,640
pays to restock those ponds or dredge those out or put them in those wetland programs. The sunflowers

1111
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:51,920
and stuff that I talked about, that's probably an allocation that came from the pheasant tags or the

1112
01:48:51,920 --> 01:49:00,000
upland game tags. So a lot of that stuff that they get, it's to put back in and to also be able to

1113
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,480
employ those game wardens to be out there policing that and checking people's tags and making sure

1114
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:13,760
they're not overtaking their quotas and etc. So there really is a check and balance system that's

1115
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:22,720
out there and I totally get it. Earlier today, I was down on the beach cruising around on a scooter

1116
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:30,160
that I was renting for whatever it is, a dollar every 10 minutes or whatever. And cruising around

1117
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:36,960
down there on the beach, I might have seen one person's cat and a seagull. Well, I saw a lot of seagulls.

1118
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:43,280
So it would be totally understandable for me to see that person's side of the story to say,

1119
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:50,480
why do you need to shoot a deer? Why do you need to shoot an elk? The difference is you go to a place

1120
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:58,800
like Iowa, for example, where I'm at, where every year I could, well, Wisconsin I knew.

1121
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:04,000
When I lived in Wisconsin, I knew that. So every year, I think there was about 750,000 deer that

1122
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:11,680
were shot. But that was every year and it had to be, but there was still millions and millions of

1123
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:22,080
dollars paid out every year for insurance claims, for deer collisions with vehicles, and six deaths

1124
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:29,680
a year on average, oftentimes more. I think it's hundreds of deaths nationwide a year for animal

1125
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:35,200
collisions. And this is- We will put together in our show notes the exact numbers, but my recollection

1126
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:40,400
is it's a little over a million collisions a year between deer- Nationally.

1127
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:45,520
Nationally. Yeah. Between deer and automobile in the United States, about a million too. My memory

1128
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,360
so much more accurately, it's about 100,000 collisions a month between deer and automobiles

1129
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:56,080
nationwide. And the dollar amount of that is about four or five billion. Was it? I can be

1130
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:00,960
wrong. We'll put the numbers in here, but- Yeah, that would be great. It's higher than I recall,

1131
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:06,240
sort of higher than I would have guessed. And my wife, she's from England. She's from just north

1132
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:12,640
of Liverpool. And when we met, we kind of talked a little bit about hunting and she was awesome

1133
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:17,360
with the fact that I told her, I'm like, Hey, I get it. Over here, when I'm in Europe, I wouldn't

1134
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:23,280
hunt deer over here. There aren't any. I'm a hunter. And all I would say is we need to find a

1135
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:28,480
way to get your numbers up. Like let's get your numbers up. As a hunter, I would love to get the

1136
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:34,480
numbers healthier so that, yeah, maybe there is an opportunity to regulate down the road. I don't

1137
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:40,720
want them to go away. I don't want them to decline. That's really not what we want. When we look at

1138
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:47,680
the numbers of white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, elk, all those things, these are based on programs

1139
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:51,760
that have been- Probably the boar and the wild pigs might be some of the most destructive animals.

1140
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:56,480
Oh, they are the most. Yeah. They're definitely, you can't keep up with their numbers. Their numbers

1141
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:04,000
are staggering. If you look at the life cycle of one female pig and how many pigs she could be a

1142
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,840
multiplier of, it will blow your mind and you can't keep up with it. Right. Very short gestation

1143
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,400
cycle, very quick. With the high litter count. With a high survival of litter. Yeah. And then

1144
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,760
they're also, her foal are already breeding within six months. Once they're born, they could

1145
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:24,960
potentially breed again in six months. Right. So yeah, it's different. And I told her, I said,

1146
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,600
when you come to the stage, you might see things a little different, which yeah, once she came to

1147
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:37,760
the stage, she realized there's 20 deer a night in our garden. We can't grow food fast enough

1148
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,880
to eat because the deer are eating it every night. I don't know if you were here when she was

1149
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:43,840
talking about it, when we were having dinner tonight, we were getting a bunch of stuff right

1150
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,800
in. She was saying to your son, she's like, God, what a dream it would be to actually be able to

1151
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,600
grow all of our own vegetables. But it's like, you just can't do it where you live because the deer

1152
01:52:53,600 --> 01:53:00,560
are going to smoke them. Yeah, they would. So I get it. But I also feel like we fill two freezers a

1153
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:09,600
year with animals that I've trained for all year, buy a tag, put money back into the natural resources,

1154
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:16,560
shoot this deer, process it, put it in my freezer. And I know everything about it. I didn't

1155
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:24,640
provide and I guess support commercial farming. I didn't do that, which I feel pretty good about.

1156
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:31,440
I know exactly where it came from. I know who touched it start to finish. And also it just,

1157
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:36,720
I don't know, it means more to me. Part of the reason why I'm passionate about cooking is because

1158
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:43,760
I'm passionate about, I'm passionate about taking something I've put a lot of work into and finishing

1159
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:50,960
it by serving it to people that are important to me. And if we waste it and throw it away, to me,

1160
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:57,680
there's a lot of hard work that went in that. If I get an elk, that means I've lifted weights all

1161
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:03,120
year, prepping for that time. I've shot my bow. I've worked on my equipment. I've probably bought

1162
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:10,160
equipment. So I've invested. I went out and then I put on the miles. Like last year, I think when

1163
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:16,560
we shot our first elk, I had hunted with my buddy Andy, who I talked about earlier. We started

1164
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:24,480
hunting, I think August 24th. And then we shot his bull on 9-11. And I think at that time,

1165
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:32,320
between the two of us, we had put, I think it was somewhere around 200 to 250 miles on the ground,

1166
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:40,880
on our GPS's before we got that shot. And I mean, it was such a reward. And then to break this whole

1167
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:48,000
thing down, package it all up, pack it out, three mile pack out. How many trips? It took three of us

1168
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:55,200
two trips. Well, how many pounds of meat? Heck, if I know a lot. I mean, easily 500, right? Yeah,

1169
01:54:55,200 --> 01:55:00,640
yeah, quite a bit. And then through that we've used it for, and then I shot a bull a few days

1170
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:06,800
later. I took my bull, took the prime cuts, took them home, have used those on my family, took all

1171
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:11,680
the trim, actually grounded into Burger, because I knew I was going to be having that event in Big

1172
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:17,840
Sky, where I was going to be at that big archery tournament. And we really wanted to have a community

1173
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:25,920
thank you to the people that follow us. So I think Sharon packed and cooked over the course of a few

1174
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:33,440
days, close to 500 elk burgers at that place that we gave out to people for free. And every person

1175
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:38,880
that was like, that's the best burger I've ever eaten. I thought every freaking mile that we pack

1176
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:44,560
that sucker out of there was totally worth it. That's a very remarkable and special experience,

1177
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:50,080
which we talked about a little bit on your show when I was in Hawaii and the axis deer, which are

1178
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:55,120
very invasive there. Axis deer, just for you folks listening to this, are a beautiful, beautiful deer,

1179
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:59,280
probably when you think of a deer. I mean, at least when I always thought of Bambi, it was really an

1180
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:03,920
axis deer. It's a brown deer with the white spots. And they're, I mean, they're simply gorgeous,

1181
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:08,320
actually. I've never seen a prettier animal in nature, but they're not native to the United

1182
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:15,600
States. They evolved in India and they evolved with only one natural predator, which was the tiger.

1183
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:24,240
And there's few things that will sharpen your skills of evading than a tiger. So these animals

1184
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:29,920
evolved to have remarkable vision, not color vision, but remarkable vision. They can basically

1185
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,960
see things in frames per second. We can't. Their sense of smell is preternatural and their hearing

1186
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:41,200
is from another planet. And their muscle twitch is, imagine being able to recruit any type of

1187
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:48,000
cornerback or wingback or a halfback with that kind of muscle twitch factor. Yeah. They're a muscle,

1188
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,960
they're an animal that twitches so much that even long after it's dead, it's still twitching like

1189
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:57,120
crazy. Yeah. They're so fast. And then it was brought to the United States or at least brought

1190
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:04,720
to Hawaii maybe 120, 150 years ago, which is a speck of time in terms of evolution. So as far

1191
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:10,560
as it's concerned, the tiger is still what it is built to evade. And then you've got clowns like us

1192
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:16,960
trying to track it down and such. And in the process, because it has no predator in the entire

1193
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:22,800
state, it has multiplied at a rate that on the three islands in which it's present, it outnumbers

1194
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:28,960
people by anywhere from two to one to 10 to one. And it's basically destroyed the land such that

1195
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:33,360
now the livestock don't have what they have. So the government of Hawaii has basically said,

1196
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:40,800
look, we've got to get rid of this animal entirely. And so the compromise is to allow it to be hunted

1197
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,280
in an ethical way rather than just a wholesale slaughter, which is some really interesting

1198
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:50,080
stories about that, which may be for another time. But point I wanted to make was the people of Hawaii

1199
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:56,400
know this. Everybody I spoke with who worked at the hotel or elsewhere in the city, they understood

1200
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:02,640
that this is a problem. This animal is a pest. And when I remember the first day I went hunting

1201
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:08,080
there and I brought back a deer and I took it to the restaurant there and I met with the chef and

1202
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:13,360
we became friends and she cooked it up for our family and for the restaurant staff. And she said,

1203
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:17,120
this is the first time I've ever been able to cook an axis deer. She's from Hawaii. She lives there,

1204
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:21,120
but she'd never cooked it before. She'd never had someone bring her. Mind blowing. Yeah, it's mind

1205
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:24,560
well, cause it's not commercially available, right? Like if you don't know somebody who's hunting it,

1206
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:29,120
you're not going to get it. You can't go to a store and buy it. And then fast forward a couple

1207
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:34,240
days, we got a much larger animal and it was enough to be able to feed all the staff of the

1208
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:38,640
restaurant. This is a smaller scale version of what you were talking about, but what a really

1209
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:45,040
special feeling to be able to say, this is a circle of life here. This is a beautiful animal,

1210
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:50,800
but it's now out of balance with our environment. And this is a little part that we can do to bring

1211
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,680
it back into balance and in the process that those amino acids, that carbon, that nitrogen is going

1212
01:58:55,680 --> 01:59:01,600
to come back into the people who live here, who have lived here and who are not working here. So

1213
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:05,200
I just don't think I would have ever understood that. If someone tried to explain this to me

1214
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,400
five years ago, I think I could have intellectually understood it, but I don't think I could have

1215
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:12,320
viscerally or emotionally understood it. And maybe someone listening to this now who hasn't

1216
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:17,680
done it will feel the same way, but I'm certain they will. It's an impossible thing. You can

1217
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:27,200
try your best to talk about it in a way that where people will at least embrace the idea of it. And

1218
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:33,600
they'll be curious about it. I don't know if I've ever been with someone that decided to pursue it

1219
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:38,880
and see what it was really about. And then they did it and then said, I didn't like anything about

1220
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:44,480
that. Most people would trigger something to where they just end up saying it was so much

1221
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:50,320
different. I feel so much differently about food that I'm buying in a store. I kind of want to ask

1222
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:57,040
him like what it came from, what it was like. And you just realize you're missing out on this

1223
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:06,160
huge, huge piece of what's weird is think of the rappers we read, especially you. But I walked in

1224
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:12,320
everything we're eating, we're label readers, which you should be. You should be. But people

1225
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:18,880
they don't read that on red meat or chicken. I mean, they might be like, well, I want organic

1226
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:24,960
chickens. I don't want any type of steroid in my turkeys or whatever. But other than that,

1227
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:29,840
there's not a lot more questions asked besides that. You know, it's funny. I actually had the

1228
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:35,600
privilege, I guess, to go and actually see a place where the cattle were slaughtered. And this is

1229
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:40,240
considered about one of the most humane places it can be done. I don't want to tell necessarily

1230
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:46,240
where because this is such a polarizing topic, I understand. And it's true as far as cows being

1231
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:52,480
commercially raised and allowed to eat grass and not given hormones and not given antibiotics,

1232
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:58,480
it's about as healthy as it gets. But you couldn't help but be struck with the stress that the animals

1233
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:03,360
were under when it came time to be slaughtered. Cows might not be the sharpest tools in the shed,

1234
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:08,960
but they know that something's wrong. When they're walking through this sort of steel barricade

1235
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:12,640
that's funneling them and getting narrower and narrower and narrower to a point where they're

1236
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:18,240
being slaughtered. One, you know, they're not truly wild animals still. They haven't really lived.

1237
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:22,160
We could debate the consciousness of animals all day long, but even absent consciousness,

1238
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:26,880
I still think an animal has, there's different qualities of life that can be given. That

1239
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:33,680
experience coupled with actually seeing what a wild animal looks like and watching how if you can be

1240
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:41,440
an exceptional archer or hunter, if you're using a gun, if you can end that animal's life without

1241
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:47,440
its suffering and it's basically lived for four years in perfect nature, eating exactly what it's

1242
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:52,240
supposed to be, eating, behaving and moving exactly what's supposed to move. And then in a moment,

1243
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:58,640
its life ended. It just strikes me as the single most ethical and healthy way you can consume that.

1244
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:03,840
And what you said a moment ago really resonates. When I got back from my very first hunting trip,

1245
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:09,760
I simply, I didn't know what to eat when I was at restaurants. Like when I went out and didn't have

1246
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:16,000
control over what kind of meat was being served, it was very difficult for me to eat, to just order

1247
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,360
a steak off the menu. In fact, I really lost my taste for it because I was like, ah, you can just

1248
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:27,120
maybe, of course it was maybe all in my mind, but I could almost just taste the unhealthiness

1249
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:31,840
of what that animal lived like. So paradoxically, and it was a long-winded way of saying this,

1250
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:38,400
paradoxically, it gave me a greater appreciation for the people who oppose the consumption

1251
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,920
of meat based on the ethical treatment of the animal, which is odd, right? You wouldn't think

1252
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:47,760
that hunting would make you more compassionate and more considerate of how the animal is treated.

1253
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,280
But for me, it has done that. And for many people, I know it's the same for you. I know it's the same

1254
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:55,760
many of my other friends in this world. That's exactly the effect it's had.

1255
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:02,960
Yeah. There's so many things that hunting has showed me in nature that I would have never,

1256
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:07,920
ever got to experience, just timeless things. I mean, it's kind of like when you watch

1257
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:14,560
Forrest Gump and he was making that run back and forth across the US and they kept showing

1258
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:21,520
these parts of America that were just breathtakingly beautiful. And a lot of people

1259
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:28,320
just take for granted some of that scenery, some of that nature and how amazing it was.

1260
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:35,920
But being an outdoors person, I see that stuff a lot and I don't take it for granted. It's something

1261
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:42,960
to where I want to go back every day. I want to see it all the time. And more importantly,

1262
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:50,560
for me now is I see that first moment when someone goes out and actually bow hunts for

1263
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:56,960
the first time and makes a shot and kind of sees it and watches the breakdown and puts in the effort

1264
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:02,720
to get it out of there. And then you kind of grill their first piece. It's like, as soon as you see

1265
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:10,480
him take it, you can see in their face, wow, this is the most meaningful meal that I've ever done.

1266
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:16,560
That is what Thanksgiving should really be. That's kind of what it was, is when everyone

1267
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:23,280
came together with this group effort to have this big feast. And that's kind of what digs out of

1268
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:29,520
you primarily when you go out and have your first hunt, experience with people that are close. And

1269
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:34,960
then all of a sudden you cook it for the first time and give it to your family and explain to

1270
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:40,800
your kids where it came from and all those little aspects that you were telling me you did. I think

1271
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:46,720
all that just plays into being more meaningful. Yeah. We talked about this a lot on your podcast,

1272
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,880
so I won't repeat it and we'll link to that so people can go back and hear it. Because I think

1273
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:55,120
we had a lot to say about it. And I don't think I said this on the podcast, which is why I repeat

1274
02:04:55,120 --> 02:05:00,400
it now. One of our guides in Hawaii, Ooka, who's all of those guys are like, they're magical. They're

1275
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:06,080
sorcerers to me. They definitely have a sense that the rest of us that certainly I don't have.

1276
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:13,120
When my daughter was there, when I shot that buck, he was amazing. He was amazing the way he talked

1277
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:17,280
to her. My Nala Juka doesn't have kids. I don't know if he spent that much time around 10 year old

1278
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:23,040
girls, let alone, right? In fact, I'm pretty sure he didn't because at one point when Mike and I went

1279
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:28,800
off to hike, Ooka and Olivia went off and he let her drive the Polaris up and down the hills. I was

1280
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,760
like, oh my God, how do they not die? But I remember him saying to her, he looked at her really

1281
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:37,360
seriously and he goes, you know, this is in your blood, right? And she was like, kind of looked at

1282
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:41,920
him like, what do you mean? And he goes, he said, you are a hunter. You wouldn't be here, Olivia,

1283
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:48,720
if this wasn't a part of who you are. And she really got that. He really said it in such a profound

1284
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:54,560
way. I knew what he meant immediately and I think it took her one more repetition to do so, but then

1285
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:59,040
she got it. She got it, which was, yeah, there was a day when you didn't go to the grocery store.

1286
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,800
Like there was a day and it was tens of thousands of years ago or even thousands of years ago when

1287
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:10,560
this was the only way you had to be able to do this on some level. And the pride with which he

1288
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:15,680
was able to speak about that to her and share it with her, I just thought it was the lighted she

1289
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:21,200
was there and couldn't imagine waiting to do it again. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Well, if you look back

1290
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:28,960
to how long ago was it really when on that island where you could go to a grocery store and buy

1291
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:33,120
food? I mean, if you go back- There are people that are still there now, especially on islands,

1292
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:36,320
like they're less populated where- They may never have.

1293
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:39,440
I know people there that subside exclusively on what they hunt and fish.

1294
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:43,840
Exactly. Yeah. Well, I get it. I get when people don't understand it.

1295
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:48,080
Have you ever been confronted harshly? Have you ever found yourself in a situation where there's

1296
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:52,720
been a really harsh confrontation when someone is really just sort of aggressively saying,

1297
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:55,680
John, how dare you do this? This is an awful thing that you do.

1298
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:02,720
Yeah, I've had a few people that have been pretty disgruntled, mainly in Europe, but sometimes I

1299
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:10,400
feel like it would be like me trying to talk with Jaco deeply about what happens in war. Even if I

1300
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:16,240
have an agreeance or disagreeance with it, we're not even on the same field for that. I don't feel

1301
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:21,840
like I really would have a right to, and he probably, with me being a friend, maybe he would

1302
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:27,520
go a little bit into detail, but all I can do is just say, I see your point. You're somewhere where

1303
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:32,880
just isn't going to be clear to you. And I think that's the best way really to address it. I'd

1304
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:38,560
tell the hunting community a lot. We don't really want to provoke. You kind of don't want to poke

1305
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:44,560
the sleeping bear, so to speak, because there's a lot of people that'll never hear podcasts like

1306
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:49,760
this. There's a lot of people that will never understand the necessity behind it. We talked

1307
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:57,200
earlier about Frank Zane. Frank's as zen of a dude as you could ever get. He's totally zen. But I

1308
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:03,200
remember we were talking one time, because he's really into meditation. They love animals. They

1309
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:08,160
rescue animals. And we were kind of talking about the hunting, and he just said, yeah,

1310
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:15,360
you know, he goes, they hunt it a lot. And I don't know, I just, he's like, I'm okay with it. But I

1311
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:20,960
just, however he said it, he was being cordial, but I could tell he would have no interest in doing

1312
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:27,040
it. And he kind of deep down, he didn't like what could easily be portrayed as like cruelty to

1313
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:35,680
animals shooting them. And what's crazy is the night that we drove home from Minneapolis to my

1314
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:43,200
house, we freaking smoked a deer. I was driving like a Hyundai accent, and I smacked this deer,

1315
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:51,360
and it bounced off the hood and off the windshield. And he was like, holy shit, how's the deer? Is it

1316
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:59,040
okay? And I'm like, are you okay? Are we okay? And so he was like, oh my god. And I just said, yeah,

1317
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:04,400
it's really bad. I said, it's really bad around here this time of year. And then I turned on the

1318
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:10,240
lights, and we might have seen another two or three before we got back to my house. And he was

1319
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:16,240
just like, I can't believe we hit a deer. I can't believe there's so many deer. And so I told him,

1320
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:21,600
like, Hey, man, when I tell you we need to shoot deer, or I went out and shot a deer, this is,

1321
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:27,840
it's something that needs to happen. And, and he told me, he's like, yeah, he goes, honestly,

1322
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:35,280
he goes, that was crazy. He said, obviously, there's too many. So he had a very visual wakeup

1323
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:42,560
call. Some people will never have that. And as a hunting community, the best thing we can do is

1324
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:48,160
realize that we need to speak positively when we have an opportunity. And kind of going back to

1325
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:54,720
what I said before, the easy route is to talk negative and to talk bad about what the opposing

1326
02:09:54,720 --> 02:10:00,960
people have, whether in what we should be doing is just talking positive about what we have. And

1327
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:11,680
we have a very sustainable and, in my opinion, ethical way of feeding ourselves. And we welcome

1328
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:16,880
people to it. I know it's not for everybody. But I think the people that do come here, I think they

1329
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:23,840
find a different meaning to eating. And it's made me eat cleaner. It's honestly made me eat less junk.

1330
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:32,240
And it makes me more focused on supporting what our environment puts in front of us more so than

1331
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:38,800
what some type of refinery does or a chemical does. Yeah, I would agree with all of that,

1332
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:42,720
John. And as we kind of wrap up here, I just, I want to thank you very much for

1333
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:49,200
the incredible work you've done, almost single-handedly. You have a team with you

1334
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:55,360
and you couldn't do what you do without them. I know that. But you really are kind of changing,

1335
02:10:55,360 --> 02:11:01,840
I think forever, the way this sport is taught. And I feel so blessed to be in this point where I can

1336
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:09,360
be in this complete sink, this back and forth balance between the pursuit of excellence within

1337
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:17,600
the sport of archery and how it feeds into this completely separate thing called hunting, which,

1338
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:23,440
by the way, is about 1% taking a shot and 99% all of the other stuff that we didn't even talk

1339
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:28,320
about. Oh, yeah. But we've talked about it a lot on your podcast, spotting animals, stocking animals,

1340
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:32,960
all of the strategy that goes into it, all the physically, the grueling physical stuff,

1341
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:38,000
depending on the terrain that you choose. I just don't think this sport for me personally would be

1342
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:42,320
nearly as enjoyable if it didn't have the educational component that you've single-handedly

1343
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:49,840
provided. So I feel like if I'd had someone like you that could have taught me the equivalent of

1344
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:54,400
what you're teaching me in archery and any of the other things I'd done, I can't imagine how good I

1345
02:11:54,400 --> 02:12:00,160
could have been in those things. So I thank you on behalf of a lot of people. And my hope is that if

1346
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:04,400
even one person listening to this, and I suspect there'll be a heck of a lot more than one,

1347
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:09,360
but if even one person listening to this considers this the opportunity to go down to their local bow

1348
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:16,000
shop, check out a bow, take an archery class, maybe buy a bow, start watching School of Knock

1349
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,000
and all of your stuff on, is it Knock? It's Knock on Archery then. For the YouTube channel. For the YouTube

1350
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:27,200
channel, yeah. On Instagram, it's Knock on TV. And on the Instagram, if you go to my IGTV,

1351
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:36,400
the Knock on TV IGTV, I have the School of Knock, the 12-week sessions. Most of those are all under

1352
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:42,000
15 minutes, I think. Yeah, you can do that whole thing in almost two hours, right? Yeah, and it'll

1353
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:50,560
pave the way for you to have really good fundamentals and basics. It's actually beyond basics. We're

1354
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:55,360
going to link to this so much. In fact, what we'll probably do, John, is even before we put up the

1355
02:12:55,360 --> 02:13:00,320
show notes, we'll send it to you to look over and make sure you like the order in which we've laid

1356
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:07,040
it out so that anybody who says, hey, I want to get started, we will curate every link in order

1357
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:14,000
that you would suggest people go to. And I mean, I'm already looking forward to School of Knock

1358
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:18,640
again in January. It's an unbelievable curriculum you've put together. And I think you're only at

1359
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:22,560
the beginning of what you're the potential of. I mean, again, we've talked about cooking, we've

1360
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:26,400
talked about all of the stuff we could do around exercise and conditioning with respect to this

1361
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:32,320
stuff. So anyway, man, thank you for everything, both on a personal level, but also just on behalf

1362
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:37,680
of all those of us that benefit so greatly from your wisdom and generosity. Oh yeah, man. Thanks

1363
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:44,880
a lot. Thanks for having me too, for sure. First of many. Thank you for listening to this week's

1364
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:49,200
episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss,

1365
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:52,960
we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth,

1366
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:58,240
exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get back much

1367
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:02,960
more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a bunch

1368
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:08,320
of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

1369
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:13,440
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes

1370
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:18,800
rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

1371
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:24,560
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

1372
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:30,160
to listen to spiels like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast, typically less than

1373
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:34,320
five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions,

1374
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:39,680
topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on

1375
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:45,280
previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts

1376
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:49,920
on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch

1377
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:54,400
of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and

1378
