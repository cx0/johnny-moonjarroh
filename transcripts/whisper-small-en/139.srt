Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,560
at the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,920
today's episode. I guess this week is Kristin Neff. Kristin is an associate professor of

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,240
educational psychology at the University of Texas here in Austin. She's the author of the

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,840
book, Self-Compassion, the proven power of being kind to yourself. She's widely regarded as one

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,640
of the world's leading experts on self-compassion, being the first one to truly operationally define

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,600
and measure this construct basically over the past decade. Now, in addition to her research into

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,080
self-compassion, she's also developed an eight week program to teach self-compassion skills in daily

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,480
life. She co-created this with her colleague, Dr. Chris Germer. It's called the Mindfulness

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:39,000
Self-Compassion MSC. I stumbled upon Kristin's work in my own search for better understanding

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,180
self-compassion. This is something that came up for me personally as an area that needed enormous

18
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,840
improvement. And in doing so, I realized I wanted to speak with her, reached out to her, and obviously

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,960
the rest is history. In this episode, we talk about her own journey towards the discovery of

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,720
self-compassion, which somewhat coincided with her discovery of mindfulness. And you'll see in this

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,200
podcast, it's actually quite interesting. And it takes me until the very end of the podcast to truly

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,400
appreciate the distinction between mindfulness and a practice of mindfulness in meditation. And so if

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,800
you're listening to this, and you're an astute listener of podcasts where either meditation has

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,920
been discussed or the concepts of mindfulness have been put forth, pay close attention and

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,600
hopefully you won't make the same mistake I will. But basically, Kristin arrives at this conclusion

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,080
that when she's going through a difficult time in her life, the best approach is to take a

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,240
compassionate approach to herself. And that experience personally then basically shapes the

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,040
remainder of her professional career. And she does a great job here contrasting self-compassion

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,320
from self-esteem and self-pity. And I think this is a very important thing. We get into sort of some

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,720
of the concerns that people have with self-compassion, you know, hey, will this reduce my

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,000
output or my productivity or my competitiveness? And I think you'll see that frankly, by the end of

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,600
this, this is a very nascent field. Much of what we talk about here is not hard science. There are a

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,440
lot of things here that we are speculating on, but I think what nobody will speculate on if they've

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,960
put any of this into practice is that you feel better. And ultimately, that's probably the metric

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,160
that matters more than anything else. So with that said, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Kristin Neff.

36
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,200
Hey, Kristin, thank you so much for making time today. I know you're super busy. And we're going

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,440
to talk a lot about what it is that keeps you busy. I've wanted to speak with you for probably

38
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,440
about four or five months now, since I started to become interested in your work and the broader

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,280
topic of self-compassion. But I think to understand how you came to study it, we have to understand

40
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,720
more about you and what it is that sort of brought you on that journey. So I sort of know little bits

41
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,920
of your story, but I kind of want to go back a little bit further, maybe even starting in

42
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,840
college. What did you study in college and what piqued your curiosity?

43
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,880
Okay, so actually, as an undergraduate, I was very much into issues of kind of culture and how culture

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,920
impacts reasoning. I took a three part series in cultural anthropology. And I just fell in love

45
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,440
with the topic thinking of how culture and the larger cultural context may influence the way we

46
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,640
think about the world and think about moral topics. And so I went to UC Berkeley to study with a moral

47
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,960
developmental scholar named Elliot Toriel, who was just amazing. And I was again researching, I was

48
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,760
really interested in things like how people balance concerns with autonomy and connectedness.

49
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,080
It was a theme actually, that's run through my entire research career, kind of you think about

50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,440
how they balance concerns with self and other. And I started getting interested in that in terms of

51
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,600
moral reasoning, how people resolve moral conflicts, especially between self and other. I did my

52
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,480
dissertation research in India looking at I think it was called reasoning about rights and

53
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,720
responsibilities in the context of Indian family life. So basically, I became interested in how

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,960
especially how gender hierarchy in a very traditional place like India impacted how people

55
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,720
resolved conflicts between their personal needs and their others needs. Some people had said that

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,080
India is a duty based culture. And it's all about meeting the needs of others. Whereas the United

57
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,520
States is a rights based culture. And it's all about meeting our own needs. I thought, well,

58
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,480
is that really true? I mean, what about gender? It seems like with a lot of gender hierarchy,

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,760
that yes, women really need to do their duty and meet their husband's needs. But husbands have a

60
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,920
lot of rights to do what they want. So you can't really separate out power and gender and culture

61
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,360
from the way people think about things. And by the way, I did find that I found that they emphasize

62
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,280
duties for wives and rights for husband. But the Indian woman were like, but that's not fair. We'll

63
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
do it because we have to, but we don't like it. It's not fair. Kind of showing the kind of also

64
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,360
that we aren't totally dictated to by our culture that we're individuals who can reason and decide

65
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,440
actually, that's not fair. I think that should change. While I was in India, I started basically,

66
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,320
I talk about it a lot in my book, but while I was in India, my life fell apart, basically,

67
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,280
I had been married. And it was kind of a, I'll go ahead and say it right here. Because we're

68
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,560
talking, what had happened was I left my husband for another man, which is something that I was a

69
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,920
very moral person. I never, ever thought I would be in that situation, but it happened. So I left

70
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,920
my husband for another man who was supposed to join me in India. And he didn't. And basically,

71
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,880
so the whole thing fell apart and I came back to Berkeley. And actually, when I came back,

72
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,040
talk about trauma, he had brain cancer and he died within a year. The man I left my husband for,

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,400
who didn't leave his partner for her. And so basically, I was a mess. I was feeling a lot of

74
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,240
shame. It was very traumatic. I consider myself a very moral, honest person. And the fact that I

75
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,360
got myself in that situation kind of was just really upsetting to me that I had allowed myself

76
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,200
to get in that situation. Plus the fact that it really didn't work out so well, right? So he

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,480
didn't come and the guy I left my husband for ended up dying of cancer within a year. My husband,

78
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,600
who I then divorced when I got back, hated me. And I was just a basket case basically.

79
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
And so I thought I would learn mindfulness meditation because I'd heard that mindfulness

80
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,520
was good for stress and trauma and all this stuff, which I was going through. So I started learning

81
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,200
about Buddhism as a way to kind of help me through what I was going through. What kind of support

82
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,200
network did you have at this time? So I'm trying to picture this. So how long were you in India?

83
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,000
A year. I was in India for a year.

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,960
And so you come back and you're in the process of writing your dissertation now, I assume?

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,640
Yes. I wrote up my dissertation.

86
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
What type of interaction you're having with your girlfriends? Are they consoling you?

87
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,440
Do you feel isolated?

88
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,360
And I had a very good support network. And actually, believe it or not, I had actually

89
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,400
met the man who was going to be my second husband when I was in India. He came as well,

90
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,080
which helped. It was a very soap opera-ish, Peter. It was like days of our lives, right?

91
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,840
It was kind of the script of the soap opera, all these elements that came together.

92
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,160
I had support, but I knew I really needed something to help me deal with everything

93
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,640
I'd been going through. And I was always a spiritual person. My mother had books by like

94
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,160
Indian gurus. Durandas's Be Here Now was on my coffee table, which is partly what drew me to

95
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,360
India, to be totally honest. I also thought that I might find some spiritual awakening there.

96
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,320
Didn't actually happen in India. It happened when I got back. But nonetheless, I was always

97
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,200
kind of drawn to those alternate ways of thinking about the world. So it was kind of a natural for

98
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
me to start meditation.

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,120
And what drew you to a mindfulness form of meditation? There are other forms, of course,

100
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,240
and especially being in India, certainly the birthplace of transcendental meditation or other

101
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,840
things. To be totally honest, it was because this meditation group, which was a Thich Nhat Hanh

102
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,760
group, a group that followed the teachings of the Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, it was right down the

103
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,600
street from me. So it was kind of happenstance. The one thing that I kind of liked about Buddhism,

104
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,400
I didn't know a lot about it, but I knew enough to know that it was more scientifically grounded.

105
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,800
The thing about Buddhism is it's more like a science of the mind. There's not a lot of

106
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
belief systems. You don't have to believe in reincarnation. You don't have to believe in

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,440
God or gods, just basically a way of understanding the mind. And because I was a scientist getting

108
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,080
my PhD, that also drew me. And then plus, I just been hearing good things about mindfulness

109
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,840
meditation. But really, thank goodness, it was a Thich Nhat Hanh group, because Thich Nhat Hanh

110
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,560
is one of the Buddhist teachers that talks a lot about self compassion, more than a lot of other

111
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,320
teachers do. Others do, but that's like a big theme of Thich Nhat Hanh. And so the very first night I

112
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,360
went, the woman leading the group talked about self compassion. If I had gone to a transcendental

113
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
meditation group, or some other group, it may have been, I don't know, Shambhala or some other type

114
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,160
of meditation, they might not have talked about self compassion. It may have just been about

115
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,960
quieting the mind, stilling the mind, observing the mind. Not the group I went to, she talked a

116
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,720
lot about self compassion. And it had an immediate impact on me. I mean, literally, when I got home

117
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:39,600
the first night, I thought, wow, I had never even thought about being actively kind and supportive

118
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,240
to myself. I wasn't a particularly harsh self critic, you might think that I was, I actually

119
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,040
wasn't, I was kind of like an average self critic. But I was feeling a lot of shame about everything

120
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,920
I'd gone through and the kind of soap opera that had become my life. When I just started being

121
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,240
actively kind and supportive to myself, I started speaking to myself in a way like,

122
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,960
hey, Kristin, I know you're hurting, this is really hard. It's understandable. There's a lot

123
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,480
of reasons for how things unfolded the way they did. I mean, I'm here for you. I started really

124
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,320
just I did it silently, but speaking to myself as if I was speaking to a friend. And it really was

125
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,480
like finding a superpower I didn't even know I had. It was almost immediate, the impact it had on me.

126
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Now mindfulness meditation took a lot longer to figure out. It's a more subtle practice than I

127
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,400
did learn to meditate and I went on many retreats. But self compassionate and probably because I

128
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,800
have fairly secure attachment with my parents, it wasn't very difficult for me to learn. I got it

129
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,680
almost immediately. But I did have to practice applying it to my life. Now, how do you go to

130
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,360
the point where you are able to sort of say to yourself in compassionate ways, the things that

131
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,800
you're saying, without first being aware of what the default voice is, that's probably happening

132
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,280
subconsciously. Is that necessary? Because to me, that's the harder part is, I think we'll discuss

133
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,160
later, most of us have some level and some more than others of being incredibly critical. The real

134
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,400
challenge is how subconscious that critical voice is and how we're not aware of it. So were you even

135
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,840
aware at that point of how degrading you could be to yourself or how demeaning you could be?

136
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,560
I think you're right that some of these things are less conscious than others. Like I say, I actually

137
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,880
wasn't a particularly harsh self critic. It was more that I was just lost in the, I mean, I was

138
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,080
feeling shame. And so you might say there was self criticism, but it wasn't an entrenched pattern

139
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,440
for me. How were your behaviors? Because I guess that to me is one of the telltale signs. You come

140
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,160
back from India, you're probably at that point, mostly sitting in your apartment and much of your

141
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,160
work is analyzing data and writing. But how did that shame manifest itself as an outward

142
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,680
manifestation of whatever the inner voice was saying? Were you in any way depressed or anxious

143
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,520
or anything like that? I think I was feeling discombobulated. That's probably the best word

144
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,000
I can use to describe it. I didn't get into a deep depression as I had a lot of stuff going on in my

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,800
life at the same time. So again, I was also starting a new relationship, which kind of made it more

146
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,200
complicated. It also gave me, you might say some support, but I've always been psychologically

147
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,520
oriented, kind of interested in my internal landscape. I could be aware of the feelings of

148
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,760
guilt and shame. For me, the biggest shameful thing was I've always identified as being a very honest

149
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,640
person. And the fact that I did that was just, it was really hard for me because it just goes against

150
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,760
my self-concept. The fact that I got myself in that situation. I understand it, how it could

151
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,880
happen, but it was really hard for me. I started noticing these thoughts about my self-concept.

152
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,120
What does this mean about the type of person I am? And that was really helped by starting Buddhism

153
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,560
because Buddhism is all about understanding this sense of self that causes suffering, this sense

154
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,520
of identification with the separate self, the kind of thoughts of I'm this type of person,

155
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,960
or I am that type of person. Did it take a long time to notice that? It certainly got better as I

156
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,200
got more deep into it, especially if you go deeper into meditation, you can start to see

157
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,760
even more subtle layers of self-judgment. But it wasn't necessary to get there before I could

158
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,520
start seeing the benefits of self-compassion. So it deepened over time. A lot of people are just

159
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,640
blown away by the simple thing of putting your hand on your heart and saying something kind and

160
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,520
supportive to yourself. Here's the thing, Peter, I really believe in part psychology. I've used

161
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,080
internal family systems therapy. I used that type of therapy for many years. That's Dick Schwartz,

162
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,760
right? Dick Schwartz's model where we have different parts of ourselves. And I really do

163
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,240
believe we have different parts of ourselves. Can you explain to folks a little bit about what Dick

164
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
Schwartz is? So the idea is we have different parts of ourselves that all kind of play a role.

165
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,000
And he, it's a terrible name. We call it internal family systems. But basically the idea is we have

166
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
different parts of ourselves that kind of form a family and interact like a family, but it's on

167
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,800
the inside and not just outside. And so we have a part of ourselves that may be self-critical,

168
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,080
maybe feel shame. We also have a part of ourselves that maybe wants to defend against the wounds of

169
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,040
the shamed part of ourselves. So maybe it's really angry at others or gets really busy. We have

170
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,640
different parts of them, a different function. The function of all the parts ultimately is safety.

171
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,840
It's kind of survival. That's kind of how these operate. So there's a part that defends our ego

172
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,840
as a form of survival. There's a part that defends against those feelings of shame,

173
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,360
but there's also a compassionate part of ourselves. I really believe that all of us have. And that

174
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,680
compassionate part of ourselves typically gets exercised when we're relating to others, people

175
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,680
we care about, maybe our children or good friends or other people we're close to. We also have a

176
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,720
compassionate part of ourselves. So I don't think it's the case that you need to totally uncover

177
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,760
all the self-critical parts of ourselves before we can activate the self-compassionate part. It's

178
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,760
there. We actually are pretty familiar with it as it relates to other people. So I think what happened

179
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,720
is I was able to activate that self-compassionate part. I was able to see, wow, this really makes a

180
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,520
difference. If you take that self-compassionate part and aim it inward as opposed to outward,

181
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,880
it almost immediately changes the landscape, also the physiological as well as the mental landscape.

182
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,080
Actually moving from the threat defense mode to the attachment system mode, you're kind of priming

183
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,600
your own attachment security when you tap into the compassionate part of yourself. So for me,

184
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,400
it got better over time. It went more deep over time. I was able to uncover more layers,

185
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,200
more hidden selves, full of shame, more inadequacy related to my father and all the stories that you

186
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,640
unpack in therapy. But it was easier than I thought it was. That's the thing that surprised

187
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,000
me over my career is actually easier than you might think to help people get in touch with their

188
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,480
compassionate self because for many, many people, that compassionate self is very, very well

189
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,440
practiced as an expert just aimed at others. So you don't have to create something totally new

190
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,760
that's not there. That's the useful thing about it. Yeah. I have a friend who in helping me think

191
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,200
about this. So unlike you, I'm probably naturally much more self critical. You sort of describe

192
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,400
yourself as probably in the middle, kind of normal. I would be an Olympic level self critic,

193
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,880
including actually audibly. I mean, I could literally, you'd think I was a crazy person at

194
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,320
times because I could literally speak in a voice like this to myself in an incredibly harsh and

195
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,360
critical way. So a friend of mine, Rick Elias, who has been on this podcast and who I consider

196
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,880
not just a friend, but kind of a life mentor said, I want you to practice something which is when

197
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,920
you're in that moment and you're about to have that discussion with yourself. I want you to

198
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,400
picture that the same events occurred that are upsetting you, but now it wasn't you that did it.

199
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,280
It was one of your close friends that did it. How would you console him? This is interesting. It was

200
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,400
for me a process of five months of doing this. But for example, I'll give you. So there's two

201
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,880
things I do almost every day. I either shoot my bow and arrow or drive my race car simulator.

202
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,840
Now those are two seemingly nonsensical activities, but unfortunately they both

203
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:38,080
have become barometers of self worth. So when they don't go well, the inner self-directed hatred is

204
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,680
enormous. And it results in anger and tantrums and outbursts and feelings of total worthlessness when

205
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,000
they don't go well. So instead, what I started doing, and I literally did this every single day

206
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,400
for five months, is after every single episode of doing one of those activities, which meant every

207
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,840
single day, I would take my phone out and I would speak into the recorder as though it were my friend

208
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,640
who had that bad experience. And I would say, I would use my name. So I'd say, hey, Peter,

209
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,160
I know you just had a really bad day shooting and you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if your

210
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,280
life depended on it, but it doesn't mean you're bad. It just means that you had a bad day at archery

211
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,360
today, but you're still a great dad and you're going to get another chance to come out here and

212
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,760
do this tomorrow. And there are probably reasons for it today. You might not even know why you

213
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,720
didn't shoot poorly, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I would send text that message to my therapist

214
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:43,040
every single day as a form of accountability. It really was amazing how much it deescalated me.

215
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,280
It was actually very quick. It used to be at the point where driving or shooting poorly

216
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,320
could ruin my day. And it got to the point where within about three minutes, I had forgotten about

217
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,840
it. Yeah, that's the power of self-compassion. And again, it's because you already had that

218
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,720
part developed. It had been one thing if you hadn't had any experience your whole life of how

219
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,920
to be compassionate or supportive to someone, but you'd spend many, many years developing that skill

220
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,960
probably with your kids or your friends. So you just needed to access that part of yourself,

221
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,320
which you weren't accessing before. And that's why I found to get back to kind of in terms of for

222
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,920
myself. That's why I was blown away by how useful it was. And then I started getting an interest in

223
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,040
Buddhism and the whole idea of self-concept. What is this thing we call self anyway, and it really

224
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,000
made a lot of sense to be this way of understanding how the sense of separate self and ego and

225
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,560
separation leads to suffering. And so I thought, well, maybe I want to kind of pivot and I didn't

226
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,080
pivot totally away, but pivot away from moral reasoning and get into understanding self-concept,

227
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,080
how the development of our self-concept impacts things. So I did my postdoc with Susan Harder,

228
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,840
studying self-concept development. She was also studying autonomy and connectedness.

229
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,240
So it was a natural fit. So I've been studying autonomy and connectedness and moral reasoning,

230
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,280
and she was studying autonomy and connectedness and relationships. You're self-concept. Are you

231
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,760
other focused? Are you self-focused? Are you both? So it was an absolutely natural fit for me to go

232
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,240
work with her and do my postdoc. But she was also one of the countries leading self-esteem

233
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,400
researchers. And she had done research along with others showing that self-esteem is not necessarily

234
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,520
a good thing. It's good that like yourself as opposed to hate yourself, but the ways we get

235
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,840
our self-esteem can be very, very problematic. A lot of social comparison is contingent. Like for

236
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,240
you, if you shoot the bullseye, you feel good about yourself. If you miss it, you hate yourself.

237
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,680
I mean, that's not very stable. It's very contingent. It's unstable. So it was when I was

238
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,840
finding out more about self-esteem, and I was just kind of questioning the whole self-esteem thing

239
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,080
anyway, through my Buddhist practice. And what is this thing we call an ego in that we invest so

240
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,800
much in that we have to judge it positively and it can't be negative at all. And then it was just a

241
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,840
natural to think, wow, I think self-compassion is a lot more helpful than self-esteem. When I was

242
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,920
working with Susan, I was developing all my ideas about that. And then eventually I came to show that

243
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,560
empirically when I got UT Austin. When you sort of take a broad lens at human psychology,

244
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,240
when did this idea of self-esteem become something that was really pushed? I mean,

245
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,560
certainly as long as I can remember as a kid, I mean, this is what was talked about all day.

246
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,680
Every day the table was pounded. Kids that don't have high self-esteem do drugs and whatever sort

247
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,760
of, but that couldn't have been the narrative forever. Was there somebody that was a champion

248
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,880
for this school of thinking? Well, it's interesting because if you actually look at the founding

249
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,040
American psychology, William James, who was writing early 1900s, 19th century, he wrote about

250
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,560
self-esteem and he actually identified contingent self-esteem. He defined self-esteem as perceptions

251
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,680
of competence in domains of importance. In other words, being good at those things in life that

252
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,360
are important to you. Like you could probably care less if you're bad at hockey, if you don't play

253
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,600
hockey, but you do care if you're bad at archery because you care about archery. That's kind of the

254
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,800
way self-esteem works. We need to be good at those things in life that we value. He was actually

255
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,080
talking about it way back then, but then it didn't really take off in psychology. Then they started

256
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,960
going into psychoanalysis and then into behaviorism. It was probably people like Rosenberg,

257
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,760
I'll blank it on his first thing, who created the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. That was probably one

258
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,360
of the big factors, creation of good measures of self-esteem because people can say,

259
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,280
wow, when people score higher on the self-esteem scale, they're less depressed, they're less

260
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,280
anxious, they're happier. Then that kind of started kicking the ball rolling and noticing. It is true.

261
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,800
People with higher self-esteem have better mental health than people with low self-esteem.

262
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,760
But the problem is all the unhealthy ways they get to that high self-esteem,

263
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,920
like feeling better than others, bullying others. We know that the reason kids in middle school

264
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,680
start to bully others is to have high self-esteem because they want to feel good about themselves

265
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:19,120
in comparison. How do we compare and contrast narcissism with self-esteem or other negative

266
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,360
traits? Because self-esteem by itself doesn't really sound to be negatively valenced, but a

267
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,760
lot of those other traits do. There's nothing wrong with self-esteem. In fact, there's a pretty

268
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,160
strong correlation between self-compassion and self-esteem. If you're self-compassionate,

269
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,400
you all have higher self-esteem and you have less self-hate. So they're linked.

270
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,800
But the healthy form of self-esteem is what they call unconditional self-esteem. You feel worthy,

271
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,040
not because you're good at something that you value. You feel worthy just because you're a

272
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:53,360
human being, an intrinsic sense of self-worth. That's the type of self-esteem that self-compassion

273
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,160
gives you. If you look at them head to head that compare it my self-compassion measure against a

274
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,640
self-esteem measure, you'll find that it's self-compassion that explains stability of self-worth

275
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,920
over time. In other words, it doesn't go up and down as much because it's less contingent on

276
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,840
outcomes on a good day and on a bad day. Just to make sure I understand that there's some

277
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,600
discordance between self-esteem and self-compassion. A person with self-compassion generally has

278
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,080
self-esteem, but not everybody with self-esteem has self-compassion. Yes, exactly. It's hard to

279
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,120
tease them apart. But for instance, if you have self-esteem because you're a narcissist,

280
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,760
you probably won't have higher self-compassion. You don't have lower self-compassion either,

281
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,680
because that would have to say that people who aren't compassionate, who hate themselves,

282
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,840
have higher narcissism. So they're completely orthogonal. When you put them all together in

283
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,960
a regression equation, you control for self-esteem and self-compassion and narcissism is the outcome.

284
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,800
It actually came out as 0.0 correlation, totally orthogonal between self-compassion

285
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,000
and narcissism, where self-esteem, I forget what it was, I think it was a moderate correlation.

286
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,920
I'd have to look again. It's not that self-esteem is bad. We want to feel worthy. It's really why

287
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:14,720
we feel worthy, how we feel worthy. It's important. I think viscerally it makes so much sense using,

288
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,320
like I said, the trivial example of do you shoot well or not. If your self-worth is dependent

289
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,400
on performance, you're doomed to fail at some point. Right. And then when you do fail,

290
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,840
what do you do? And so people criticize themselves thinking it's going to improve their performance.

291
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,640
And by the way, it does kind of work. It has to be admitted. Many people have gotten through

292
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,920
med school or law school through harsh self-criticism. So it's not like it doesn't work at all,

293
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,160
but it works with a lot of negative side effects, like a performance anxiety is a big one. So if

294
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,880
you have a lot of anxiety, because you're slamming yourself, you're beating yourself up,

295
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,480
next time you have some big tasks or something you're really worried about doing well,

296
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,280
because you know, if you don't, you've gotten the negative reinforcement of beating yourself up.

297
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,280
So it makes you more anxious, which actually undermines your performance. It can make you

298
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,600
more disconnected from others. If you're really invested in doing better than other people,

299
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,680
that can lead to like little interpersonal behaviors that actually aren't good at creating

300
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,040
closeness and connection. It kind of works. There's a lot of problems with it. And self

301
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,880
compassion works better. What we know in the research is constructive criticism is more

302
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,440
effective than harsh criticism. We know that of course, we know that you still want criticism,

303
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,240
you want to know where you went wrong and how you could improve. It's not like, oh, that's fine.

304
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,840
If you're a professional Archer saying, Oh, well, just had a bad day. That's not going to help you.

305
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,280
And that's not going to help you achieve your goals, which means it's actually not ultimately

306
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,720
loving. If you're a professional Archer, you want to do your best because that's related to your

307
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,720
happiness and well being. But what's going to help you do your best constructive criticism says,

308
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,480
okay, well, here's what didn't work. And you did it this way. This didn't work. Why don't we try it

309
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,600
this way? I believe in you. You've got my support. I'm here for you. That type of constructive voice

310
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,800
is actually more effective. Yes, a coach that says your crap, you better do better. It kind of works.

311
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,240
It doesn't work as well as constructive criticism. And we know that because obviously that's one of

312
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,160
the concerns that anybody would have going down this path of self-compassion. If somebody had

313
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,040
spoken to me when I was in high school or college and said, look, we're going to work on you not

314
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:32,240
beating yourself up, I would have said, no way. I'm not willing to give up my edge in exchange for

315
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,840
feeling better in the moment. Right. Which is ironic because it actually doesn't give you an

316
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,840
edge. It actually is not nearly as effective. It gives you more of an edge if you have constructive

317
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,440
criticism than destructive criticism. And again, study after study shows that. Yeah. So walk me

318
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,160
through some of the social psychological experiments that can test that hypothesis.

319
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:02,000
Research has come out of UC Berkeley, which shows a lot of research shows that self-compassion is

320
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,240
not only more effective than self-criticism, which kind of occurs naturally, but also is more

321
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,080
effective than self-esteem as a motivator. So just as an example of one type of study,

322
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,760
they had UC Berkeley undergraduates, they had them all fail a vocabulary test. They took like the

323
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,160
hardest items from the SAT. They had the students take the task and everyone failed because it was

324
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:30,000
a really hard test. They split up the students into three groups. One group, they gave instructions to

325
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,200
be self-compassionate about the failure. It was a really hard test. Try not to beat yourself up

326
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,880
about it. Just try to be kind and supportive to yourself about failing this test. The other group,

327
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,040
they gave a self-esteem instruction. They said, don't worry about it. You got into Berkeley. You

328
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,680
know, you're smart. Kind of give them a self-esteem boost. And the other group, they didn't give any

329
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,920
instructions, which meant they were probably self-critical. They didn't encourage the students

330
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,520
to be self-critical and be kind of unethical. They just didn't say anything. What they did is they

331
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,520
said, you're going to take the test again. You've got some free time to study for the exam. They had

332
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,160
materials they could study for the vocabulary test. Just kind of let us know when you're done

333
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,520
and you're ready to take the exam. And what they found was that people who were told to be

334
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,320
self-compassionate about the failure studied longer and harder than the other two groups.

335
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,480
And how long people study was related to how well they did on the next exam.

336
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,240
I mean, what would be another interesting group as a fourth group would be a group

337
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,400
that was berated and told your crap. Yeah. Like you guys got into Berkeley and you still flunk

338
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:42,080
this test. Yeah. Pathetic. I'd be curious to know if that was positive or negative in terms

339
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,200
of reinforcing additional study. Yeah. I guess it's kind of unethical to do that. It'd be very

340
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,240
hard to do a study like that. You can't actually insult subjects in an experiment like that because

341
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,240
it's considered psychologically damaging. Let's pause for a moment on that. The IRB won't let you

342
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,600
say to an undergraduate something like that. Whereas think about what was done 40 and 50 years

343
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,240
ago with some of the famous psychology experiments down at Stanford. That's why they've changed the

344
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,960
RB. And actually Peter, do you know what you have to use as an insult? The feedback you use is you

345
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,960
did average. That's considered an insult. If you tell people their score was average,

346
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,600
it's considered an insult. There's lots of research like that that basically, so what happens

347
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,840
is when you're self-compassionate about a failure, first of all, it allows you to learn more from the

348
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,520
failure. I mean, it's such a truism. Failure is our best teacher, but if you're full of shame

349
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,360
and you're just really mad at yourself, you don't actually have the presence of mind to look

350
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,600
objectively and say, huh, where did I go wrong? How could I do better next time? But self-compassion

351
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,560
support actually does give you that presence of mind to be able to learn from your experiences.

352
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,120
So self-compassion leads to what they call growth mindset, where you actually learn from your

353
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,280
mistakes as opposed to fixed mindset, which means you just think you're stupid or smart, one or the

354
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:07,280
other. How soon in a child's development can these patterns be set? We don't have a lot of data with

355
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,520
kids. Partly that's because we don't have a good way to measure self-compassion in children. There

356
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,560
are a few scales. I actually just came out the scale for youth that can be used for younger kids

357
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:24,160
at brand new. It came out like last year. It hasn't been used much. We don't have a lot of data on

358
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:31,120
this, but I suspect that about age seven or eight, once kids have learned about friendship

359
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,240
and they have a cliche we call two-way thinking, you can understand reciprocity,

360
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,160
they understand concepts of fairness, they understand kind of that back and forth. They

361
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:46,640
can take the perspective of another. To be self-compassionate, you have to take the perspective

362
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,320
of another towards yourself. And also, by the way, self-criticism doesn't really kick in until later

363
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,880
on in development, partly because of that, because children are just kind of like happy and they have

364
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,680
a positivity bias and they tend to think they're great unless their parents tell them the exact

365
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,600
opposite. It's called one-way thinking, all one or the other. I would assume two-way thinking would

366
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,320
have to kick in, which would be about age seven or eight. So there's some good books out there,

367
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,120
and you can find them on my website if you want to get the reference, kind of teach kids when they

368
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,440
learn about friendship, that they should also be their own best friend. Learn about what it means

369
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,280
to be a good friend. They should also learn to be a good friend to themselves. And I suspect that's

370
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,840
probably the best time to start introducing these concepts. And then adolescence, once you start

371
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,800
getting metacognition and you get more abstract thinking, it's even more appropriate because

372
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,360
that's when really the self-concept formation starts kicking in. What kind of person am I?

373
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,240
And then you can start having conversations with teenagers. They actually do understand

374
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,000
issues like, do you really want your sense of self-worth to be contingent on being pretty

375
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,720
enough or having people like you or being smart enough? They have enough abstract thinking skills

376
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,840
to be able to understand something like self-compassion. Now, some would argue that we're

377
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,440
sort of in the midst of a social experiment for which the outcome might not be known for decades,

378
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:18,320
which is a group of kids that are growing up in a world where comparison is at a level that you or

379
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,880
I couldn't imagine. You and I grew up, so I'll speak for myself, but I didn't have a clue outside

380
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,960
of my neighborhood. There was nothing. I mean, even looking at the TV was very abstract, not like I

381
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:39,040
knew anybody that lived out of the borough of the city that I lived in. And you barely watched TV,

382
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,080
there was no way to sense what was happening. And of course, today that couldn't be further from the

383
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:52,480
truth. So you spoke earlier about ego being so entwined in comparison to others, that you would

384
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,720
argue that we are in an environment today where the potential for that comparison, that ranking,

385
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,840
is so high. So it would seem to me that self-compassion is more important today than potentially it ever

386
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:10,000
has been. I hear what you're saying. I think it certainly is frightening. On the other hand,

387
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,560
I don't know a lot about it. My son doesn't use social media. I don't use social media. I'm like

388
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,600
a dinosaur. My book has a Facebook account, but I don't. So it's a whole other world and I know

389
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,400
I'm not really part of it. My son's not part of it either. But I do from friends who have teenage

390
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:32,000
kids, I do hear this. On the other hand, it seems like that the younger generation is more open-minded

391
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,240
than past generations. That it may be because they've got the ability to know so many different

392
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,120
stories. Like in some ways, when we were growing up, probably a little older than you, but still,

393
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:48,080
it was like there was a few sitcoms on and everyone watched All in the Family or MASH or whatever it

394
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,480
was. I'm probably dating myself. You're probably like seven when those came out. But nonetheless,

395
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,840
there were certain sitcoms that everyone watched and that was kind of the unique frame of reference,

396
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,280
shared frames of reference, at least in cultures like the United States. But now people, they can

397
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,840
get the point of view of like so many diverse points of view, depending on what they like,

398
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,760
what they're interested in. I haven't seen any data. Well, that's not quite true. There is some

399
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,720
data showing that suicide rates are up and stress is up. I just don't know. I think the jury's out.

400
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,040
I think the jury's out. I think in some ways, social media can be used. For instance, if you're

401
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,160
part of the LGBTQ community, you have access to people like you in a way that you wouldn't have

402
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,080
had 20 years ago. And in that sense, social media could be a positive thing. It can make you feel

403
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,840
less isolated and more connected to others. On the other hand, if you're just looking at Instagram

404
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,320
and followers, maybe not. So I think I just don't know what to think about it. It's scary though.

405
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,560
I admit it. It's really scary. We don't know. That's a missing point. Now you mentioned your

406
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,280
son does not use social media. Your son has autism, correct? Yes. He's how old now? He is 18.

407
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,840
And by the way, he just got his driver's license. I can't even tell you how proud he is and how

408
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:12,240
proud I am of him that he just got his driver's license. It is like independence is just around

409
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,200
the corner. He's a sophomore in high school. He was delayed because we homeschooled him.

410
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,160
We started him a little bit back so that he could catch up academically. But yeah, he's doing really

411
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,760
well, really well. You probably start to figure out that something is not exactly quote unquote

412
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,000
normal when your son is two or three years old. I knew earlier because I was trained as a developmental

413
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,760
psychologist and I knew something was up. But there's a myth that autistic children don't make

414
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,480
eye contact. They make eye contact a little less frequently, but a lot of them make a lot of eye

415
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,960
contact, especially with their parents. And I literally used to joke with his father, huh,

416
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,840
well, at least we know it's not autism. Look at that eye contact. But then it turned out it was

417
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,720
autism. Well, he's actually an extroverted. There are extroverted autists. He's an extroverted

418
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,800
autist. So what did you notice? And when the diagnosis finally came, how did you start to

419
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,480
process that and how did your training and self-compassion serve you? I started noticing

420
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,280
because he was delayed in language development. Actually, delayed pointing is one of the biggest

421
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,760
indicators of some sort of delay. And he was just using the echolalia, just repeating of the words,

422
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,400
kind of the repetitive behaviors. But he was very social. I had the stereotype that autistic kids,

423
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
they weren't loving, they weren't affectionate, they didn't make eye contact, which wasn't him at

424
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,520
all. But then once I realized that a lot of autists are extroverted and social, I realized,

425
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,760
oh, yeah, he's got it. And then we had the official diagnosis. It was devastating. It was

426
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,120
devastating. The first feeling quite honestly is one of disappointment, it just has to be kind of

427
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,640
owned. This isn't what I imagined being a parent would be like. I imagined something different,

428
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,920
these long in-depth philosophical conversations about life. Actually, we're starting to finally

429
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,480
have those, but it took a lot longer than I thought it would. He wasn't potty trained until

430
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,880
he was five, which is really, really hard. He would tantrum a lot well past the terrible twos.

431
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,280
And so I was disappointed, I was overwhelmed, but it wasn't the plan I had signed up for.

432
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,840
And so my self-compassion and my mindfulness practice both together, and they really can't

433
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,840
be separated. Mindfulness is a necessary ingredient to self-compassion. The day after he got his

434
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,160
diagnosis, I went on a meditation retreat and I just sat there on my cushion and I cried.

435
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,760
What I did was I allowed every single emotion to come up. You're supposed to feel disappointed

436
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,040
because I love my son more than anything else in the world. I didn't say, okay, this emotion's

437
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,040
allowed and that emotion isn't allowed. I just let any emotion I had to come up, feelings of grief,

438
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,240
feelings of disappointment, feelings of fear. And not only was I allowed myself to be with them

439
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,000
without suppressing them or fighting them, the thing that made the biggest difference for me

440
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
is I actively gave myself support because of them. This is really hard, Kristin. I know you're

441
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,680
disappointed. I know you're frightened. It's going to be okay. I'm here for you. I'm so sorry that

442
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,800
you're having struggling but care about you. I treated myself just like I would treat a good

443
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,560
friend who had a similar situation. What I found, and over and over again, the more I could give

444
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,720
my self-compassion for my son's autism, the better parent I was to him, and the more I could accept

445
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,040
him, the more I could accept my own difficult feelings about his autism, the more I could

446
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,080
actually accept his autism. Whereas if I had fought them and suppressed them or said, I'm not supposed

447
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,960
to feel this way or I could allow myself to feel this way, I think it would have created a tension

448
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
that would have actually made it more difficult to accept him for who he was.

449
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,640
When you were going through this process, did your husband mirror you in that practice or did he

450
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,880
sort of have his own way of doing this so you were kind of in this journey of you were supporting him

451
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,480
and he was maybe delayed? What was that dynamic like?

452
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:15,600
A bit of both. He had kind of his own way of dealing with things. He's much more of a doer and

453
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,000
wrote this book called The Horse Boy and he thought about how can I make this into an adventure?

454
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,160
That's kind of his way of dealing with things. If life throws you lemons, how am I going to make

455
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,640
lemonade, which is a little different than my way of doing it. He had this whole adventure and we

456
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,080
took our son to Mongolia and he wrote a best-selling book and a documentary about it. He really tried

457
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,960
to look on the positive side of it. There's really value to that as well, a different approach than

458
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,000
what I took. Mine's kind of more like how do I hold the pain with love? He actually has a line

459
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,960
in his book. When life gives you lemons, why stop at lemonade? Make a margarita. Very much his way

460
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,840
of dealing with things. By the way, we aren't together anymore just so you know. We split up

461
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,200
about nine years ago. There was a point in that documentary by the way. Oh, so you did see it?

462
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,720
Yes, yes, I did. It's very powerful. It's at least represented in the documentary that Rowan

463
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,760
basically didn't make a sound. Maybe I'm misremembering this, but it was only when

464
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,240
he first encountered the horse that he sort of came to life. Am I remembering that correctly?

465
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,280
It was the first time he did a complete sentence. So before he'd repeat words,

466
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,800
it might be like food he liked back then. It might be bottle or water or muffin or something like

467
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,440
that. He would repeat the words, but it's the first time when he got in Betsy. It actually wasn't

468
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,520
there when it happened. So I'm assuming it's true. He said, he's a nice horse. Betsy's actually

469
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,120
female, but he's a nice horse. First time he was on the back of the horse. I did see a change.

470
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,600
So there's some research that suggests on horses. It's actually, they think it may have to do with

471
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,600
the cerebellum because when you continually have to find and refine your balance, it influences the

472
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,480
cerebellum, which helps brain integration. And one of the things that's happening with autism

473
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,440
is a lack of brain integration because overgrowth of white matter. You probably know all this about

474
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,880
autism, lack of adequate pruning. It's hard to get cross-brain communication in autistic kids,

475
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,640
which is one of the reasons you get kind of hyper specialization and fixations.

476
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,400
There's a really good scientific reason to think why things like being on a horse, finding the

477
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,480
re-finding and the balance would help cross-brain communication, which might allow for things like

478
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,440
language. And also it was just a lot of fun. Basically learned to speak on horseback. It was

479
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,960
pretty amazing. Remind me how old Rowan was when you guys did this trip? About five, between five

480
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,120
and six. And you obviously alluded to kind of these outbursts, right? I mean, children with autism

481
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,960
obviously can have remarkable outbursts. Yeah. Because they get overwhelmed. My son

482
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,840
likes to tell me, autistic children, they don't tantrum because they're trying to get their way.

483
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,720
They do it just because they get overwhelmed and it's just a natural reaction, but they don't do

484
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,640
it to manipulate. So it's interesting, which I think is very true. So where does self-compassion

485
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:13,520
come into trauma? You alluded to it very briefly upfront, but there's also some literature for

486
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,840
formal diagnoses of PTSD, isn't there? Oh, in terms of self-compassion? Yes. It's not so much

487
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,200
that self-compassion aids in the diagnosis of PTSD. There's a lot of research actually on

488
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,120
self-compassion and trauma. So there's kind of two parts to that research. One is that people with

489
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:37,200
early childhood trauma, so sexual, emotional, physical abuse, it actually hinders the ability

490
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,040
to be self-compassion as an adult. And that's mainly because of the attachment system. So if

491
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,360
you have secure attachment, it means you think you're kind of valuable, you're worthy, and your

492
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,440
needs are worth being met. If you had secure attachment with your parents and your parents

493
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,320
treated you like you were worthy and they met your needs consistently, then when you're an adult,

494
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,000
it's easier to think that I'm worthy and I'm going to meet my needs because I'm worthy of having my

495
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,040
needs met. If you have insecure attachment, then you may not think that your needs are worthy of

496
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,320
being met. And if your parents were actually harshly critical or actually abusive, what can

497
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,160
happen is the system that's supposed to make you feel safe, the attachment system, gets fused with

498
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,320
feelings of fear because these people who are your only source of safety and comfort in life are also

499
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,480
terrifying you. And then so what happens is everything gets kind of jumbled up and mixed in.

500
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,280
And for some people actually it can be frightening to give themselves compassion. Paul Gilbert talks

501
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,080
about this. He calls it fear of self-compassion because basically when you're activating the

502
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,440
attachment system, which is supposed to make you feel safe, it actually makes you unsafe. And so

503
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,760
some people when they start opening their hearts with self-compassion, they have memories, traumatic

504
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,400
memories come up or like just this voice in their head saying you're crap, you're worthless, or maybe

505
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,920
some memories of kind of some sort of abuse. It's harder to be self-compassionate if you have a

506
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,400
trauma history. But having said that, self-compassion is one of the best ways to deal with early

507
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,440
childhood trauma because what you're doing is you're like re-parenting yourself. So maybe the

508
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,200
program is okay, you're worthless, you aren't worthy of care. But if you actually intentionally

509
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:21,120
give yourself compassion for those feelings, which are so hard, wow, it's really hard to feel that

510
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm worthless. These feelings of shame, they're really difficult. How can I learn to relate to

511
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,360
the pain of the trauma with some kindness? It's not like cognitive behavioral therapy where you

512
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:36,160
work directly with rewriting those negative schemas. I mean, that's also useful. It has its

513
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,720
role for sure. What you're really doing is learning how to hold the pain, any pain, with this kind,

514
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,360
supportive stance. And so when you do that, there's actually some research showing you can get what

515
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,840
they call earned secure attachment as an adult. You can actually learn to have a secure attachment

516
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,960
schema through self-compassion. Maybe your parents didn't meet your needs consistently,

517
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,360
but you can learn to meet your own needs consistently when you're frightened or you

518
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,920
need help or you need support in some way. It is harder, the road's bumpier, and it usually

519
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,640
really helps have a good therapist help you unpack all of this. Once people can do it,

520
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,280
there's lots of research, especially with compassion focused therapy created by Paul Gilbert,

521
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,320
which is specifically designed for people with early trauma. The most different ways you have

522
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,000
to approach it and the way in is a little different and has to go slower and things are a little

523
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,640
different, but it actually is remarkably effective and you can get people who are able to heal from

524
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,880
early trauma through self-compassion. And so there's research showing this, if you look at

525
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,560
trauma that's not caused by early childhood, for instance, there's a lot of work with combat

526
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:45,280
veterans. So combat veterans, to Iraq or Afghanistan, who experienced a lot of combat trauma,

527
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,840
what they found is those veterans who are more self-compassionate toward themselves about what

528
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,120
they'd experienced, they were less likely to develop post-traumatic stress syndrome. And so in

529
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,320
a way, post-traumatic stress syndrome is when the trauma almost gets locked in your body and

530
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:06,560
you keep re-experiencing the trauma because you can't process it. And so self-compassion towards

531
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:12,560
the trauma helps you process it so it doesn't get locked into place through post-traumatic stress

532
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:19,200
syndrome. Yeah, which really makes so much sense when you look at the incredible success that the

533
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:28,000
organization MAPS has had in testing MDMA in people with PTSD because MDMA is the ultimate

534
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,680
compassion molecule. So it basically takes a slight amount of compassion you might have and it just

535
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,880
amplifies it tremendously. And that's presumably why people in as few as two or three sessions can

536
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:48,000
have otherwise debilitating PTSD rectified. I think there's only one study that did show that

537
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,640
MDMA increased self-compassion but there isn't a lot. I think there's a huge, what we'll see,

538
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,160
starting there's a huge boom already in looking at psychedelics, MDMA, mushrooms, because what

539
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,600
they do is they give you an experience of basically love and connectedness. And I think, as you say,

540
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,440
one of the reasons probably that it works is by increasing both self-compassion and a sense of

541
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,240
connectedness. The two are actually they go hand in hand. I wouldn't be surprised if we find that

542
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,080
that's kind of the active ingredient of how it works is to increase self-compassion, increase

543
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,480
mindfulness and increase connectedness. The three components of self-compassion are self-kindness,

544
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,480
mindfulness, and common humanity or kind of the sense of connectedness. And the three really do

545
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,240
go hand in hand. They operate as a system. What's the relationship between those and physical health?

546
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,240
So there is an emerging literature that shows that self-compassion is linked to better physical

547
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,160
health. It's kind of a small to medium correlation maybe. I think there's a meta-analysis that found

548
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,720
0.28, 0.30, so significant, not mind-blowing, but still there with physical symptoms, at least

549
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,000
self-reports of colds, aches, pains, physical symptoms. A lot of research, actually Fuchsia

550
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,480
Cyr was one of the big research in this area and she finds that it's linked to better physical

551
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,200
health. There's also research showing, this is probably why it's linked to physical health,

552
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,320
is that it operates through the nervous system. So self-compassion, and this is done either

553
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,680
looking at self-report of self-compassion or by like enhancing the self-compassionate mood.

554
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,840
You can have people think of something they're dealing with and write to themselves, a paragraph

555
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,160
being mindful, kind of accepting of what's happening, remembering that they aren't alone,

556
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,880
common humanity, and being kind to themselves like they would be to a friend. If you induce the three

557
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,960
components of self-compassion, what we find is first of all it reduces sympathetic activity,

558
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,880
things like inflammation, things like cortisol levels, and also increases heart rate variability,

559
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,040
which is the main marker we have of parasympathetic activity. And it's probably by changing the nervous

560
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,080
system reaction that it influences physical health because of course what your body's doing,

561
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,920
how reactive it is, is linked to how healthy you are. Also immune function is linked to better immune

562
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:11,040
function. It actually seems to me like I wouldn't be surprised if a greater body of literature emerges

563
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:18,240
from this because I think it sounds so cliche to say that the mind and the body are related.

564
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,800
But they are. They clearly are, and I think anybody who's tried to help people in one of those

565
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,680
dimensions and not been able to help the other is pretty aware of that focus. And certainly I

566
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:37,760
interviewed Bob Sapolsky some time ago and I think his work in stress is just so interesting.

567
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,360
And stress is really to me kind of just one other piece of this vector. So I'm excited to hear that

568
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,600
we're becoming more aware of this because obviously the lens I kind of come at all these

569
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,640
things through is longevity. And longevity isn't just living longer, it's living better.

570
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,520
And that for me I think was the turning point in coming to accept the value of this,

571
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:05,120
was even if figuring out a way to become more self compassionate didn't make you live one day

572
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:12,400
longer. It increases telomere length also. But even if it didn't, the impact it would have

573
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:19,600
on the quality of your life alone would be worth it. And I think in the final analysis, quality of

574
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:25,760
life matters more than length of life. And there's no reason you can't strive for both. The old joke

575
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,880
about lifelong caloric restriction is it will increase your lifespan and you'll know it or

576
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,880
something to that effect. It'll feel like it. You'll live longer and it'll sure feel like it because

577
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,320
you're so miserable. So to me that's kind of a big part of it. I want to kind of go back to tease out

578
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:46,000
a little bit more of the nuance in this because one could easily misconstrue self compassion for

579
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,640
self pity. How do you distinguish these? We need the three components of self compassion. Just

580
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:59,600
self kindness or self love. It could be a self focused state that I'm just poor me and I feel

581
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:05,440
sorry for myself. What's the difference between pity and compassion? How do you know and what's

582
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,720
the difference between when someone pities you or someone has compassion for you? If you think about

583
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,280
it, we like one and we don't like the other. Well, that's a good question. I mean, pity feels

584
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:22,080
condescending, I suppose. Exactly. The separation you're looking down is the separation. Compassion

585
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,000
is, hey, I've been there, man. It's shared. And that is the whole difference between compassion

586
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,560
and pity. And that's why in my measurement and my construct of self compassion, we need to include

587
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,080
the sense of common humanity. I knew that common humanity, I actually wanted to call it

588
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,200
interdependence or interbeing. It's kind of like going beyond the separate self, but I knew that

589
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,880
that'd be kind of a hard term for most people to get their head around. But that's really what

590
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:56,000
it's pointing to. When you have self compassion, you recognize that everyone's imperfect. Everyone

591
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,440
needs an imperfect life, suffering, failure, hardship. This is part of the shared human

592
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,720
condition. And also, if you really go deeply enough with it, you also realize that what I

593
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,200
experienced is not separated from what you experience. It's all part of these interdependent

594
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,800
causes and conditions, co arising in the idea that you can really separate yourself out of the larger

595
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,680
whole, in some ways is an illusion. You don't have to go that deeply with it. But that's ultimately

596
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,840
where it's pointing. But if you didn't have that sense of connectedness, in the experience of

597
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:33,360
suffering, it may turn into self pity. That's why that part has to be there. Also mindfulness.

598
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,880
So self pity isn't very mindful self pity tends to exaggerate, it tends to catastrophize poor me,

599
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,600
this is like the worst thing ever, and a very self focused mindfulness kind of has more

600
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,360
equanimity, it's more of a balanced state of mind and see things as it is just belittle things,

601
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:54,320
we do see importance just like say, carry on that type of thing. I'm not going to focus on the fact

602
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,240
that this is hard. I'm just going to pretend it's not there. That doesn't help. But on the other

603
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,600
hand, catastrophizing doesn't help either. And the mindfulness component partly comes from the

604
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,840
inherent perspective that comes from self compassion. Ironically, it's interesting to

605
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:16,080
think about this. But because we are used to giving compassion to others, whenever we give

606
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:21,040
ourselves compassion, there's like an inherent sense of perspective there because we're treating

607
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,680
ourselves as we would treat another, we aren't lost in our drama, like stepping outside of

608
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,880
ourselves. And that perspective, which actually leads it's not exactly the same as mindfulness,

609
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,080
but they're very related, and actually gives us more perspective and balance in terms of how we

610
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,280
relate to our own situation. From my point of view, all three need to be there to be self

611
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,760
compassionate. And actually, psychometrically, if you look at psychometric analysis, the self

612
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:53,200
compassion scale, they all operate as a system and all three change simultaneously. So they really

613
00:55:53,200 --> 00:56:00,080
do operate as a system. Now, one of the things that anybody who starts to practice this becomes

614
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,800
aware of is when you fall short of it, depending on how harsh a critic you are in the first place,

615
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,200
you can easily fall into a pattern of self judgment. Right, beating yourself up for beating

616
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,440
yourself up. It's the double bang. Yeah. So what advice do you have for folks who want to begin

617
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:23,520
this practice to pull themselves out of that spiral? Well, I think it's really helpful to know

618
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:30,000
why we criticize ourselves. We criticize ourselves because we care. The reason we criticize ourselves

619
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,400
is because we want to be well, we want to do our best, we want to be safe. We want people to love

620
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,440
us, to support us, because we're afraid that if we don't do well, maybe we're going to harm other

621
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,120
people, we're going to harm ourselves. Bad things are going to happen to us. If we don't do well,

622
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,440
and good things are going to happen to us, we believe if we do do well. So it all comes from

623
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,520
the basic sense of safety. We don't need to beat ourselves up for beating ourselves up. We need to

624
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,360
have compassion for the reasons who beat herself up, which comes with a very natural desire to be

625
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,120
safe. And once you recognize that, it's like, oh, okay, that's just me trying to be safe. Well,

626
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,680
actually, there's a more effective way to help myself feel safe. And that is by giving myself

627
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,040
compassion for what's just happened. When we teach people, especially self compassionate

628
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,800
motivation, if you want to help people move from motivating themselves with criticism to a more

629
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,400
kind of constructive criticism or compassionate motivation, if you leave out that step of having

630
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,800
compassion and even gratitude to our inner critic for trying to keep ourselves safe,

631
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,000
it actually doesn't work. And I think why that is, is because that part of ourselves,

632
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,560
the self critical part is really scared for its life. In many ways, it's like from that point of

633
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:52,000
view, it's like, life will end if I fail or life will end if I make this mistake or life will end

634
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,600
if I'm not a good archer or whatever, you know, it's not a really rational part of ourselves.

635
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,240
It's just like an emotional reaction. And so if we just skip over that part, say, Hey, shut up,

636
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,640
I don't want to listen to you. I want to listen to my compassionate part. That part of us gets even

637
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,760
more scared. Life's gonna end and you're listening to me. Listen, listen, listen, life's gonna end.

638
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,760
It's like it shouts even louder if we don't listen to it. But if we listen to it and say, hey, okay,

639
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,360
I see you worried, you're worried about my safety. Thank you so much. I hear you. Trust me, I'll do

640
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,800
everything I can to keep myself safe. Once you do that, then it's much easier for the more

641
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,800
compassionate part of ourselves to try to motivate a change. Kit also wants to keep us safe, also

642
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:38,160
wants to do our best, also wants us to change unhealthy behaviors. But does it not because it's

643
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,200
afraid that we'll be inadequate, but just because it cares. It's a much more effective and sustainable

644
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:49,040
voice of motivation. I think that's a really interesting point. I'm glad you brought it up

645
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:55,040
because I don't think I've appreciated that nuance. You do have to acknowledge, again, this maybe

646
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:02,400
comes back to maybe not so much Dick Schwartz's model, but other models of essentially us having

647
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,760
wounded children within us, adaptive children within us, functional adults, etc. You can't ignore

648
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,280
anyone's voice inside. That's right. And the idea is just integration. We want integration and we

649
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,320
want to learn. Part of what your inner critic is telling you may be useful, but you just want to

650
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,320
claim it's useful. And what's useful is probably about, where did you go wrong? What could you do

651
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,120
better next time? It's not useful to say you're worthless or you're a bad person. What are you

652
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:35,520
going to do with that? It's not helpful, but you don't want to shut down that voice at all. But you

653
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:41,760
don't want to dominate things either because it's a very one-sided, very kind of immature, not very

654
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,880
wise part of yourself that just is freaking out, basically. I have no doubt that there is a very

655
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,160
strong correlation between, and it would really be a reciprocal correlation or an inverse correlation,

656
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:01,040
between high levels of self-compassion and low levels of maladaptive behaviors, such as addictions.

657
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:07,280
I wouldn't dispute that for a second. What I'm curious about is how much is causative. In other

658
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:15,040
words, is there any evidence that we could use self-compassion as an intervention to treat,

659
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:21,200
at least partially maladaptive behaviors, gambling, substance addiction, things like that?

660
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,680
I wish there were more research on self-compassion and addiction. There is a little bit of

661
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:34,640
intervention research, I believe. Actually, I'm trying to think, is there a randomized controlled

662
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,120
trial with addiction as the outcome with the intervention? There may not be. I think it's more

663
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:44,000
cross-sectional research that shows they're negatively correlated. Of course, we don't know

664
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,200
causality in that case. There is some research showing that one of the things, when AA is

665
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,480
successful, it appears that one of the reasons it may be successful is because it increases

666
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,480
self-compassion. By the way, I think it depends what group we belong to. I've had people who've

667
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,280
gone to AA that said it was all about shame. Another say it was all about self-compassion,

668
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:09,040
so I think it varies depending on what group you go to. I would be willing to bet money that you

669
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,320
would find that. I don't think we're quite there yet. In terms of the two-way causality, for

670
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,040
instance, if you're really addicted, it may make it harder for you to be self-compassionate.

671
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:23,600
Once you come off a substance, it may be easier to be more self-compassionate. All these things

672
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,440
are always kind of bidirectional. How easy is this? I think as we sort of think and look to the

673
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,960
future of using self-compassion as an intervention. So if you think about the easiest interventions

674
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,880
are drugs. Here's a pill. The treatment group gets a placebo pill. The intervention group gets an

675
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,760
active pill. All you have to do is take this one pill once a day and we'll figure out if it lowered

676
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,720
your blood pressure or your cholesterol. Well, when you start to get into, now we're going to test

677
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,160
whether mindfulness-based meditation is beneficial or self-compassion is beneficial, it becomes more

678
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:04,560
complicated. How challenging is it from a clinical research standpoint to package the practice that

679
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:11,440
you've spent the better part of 20 years refining in yourself, writing about, but then taking it into

680
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,560
a clinical setting with a group of subjects and being able to blind them, being able to randomize

681
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,600
them and then blind researchers who are going to measure outcomes based on obviously the differences

682
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,920
in behaviors. We have developed the mindful self-compassion training program, which actually isn't

683
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,200
designed for clinical populations, but can be adapted for clinical populations. And there's

684
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,800
also compassion-focused therapy, which is similar that is designed for clinical populations. And

685
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,400
there have been randomized controlled trials of both with a waitlist control, which isn't as good

686
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,600
as an active control where you put people in peer support, you might get similar findings and

687
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:55,120
actually expect you might get similar findings from a peer support group. It's actually not that

688
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,760
difficult. I think we definitely have the tools in place right now to do the research. I'm not doing

689
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,640
that research because I'm more focused on developing the interventions. I really hope people do. Also,

690
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:10,800
I don't think it has to be reinventing the wheel. I think adding some explicit self-compassion to

691
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,440
pre-existing interventions that we know work is probably the way to go. There's more than just

692
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,240
self-compassion. Self-compassion isn't everything. I think including mindfulness interventions,

693
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,120
I have to say personally, my feeling is although mindfulness training naturally increases

694
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:30,880
self-compassion, it makes it stronger if you make it explicit. If you give people explicit tools they

695
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,400
can use to practice self-compassion, that's not meditation. Because when you're like in the

696
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,960
supermarket and you have some thought or something happens, you're not going to sit down and meditate

697
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,040
in that moment. But you can put your hand on your heart and say something supportive to yourself.

698
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:51,200
It's very portable. It's very scalable. And now the research shows it doesn't require meditation

699
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:57,360
to learn it, which also makes it more accessible to a lot more people. I love meditation, but it's

700
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:01,760
just a lot of people aren't going to meditate. That's just reality. The self-compassion is easier.

701
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,280
It's more portable. It's more scalable. I personally think if we started looking at

702
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,320
those adding explicit self-compassion into these interventions, strengthen it. I suspect you'd find

703
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,280
it does. We're not quite there yet. I think you're right, by the way. I think that's exactly the way

704
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,360
to go about doing it is you take interventions that are already known to have some efficacy and

705
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:27,440
you layer this on. Because I think as your story explains, this is a relatively straightforward

706
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,880
intervention to teach somebody. And the results can happen quite quickly. If someone who's as

707
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,200
harsh a self-critic as I am can in a period of months with a little bit of daily practice,

708
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,560
with something tangible, because it's tangible to practice, I'm quite excited about it in the sense

709
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,280
that I think there's a pretty big opportunity there. I want to go just into the mindfulness

710
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,200
component a little bit, because you've made this point now several times, which is,

711
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,440
look, mindfulness is not a necessary component of self-compassion.

712
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,240
No, it is a necessary component of self-compassion.

713
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,920
Oh, it is. Okay. So I misunderstood. Maybe I misunderstood. I thought a

714
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,480
mindfulness-based meditation practice is what I really mean. Is that necessary?

715
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,080
You don't need to meditate to be mindful. So meditation is probably the most tried and true

716
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:19,760
way to increase mindfulness. Most mindfulness training programs base their techniques on

717
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,640
meditation. But being mindful is just kind of being aware. Whenever you're aware that you're

718
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,480
suffering, you're being mindful of your suffering, especially when you're aware in a certain way,

719
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,160
when you're aware, not like freaking out aware, but you're aware like, okay, this is what's happening.

720
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,160
So mindfulness itself, you can't have self-compassion without some degree of mindfulness,

721
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,000
but our research shows we did a randomized controlled trial, the mindful self-compassion

722
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:49,520
program. And we found that practice was linked to gains in self-compassion, but it didn't matter

723
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:55,280
whether that practice was sitting down and doing self-compassion meditations, the program has many,

724
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,280
or it was just simple things like taking a self-compassion break in the middle of your day,

725
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,680
and you notice your suffering, giving yourself kindness and support, like you told a good friend,

726
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,840
it didn't matter how you practiced. So meditation isn't necessary, but mindfulness is. And you can

727
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,080
also learn mindfulness without meditation. It's just a little tricky because mindfulness is kind

728
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:18,560
of vague and abstract. It's hard to get your hands around it. So meditation helps.

729
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:26,960
Do you think an analogy to make this point would be that having strong legs is necessary for walking

730
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,960
up a hill? One way to do that is just to walk up a hill. Another way to do it is actually go to the

731
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,560
gym every day, lift weights, and walk up the hill where the actual mindfulness meditation is the

732
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:44,560
going to the gym. It's doing the very concentrated focused exercise. Technically, you don't have to

733
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,440
do it to still do well, but you're in the long run, maybe going to do better. Yeah. So we don't know,

734
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,160
we don't have data in the long run. What's better? I mean, meditation, we know it's tried and true.

735
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:00,080
It can change your neuronal pathways. Meditation is good. I believe in meditation. I'm a meditator.

736
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:06,880
I think it's a little unfortunate that so much emphasis has been placed on meditation because

737
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,000
not everyone's going to meditate. Not everyone wants to meditate. Some people don't have time to

738
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,200
meditate. It doesn't appeal to them. Again, I do think self-compassion is more scalable.

739
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,160
You can have someone. So for instance, we just did a training program for healthcare workers

740
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,760
working at a pediatric hospital, six weeks of training, one hour a week, just done at lunch,

741
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:33,280
very minimal training. We did not give them any homework they had to do outside of the class

742
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,040
because they didn't have time. They were stressed out healthcare professionals. We didn't give them

743
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:42,720
any meditation, but we said on the job, whenever you notice you're stressed or you're sad or have

744
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:48,160
something difficult happens, we give them certain practices they could use to deal with it. We did

745
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,440
give some informal mindfulness practices like feel the soles of your feet, come back to the present

746
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,320
moment. We did things like the self-compassion break, put your hand on your heart and help people

747
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:03,200
develop phrases that work for them to remind them of the three components of self-compassion.

748
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,560
And they got a lot out of it. They didn't have to meditate. After we taught the program, a lot of

749
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,880
them said, actually, maybe I'll take the full program and learn how to meditate. You know what

750
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,240
I mean? So yeah, so maybe they'll go on to meditate after learning some self-compassionate. Actually,

751
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,080
there's some research that shows it helps you stick with the meditation practice if you have

752
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:28,160
self-compassion. The meditation is hard, but I don't think it's the only way forward. And I do

753
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:33,440
think, I just think unfortunately in our culture, there's a way in which it seems kind of foreign

754
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,600
to people. I think there's a lot of blocks to meditation that aren't there with self-compassion.

755
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,520
But it's obviously stuck for you. You've gone on several retreats, it sounds like.

756
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,840
Yeah, 40 retreats. I don't go on retreats nearly as much as I used to. First of all,

757
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:51,440
the pandemic and just my life getting so busy, but I still meditate. Yeah.

758
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:58,080
What is it for you that has kept meditation as sort of part of your daily routine?

759
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,200
Well, the meditation, the reason it's useful, because what meditation basically is,

760
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,840
it's just it's a really focused time. You aren't doing anything else. You're kind of

761
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:14,080
reducing sensory input. I actually usually meditate in bed. It's not quite as good as doing

762
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,080
it on the cushion, but it's still pretty good. And it's kind of more doable for me, right? So

763
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,920
I'll do early in the morning or late at night. You don't fall asleep doing that?

764
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,840
Sometimes I do, but sometimes I don't. Like if I do it when I'm really awake,

765
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,400
if I wake up in three in the morning, let's say my mind's racing, then it's a really good time to

766
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,360
do it. And it actually will help me fall asleep. I'll be honest, the quality of the meditation is

767
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:40,720
not quite as good as when I sit on my cushion, but at least I do it. Whereas sometimes I just

768
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:46,000
find I don't have time. Yeah. So meditation is helpful, first of all, because what happens

769
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,880
when you meditate is you get to a certain brain state. Basically what happens is your default

770
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:57,040
blood network quiets. And so your brain state changes and it's easier for you to see clearly,

771
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,440
it's easier for you to pay attention. There's less chatter in the brain. And that's very helpful.

772
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,760
Yes. So meditation is great, but I just don't want people to think that unless they meditate,

773
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,640
they can't learn this skill. So for instance, there was one study that just had people kind of

774
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,680
like you, instead of texting themselves kindness, we wrote a compassionate letter to themselves,

775
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,720
the three components, mindfulness, common humanity, kindness, what's a day for seven days, one week,

776
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,640
and it reduced depression for three months and increased happiness for six months.

777
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,440
That's doable. Anyone could do that. You don't have to learn how to meditate to do that. And

778
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:37,280
it still helps you. Does your son have a practice around this? It sounds like he's quite aware.

779
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,840
He's finally coming around to self compassion, but he fought it tooth and nail for years. I mean,

780
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,880
just really recently, like the last few months he's come around to it. He used to say, don't give me

781
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,840
that self compassion stuff, mommy, because he didn't want to accept the pain. He wanted to

782
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,520
fight the pain. You don't want to accept imperfection. He was like just clinging on tooth and nail,

783
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,360
you know, to, he wanted the pain to go away. He didn't want imperfection to be there. He was like

784
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,080
full on resistance, but he could articulate it. And I would kind of think, okay, well,

785
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,000
good luck with that one. What can I do? Like you can try to fight the pain. Unfortunately,

786
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I know it's not going to help, but people have to come to that conclusion themselves.

787
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:23,840
But now finally, he's starting to see the value of being kind to himself and see the value of

788
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,640
just kind of understanding that yet he's got to accept imperfection. He said to me the other day,

789
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,840
he said, imperfection is like spicy food. You know, if everything was perfect, all our meals

790
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,640
would be bland. You know, we need some variety. We need some spice to our life. He came up with

791
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,320
that himself. That's kind of amazing. Yeah, it is. And he's finally getting there. He's 18 now,

792
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,600
and he's really getting kind of into the next level of self reflection and stuff. So he's a little

793
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,400
behind, but he's definitely getting there. You have a workbook that's based on your book, correct?

794
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:00,080
The mindful self compassion workbook is basically the mindful self compassion program,

795
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,480
which I co developed with Chris Germer. We met back in 2008, we're partners, and we created this

796
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,160
program, we've got the Center for mindful self compassion, we have teacher training,

797
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:16,320
we have adaptations, it's his own thing. Chris and I was totally us together that created this

798
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:22,240
program. And the workbook is the eight week program in workbook formats, you basically

799
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,280
take yourself through the program. Yeah, I mean, to me, that seems like a really logical place for

800
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,640
somebody to start if listening to this podcast has got them interested in at least piqued some

801
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,920
amount of curiosity around this idea. It's a very structured way to go through this. It's not the

802
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,600
way I did it. But I've looked through the book and I thought, boy, this is a really nice way

803
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:49,360
to be guided through something. I would certainly make a plug for that. You can just get it on

804
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:55,520
Amazon. It's easy to hear. It's like $10. Yeah, if you want to actually train in self compassion,

805
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,920
it's an empirically supported program. There are randomized controlled trials, it's very carefully

806
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,960
sequenced. We refine the program over years and years and years and what worked and what didn't

807
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:12,000
work. I'm pretty confident in the efficacy of the program. But if you want like more personal stories,

808
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,320
then you could probably go with my first book self compassion or Chris Germer's book,

809
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,720
The Mindful Path to Self Compassion. Some people don't like workbooks, they like more like the

810
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:25,760
stories. And so that would be my trade book. Well, Kristin, this has been a really interesting

811
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:32,000
discussion. And I'm really a huge believer in this work that you're doing. And you've also lived it

812
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,800
too. You've had these ups and downs and these challenges that have, I think, kind of allowed

813
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,120
you to sort of roll with things that are hard. I had a lot to be self compassionate about,

814
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:47,120
that's for sure. Well, I look forward to meeting you in person at some point when this pandemic

815
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,440
rolls over. And again, thanks so much for your time today. Thank you. It's lovely.
