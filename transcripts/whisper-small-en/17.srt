00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,480

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,360
Welcome to this episode of the Peter Attia drive.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,680
This was a really fun one for me to do.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,040
I mean, it was done relatively without much preparation or prompting.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,240
So in this episode, I interview one of my really, really close friends, Mike Trevino.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,360
Mike and I have been friends from the moment we met, which was about five years ago.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,160
And there are just a number of things about Mike that are really interesting and you'll

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,280
learn a lot of them in this episode.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,480
Starting with the fact that Mike is arguably the most accomplished amateur endurance athlete,

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,920
certainly that I've ever known, but you'd have a hard time making a case for any other

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,080
amateur endurance athlete period.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,920
His accomplishments are beyond legendary.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,200
And we go through many of them here, though not all of them.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,160
And that's sort of why I wanted to have this discussion with him.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,280
I was like, Mike and I see each other every week.

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,920
We somehow figure out a way to time our travel such that there's one day a week, at least

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,560
three weeks out of the month when we're not traveling and we can go out and do a ride.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,880
And it's a relatively short ride.

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,040
We ride about 40 kilometers, but it's just kind of this amazing time when we get to catch

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,480
up on life and all of the things that we think about together.

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,600
And so Mike shares a lot of that stuff today.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,120
He gets into, again, I think you could listen to this and easily come away overwhelmed and

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
thinking, wow.

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,000
There's nothing about that guy's experience that I can relate to because he's basically

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,560
setting world records in running, in cycling.

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,880
He's doing these things like the race across America that I think it's almost impossible

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,800
for a normal person to fathom what that means.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,840
It's impossible for me to fathom what that means.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,440
And I have some experience in these sort of ultra distance world.

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
But I think he also is able to make the case that the lessons that he learns in doing these

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,800
things are applicable to life and they're applicable to specifically things that you

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
might want to do for your own endurance.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,320
If you're currently able to run a 5K and wondering what does it take to get to the 10K or the

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,920
half marathon or you're running the half marathon and you want to run the marathon, what does

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
it take?

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,800
Well, in many ways, it's sort of taking a page out of Mike's playbook.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
Mike's a really special guy to me.

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,200
Mike and his wife Nada, who are very close friends, have been there for me during arguably

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
one of the most difficult periods of my life.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,760
And they were the first people to basically show up when I needed to be picked up.

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,440
And so I'm forever grateful to Mike and his family.

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,880
And I just find that our weekly bike rides on Sunday mornings, which are usually when

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,080
we do them, are among kind of the most cherished things that I do outdoors anymore.

54
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,240
So much of what I do is now alone.

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I lift weights alone.

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,840
I ride my Peloton or my Wahoo Kickr alone.

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,600
And this is kind of the one time a week when I get to go and be with somebody else for

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,240
an hour, 75 minutes, an hour and a half.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
And I value it greatly.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,620
One anecdote that I'll tell before we jump into this episode, just to put in perspective

61
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,480
for anybody who is themselves a cyclist or a reasonably serious athlete, just to put

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,360
in context Mike's accomplishments and just his ability.

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,040
So about four years ago when I was training very hard as a time trialist, and at this

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,720
point Mike was, you know, he was running, but he was kind of done with his ultra distance

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,520
career and had not been on a bike in probably a year.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,920
And he was like, you know, I'm going to come out and join you one day for one of your workouts.

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,280
I said, that'd be great.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,960
You know, and I couldn't expect that he could even come close to keeping up with me because

69
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,120
at the end of the day, just conditioning seems to matter and how much preparedness you have

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
matters.

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,680
And so we went out to Fiesta Island where we train and there's, you know, a loop that

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
you do that's part of the training.

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,120
So we did this workout together and it was a very tough workout, lots of sort of three

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,280
minute, four minute all out intervals.

75
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,920
And at the end of the workout, we decided to do two hot laps.

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,160
So that's two laps of the big loop of Fiesta Island.

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,040
That would be about almost 14 kilometers for those two laps.

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,880
And you know, I was fit, like I was training for races and I guess, as I said, Mike hadn't

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,520
been on a bike in about a year and we went out and did these two hot laps and I couldn't

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,240
believe it when I crossed the line for the second lap.

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,560
I mean, I expected Mike to be three or four minutes behind and I look back and he's all

82
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,800
of 15 seconds behind me and I was like, wow, I'm about as fit as I'm going to be at this

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
stage of my life.

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,840
There's not a lot I'm going to do to take my game to the next level.

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,320
And he's pretty much right where I am just out of the gate.

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,480
And that was kind of an interesting, you know, wake up of like, there are guys that

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,840
are just at a different level and these guys train and they're forget about it.

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
They're in another world.

89
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,640
So I hope you enjoy this episode.

90
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,200
It's really geared towards people who have some sort of interest in physical performance,

91
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,920
but I really think there are enough sort of life lessons placed within here that I think

92
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,680
anybody even someone who has no desire to run a marathon or do anything crazy like that,

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,080
I still going to find something in it.

94
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,440
And finally, at the very end, if you just don't want to hear anything else and just

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,080
want to skip to the very end, we do disclose what we consider the second best beer of all

96
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
time.

97
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,560
Again, we do not disclose the best beer because, you know, I've got my reasons for that, but

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm at the very least, those of you that are interested in great beer, we'll get a little

99
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
tip at the end.

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,800
So anyway, I hope you enjoy.

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,480
Mike, I'm super excited to sit down and talk about all this stuff with you.

102
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,840
You know, we've known each other for such a long time now, but you're such a sort of

103
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,520
mild mannered understated guy that if someone Googled your name, they wouldn't realize a

104
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,760
fraction of what you've accomplished.

105
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,440
And I think there are a lot of people who are going to listen to this who are going

106
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,840
to be, I think we'll learn a lot from this and be able to apply it to what they're doing.

107
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,760
I doubt many people who listen to this are ever going to want to go and do Ram or try

108
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,600
to set 24 hour world records in cycling and running.

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,040
But I think the principles that you've learned over the years are applicable to someone who's

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,760
going on to try to run their first 10 K or whatever.

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,400
But let's start with a funny story, which is what'd you do for your birthday this year?

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
I ran.

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,920
So how old did you turn?

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,440
43 in December.

115
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,400
And what is your shtick on your birthday?

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Starting at 40, the new goal became run my miles and years, years and miles.

117
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,480
So this year was 43 miles.

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,560
So I remember when you called me later that day after you did your 43 mile run, which

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
in and of itself was crazy.

120
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
The part that I found most impressive was your nutritional strategy.

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,440
Yeah, this year was a new experiment.

122
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,080
I thought it was in good shape and decided to try the run, no calories.

123
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,240
So self supported, but no calories just to see if I could pull it off.

124
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,360
So I left with a couple of crystal light packets for flavor on hydration and 20 bucks to buy,

125
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,320
worst case by a banana at a 7-Eleven or something like that.

126
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,640
And I pulled it off.

127
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Yeah.

128
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,880
I had dinner the night before.

129
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah, I started fasting at five the night before.

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Had a beer.

131
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,520
By the way, I just want to state for the record, the beer that we drink, we never mentioned

132
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
by name.

133
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Never.

134
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Ever.

135
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Okay.

136
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Just yet.

137
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,600
So don't let that ever slip out in case that was the beer you had.

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,040
So you had a beer at 5pm.

139
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:55,120
Had a beer at five and went to bed 9 or 10, up at four and out the door by five.

140
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
No breakfast.

141
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,840
No breakfast.

142
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,000
And that was it.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,160
Started running.

144
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
And you ran about eight minute miles for 43 miles.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah, just over eight with some hills.

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Went south.

147
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,480
I went left North County, San Diego, went to the coast, ran up Torrey Pines.

148
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,200
Gorgeous morning and just kept going down the coast of La Jolla and Pacific Beach and

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,880
down to Point Loma and then turned around and stopped at Pacific Beach at the pier where

150
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,000
I met my family noonish and we had brunch.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,880
And you said you weren't even really hungry when you were done.

152
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
I wasn't.

153
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
I expected to.

154
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,760
You know, we were ready to have a big brunch and Bloody Mary's and celebrate.

155
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,920
You know, my wife brought the kids and balloons and we ate at our favorite restaurant and

156
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
now it was great.

157
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
It was a wonderful day.

158
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Yeah.

159
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,520
So in the parlance, that's what we call fat adaptation because, you know, if you do the

160
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,040
math, the extent to which you're expending energy, you're probably expending somewhere

161
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,560
in the neighborhood of six to seven hundred kilojoules per hour.

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,520
And you know, if you were trying to get access to that just from glycogen, I mean, you'd

163
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,600
be done in probably two, three hours.

164
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Two or three.

165
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah, two or three at most.

166
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,840
And that was fairly aggressive pace.

167
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Right.

168
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,480
So, you know, there's a series of energy stores that you tap into depending on your output

169
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,400
and duration, you know, that well.

170
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,840
So now I try to keep an even pace and stay hydrated.

171
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,120
I didn't really stop.

172
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,220
It was actually nice because in prior runs, I'd, you know, you have to stop at a seven

173
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,400
eleven and wait in line or stop at a gas station and get something to drink and buy a banana

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,760
or granola bar or something.

175
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,260
And then you get tight.

176
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,640
So I was able to just keep moving.

177
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
How did you drink?

178
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
How did you stop the game?

179
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,680
So I had I had 20 ounce handhelds and fortunately was able to refill.

180
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,720
There's a little drinking fountain at Toy Pine State Beach and there's one in low way

181
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,400
shores and I didn't kind of know where all the stops are.

182
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,480
So I just planned it and a little 30 second diversions.

183
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,920
And by the end I was just doing, you know, straight water, which felt and tasted better.

184
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:10,480
I turned around Point Loma OB and then went back up north and one last water stop in South

185
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,400
Mission Beach and ended in Pacific Beach.

186
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,600
So I remember one of the first times we hung out, we were introduced by a mutual friend.

187
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,440
This is probably in 2013.

188
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,800
And this is back when I was cycling pretty seriously.

189
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,320
You were running pretty seriously, but you weren't cycling much at the time.

190
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,520
But I was telling you about this shake that I make this generation.

191
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,160
You can I call it the Peter Kaufman where I take the generation you can and I mix it

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,560
with heavy cream and almond milk.

193
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,800
And it's like it's like the best meal you can have in a shake.

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Right.

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
And I was like, hey, you know what?

196
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,640
Why don't you come over after your workout on Sunday?

197
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,040
And I'll fire this up for you.

198
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
And you said, sure, I'll be there.

199
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
And you came over.

200
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,460
But the part that blew my mind is you ran over and it was a 50 mile run.

201
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,360
You know, even though we only lived like you lived in La Jolla at the time.

202
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,840
So we only lived maybe 12 miles away from each other.

203
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,560
But you had turned it into a 50 mile run to end at my place.

204
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,960
I forgot about that.

205
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,320
Yeah, of course.

206
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Because for you, that's nothing.

207
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
Well, no, it was it was actually one of my longer runs training for so that was that

208
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,440
was 13 and that Sunday Saturday or Sunday was one of my long runs training for a supposed

209
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,600
to be a 300 mile run down the coast.

210
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,400
And so I think I peaked around 50 or 60 in terms of I was doing 130 mile weeks getting

211
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
ready for that.

212
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,080
170 you hit one week, didn't you?

213
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,320
No, the week of the run, I hit 315, 313, 315.

214
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Ended up being about 275 miles.

215
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,880
The run itself, which was Gaviota State Beach to San Diego to raise money for the Navy Seal

216
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Foundation.

217
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,280
So that 50 mile I was training for that, which was five, six weeks after your shake.

218
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,560
I remember your wife and daughter saw me standing in the driveway and she kind of looked at

219
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,880
me out of the corner of her eye and just ran in the house.

220
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
The pool of sweat.

221
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
It was incredible.

222
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, a lot of sweat.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,560
But yeah, you came in and fired up the shake.

224
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,880
So I'm really glad to have microscopically contributed to that recovery that there.

225
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,800
Yeah, it's all about that shake.

226
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
So where'd you grow up?

227
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
I grew up in Iowa.

228
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,920
And were you like a cross country star in high school or something?

229
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,600
No, no, I was actually a football player wrestler in Iowa.

230
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:30,440
I started riding my bike at four and was out the door independently by six and then doing

231
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,600
50 and 100 mile rides by the time I was 10 or 12.

232
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Did Greg Bry, which is a bike ride across Iowa.

233
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,280
First one was in 87 when I was 12.

234
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,200
I was 400 miles across the state.

235
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,820
So I mean, I always liked the endurance stuff, but most of my time was spent.

236
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,160
My dream was to play Notre Dame football.

237
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,720
Your dad went to Notre Dame, right?

238
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Dad went to Notre Dame.

239
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
My grandfather did.

240
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,560
My mom went to St. Mary's, which is the sister college there.

241
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,120
So my dream was to Notre Dame football.

242
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
So that was big too.

243
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,720
Weighed about 200 pounds in high school and wrestled heavy weights.

244
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I didn't want to lose weight.

245
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,680
Offensive lineman, offensive tackle in high school and then went and played football in

246
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,640
college inside linebacker in college.

247
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,840
And I remember the first time you told me that I was like, how were you a football

248
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,880
player? Like you just you don't have an ounce of extra weight on you at this point.

249
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,680
And so what was that metamorphosis like to transition from being kind of a power athlete

250
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,480
to an ultra endurance athlete?

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,360
It wasn't planned.

252
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,840
You know, it was college became about college and I played a year and a half of football

253
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,640
and I wanted to finish college early.

254
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,560
I just didn't want to go the whole four years.

255
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,320
So I just loaded up on classes and realized I was there to study and work and not

256
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
necessarily play football.

257
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,160
So I quit football, played rugby.

258
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,240
And my first job out of college was actually a startup in Europe.

259
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,080
And the interesting byproduct of that whole transition was I was learning

260
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,920
German, living in Heidelberg, Germany.

261
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,480
I was running sales and marketing for this tiny little startup there.

262
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,560
And the family teaching me German, one of the daughters was dating a rugby player that

263
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,960
played for the local semi pro rugby club.

264
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,440
And when he found out I had played rugby, he said, come practice with us.

265
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,280
And their practices at the time were runs in the mountains in Bavaria in southern Germany.

266
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,880
So I just fell in love with the trail running.

267
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,680
So it just and I ended up playing rugby with that team, which was fantastic.

268
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,480
It was a blast.

269
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,960
But I also ended up losing weight and that's just sort of fed on itself.

270
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,720
So by the time I got back to New York, you know, I'd lost 15 pounds and just kept

271
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
training, kept running.

272
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,520
It didn't lift as much and it just fell off.

273
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,480
I mean, I was at my peak 218.

274
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
I'm 170 now when I was racing.

275
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,920
I was 155, 160.

276
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,080
I lost five, 60 ish pounds over the course of five, 10 years.

277
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,440
But the amazing thing, because I've seen so many pictures of you back, like the picture,

278
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,920
there's a great picture of you that hopefully we'll figure out a way to sort of link to

279
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,600
it in the show notes.

280
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,400
But at the beginning of the 2000, I think 2004 Ram maybe.

281
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,320
And it's like, I'm looking at you and I'm like, I know you're 155 pounds, but you

282
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
don't look at, you look like a beast.

283
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Yeah, it was never about looks.

284
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,960
No, but it's just you're, you know, you become purpose built.

285
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,840
We've talked about this, you know, being an engineer, I've always just looked at my

286
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,040
body's just a utility to achieve an outcome.

287
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,360
Right.

288
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,520
So how do you engineer the outcome that you want?

289
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,720
I made a transition from running to cycling.

290
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,440
In hindsight, it was a fairly short transition.

291
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,040
I was riding a lot cross training when I was competing in ultra is running 2001,

292
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,040
two, three, but I knew I wanted to do race cross America.

293
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,920
And so I was always, I mean, I was still riding 150 miles a week when I was

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,560
running 100 miles a week.

295
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,240
So I was still riding quite a bit.

296
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,280
But then as soon as I stopped running and started writing, my body just changed.

297
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,120
I, my massage therapist, who's still my massage therapist today, couldn't believe

298
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,880
the transformations, your body just changed overnight.

299
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,400
But that's all I was doing.

300
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
All I was doing was training.

301
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,560
You have that sort of unique ability where you can go out and run a sub three

302
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,240
hour marathon, which that's a very fast marathon.

303
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,120
But at the same time, you're setting 24 hour world records on a track and running.

304
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
I mean, you ran almost 150 miles in 24 hours, right?

305
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,200
Yeah.

306
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,480
Yeah.

307
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,040
I didn't set any world records on the track running.

308
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,240
I did set some course records on a track 24 hour run in a one, which was the San

309
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,520
Diego one day, and I swore I would never run on a track again.

310
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,960
It was probably the hardest ultra, single day ultra I ever did.

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,560
Cause it's just so monotonous.

312
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,240
You're on a quarter mile track.

313
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,400
Quarter mile track.

314
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Kiamaka college in, you know, South San Diego running 24 hours just going, you

315
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,160
know, you looked forward to every four hours or every six hours, they'd change

316
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,200
direction, they blow whistle and you crossed the chip tracking was, and then

317
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,040
you'd change direction and you'd run the other direction for four hours.

318
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,240
That's what you look forward to.

319
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,080
And at the time, this is a one, I mean, I was running with the handheld Sony

320
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,320
Walkman and I had tapes.

321
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,560
Oh my God.

322
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Back then the CDs were still skipping a little too much.

323
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,920
CDs didn't work.

324
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,800
And shortly after that, you know, MP3s, you started playing with mini discs

325
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,400
and other things, but so that in hindsight, you know, I'm running with a

326
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,960
water bottle on one hand and a Sony Walkman in the other hand carrying it for

327
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,040
24 hours.

328
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,680
And did you have like a big support staff for something like that?

329
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,520
I did not have anyone there at that event.

330
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,800
In fact, I had a cooler that I brought, you know, I backed my truck up to the,

331
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
you know, back of the track and threw a cooler in the back and left the hatch

332
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,720
open and I just crude myself for that.

333
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
I didn't want to bother anyone.

334
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,440
I mean, couldn't ask anyone to stay out there.

335
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,960
This was sort of your opening, uh, like this, this was the event that kind of

336
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,880
put you on the map of like, cause again, you didn't, a lot of these ultra distance

337
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,640
guys had been sort of doing that stuff for longer, but you just sort of showed

338
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,840
up and wasn't that like your first big win?

339
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,720
That run was actually at the end of what had been my first big year.

340
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,080
So I, in 2000, I ran my first 50.

341
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,360
You know, Trent made the transition from marathons and you know, the question was

342
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,600
just, can I do a 50?

343
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,080
And I did the, it was, we call it PCT 50, the Pacific Crest Trail 50 molar, um,

344
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,800
hot August, and I then did a hundred molar called the Angeles Crest 100 starts

345
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,280
in the right wood ends at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, about six weeks after that.

346
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,760
And I was doing the hundred because my goal is to qualify for what was, and

347
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,440
still is the super bowl of ultra is the Western States 100.

348
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
Uh, I didn't get into the Western States.

349
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,680
This was in 2000, but I submitted for the bad water.

350
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,800
So that was my goal.

351
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,840
So in 2000 applied to get into bad water.

352
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,160
I did for 2001, the July 2001 running to the bad water.

353
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,560
And so 2001 was, I stacked a bunch of races.

354
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,400
I did a bunch of 50 molars actually to the Boston marathon, you know, in there

355
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,960
and between two fifties and so the track run was actually at the end of that season.

356
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,640
So I did 50 you've been doing a lot of water.

357
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,000
And then I actually on September 11th of 2001, I was scheduled to fly to

358
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,600
Colorado to try to beg a bunch of 14ers set a record of 14ers and had to postpone

359
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,840
that a week and did it a week or two after that.

360
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
And that was in September of 01.

361
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,320
And then I did the track run in November of 01.

362
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,400
And that was the end of my year.

363
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
So tell people what bad water is.

364
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
Cause that out here means a lot.

365
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,600
Cause anyone in Southern California knows what that is, but yeah.

366
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,560
So bad water is a running race that is starts in Death Valley, California.

367
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,600
So it's nice and cool.

368
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,760
Nice and cool.

369
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,080
You know, it's a cool one 25 at the peak around four o'clock.

370
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,080
You know, it's so hot.

371
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
If you run the white line, it's, you know, 10 degrees cooler.

372
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,480
The surface gets really hot.

373
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,760
So the air temperature is 125.

374
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,240
The surface to me can fry an egg.

375
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,760
People can fry an egg on a hood of a car.

376
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,480
So I did the bad water and how long is it?

377
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,720
It's 135 miles and you start in Death Valley at a hundred or so feet below sea

378
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,120
level, I don't remember exactly.

379
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,920
And it now finishes in Whitney portals, which is 8,500 feet.

380
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,480
So it's a beautiful, let me go through all these.

381
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,200
Ecosystems you start in a desert and you journey over to three 95.

382
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,400
You roll into lone pine, which is sort of a cool little mountain town in

383
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,520
California, the base of the Sierras.

384
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,760
And then you start get on this portals road, Whitney portals road, which is

385
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,600
about a half marathon pure, you know, all climbing.

386
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,280
So you have 13 or so miles of climbing up to the Whitney's portal.

387
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,120
It used to actually go all the way up to the top of Whitney for safety

388
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,520
reasons, they stopped doing that.

389
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,600
And funny side note is I had, I was doing a lot of climbing, a lot of

390
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,040
mountaineering stuff in 2001.

391
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,120
So my crew, I did have a crew for bad water.

392
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,200
You have to have one.

393
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
So I had two crews.

394
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,760
I actually had a running crew and a climbing crew and my climbing

395
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,520
partner was waiting for me at the portals.

396
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,440
I don't think I've ever talked about this with you.

397
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,280
So I did the race, you know, 10 a.m.

398
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,720
Start.

399
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,520
I finished, I forget my time, but I finished the next day around noon or one.

400
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,640
And my climbing partner was there.

401
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,880
We were going to go climb.

402
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,640
So we're going to hike up to the base of Mount Whitney.

403
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,480
And we were going to climb, I think the East face of Mount Whitney.

404
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,680
And he had all the climbing gear ready to go.

405
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,120
And I finished 135 miles and I said, Hey, buddy, you don't want me on the other

406
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,440
side of playing you, you don't want me on the other side of the road.

407
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,600
And so we ended up going down to Lone Pine and having pizza.

408
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah, they all, they all down the climb.

409
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,920
I have a much smaller story than that, meaning like it's a fraction of that.

410
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,480
But, uh, in 2007, I was, I wanted to swim across Lake Tahoe as a training swim

411
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,760
for a longer swim I was doing later that summer and trans Tahoe.

412
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,400
I mean, you can do it 10 different ways to Sunday, but I wanted to do the

413
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,880
longest possible crossing, but I didn't do a good job picking a boat captain.

414
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,120
I left it till the last minute.

415
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,400
I didn't know how to get someone really good.

416
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,320
So I just kind of went to, you know, some local and said, Hey man, can you

417
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,960
pilot me across this thing?

418
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,000
And it turned out he was clearly drunk.

419
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,440
And we only know this because I left accidentally, I left my GPS device on

420
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,760
in the boat the whole time we were on the boat, but he didn't realize that the

421
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,600
purpose of the guy in the boat is to set the direction, the swimmer sets the speed.

422
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
The boat sets the direction he followed me.

423
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,640
So we asked our way across Lake Tahoe and I mean, it was a total shit show.

424
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,600
I ended up like running out of food.

425
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,880
Because of course I only budgeted this to be so many hours and it ended up being

426
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,680
like two and a half hours longer.

427
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,880
It turned out to be probably the hardest one in my life mentally.

428
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,280
But I remember that day I was like, Oh, you know, we start at night.

429
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,560
So I'm like, I'll be done by 2 PM.

430
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,240
I told my brother, I was like, dude, have the bikes down at Lake Tahoe.

431
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,680
As soon as I get off, we're going to ride around the lake, you know, which is

432
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,880
like a 80 mile ride or something.

433
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,320
And I swear when I finished that swim, I was, I could barely walk

434
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,160
to the car, just, you know, the sun beating down on you, like the mental fatigue.

435
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
I was like, yeah, I don't know how I thought that I was going to ride around

436
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,360
this lake at this point.

437
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,560
That's a great, I mean, the training, the training for these things is what

438
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,600
prepares you and not just the miles, not just the time on your feet, but it's

439
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,040
stuff like that, that mentally is demoralizing, right?

440
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,520
It completely humbles you.

441
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,640
And I think if I look back on the stories, you know, very few stories come from races.

442
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,000
A lot of my stories come from the training and we all have great stories.

443
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,600
I mean, I've gotten stuck in the desert, sand storms, learned to bring goggles

444
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,160
with me to ride my bike and goggles to deal with sandstorms.

445
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,720
I had my beam.

446
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,080
I used to ride a soft ride and my beam delaminated.

447
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,320
It was so hot in the desert.

448
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,520
So the carbons sat in this, this carbon beam sat in an aluminum sleeve and it was

449
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
so hot it delaminated.

450
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,720
So essentially what happened is, is the, my seat lowered about six inches.

451
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,080
And so I was on my way out east to the Salton sea and I think somewhere around

452
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,760
Westmoreland and Brawley, I found a machine shop and I went to the guys and none of

453
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,920
them spoke English.

454
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,440
And I said, do you guys, do you have any screws?

455
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,600
Some cheap metal screws.

456
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:40,320
And so they had a bunch of power tools and they, three of us, they pulled up on the

457
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,880
sea, got it to a relatively close spot where I needed to be.

458
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,280
And we started drilling sheet metal screws through the aluminum and carbon.

459
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,440
Cause I was 200 miles from San Diego, 150 miles from San Diego.

460
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
And it just wouldn't occur to you to call a friend and come pick you up.

461
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,600
No, I mean, yeah, you're, you're on your own as part of the journey.

462
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,200
And this is this, I had a flip phone that I turned off because you had no reception

463
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,760
out there, so I don't think I probably even could have called a friend at the time.

464
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:06,560
Great.

465
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,080
You know, the stories are endless on, you know, stuff like that.

466
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,200
Another, you know, Whitney story, we tried to rock climb Whitney in May and it was

467
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,000
still all snow and ice and what should have been a six or eight hour climb turned

468
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,440
into a 22 hour climb.

469
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
No food, no water and brutal.

470
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,080
Same deal.

471
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,040
We had planned to meet some people afterward and, but those, you know, those

472
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,080
are the most memorable stories.

473
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,640
It provided you get out alive.

474
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,560
Provided you get out alive.

475
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,120
Yeah.

476
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
That's the caveat.

477
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,040
So you very, very briefly a moment ago alluded to Ram, which again, anybody in

478
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,800
the cycling world, especially in the ultra world will understand what Ram is.

479
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,200
It would generally be regarded as the single most challenging cycling event.

480
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,840
I, again, I don't even know how you can pair it to the Tour de France, obviously

481
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,720
the Tour de France or one of the grand tours like the Giro or the Vuelta.

482
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Those are remarkable feats that only the best professionals in the world are going

483
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,920
to do it was Ram, you know, it's an amateur event, although some pros have done it,

484
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,640
but I don't even remember when I learned about Ram, like it was always something I

485
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,680
knew about and couldn't fathom that people could do it.

486
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,080
So you obviously decided to do it, but tell us what Ram actually is.

487
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,280
Ram is the race across America.

488
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,840
It's a bike race across America.

489
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,520
It started in the, I think it's the early eighties and my first exposure to Ram was

490
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,440
actually when I was a kid, there was a guy named Bob Breedlove, who was a surgeon in

491
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,680
Des Moines, Iowa, who was doing this crazy race across America.

492
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,560
So I learned about Ram and I was already riding my bike.

493
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,880
And it's just, holy cow, these guys can go 3000 miles across the country nonstop.

494
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,520
So it's the same length as the Tour de France, but it's not in stages unless you

495
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,920
decide to make it in stages, you just go nonstop.

496
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,440
So the whistle blows and first person to these coast wins.

497
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,600
And to put that in perspective, the Tour de France, which is ridiculously grueling,

498
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,440
is about 22 days.

499
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
It's about 22 days.

500
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:02,920
Yeah.

501
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,640
And the winner is going to do Ram in how many days?

502
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,520
Eight.

503
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
And depending on the route in the year, it's over a hundred thousand feet of

504
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,640
climbing and you're going through the desert of California, the Hills of West

505
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,520
Virginia, of course, to the Rockies and Kansas and the flats that are windy.

506
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,480
And the year I did it, it was very windy, crazy rains.

507
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,440
So the thing about Ram is it's not just the person riding the bike.

508
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,720
It's the logistics.

509
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,880
It's the crew.

510
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,040
You're dealing with rules, crazy race rules.

511
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,320
And so it's a really multifaceted, I mean, you have to really engineer

512
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,640
the race to do well, right?

513
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,200
So of course you have to prepare for it, but you know, your bike equipment,

514
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,920
you have the vehicle equipment, you have race food, racer food, you have crew food.

515
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,120
And then you think about everything from batteries to, we were rigging the

516
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,960
car to get power, extra power.

517
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,920
We had speakers on the vans and I mean, it's just crazy logistics, getting

518
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,440
ready for something like that, which is part of the fun, it's part of that.

519
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,880
You know, all the different variables you have to control for.

520
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,360
I've seen world-class racers bail before they even hit Arizona.

521
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,240
Cause they just, their crew blows up.

522
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,600
My crew in 2004, when I did it, only one was a cyclist.

523
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,040
You know, it was kind of like building a company, you know, you, you, you,

524
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,240
problem solving comes best from people that represent different functional areas.

525
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,560
Right.

526
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,080
So I had massage therapists.

527
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,920
I had a doc.

528
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,000
I had a one cyclist at a software engineer, my sister, you know, I had a

529
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,920
really mixed team, none of them, except for one knew how to change a tire on a

530
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,920
bike and I figured we could teach them that.

531
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,320
Yeah.

532
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,000
And the crew dynamics is the biggest part of pulling that thing off.

533
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,960
It's all about the crew.

534
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,520
You know, when you're talking about eight, nine days, that's unbelievable.

535
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,640
I always felt the highest compliment that I ever felt or the greatest sense of

536
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,840
pride I probably ever felt during my marathon swimming days was when I got

537
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,000
asked to crew chief for one of my fellow swimmers.

538
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,360
So when I was doing the swims, you don't have to have a crew chief.

539
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,560
And that person basically is the one that is designated in charge.

540
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,080
There is one and only one boss on that ship and everybody does what they say,

541
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,600
no matter what the fuck is going on.

542
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,000
That's right.

543
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,720
So you have to trust that person with your life.

544
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,120
They're the ones that make the decision on when you have to change

545
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,080
feeding, if things are going wrong, they're the ones who pull you out of the

546
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,520
water, if they think you're failing, that's like the guy in the corner who

547
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,600
can throw the white towel.

548
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,320
And when you're getting the crap beat out of you, so, cause you know, as

549
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,800
athletes, when they're doing these ultra distance things, like they can

550
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,640
become delirious and then you have to think about their safety.

551
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,560
So, you know, a number of occasions I got to crew chief for friends of mine who

552
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,200
were doing some of the most ridiculous swims I've ever seen.

553
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,440
Like Forrest Nelson is a friend of mine who again, outside of the swimming

554
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,320
community, nobody would know him, but he's the guy's ridiculous.

555
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
I mean, he's soloed around Catalina Island.

556
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,400
That's a 50 mile swim.

557
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,360
He's done a double crossing of Catalina in the winter, which is, I mean,

558
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,160
just from another planet and yeah, you realize like, you know, the

559
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,240
responsibility that's on you when you are responsible for making sure the

560
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,080
other 10 people on the boat aren't screwing up their jobs and you are a

561
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,920
hundred percent responsible for everything that swimmer is doing, counting

562
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,560
their stroke, right?

563
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,200
All those things.

564
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,800
And, and again, the longest I've ever had to crew is, you know, be a chief

565
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,560
is maybe 36 to 48 hours.

566
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,000
I can't even imagine what a crew is going through for nine days, eight days.

567
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,920
It's nine days.

568
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,520
It's nine days of the most intense and you know, these are first world problems.

569
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,120
This is an invented challenge.

570
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,360
We should keep that in perspective.

571
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,000
So, but when you're in the moment, when you're in the race and there's other

572
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,840
crew out there and there's other racers out there, and especially as you get more

573
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,240
and more sleep deprived and vested in the outcome, it's as real as it gets.

574
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,840
So that's exactly right.

575
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,840
In fact, my crew chief, the first year was the only cyclist he had brought his

576
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,080
brother, I think his brother was a math professor at MIT or Columbia, and they

577
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,080
ended up getting into a fist fight in the parking lot of a grocery store in the

578
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,880
Midwest.

579
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,640
And I heard screaming out, I was down for a sleep.

580
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,800
I heard screaming outside the RV.

581
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,400
What's going on by her and Jerry or in a fight?

582
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,840
What it's come to blows and they didn't speak for the rest of the, I mean, that

583
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,000
was the, I mean, that this is, these are brothers.

584
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,720
So that was one of many things that happened that year, but I broke my crew

585
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,400
in the first 45 hours.

586
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,920
I didn't, I didn't get off the bike for 28 hours.

587
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,600
I didn't sleep for 45 ish hours.

588
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,040
And when I was supposed to go down for my first plan sleep, the goal was to sleep

589
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,840
two hours a day after the first night.

590
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,160
So I'd ride through the first night and then sleep into the second.

591
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,640
But it's a funny story.

592
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,880
I came off the bike 44 hours, but just outside of Mexican hat, Utah in second

593
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,840
place, tell folks where the race starts.

594
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,160
The race started in Oh, for the race started in downtown San Diego.

595
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,960
So star of India, we're starting San Diego and you start heading east.

596
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,000
You know, go through.

597
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,880
It's not just that you're crossing the country.

598
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,720
You're diagonally crossing the country.

599
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,720
You're going from the bottom left corner of the United States to the

600
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,960
top right corner, right?

601
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,640
Cause that's right.

602
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,440
It's not Northeast.

603
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,800
It finished that year in Atlantic city.

604
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,400
And so we, you know, I don't remember how many miles, but you know, call it 800

605
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,240
miles into the event.

606
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,440
I went down from my first sleep and I'm naked, getting massaged and my massage

607
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,200
therapist is just trying to put me to sleep.

608
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,400
And just as I'm falling asleep, I feel this rocking and the whole RV is rocking.

609
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,000
And I like, for whatever reason, something fires and like, wait, that's the wind.

610
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,600
And so I jump up completely naked, run outside the RV.

611
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,000
And I'm standing on the highway.

612
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,520
Like, which way is the wind blowing?

613
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,440
Which way am I going?

614
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,640
I didn't even know which direction I was going.

615
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,640
And the crew had just slept, you know, just everyone's asleep.

616
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,960
And I, it's probably a half hour after I had gone down.

617
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,200
I hadn't slept yet.

618
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,200
And they realized like, I wanted it.

619
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,120
If that's a tailwind, put me back on the bike.

620
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,880
And it was, and it was.

621
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,600
And so they put me back on the bike.

622
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,480
So they got me all dressed and getting me dressed.

623
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,960
You know, it was a process.

624
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,640
Cause at that point I was sunburned and pretty beat and sore and shaved.

625
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,480
You got me dressed, got me back on the bike and I started riding and I saw

626
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,760
the guy in first place.

627
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,040
I passed the guy in first place who was just coming out of his first lead

628
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,840
slept for an hour.

629
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,880
So this was for Robic.

630
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,320
Robic.

631
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,480
Yeah.

632
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,760
So your aerobic was had just slept.

633
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,600
I passed him and I was then in the lead wasn't by design, but then he, what

634
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,160
happened is he and I then rode for four or five hours and pushed into Utah.

635
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,640
You guys gap the field.

636
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,760
We gap the field.

637
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,800
And what happened is that wind was a storm.

638
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,480
And so if I had stayed, I would have gotten caught in the storm.

639
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,040
And so what happened is we gap the storm.

640
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,400
There was one guy behind me named Wolfgang fashion.

641
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,560
It's a world-class endurance athlete and seven summit sky, Austrian guy,

642
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,640
greatest guy, he was behind me, but a few hours behind me had blown up in the

643
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,000
desert, just a lot of the European guys struggle with the heat.

644
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,280
Cause they just can't train in the heat over there.

645
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,160
So your aerobic and I ended up pushing 10, 12 hours ahead of everybody else.

646
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,680
And everybody else got caught up in this storm.

647
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,320
So I ended up being a really very good strategic move to get back on the bike.

648
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,880
I ended up sleeping around the 48 50 hour mark.

649
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,920
I did get my, you know, hour and a half.

650
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,640
And at that point we were ahead of everybody else and everybody else was

651
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,480
just playing catch up for the next six days.

652
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,400
It's unbelievable.

653
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,360
I mean, we'll come back to talking about Robic who would go on to become probably

654
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,640
the most storied writer in Ram history, correct?

655
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,400
Yeah, he is.

656
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,840
Five time champion.

657
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,480
Yeah, I think four or five time.

658
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:32,960
Yeah.

659
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,680
There's a book that talks about Ram and I've read it and I'm blank on the title.

660
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,440
Now we'll definitely link to it in the show notes.

661
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,480
Do you remember the book I'm talking about?

662
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:39,720
I don't.

663
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,400
Well, you're in it, but barely because I remember talking about it with you a few

664
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,640
years ago and I was like, Mike, this is the year you were second in Ram.

665
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,560
And you're like, yeah, I didn't want to talk to the reporter, but, uh, I, I,

666
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,200
anyway, we'll, we'll figure out what the name of the book.

667
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,760
It's a great book because, you know, if anybody's listening to this and thinks

668
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,000
what the hell I want to understand a little bit more about this, you go into

669
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,240
it and the book, because I mean, Robic must have been able to speak with the,

670
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,800
with the author, you know, you just get a great picture of this crazy dude.

671
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
What he's Serbian, right?

672
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,000
He's Sylvanian.

673
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,520
It's Sylvanian.

674
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:10,840
Okay.

675
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,400
So he was riding for the Sylvanian army.

676
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,440
He was a soldier and his full time job was to be an endurance athlete.

677
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,200
And he was just a beast strong, you know, just in his mental

678
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,160
patience was just phenomenal.

679
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,400
Although that year, if I recall, first of all, you're a rookie.

680
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,080
So a rookie is not supposed to be, I was not supposed to, you're not supposed

681
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,920
to be riding next to him.

682
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,440
In fact, that year was the race directors couldn't figure me out.

683
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,040
I was a runner.

684
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,200
Who is this guy?

685
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,520
And I just didn't know any, but I was young, you know, I didn't know any better.

686
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,360
I just hammered and just I all along was part of my plan.

687
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,080
I was actually off my pace to my, you know, I'm all about looking at my

688
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,120
expected pace over 55 time stations and altitude gain and loss and, you know,

689
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,480
planning it all out, I was off my projected pace.

690
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,760
So, you know, I was a little bit disappointed with where I was, but that's

691
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
eight days of 3000 miles.

692
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,120
So, you know, things get out of whack pretty quickly.

693
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,360
So, you know, it's all about just being a, it's adaptation right in real time.

694
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,480
Now, was this the year or was it the following year when Robik's team

695
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,120
basically accused you guys of cheating?

696
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,240
That was that year.

697
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,440
So that year Robik thought he was going to win it.

698
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,360
He had been preparing.

699
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,360
He should have won by a day.

700
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:21,840
Yeah.

701
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
He expected to.

702
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,240
And so his crew, all, you know, armed forces guys, about halfway through

703
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,640
the country when I was still in it and they, for whatever reason, they just,

704
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
I just wasn't sleeping for that year.

705
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,840
I just didn't, I could not sleep.

706
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,120
I, you know, over the eight and a half days, slept 10 and a half hours.

707
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
Oh my God.

708
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,920
I just couldn't sleep.

709
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,520
And, you know, we can talk later about the mental effects of not sleep.

710
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,440
I mean, sleep I've found is more important than food and hydration when it comes to

711
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,320
thermoregulation and muscle glycogen restoration and synapse repair and

712
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,280
formation, I mean, literally when I was clinically insane by the end of that race,

713
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,880
fully delusional by the end of that race.

714
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
But I just kept hammering.

715
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,920
And so the Robik team, what, who is this guy?

716
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,680
What is he doing?

717
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,360
He has to be cheating and it's legal to spot people.

718
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,080
So they sent a van back and they just attached him to my team.

719
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,560
And apparently this is sort of race tactics.

720
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,960
The Ram is famous for other racers playing mental games and the race

721
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,520
directors kind of encouraged it.

722
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,600
And that was all new to me.

723
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,080
I mean, I'm kind of a pure clean, just go and hammer and let the best man win.

724
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,720
And they love that those antics, right?

725
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,520
The mental games.

726
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
The mental games.

727
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,080
And so the accusations of cheating were chalked up as all.

728
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,800
They're just mental games, but it did become more than that for me because the

729
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,480
race director, you know, at first of all, I had the press, which is why I wouldn't

730
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,720
talk to the press after that.

731
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,440
I had the press asking me, what do you think about the accusations?

732
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,080
My team hadn't told me yet.

733
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,960
And Robik's crew just accused me of cheating so that officials would scrutinize me.

734
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,800
And they intend, eventually they withdrew their accusations and, you know,

735
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,400
it was all fine.

736
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,320
The damage had been done.

737
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,400
I had one really, really bad night.

738
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,240
I think it was in Kansas or a little bit past that.

739
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,800
And it came after I, Robik told me flat out, you're going to win.

740
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,200
And he said, you just don't need to sleep.

741
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,960
You're going to win.

742
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,040
And I said, we've got a thousand miles to go.

743
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,280
So you and Robik would actually be riding together at some point.

744
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,120
Is that even legal?

745
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,360
You're allowed to ride together for 20 minutes every 24 hour period.

746
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,440
And so we rode together and we taught his wife was pregnant at the

747
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,800
time and, and oh, for when we were riding, you know, he's, we were talking about

748
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,880
his, I think he knew it was going to be a boy.

749
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,040
So, you know, he's talking about his, his soon to be born kid and, you know, he

750
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
asked me where I was from.

751
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,760
And, and so we talked a little bit, you know, he, his English was okay and

752
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,040
actually had a great time.

753
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,480
And then I told him to go ahead and he said, no, you go ahead.

754
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,960
And so I ended up riding ahead and got ahead of him a bit.

755
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,160
And he was hurting at that point.

756
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,400
Cause I think he was just like, what?

757
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,080
And I was, I did my best to look fresh and was smiling and joking.

758
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,160
And, you know, acting like, oh, this is just a little stroll, you know, in the park.

759
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,480
So mental games.

760
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,320
But shortly after that, his team accused me of cheating and, you know, it all

761
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,200
played out over a day or so.

762
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,800
What's interesting is one of the race officials, I almost, I don't think we've

763
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,080
ever talked about this, but I quit, I quit the Ram.

764
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,440
I think we were in Indiana, we were outside of Indianapolis and it all came to a head.

765
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,240
And the race official, his name is Johnny Boswell.

766
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,200
And Johnny came up to me and he said, we're so sorry about everything that's

767
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,360
happened. I heard you, you're withdrawn from the race.

768
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,560
Is there anything we can do to keep you in the race?

769
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,720
And I said, this isn't why I came out here at, you know, this is crazy.

770
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
And mind you, I've, you know, 2000 miles into it.

771
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,160
Yeah. With no sleep, you're not even able to think straight.

772
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
I just got off the bike.

773
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,120
Robic at that point was four or five hours ahead of me.

774
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,080
It was completely demoralized, right?

775
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,400
And my team's having to answer questions about why they pulled me off the road to

776
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,640
sleep in the RV. Just crazy stuff, right?

777
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,560
All within race rules.

778
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:08,440
And so I told John, I said, the only way I'm going to stay in this is if no one

779
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,120
speaks to me for the rest of the event, I don't want, because there were crew or

780
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,120
press vans cruising up alongside me, trying to take pictures, trying to interview

781
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,000
me. And I said, I want everyone to leave me alone.

782
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,920
The only way I stay in this.

783
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,960
And at that point I'd felt like, you know, the race is lost.

784
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,200
I'm not going to win this race.

785
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,040
Grobix too far ahead.

786
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,480
So four or five hours with how many miles to go is insurmountable.

787
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,560
Around 800, I think it was around 800 miles.

788
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,360
I'd have to go back and look.

789
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,440
And believe it or not, I went for a run.

790
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,880
I went.

791
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,920
I would say I don't believe it, but you went for a run before we rode our bikes

792
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,000
today. I did.

793
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,560
You just decided at 5 30 in the morning you needed to go for a run just to, you

794
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,920
know, get a little workout in before we got on our bikes.

795
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,320
So I asked myself, what's the one thing that'll center me?

796
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,920
And for me, running has always been my call it meditation, but it's just, I get

797
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,920
centered, right? So I asked my crew, I said, you get, find my running shoes.

798
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,960
And I, you know, what?

799
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,240
And I went for a run and I found a park bench and a little town in the Midwest.

800
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,680
And I ran, you know, a mile or two and I just sat under a park bench and I checked

801
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,080
myself and it was, you know, you could say I was sleepy, but I was of probably

802
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,720
the clearest mental, I knew exactly why I was there and what I was doing.

803
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,720
And I asked myself, do I want to do this to my crew?

804
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,960
They were demoralized.

805
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,000
I was hurting and I ran back and I said, all right, I will do it under these

806
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,600
conditions. I will get back in the race and do it under these conditions.

807
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,080
And I did.

808
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,280
And the official stayed with me and kind of protected us the rest of the race.

809
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
And it was fantastic.

810
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,120
They gave us space, but they just kept an eye on us the rest of the race.

811
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,480
And I've, you know, since I still exchanged Christmas cards with Johnny Boswell.

812
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,920
And we'll always think of him as a friend because he, he saw what we were trying to

813
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,560
do. And I think a lot of people are like, what's this guy doing?

814
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,080
What's, what's his angle?

815
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,080
What was the strategy that normally people took to Ram as far as how much time on the

816
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,320
bike versus how much sleep time?

817
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,840
What would, what would be considered the sort of best practice?

818
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,160
20 to 22 hours on the bike, two to four hours of sleep.

819
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,520
You know, so you want to sleep if you're at a minimum 18 to 20 hours over the course

820
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,440
of a week.

821
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,400
So did anybody ever experiment with I'm going to ride 18 hours and sleep a full six?

822
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,640
A lot of guys have talked about time trial and it, right?

823
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,000
So yeah, you ride 300, you hammer and you go off, you know, so you ride for, call it

824
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,240
18 hours and then you get off the bike and you sleep six.

825
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,520
And I think there's something to be said for that.

826
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,000
I mean, that's the ultimate, you know, if you can do that and sustain it and still put

827
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,400
the same performance in on your sixth or seventh, 300 mile or then that may be there.

828
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,240
You know, it's just math if, you know, cumulative time elapsed is less than just

829
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,440
hammering the whole time.

830
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,520
It's tough though.

831
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,080
I'll tell you, it's tough to get off the bike.

832
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,480
It takes a lot of patience, especially early in the race when the other guys are, you're

833
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,080
going to see like, Jesus, I'm going to sleep for six hours when some dude's sleeping for

834
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,160
two. Like I'm going to wake up, you know, given the difference in speed, three hours

835
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,920
behind a guy.

836
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,080
That's right. And there's a guy here in San Diego that his name is Pete Pinsiras and he

837
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,400
held the transcontinental speed record for a long time.

838
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,200
He was 15.4 miles an hour for eight and a half days.

839
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,280
That includes off the time.

840
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,960
Yeah.

841
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,160
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

842
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,800
So his on bike speed is 20 miles an hour.

843
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,560
He's flying and he didn't stop much, but he said there's really two and I eventually

844
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,280
experienced this.

845
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,400
There's two things that will determine whether or not you can win Ram.

846
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,800
One is what is your Ram speed and really what is your speed?

847
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,800
What speed can you maintain on the bike after you've depleted your muscle glycogen and

848
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,960
you're just cruising?

849
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,720
Because that's ultimately going to determine how fast you can really go.

850
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,840
We used to call that your all day speed in the water.

851
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,720
This is we're well beyond thresholds.

852
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,080
We're just talking about something totally different.

853
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,520
That's right.

854
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,200
That's right.

855
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,440
You're no longer trying to stay 5% of threshold.

856
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
You're you're just you're done, right?

857
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,880
That's that's one.

858
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,240
And the other is what's your REM cycle?

859
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,960
And he taught me this and his wife used to do it for him is she would watch him sleep and

860
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,920
then watch when he would come out of Ram and she would chart it and they would do this

861
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,640
before the Ram because obviously it changes over time.

862
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,080
And so right up before the Ram, his wife would watch him sleep, time it, and then she

863
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,920
would wake him up.

864
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,120
And the whole point being don't wake yourself up in the middle of Ram because you're going

865
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,440
to be sleepy and not be able to perform.

866
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,880
So she'd look at his eyes until because theoretically you go from Ram you if it's late

867
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,280
enough, you might go up to stage one to which is a perfect time to wake somebody up.

868
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:42,640
That's right.

869
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,440
So she would wait till his eyes stop moving.

870
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,800
She would wait till his eyes stop moving, bring him out.

871
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,280
He would feel rested even though it was two hours.

872
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,760
And he said, look, if your Ram is 90 minutes instead of 220, two and a half hours, you're

873
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,160
going to win.

874
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,560
Yeah.

875
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,600
Wow.

876
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,320
That is freaking incredible.

877
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,080
Sleep engineering, engineering the sleep and then he, you know, we've talked a lot about,

878
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,480
you know, staying liquid because it's, you know, you don't want to move blood to your

879
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,880
gut while you're riding because then obviously you're taking blood away from your

880
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,280
legs.

881
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,160
So stay liquid, try to let your body do as little work digesting, but you want nutrient

882
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,000
dense calories, right?

883
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,040
And nutrition, nutrition and hydration should be one of the same to the extent that you

884
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,120
can tolerate that.

885
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,920
So yeah, you're engineering your sleep.

886
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,720
You're engineering your intake.

887
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,720
Of course, you're engineering your training and race strategy.

888
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,360
And then people engineer the shit out of their bikes too.

889
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,600
I mean, people are doing all kinds of crazy things to get their bikes dialed.

890
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,680
Now you got to know Panzaris pretty well and you got to ride with him.

891
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,280
You told me a story about him once and I couldn't believe it.

892
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,080
Like how old was he and how fit he still was?

893
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,600
Yeah.

894
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,760
In 04, I was introduced to him in 04 and went out and rode with a group of guys that

895
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,000
still ride.

896
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,760
And he invited me to ride with them.

897
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,800
So I rode up there in North County, San Diego, and I rode up, did 60 or 70 miles to meet

898
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,120
them.

899
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:09,160
And we rode and we were, we rode up a hill that was a 26% grade, probably a hundred or

900
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,640
so miles into our ride.

901
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,640
I was about 140 or so for me.

902
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,680
And we rode up the hill.

903
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,720
We were leading this crew and I looked over to him at the end of the hill, 26% grade in

904
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,440
North County.

905
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,640
I think it was up near Fallbrook or Vista where he was former nuclear engineer at San

906
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,240
Onofre.

907
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,360
And he said, what's your heart rate right now?

908
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,840
And I said, I think it's like 188.

909
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,960
And I said, what's yours?

910
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,120
And he said, it's 181.

911
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,160
So he's 60.

912
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,800
I don't know how old he was.

913
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,280
He was mid sixties then.

914
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,800
And his heart rate was like 180.

915
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,040
And I said, what's the highest your heart rate has ever gotten?

916
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,800
And he said, I just hit the highest heart rate I've ever seen.

917
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,240
So here he is in his mid sixties and I asked him, I said, you said, I've never gone up

918
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,080
this hill this fast and I've never seen that heart rate.

919
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,320
So here's someone in their mid sixties.

920
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,640
And if you do the math, right, 220 less your age and that's your max heart rate.

921
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,200
That's, that's, so, you know, he should have been around, let's call it 160.

922
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,840
Maybe max heart rate for highly trained, adapted semi professional athlete, world

923
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,240
class athlete, transcontinental speed record holder at the time.

924
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,240
And here he is hitting 180 and he just did.

925
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,440
I'm still reeling in the 26%.

926
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,160
I mean, admittedly I've never been able to climb particularly well on a bike, but

927
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,320
I don't actually think I could pedal a bike up 26% grade unless I had like a

928
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
mountain bike or something.

929
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,680
Like if I took my road bike now, which probably, I can't even remember if I have

930
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,960
a compact crank, I probably do.

931
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,480
So I'm riding like a 34 23.

932
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,680
I don't think I could get up 20.

933
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,240
Like that hill when we're coming around like Hodges, as we're, you know, when you

934
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,560
come to the light before you get to Del Dios, that's maybe 18%.

935
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,720
Maybe.

936
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,760
And it's a, and it's only like 600 mile.

937
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,560
Yeah, exactly.

938
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,440
Yeah.

939
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:01,960
It's nothing.

940
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,120
It's nothing.

941
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:03,640
Yeah.

942
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,160
In fact, he told me most guys will, what they call paper boy.

943
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,360
So they weave back and forth to get up that.

944
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,240
So they'll paper boy.

945
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,920
And then the rule used to be they would go, there's an avocado grove.

946
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,200
It gets to the top of the hill.

947
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,480
And when they were kids or younger, they would go grab avocados and they would

948
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,080
start just, it's all you have to do is lay it on the road and the avocados would

949
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,520
roll down and start, start bouncing down the hill and they'd try to nail guys on

950
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,880
their bikes and avocados.

951
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,040
So if you're slow, you're going to get beamed by avocados.

952
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,800
Oh my God.

953
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,880
So Pete came up to me before, right before the race and said, good luck.

954
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,760
You know, that record needs to go and I wish you the best.

955
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,240
And he, he taught me so much.

956
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,600
I mean, very early on, I haven't talked to him in a few years, but he taught me a

957
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,680
lot and just this whole notion of engineering, the sleep, the nutrition,

958
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,160
the training plan, the race strategy, of course, all the crew stuff.

959
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,320
And that's a lot has to come together.

960
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,640
There's so much more I want to talk about on that front.

961
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,160
I want to come back to Robic because I don't want to forget this.

962
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,800
There are a lot of people listening to this who do, they just can't relate

963
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,680
to what you're talking about.

964
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,800
Let's call this beta spade.

965
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,800
I doubt there's anybody listening to this who's ever going to go out and ride Ram,

966
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,960
let alone, you know, do any of the other crazy ultra endurance stuff.

967
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,880
But I get, I am sure there are a lot of people here who are thinking, I really

968
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,720
want to run a marathon one day, or I really want to do an Ironman.

969
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,600
You know, I want to take that leap from Olympic distance to Ironman.

970
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,760
What can they learn from you to make that transition, which, you know, for many

971
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,560
people running a marathon is as crazy as doing a 24 hour run.

972
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,120
And for many people doing an Ironman for them is as big a stretch

973
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,320
as it was for you to do Ram.

974
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,280
I think we all have the physical ability.

975
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,880
We all natural born athletes, right?

976
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,560
Everyone.

977
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,960
Some people may have, you really believe that.

978
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,720
I believe that.

979
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,840
I firmly believe that.

980
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,960
Now some people may have better genetics or better biomechanics, but look, I was

981
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:54,960
heavy and a jock football player, and I'm not the best endurance athlete in the

982
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,800
world. I mean, I was able to engineer myself, kind of hack my way to positive

983
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,840
outcomes. And if I can do it, I think anybody can.

984
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,600
Now people may have different goals.

985
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,560
So I think the biggest thing is just assume that you have in you somewhere

986
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,640
the ability to do great things.

987
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,400
The other piece of it is change your mindset, right?

988
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,320
Whatever your goal might be, whether it's running a half marathon instead of a 5k,

989
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,360
if that's what you want to push yourself is there should be no sacred cows, right?

990
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,640
We have these constructs in our mind about limits.

991
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,040
And I'd say that's the biggest thing I've talked to people about this before is

992
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,320
just change your perspective on what you think you can do.

993
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,880
Just throw it out the window.

994
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
It's the classic, you know, if someone gets electrocuted and they get thrown up

995
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,400
across the room, it's not the electricity throwing them across the room.

996
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,080
It's their body.

997
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,760
They have the innate ability to do amazing things.

998
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,760
Most people haven't figured out how to tap into that.

999
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,320
So that's my only piece of advice is just check your assumptions at the door,

1000
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,680
right? And just open your mind up a little bit.

1001
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,520
We talked about all these things you've done and what's missing from the story is

1002
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,080
you were working 60 hours a week as an engineer at Qualcomm during this period

1003
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,720
of time. Yeah. In the early 2000s,

1004
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,920
I was running a software company and you know,

1005
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,920
we had test engineers and programmers, et cetera,

1006
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,600
working at Qualcomm and lots of other places. That's right.

1007
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,240
So I actually, but it fit very nicely with my routine.

1008
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,600
So I would get up at three ish run that ride into,

1009
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,160
just to be clear, that's 3am, 3am run and run.

1010
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,280
How far, what would be giving a day in the life of training?

1011
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:34,280
1212 was sort of my staple run 12, jump on the, you know, no shower,

1012
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,200
jump on the bike, ride in to work, shower,

1013
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,160
ask and seat by 630. And I was a programmer at the time. I met,

1014
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,200
even though I had people, I loved the architect and build stuff, right?

1015
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,640
So somewhere in there and prepping from my run,

1016
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,560
I would make a smoothie with whey protein isolate and L-glutamine and

1017
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,520
glucosamine and flaxseed oil and all the stuff I needed to recover.

1018
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,680
So I'd have that in the freezer, come back from my run, grab that,

1019
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,760
throw it in my pack, throw my computer in my pack, jump on the bike,

1020
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,640
and then I'll put my feet up. And so from 630 to noon,

1021
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,120
I would sip on a smoothie that was super cold and eat over time.

1022
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,280
You know, that, that, those would be my,

1023
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,840
that was 2000 calorie shake essentially. Right.

1024
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,600
And so that was my routine,

1025
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,920
but it worked because that was my recovery time and occasionally I would go out

1026
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,000
and run or when I was training for bad water, I learned bad, you know,

1027
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,720
bad water was all about just becoming like a human water filter because you have

1028
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,720
to push so much fluid in bad water just cause you sweat so much that

1029
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,400
I would go and do sauna time.

1030
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,840
So I would run over to a fitness facility that had a nice sauna and jacuzzi

1031
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,800
and I would just focus on raising my, my body temp. So I'd sit in a sauna,

1032
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,640
then I would go sit in the jacuzzi and I would just pound waters and I would go

1033
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,720
back and work for a few hours and jump on my bike.

1034
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,560
So you trained yourself to be hot and to basically process as much water as

1035
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,600
possible. Did you have to pay attention to your minerals and electrolytes?

1036
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,200
Because you know, at that level,

1037
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,200
you can start getting into concern around hyponatremia and things like that.

1038
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,800
Exactly. Yeah. In fact, I learned to love salt.

1039
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,440
So I would actually find it kind of became a salt geek.

1040
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,720
So I would find different salts with trace minerals and elements.

1041
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,560
I fell in love with this Celtic sea salt that I found and it just,

1042
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,480
it felt like electricity. You put it in your mouth and I would actually just do,

1043
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,880
you know, teaspoons of that. So I would do grams of salt. I mean,

1044
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,800
of course other things, magnesium and potassium, et cetera.

1045
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,480
So without a doubt, salt was a big part of it.

1046
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,920
And then of course fat in, you know,

1047
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,320
whether it be a tablespoon of coconut oil or something else,

1048
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,880
I would do that throughout. Yeah. You were kind of far ahead. I mean,

1049
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,960
I think today most people, if they're going to be objective,

1050
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,520
so let's dismiss all the sort of zealots on all sides of the equation,

1051
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,680
but if you're going to be objective,

1052
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,360
there's no doubt that if you want to be an ultra distance athlete,

1053
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,080
you have to be fat adapted. Now that doesn't mean you have to be a nutritional

1054
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,360
ketosis, but you must be fat adapted.

1055
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,080
You do not want to do these things with an RQ above about 0.75 to 0.8.

1056
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,040
But I feel like you sort of backed into that because there wasn't anyone to

1057
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,280
look to 15 years ago.

1058
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,200
There weren't people doing this stuff or talking about it the way there are

1059
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,760
today. When did you figure that out? And what made that so clear to you?

1060
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,480
There were a couple of things and you're right. It was, it was accidental.

1061
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,400
I backed into it and it was through experimentation. Again,

1062
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,640
just checking all your assumptions at the door. There was this, first of all,

1063
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,840
back then there was this idea you shouldn't run more than a marathon or two a

1064
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,480
year, which at one point I was doing one a day.

1065
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,120
And just as part of my training regime.

1066
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,840
So what about this whole idea of carb loading? Really?

1067
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,960
Cause I always felt bloated and it didn't, you know,

1068
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,800
my performance the next day, my heart rate and you know,

1069
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,680
blood was still in my gut. And so I'll metric for me often when I woke up the

1070
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,480
next day about whether or not I was going to run a train was my heart rate.

1071
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,360
And my resting heart rate used to be 37, 38. And if it was ever above 40,

1072
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,080
I would just stand back. I wasn't adapted.

1073
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,400
And there was no point in stressing myself further because I would break into

1074
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,320
overtraining. Well, that in and of itself is pretty impressive.

1075
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,880
Cause I'm guessing many people listening to this are thinking this guy's just a

1076
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,400
hammerhead. He's just a robot. But that takes, I remember from my days,

1077
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,920
the hardest decisions were the days when I pulled back on training. That's right.

1078
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,520
Cause that was like, you're struggling with your own demons. Am I good enough?

1079
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,880
Am I, I'm going to stay in and not train today, but my opponents out there

1080
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,000
training, Oh my God, what am I doing? But you,

1081
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,080
this is almost where it helps to have a trainer. That's right.

1082
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,160
Who you can outsource that decision to, but you had the discipline to do that.

1083
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,560
But after a lot of research, so, you know, a couple of things, you know,

1084
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,480
I want to come back to fat adaptation and, you know, carb loading,

1085
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,880
I learned, so I had some fairly objective indicators that I would use to make

1086
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,800
decisions. Cause a big part of doing this consistently over time is just to be

1087
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,920
objective with yourself. Am I really in course record shape,

1088
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,160
or am I just fooling myself? And so what are the metrics?

1089
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,480
What are your times? Time doesn't lie, right? Time is objective.

1090
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,760
Your heart rate it's objective. It's a great metric to use force power.

1091
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,280
If you're on the bike is the absolute. And if you know you're at altitude,

1092
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,520
there's some other things you can do in Mountaineering to keep yourself in check

1093
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,440
and Mountaineers are the same way. They're very disciplined.

1094
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,320
If I'm not where I need to be by 2PM, I turn around. It's not summit day.

1095
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
So it's not going to work.

1096
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,400
That is impressive. When I talk to those guys that have summited Everest,

1097
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,160
especially those I've talked to a few guys have done it repeatedly.

1098
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,800
That actually impresses the hell out of live the climb another day.

1099
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,000
It's that simple. So I borrowed from Mountaineering.

1100
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,440
I'll get back to the fat thing in a second. Cause there were indicators,

1101
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,160
early indicators in terms of just being in ketosis and what your body does over

1102
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,960
time to optimize endurance.

1103
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,920
So Mountaineering is actually where I learned about fat and I'll get back to

1104
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,880
that in a second. So the carb thing didn't work for me, right?

1105
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,560
And I learned accidentally that you can actually fast and do better.

1106
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,360
And feel better and feel cleaner.

1107
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,920
And so I just started phasing things out, right?

1108
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,080
So I started phasing carbs out, drank very little alcohol and very monastic

1109
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,000
lifestyle for a long time there.

1110
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,680
I had no girlfriend lived in a little condo by the beach and just worked my

1111
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,360
tail off and trained and loved it. It was a very simple life.

1112
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:17,000
No drama outside of just not, maybe not feeling good about my run that day.

1113
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,440
It was a very simple life engineered intentionally to be that way.

1114
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,200
So I did learn that the traditional thinking was wrong.

1115
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,760
And I also learned that the assumptions around what a human body could do were

1116
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,880
wrong. And I learned that through experimentation.

1117
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,480
So back to the Mountaineering thing. So there's a great book called,

1118
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,800
I think it's called fast and lighter moving fast and light.

1119
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,800
There's a Mountaineer named Mark Twit who's a batshit crazy Mountaineer who was

1120
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,280
doing all kinds of stuff in the nineties.

1121
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,560
And I've always been intrigued by doing endurance stuff and in the mountains.

1122
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,760
And there's guys not doing what I knew would eventually happen.

1123
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,080
I came to it late and of course had a family decided risking my life wasn't worth

1124
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:06,080
it anymore. But we knew that metabolizing your body is very different at altitude

1125
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,880
and actually taking a shot of oil at altitude was better than eating a bowl of

1126
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,880
spaghetti. And it's written about and that's where I learned sometimes it's

1127
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,640
better just to take a shot of olive oil and never forget reading about this.

1128
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,760
And I'm like, well, I'm going to experiment with that.

1129
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,400
If they're doing this at altitude and it's working and it's actually helping

1130
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,760
them, right? First of all,

1131
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,760
a little Nalgene vial of olive oil or flaxseed oil to take in your pack if you're

1132
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,840
doing it on summit day to not have to carry a bunch of food.

1133
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,920
Yeah. From an energy density standpoint,

1134
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,080
it's the most energy dense way and your fat adapted and your body has a hard time

1135
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:48,080
metabolizing the fat and anything else at altitude and it's hard to cook stuff at

1136
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,080
altitude, which is another story.

1137
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,480
So I learned that fat, fat's actually not bad.

1138
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,200
And also learned, you know, sugar is not good when you're doing long events because

1139
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,240
you know, insulin response and you bonk and you know, so sugar is great.

1140
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,360
It's like a drug though, right?

1141
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,440
It's chasing the Drake.

1142
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,360
And once you have your Twix at mile 20, you're going to want another one at mile 25.

1143
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,160
You're hosed.

1144
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,160
You have now committed to a pure glycolytic strategy and you better have it timed

1145
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,600
perfectly to the finish line.

1146
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:21,440
And it is part of the strategy and you know, and I would argue in terms of optimizing

1147
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,160
performance should be part of your strategy, but you, you only get one shot at it.

1148
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,080
So if you're doing a hundred, you better, you know, if it comes before a mile 80,

1149
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,320
you better know what you're doing because after that, I'll be, you know, if you're

1150
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,160
going to take a mountain do don't do it a mile 20 because it is at that point, all

1151
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,720
bets are off.

1152
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,840
Your body is now shifted into a completely different world and it's going to want to

1153
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,360
stay in that world and you know that well.

1154
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,960
So I came back from the Himalayas in 02.

1155
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,760
I spent a couple months over there in Tibet on Everest and we were eating yak meat,

1156
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,480
which you can't cook at 25,000 feet.

1157
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,880
And I was like, Oh, I'm going to eat this.

1158
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,200
I'm going to cook at 25,000 feet.

1159
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,040
And so I came back with just crazy parasites, which I later learned in 03.

1160
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,440
And so the other part of this, to answer your question about sort of backing into it is

1161
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,080
the only way I was going to get rid of the parasites was to essentially go nuclear on

1162
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,400
my own body, which meant like a 10 day fast.

1163
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,360
So I did the Eastern Western thing.

1164
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,920
So I went to, you know, infectious diseases guy at, you know, San Diego or UCSD.

1165
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,480
And I said, well, how do we get rid of this stuff?

1166
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,280
How do we, he's like, Hey, I'm going to give you some stuff and it's going to be really

1167
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,280
hard on your body.

1168
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,440
I need you to take it.

1169
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,600
And I said, what have the people been doing for thousands of years?

1170
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,720
Because you know, tapearms and other stuff has been a problem for a long time.

1171
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,520
You starve yourself, just starve it, you starve it eventually, you know, get rid of it.

1172
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,760
So I did both.

1173
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,320
So I said, give me the meds.

1174
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,240
And I did the meds and I didn't eat for 10 days.

1175
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,520
So I just drank warm water every day, didn't really train and did other crazy stuff to

1176
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,520
just completely cleanse myself.

1177
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,160
And by day three, day one and two was brutal.

1178
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:06,920
By day three, I just it's like my whatever, 170 degree vision went to I could see around

1179
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,920
myself, right?

1180
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,920
I could feel stuff.

1181
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,760
I could smell stuff.

1182
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,800
And it just turned into this journey was of course, fix the problem, get rid of it.

1183
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,320
And I was, I was developing exercise induced asthma.

1184
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,920
I became allergic to certain foods.

1185
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,360
And I was allergic to myself.

1186
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,480
I was actually, of course, fighting these parasites, but I didn't know it at the time.

1187
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,800
All that went away in 03 by fasting.

1188
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,480
And I felt better.

1189
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,480
And so I backed in.

1190
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:39,080
So I was obviously in ketosis, because I started training again by day seven, I wasn't eating,

1191
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,120
but I started training again.

1192
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,120
And I felt fantastic.

1193
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,040
And that's when I realized like, holy cow, like it was accidental.

1194
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:51,520
But between the fat and understanding that that's a component of performance, and then

1195
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:57,000
the fasting, which was again, just to get rid of parasites, I realized like, heck, and

1196
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,840
actually perform even better, throwing everything else out the window.

1197
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,320
It is amazing.

1198
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,880
I actually didn't know that story about you.

1199
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,600
I didn't know that you had to do this tend to I didn't even know about the whole parasite

1200
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,600
thing.

1201
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,960
And those things are really interesting, because I, I know a lot of people who have had that

1202
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
experience, right?

1203
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,560
They go off and they climb Kilimanjaro, and they come back and they're never the same.

1204
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,160
You know, one of the people who was actually helping me and that trans Tahoe swim had just

1205
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,120
come back from Kilimanjaro.

1206
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:28,920
And this person's kayaking, one of my kayakers, and I mean, had to literally hop out of the

1207
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,600
kayak and take a shit in the water about every, I don't know, hour.

1208
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,000
I mean, devastated by these parasites.

1209
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
But it's really interesting.

1210
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,040
I mean, I can, it certainly strikes me as relatively low downside to at least give a

1211
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,160
trial attempt of fasting coupled with the medical therapy.

1212
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,920
I mean, certainly there's evidence to suggest that fasting coupled with chemotherapy can

1213
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,320
increase the efficacy of chemotherapy.

1214
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,080
I mean, this has been now actually demonstrated.

1215
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,400
Valtra Longo has talked about this quite a bit, but you know, Dom Degasino has been

1216
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,120
talking about this for at least five years now.

1217
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,320
So I didn't know that about you.

1218
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
I love that.

1219
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,160
I feel like I know everything about you and yet I've already learned like six things about

1220
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,780
you in the last hour that I didn't know.

1221
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:14,960
Let's close out the Ram story just because I, again, I'm, to me, your Ram exploits might

1222
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,280
be your second most impressive story.

1223
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,600
We're going to come to the most impressive feat of them all in a moment.

1224
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,240
But there was a really sad ending to Robic, wasn't there?

1225
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,240
Yeah.

1226
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,480
In fact, there was a sad ending to Robic and Bob Breedlove.

1227
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,720
So Bob Breedlove died in oh five on the Ram.

1228
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,840
I was a few hours ahead of him.

1229
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,360
These aren't, I think at the time I did Everest, it was one in eight people would die.

1230
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,200
So you're not talking about people are asking me about finished rates.

1231
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,160
There's death rates to some of these races.

1232
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,760
So one in eight die on Everest.

1233
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,320
I don't know what the stats are today.

1234
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,320
K2 is even worse.

1235
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,400
K2 is like one in three or something crazy.

1236
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,920
There's a few that are just, and that's, you know, it's why with young family, I'm not,

1237
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,400
you helped me a few weeks ago, pull a tree down and I had my climbing gear out for the

1238
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,200
first time in 15 years, rapping slings around a tree.

1239
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,760
I walk over and I see you with a chainsaw and a fricking 80 foot tree.

1240
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,280
And I'm like, Hey, Mike, you need a hand?

1241
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,960
It's the first time I climbing gear has been out in a while.

1242
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,960
So yeah.

1243
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,920
I think unfortunately I had a fantastic performance a number of years after we raised against

1244
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,400
each other and he died on a bike in Sylvania.

1245
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,560
Gosh, it's been, it's been a few years.

1246
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,760
He was riding down a hill or something.

1247
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,320
He was riding down a, as I understand it, riding down a gravel road, a fire road or

1248
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:41,360
something in Sylvania and crossed the center line and ran into a car coming up and went

1249
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,360
over the top.

1250
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,360
I mean, I've, I've been there.

1251
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,360
I mean, I've crashed several times and I just, there are so many people I know that

1252
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:54,880
have died on bikes, which is why I just don't ride as much anymore.

1253
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Eventually.

1254
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,520
It's just law of large numbers, right?

1255
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,520
You're out there enough.

1256
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,520
Something's going to happen.

1257
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,520
Yeah.

1258
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,720
I had that wake up call in, um, maybe 2010.

1259
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,240
There's a guy named Nick Venuto.

1260
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,480
I don't know if you knew Nick, but he was the CFO at our company.

1261
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,320
This was back when I was working at a biotech company and a amazing cyclist.

1262
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,080
He actually won the Mount Palomar time trial a couple of times.

1263
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,040
So for people who are around here and understand what Mount Palomar is, it's basically Alpe

1264
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,280
d'Huez in terms of rise grade and even including the same number of switchbacks.

1265
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,840
So it's a serious climb and every year there's a time trial and Venuto would win it.

1266
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,480
And I remember on one afternoon I was leaving, this was back when I was, could call myself

1267
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,880
a cyclist and I was like buggering out earlier.

1268
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,560
It was like five o'clock cause I wanted to go home and I had intervals to do that day.

1269
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,920
And on that day I remember I had the luxury of calling an audible, which was I could either

1270
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,640
do repeats on Torrey Pines, which would be Hill repeats, or I could go out to 56 on the

1271
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,800
bike path and do VO two max repeats.

1272
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,200
Cause it's not as steep.

1273
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,240
You know, you're only climbing like sort of 4% as you ride from Carmel Valley out the

1274
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,640
Poway.

1275
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,160
And I just decided, you know, I'm going to go ride Torrey Pines today.

1276
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,160
So I did.

1277
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,960
And I remember walking out my door cause Nick and I opposed each other and I said, and he

1278
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,000
was like, he, you know, I know everybody says this about everybody, but he literally

1279
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,400
was the nicest dude on the planet.

1280
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,280
And I remember saying, all right, Nick, see you later, man.

1281
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,000
And Nick used to ride to and from work every day.

1282
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,960
He was such a devoted family guy that he just didn't want to waste time training outside

1283
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,960
of his commute.

1284
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,240
And he lived far away.

1285
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,120
So you know, he'd get in like 40 miles a day training just on his commute.

1286
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,680
He's riding home on the 56 bike path, the same road I was going to do.

1287
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,760
I could have been doing my intervals on.

1288
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,280
And if I showed you where it happened, it's the last place you think this could ever happen.

1289
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,200
But a woman driving, her SUV decides at that moment, she's just got to check her cell phone

1290
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,560
and she drives up the embankment through the fence and hits Nick and kills him.

1291
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,560
And I couldn't believe it.

1292
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,480
I mean, I just, you know, to think like I was just with this guy two hours before.

1293
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,200
And unfortunately that's just not an uncommon story.

1294
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,520
Like, you know, obviously since then have known of other cyclists that have died, but

1295
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,960
I didn't know any as well as him.

1296
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,480
And yet, you know, given what you've done, you really know a lot of people who have met

1297
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,360
this horrible fate on a bicycle.

1298
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:16,520
And a lot of times actually the cyclist is 100% not at fault.

1299
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,160
You know, in the case of Nick's case, I mean, he's on a bike path, nothing he could have

1300
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,160
done to prevent that.

1301
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,160
That is a lightning strike.

1302
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:28,200
You know, to be hit from behind when someone veers off a freeway going 75 miles an hour

1303
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,200
and hits you.

1304
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,200
I mean, like you're done.

1305
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,200
You're done.

1306
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,560
And on a bike path, that's protected.

1307
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,640
You think that, you know, the worst you can do is make a mistake and go down or someone

1308
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,680
else on the bike will hit you, which is probably not lethal.

1309
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,480
You know, my brother, who's a really good mountain biker, the reason he's just so obsessed

1310
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,680
with being on a mountain bike, he goes, look, here's the difference.

1311
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,320
When I used to ride on the road, if something bad was going to happen statistically, it was

1312
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,320
the driver's fault.

1313
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,760
On a mountain bike, when something bad happens, it is always my fault.

1314
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
That's right.

1315
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,760
That's right.

1316
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,640
And it's a broken collarbone or, you know, broken arm.

1317
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,160
It's not, it's usually not lethal.

1318
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,280
It's part of the reason why I don't ride as much as I did.

1319
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,280
And I was hit actually similar driver.

1320
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,240
I thought she saw me.

1321
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,240
She looked right at me.

1322
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:16,680
I don't know if it's sunlight, sun was setting, but I was also bike commuting, leaving work,

1323
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,240
and she accelerated right through me.

1324
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,240
She had a stop sign.

1325
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,600
She just rolled through it.

1326
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,080
I was doing about 35, just rolling down a hill and I was slow motion.

1327
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,320
And you know, I've had other accidents, but that was probably the most mentally.

1328
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,040
I mean, that's when I bought my CompuTrainer.

1329
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,720
Actually, my wife got it for me because she just, I just wouldn't get on the bike because

1330
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,680
I really thought she saw me and I couldn't hit my head and I couldn't move the right

1331
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,680
side of my body.

1332
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:46,640
And I apparently was making this crazy noise sound, just moaning on the pavement.

1333
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,920
This was in oh, I think it was oh six, oh seven.

1334
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,800
And that's was when I, I mean, it took me, she was absolutely sweetheart about it.

1335
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,800
I mean, she was just devastated.

1336
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,920
I mean, I went over the hood and the back of her car and the bike went one way and I

1337
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,560
went the other and we were both, by then doing 40 and just, you know, hit the pavement and

1338
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,560
rolled.

1339
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:12,360
And fortunately, my wife was a mile away and call her and come get me.

1340
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,440
And I tried to walk it off.

1341
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,720
I was going to try to ride home and I just literally was, it shook me up.

1342
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,720
It shook me up.

1343
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,600
And after that, I just said, you know, it's, and after, you know, many deaths, friends

1344
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,320
and guys like Robic and others just said, you know, it's going to happen.

1345
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,920
Eventually, it's going to happen.

1346
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,920
Yeah.

1347
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,880
By the way, going back to the CompuTrainer, you're probably one of the only people that's

1348
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,880
broken a CompuTrainer.

1349
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Twice.

1350
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
Twice.

1351
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,640
Yeah, the CompuTrainer at this point is a resistance trainer and I've stopped replacing

1352
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:48,240
them and I just get on at this old Slocum stand, which I've had powder coated a couple

1353
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,640
times from the sweat and the rust.

1354
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,640
And I used the actual.

1355
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,720
First time I saw your CompuTrainer, I was like, dude, what have you done to this thing?

1356
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:00,280
Well, I have my contraption I've engineered for the PVC.

1357
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:04,480
You know, at the time it was a blackberry and computer stand and other stuff.

1358
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,040
It's now an iPad holder.

1359
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:11,840
And so my contraption strapped to the front of it bracketed to the front of it for my screens.

1360
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,000
So of all the incredible things you've done and as I, you know, as we become closer over

1361
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,680
the past five years, I've gotten to know all of these things.

1362
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,800
But you're so unassuming that I have to like pry them out of you.

1363
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,520
But I don't know what it is about Trans Iowa.

1364
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,920
But when you finally told me about that, I was blown away.

1365
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:35,560
I think Trans Iowa might be the most ridiculous feat in the history of cycling, certainly

1366
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,260
as far as a one day event goes.

1367
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:39,880
So explain the motivation for that.

1368
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,840
What the hell you did, how fast you went.

1369
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,480
Like, well, talk to me about Trans Iowa.

1370
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:49,640
Well, you know, growing up in Iowa and having done the bike ride across Iowa, Ragbri, the

1371
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,040
registered annual great bike ride across Iowa many years.

1372
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:58,440
I always asked myself, how fast could you do this in one go?

1373
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,840
Even when I was a kid, like, why are they stopping?

1374
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,560
You know, I get people drink at night and party and it's a fun time.

1375
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,720
But why isn't anybody doing this in one push?

1376
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,140
It's possible.

1377
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,560
And so it's been on bucket list thing, right?

1378
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:16,160
A lot like hearing about Bob Breedlove in the 80s about Ram that was became a bucket

1379
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,160
list thing.

1380
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,440
Ram became a bucket list.

1381
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,960
Trans Iowa became a bucket list.

1382
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,580
And so no, did Ram in 04 and lots of other stuff and decided that I could work at my

1383
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:30,240
own sort of attempt at trying to set a speed record across Iowa.

1384
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,940
It's where I'm from.

1385
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,200
And it was a bucket list.

1386
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:38,120
And so I got, actually my Ram crew chief was the official because they're, you know, to

1387
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,160
be a true record, the UMC has, you have to have an official and he was a UMC official

1388
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,400
and my uncle, best friend from high school.

1389
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,000
And you know, some, a couple other people crew me for it.

1390
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,280
And it's a, you know, depending on your route, you can pick your route and you know, there's

1391
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,280
UMC recognizes record attempts.

1392
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,560
Looking at it, just a few simple criteria.

1393
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,760
So I picked my route, set my date and pick my official.

1394
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,680
And the distance was what?

1395
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,680
270.

1396
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,840
So the 270 mile.

1397
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,320
270 and change, actually more climbing than you'd think.

1398
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,280
Most people think Iowa is flat, but it's not.

1399
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,280
How many feet vertical?

1400
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,000
I'd have to go back and look at the stats, but several thousand feet of vertical.

1401
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,040
So you start at one river and end at the other, right?

1402
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,560
One east to west and, uh, was able to do, I didn't have to unclip.

1403
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,760
It was pretty cool.

1404
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,280
I, I, there was halfway through some guys from construction on the road and the guy

1405
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,800
had a stop sign, you know, one line open at a stop up and I waved to him.

1406
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,080
I just let me through, forget the car behind me.

1407
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,760
This was my, my crew vehicle.

1408
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,880
Um, but let me through and he flipped it around and you know, so I didn't have to unclip for

1409
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,840
the entire state and managed to do in about 10 hours and 40 ish minutes.

1410
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:54,560
I can give you all the stats if you want, but I did about 25.7 miles an hour average,

1411
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,320
a little tailwind to start across wind.

1412
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,480
It was beautiful day conditions were perfect.

1413
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:03,360
You know, in fact, there were storm chasers out the night before there were tornadoes

1414
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,360
all over the place.

1415
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,720
It was a may.

1416
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,360
And so this was the lead up to Ram Oh five.

1417
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,040
So this was an Oh five.

1418
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,280
So it was, it was a great day.

1419
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,440
I start with a bit of a tailwind and you got a crosswind in the middle and then you

1420
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,320
ended with about a tailwind with a headwind.

1421
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,280
Ended with a headwind and I felt fantastic.

1422
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:27,800
In fact, I thought about continuing on and well, let's go do the next state.

1423
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,760
But you know, it was, it was, it was a fun day.

1424
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,480
I'll never forget looking down at my polar heart rate monitor at the time and I just

1425
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:39,280
couldn't believe the numbers because I, you know, I've done coastal stuff training here,

1426
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,280
right?

1427
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:45,800
Like Newport or whatever and do one days or one push rides with two water bottles.

1428
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
Don't stop.

1429
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,760
Don't unclip if you, unless you have to.

1430
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:54,400
But I looked down and I just covered my home state in 10 and a half hours and it was fun.

1431
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,400
Yeah.

1432
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,480
I mean, you didn't have a power meter at the time, but I remember when I was time trialing,

1433
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:04,760
I used to have so many models that I could basically estimate power by CDA, wind speed,

1434
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,800
velocity, et cetera.

1435
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:13,520
And I remember calculating you were probably doing about 310 Watts to 320 Watts for 10

1436
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,720
hours and 40 minutes.

1437
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,000
That would have been your average power.

1438
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,520
Obviously you would have ebbed and flowed.

1439
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,640
And I remember thinking, wow, we're in a different league here.

1440
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:27,240
People like, you know, like, you know, you're really a professional cyclist at that point.

1441
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,600
You're not really amongst the amateurs anymore.

1442
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,960
Well, the metric in professional cycling is Watts per kilo.

1443
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,960
Right.

1444
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,040
So, and you weighed what at that point?

1445
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,880
Ah, 160.

1446
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,640
So that's what, 72 kilos.

1447
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,640
Yeah.

1448
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,600
I mean, so you have to figure that if you were averaging 310 to 320 Watts for 10 and

1449
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:52,240
a half hours, your FTP was probably very close to 380 ish, maybe 400 Watts.

1450
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:58,160
I mean, that's a professional level, at least a non-EPO professional level FTP.

1451
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,520
EPO certainly probably gives you about a 10 to 15% boost on that.

1452
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:06,920
But, you know, like the best guys in the tour during the sort of more EPO driven

1453
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,760
eras were putting out, I used to know this stuff so well.

1454
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,880
I think they were putting out about 6.3 to 6.4 Watts per kilo.

1455
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:19,080
Anything over five is five sort of the, well, five for, I mean, if you can do five

1456
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,840
with us, if you can do five without drugs, that's incredible.

1457
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,920
And I, and I, that's kind of where I try unintentionally because I, you know, I had

1458
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,800
no, for me, it was, this has always been sort of a sacred endeavor, right?

1459
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,760
I knew how to make money.

1460
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,400
I didn't, you know, to the extent that I needed to for Ram, I had sponsors, but for

1461
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,520
me, I love the product side of getting into clothing and other gear production and

1462
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,080
design, but for me, it's never been about monetizing it, right?

1463
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,520
So I, you know, been invited to join professional cycling teams and train with

1464
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,440
them and teams come out here or Arizona.

1465
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,000
And it's never interested me.

1466
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,200
It just was never something that I wanted to do.

1467
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,680
That wasn't part of the deal for me.

1468
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,440
It's always how good could I be?

1469
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,480
And I knew the drug side of it as well.

1470
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,280
And that's something that had no interest in.

1471
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,400
Was there a lot of drug use in Ram and in these sort of?

1472
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,600
We were drug tested throughout.

1473
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,520
I don't know.

1474
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,320
I don't know if anyone else was.

1475
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:18,440
It's one of those things where I think that so it's such an epic event.

1476
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:23,120
I don't know what you would do because there's so many components

1477
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,640
to an optimal performance, right?

1478
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,840
So I don't know what drug you would do.

1479
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,600
I mean, stimulants would eventually blow you up.

1480
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,000
Yeah.

1481
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,640
I mean, modafinil, I mean, I think modafinil is banned on Wada and

1482
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,240
Usada, but modafinil would certainly help.

1483
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,040
What is that?

1484
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,840
It's a drug that's approved.

1485
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,400
It's only FDA indication is for narcolepsy, but it's a non stimulant

1486
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,440
that keeps you awake.

1487
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,840
It's actually a pretty interesting drug.

1488
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,160
This was our drug of choice in residency.

1489
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,840
We abused the shit out of this drug.

1490
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,640
I was during residency taking two to 600 milligrams daily.

1491
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,960
The maximum it was ever been tested at is 600 milligrams, but

1492
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,040
in the air force, they had done a study, which is the study that I clung to,

1493
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,320
which was they put a bunch of pilots into a simulator flight simulator.

1494
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,280
And so the placebo group has nothing and predictably over the course of 24

1495
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,840
hours, their performance declined.

1496
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,280
So, you know, but not surprisingly.

1497
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,640
And then you had like a caffeine group and their performance got a little bit

1498
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,840
better initially, but then sort of petered out, if not outright crashed by 24 hours.

1499
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,040
And of course I could be completely mistaking some of the details on this,

1500
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,120
but this was the gist of it.

1501
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,920
At 200 milligrams of Medafinil, which is the standard dose performance was

1502
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,040
maintained for a very long period of time, but at the end of the 24 hours, it fell

1503
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,480
off, but the thing that I always clung to was at 600 milligrams.

1504
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,880
I think performance actually just got better monotonically over 24 hours.

1505
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:50,640
And so I found this to be the most amazing drug in the world because basically

1506
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,480
in residency, you're sort of sleeping about four hours a night on average, but

1507
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,600
it never works out to that.

1508
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,520
So it's like, you'll have zero and then you'll have six, and then you'll have

1509
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,520
seven, and then you'll have zero and then you'll have three and then, you know what

1510
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:03,800
I mean?

1511
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,240
And so being able to take Medafinil was huge and you know, Medafinil has a number

1512
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,160
of interesting properties.

1513
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,960
I don't really use it more than a few times a year these days.

1514
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:16,040
I only really used around jet lag, significant jet lag, but it strikes me as

1515
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,800
being a pretty impressive drug.

1516
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,480
Again, not withstanding the fact that I'm pretty sure it's Wada and you saw it.

1517
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:26,960
It probably is, but that goes back to the point that I had no desire to be

1518
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,640
professional because I didn't mean for me, it was very simple, which is natural

1519
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,240
performance.

1520
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:38,120
And if you're augmenting with things like that, it's just, you're not answering your

1521
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,720
question, right?

1522
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,000
You throw into these other variables that are called unnatural and where do you stop?

1523
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:48,760
IVs have always been sort of a disputed territory for ultra athletes.

1524
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,120
I've never, if you go into Vinnius, you're done in my opinion, right?

1525
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,360
You should not need an RV.

1526
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,640
That's not natural to me.

1527
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,840
Even if it's just sailing, doesn't matter.

1528
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,400
A lot of people disagree with me and that's just my personal opinion.

1529
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:05,160
There are a lot of guys that design their whole plan around being able to go into

1530
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,760
Vinnius and get, you know, all change.

1531
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,240
And, and I haven't.

1532
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,280
I mean, that's just me.

1533
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,680
It's just my own standard.

1534
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,800
There are very few things I think drug wise that would you.

1535
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,440
Yeah. Ram is a tough one.

1536
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,120
Ram's a tough one.

1537
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,960
Because it's not clear to me that EPO would help you that much in Ram.

1538
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,040
It's not even clear to me that anabolic steroids would help as much as they do in

1539
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:25,720
the tour.

1540
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:31,440
I mean, I think EPO is a much more important factor in grand tours than even

1541
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,200
the anabolic steroids or the glucocorticoids or corticosteroids.

1542
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:35,400
Yeah.

1543
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,360
And the stimulants, I mean, that used to be the drug of choice up until the,

1544
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,320
about the eighties in professional cycling.

1545
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,760
But as you pointed out, I mean, stimulants, you better know when you're using them

1546
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,480
and for how long because it's, you can fall off a cliff pretty quick.

1547
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:47,720
Yeah.

1548
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,960
And I've seen guys do that.

1549
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,080
I've seen guys do that.

1550
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:55,280
And I've been part of a few studies that have tested down it, which not

1551
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:59,760
Liberty station and I think it was the NTC down in Point Loma, the Naval

1552
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,840
hospital, I participated in a few studies with Navy SEALs and they were testing

1553
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,040
different things and the SEALs and special forces there on a whole cocktail,

1554
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,080
right, depending on what they're doing.

1555
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,200
They're in transit.

1556
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,160
They're taking one thing.

1557
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,800
If they're getting ready, they take something else and they should.

1558
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,280
And my Daphanil is a great drug in that setting because when you consider that

1559
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:26,360
the alternative is stimulants with their horrible cycle, you know,

1560
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,880
well, not to mention the psychological stimulants, throw you, right?

1561
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,120
Throw your judgment and do other things.

1562
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,880
So I agree.

1563
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:35,840
I agree.

1564
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,040
You know, I've never tried Adderall even once.

1565
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:38,440
All of them.

1566
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,040
The time I've taken the Daphanil, I've never once tried Adderall.

1567
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:45,760
And yet the talks with a lot of people who swear by low dose Adderall for, you

1568
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,840
know, mental clarity, like 10 milligrams or something like that.

1569
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,360
But I don't know.

1570
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,240
I just, I don't feel like stimulants would sit well with my system.

1571
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,880
Yeah.

1572
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,640
I didn't even know what Adderall was.

1573
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,480
And some of the guys that software programmers on my team were trading

1574
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:04,560
Adderall a few years ago, like, what are you guys doing?

1575
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,280
And we're going to go outside and we'll be back and, you know, total hours

1576
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,440
later, they're still heads down.

1577
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,400
It clearly, I've seen it clearly.

1578
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,720
I mean, it's certain tasks.

1579
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,720
It's works.

1580
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,040
Yeah.

1581
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,480
I've seen, I think that this low dose Adderall strategy for the right person

1582
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,760
can be remarkable.

1583
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,680
Again, the question becomes frequency at what point does it become too much?

1584
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,920
You know, today when we were on the bike, we were kind of talking

1585
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,720
about this a little bit, but I remember when I was swimming a lot, it's a very

1586
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,920
tight knit community, you know, the weirdos who want to do really long

1587
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,040
swims or really long rides or really long runs or whatever, but it became

1588
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,680
clear to me a few years into my swimming endeavors that most of the people

1589
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,920
I swam with were addicts were recovering addicts.

1590
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,080
So they had, they were former alcoholics.

1591
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,360
Um, they, you know, you know, recovering drug addicts or things like that.

1592
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,400
And I remember thinking, God, this is so interesting.

1593
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:58,280
Like I'm the only non addict who does this amongst my peer group, but I've come

1594
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,960
back and revisited that assumption and now realize that of course I am an addict.

1595
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,560
And just because it's not alcohol or drugs, doesn't mean I'm not.

1596
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,760
And so it makes me wonder like, what kind of person does this stuff?

1597
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,080
What motivates them?

1598
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,360
What are they numbing?

1599
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,160
Where is this coming from?

1600
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,520
And have you, and it's a philosophical question, but have you ever sort of

1601
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,480
stopped and said, what the hell drove you to do all of this stuff?

1602
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,480
Cause at the risk of just being a little blunt, like it ain't normal, man.

1603
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,320
Like it ain't normal to do any of the shit we just spent the last hour talking about.

1604
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,400
It's normal to me.

1605
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,680
It's my normal.

1606
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,040
No, it's not.

1607
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:32,880
It's not.

1608
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,720
And I learned this on Ram and I've never, I haven't experienced it since, but there's

1609
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:45,320
a sequence of mental states that I think you go through in these things and call

1610
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,760
it normal homeostasis.

1611
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:52,080
And then you move to with sleep, DAP and extreme output, you move to illusions,

1612
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,880
hallucinations, people talk about that and laugh about it.

1613
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,880
They're funny, but you're still with it.

1614
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,400
And then you get truly delusional.

1615
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,840
This is when you're mentally insane.

1616
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:09,760
There's a time on Ram toward the later part of 04 where I literally didn't know why this

1617
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,280
van was following me.

1618
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:19,200
And I somehow concocted this whole story about being chased and somehow crafted that we

1619
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,600
were going by a power plant.

1620
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:27,480
And I thought they were spies and I was truly delusional and I was paranoid and I would try

1621
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:31,000
to get away from them and I kept racing away from them and they're still following me and

1622
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,240
they're turning where I'm turning.

1623
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,600
I'm like, what the hell is going on?

1624
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,360
And finally I decided to get off the highway.

1625
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,920
Well, I get off the highway and I'm in a cemetery in the middle of nowhere and I put my

1626
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,240
bike.

1627
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,440
It's all I had to protect myself in between me and my crew.

1628
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:48,960
And they followed me and this van is here and they get out and I'm like, what are you

1629
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:49,440
doing?

1630
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,360
And they're like, so you didn't recognize them even once they got out of the van.

1631
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,000
I didn't recognize them.

1632
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,920
I was confused.

1633
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:01,080
This is after six, seven days and maybe an hour and a half, two hours of sleep.

1634
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:05,320
I slept up of my 10 ish hours the whole race.

1635
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:10,040
One of the three hour block is very end where I just shut down.

1636
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,520
So I had very little sleep over six or seven days.

1637
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,120
I was just, I was losing it.

1638
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,800
So it's not normal, right?

1639
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,240
And eventually came back and the next day in daylight, like a holy cow.

1640
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,200
And I remember everything.

1641
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,360
I remember the whole episode and they're like, we picked a frickin cemetery of all places to

1642
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,400
like peel off the road.

1643
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,440
It was a cemetery and it was, they were scared.

1644
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,800
Like, who is this guy?

1645
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,000
What is he doing?

1646
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,080
And then, you know, finally we got to New Jersey and 60 miles from the finish and I

1647
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:41,040
had completely lost it and threatened a dear friend of mine, Howard, who's massive

1648
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,280
college swimmer, former college swimmer.

1649
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,160
And I decided I was going to get in a fight with him and he just, he stuck his hand out

1650
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:52,480
and I thought I was going to get into a fist fight with Howard and I was 160 and he was

1651
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,640
220 and twice my size.

1652
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:55,840
Now you lose it.

1653
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,280
Yeah.

1654
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,440
What's the, but more deep seated.

1655
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,720
And I think that's your question, right?

1656
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,720
What motivates this?

1657
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,360
I started the marathon.

1658
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:09,280
I was living in New York city, actually living in Stanford, Connecticut in 97, 98.

1659
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,280
And I moved back from Europe and came to New York, was working for Pricewaterhouse and

1660
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,960
was living with guys I went to school with, you know, their Goldman Sachs and

1661
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,920
et cetera, et cetera.

1662
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,240
And they were bringing home a case of beer every night and I was sleeping on a couch

1663
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,440
because I was tired in New York city.

1664
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,280
I just wanted to get out of New York.

1665
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,400
And so I crashed on their couch in Stanford.

1666
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,440
I was always on the road.

1667
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:35,400
And after a week of those guys bringing beer home every night, I'm like, this

1668
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,640
isn't what I want to do.

1669
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,280
So I needed an excuse.

1670
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:43,200
So believe it or not for me, and by the way, when you're on the couch, you can't get

1671
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:43,600
away.

1672
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:48,520
So these guys would sit and watch TV and drink beer and five guys sitting around,

1673
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,360
you know, living like they were in college, taking the train into New York, you know,

1674
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,440
every morning at five thirty and just doing the drill.

1675
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,200
So it was actually an escape for me.

1676
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:02,040
So I started training for the 98 New York Marathon in the spring of 98.

1677
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,720
And that was my excuse.

1678
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,680
Sorry, I can't drink.

1679
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,480
I'm got to get up and run in the morning.

1680
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,040
And that's what I did.

1681
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,120
So that's how it all that's how it all started.

1682
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:14,320
They right around the same time was going through a brutal breakup with my college

1683
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,320
sweetheart. And I think that was the second component of it.

1684
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:24,200
Right. I had no desire to socialize and just wanted to get back to some foundation that

1685
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,320
I could find for myself.

1686
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,520
So a lot of transition.

1687
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,480
So I'd say, you know, running away from stuff is where it started.

1688
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:35,600
And then, of course, it evolved to, you know, once I did my move to Chicago, did the

1689
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:41,520
Chicago Marathon, then did New York, which was my goal, did New York as Batman in 98.

1690
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,360
It blast, frickin blast.

1691
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,000
You know, run it.

1692
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,600
Just didn't know.

1693
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,440
Didn't worry about time.

1694
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,360
Just had a good time.

1695
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,320
But then realize that, you know, I could actually pull off some decent times.

1696
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,160
It's not that hard.

1697
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,280
I've hardly trained for this.

1698
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,160
And I did well by my standards.

1699
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:59,280
And so that's when I moved to San Diego in 99.

1700
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:03,880
As I said, you know, I'm going to get serious about this and really focus on it.

1701
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,480
Obviously, what what do you think about?

1702
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,800
Big question I get.

1703
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,880
What do you think about when you're out there for so long and I've you get bored and I've

1704
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:12,880
never gotten bored.

1705
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,560
And for me, you know, you and I have, I think, similar backgrounds, right?

1706
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,360
We working class families who care deeply for us.

1707
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,480
But we've also had a lot of stuff happen to us over time, right?

1708
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:29,480
And for me, it's always been a time to work through stuff and just think about things

1709
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,720
both past and present.

1710
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,680
And so it's been very meditative for me.

1711
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:40,000
And unfortunately, and I've learned over time to somewhat mitigate this, but it's where I

1712
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,200
found my happy place.

1713
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:41,920
Right.

1714
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:42,840
I'll never forget.

1715
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:48,160
I saw this a couple of years ago in my application for bad water in 2000 for the 2001

1716
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:48,800
bad water.

1717
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,000
Why do you want to do bad water?

1718
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,920
And I said, I love ultra running.

1719
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,360
And you know, the follow up question is, is why?

1720
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:59,480
And you know, it's the only time I feel normal and I like to feel normal.

1721
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,160
I feel normal when I'm out there doing that stuff.

1722
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,720
It's just it feels right, right or wrong.

1723
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,080
That was my comfortable spot.

1724
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:14,120
Now, at least going back to that time, what felt abnormal when you weren't running?

1725
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:21,080
Probably the biggest thing that felt unnatural, maybe not abnormal, is I just I've never

1726
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,320
been terribly social.

1727
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:27,280
I never when I moved to San Diego, I you know, I I like to build stuff.

1728
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,200
I like to challenge myself.

1729
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,960
And I just didn't fit in in New York.

1730
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,720
I didn't fit in out here.

1731
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,880
And I liked just pushing myself.

1732
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,200
And that was abnormal.

1733
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,240
That was unusual.

1734
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:45,680
And I would have people ask me all the time about this sacrifice that I was making to

1735
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,720
do what I do.

1736
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:50,720
And my response has been it's a privilege to do what I do.

1737
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,240
I love doing what I do.

1738
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,720
It's fantastic.

1739
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,280
It's not a sacrifice.

1740
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,280
If it was a sacrifice, I wouldn't be doing it.

1741
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,240
So that's, in my mind, abnormal.

1742
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,560
And this is an I don't judge people, right?

1743
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,640
I mean, I don't judge people for not doing this, but it's just I don't choose a path of

1744
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:11,400
accepting that I have certain limitations and certain things are impossible.

1745
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,480
I think that's bullshit.

1746
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:18,280
I just refuse to accept that certain things are not possible because most of the time

1747
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,000
it they're wrong.

1748
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:19,880
It's amazing.

1749
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,720
I mean, you know, people listening to this who obviously don't know you won't

1750
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,240
necessarily appreciate some of the nuance in this.

1751
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:30,600
But and obviously I won't mention names, but one of my favorite stories is there's a

1752
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,640
piece that came out about you in Vogue, Men's Vogue.

1753
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,000
I don't know.

1754
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
God, it's got to be 12, 13 years ago.

1755
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,720
And it's an amazing piece.

1756
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,880
We'll make sure we link to it in the show notes here.

1757
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,240
And it's amazing.

1758
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,200
Like it's a really great piece that gets into it.

1759
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:47,840
And one of my favorite stories is how on the day of the Oscars that year, you get a call

1760
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:54,160
from someone basically saying, hey, so-and-so wants to invite you up to be her guest at the

1761
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:54,880
Oscars tonight.

1762
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:00,280
And it turned out to be like one of the biggest A-list actresses of our generation.

1763
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,880
And you just decided, nah, I don't want to go.

1764
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:10,160
And I'm thinking, you remember when you told me this story, I was like, oh my God, I would

1765
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:17,080
have freaking walked to L.A. backwards or on my hands and knees just to have had a chance

1766
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,240
to have met her, let alone have been on her arm all night.

1767
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,000
But you just don't care.

1768
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,040
I love it.

1769
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:23,920
Yeah, I don't care.

1770
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,240
I wish I could say I didn't care.

1771
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,760
Believe it or not, I out of everything that I considered in that.

1772
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:34,920
And I think I mentioned this to you when I first I just told you this story recently,

1773
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,760
although it was written about years ago, someone that knew my mom knew how to get to me.

1774
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,640
That's how the introduction came.

1775
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,520
And talking through it, I just don't want to go to L.A.

1776
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,960
I do not want to go to L.A.

1777
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,640
I don't want to do the drive to L.A.

1778
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:51,040
That is I don't if it were here.

1779
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:51,360
Sure.

1780
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,320
I no big deal.

1781
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,920
I'm not doing anything today, but it might be fun.

1782
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,600
But I don't want to deal with that.

1783
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:07,080
But I think a big part of the mindset, my mindset at the time was I was really good at saying no.

1784
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,200
I'm not so good at that now.

1785
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:14,000
I say yes to a lot of things and at a detriment to time with my family or kids.

1786
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,280
But at the time, I was very disciplined about saying no.

1787
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,920
If it wasn't on the critical path, I wouldn't do it.

1788
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,160
And I was very focused and I was just great at saying no.

1789
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:29,440
In fact, there was a time there for months where I just told my family I'm busy.

1790
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,400
I don't want to talk to you.

1791
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,600
I don't want to communicate with you.

1792
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:40,120
I'm going to be laser focused and I want to eliminate every potential distraction I can.

1793
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,680
And at the time that for me would fell into that category.

1794
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,040
It was just a distraction.

1795
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:51,960
When do you think you made that transition to, you know, today your priorities are clearly split between mostly two things.

1796
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,920
Your family first, your company second.

1797
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:59,600
You obviously still exercise much more than the average individual could ever fathom.

1798
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,320
But you know, you're not trying to set world records anymore.

1799
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,040
What led to that transition?

1800
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,960
Was it simply meeting your wife?

1801
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:06,920
It was my wife.

1802
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:07,920
Yeah.

1803
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,720
I mean, there's a funny story here.

1804
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:17,320
I met or didn't meet but saw my wife two years before I formally met her.

1805
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,560
And I thought she was an angel.

1806
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:19,920
Right.

1807
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,240
I saw her and like, Oh my gosh, this is the woman of my dreams.

1808
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,400
But I was trending for Ram.

1809
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,600
That was the end of that.

1810
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,560
Didn't even talk to her.

1811
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,200
May have walked by her office once or twice.

1812
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,160
And that was the end.

1813
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,320
She was also an engineer.

1814
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,160
Yeah.

1815
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,680
She was a, she's electrical engineer and at the time was at Qualcomm.

1816
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:43,320
And so, Sarr love at first I didn't talk to her and I'm relatively shy.

1817
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:46,520
I'm not a big fan of hitting on that.

1818
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,480
It wasn't my deal.

1819
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:53,400
So a couple of years went by and we were both in the spin room a couple of years

1820
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,440
after that I had a cast.

1821
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:03,480
I had shattered my elbow training in 06 training for Ram and had reconstructive

1822
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:06,200
surgery and had a cast that had drilled holes in.

1823
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,480
So it was from my arm head all the way down to my wrist and I was drilling holes

1824
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,520
in it so I could shower with this cast.

1825
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,120
And I had pins and wire and crap in my left elbow.

1826
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,200
And she came in and I had a pool of sweat.

1827
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,400
I had gone in.

1828
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,560
I was doing 12 hour.

1829
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,720
I couldn't ride outside with my cast.

1830
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,720
It was too dangerous.

1831
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:30,320
But I was doing 12 hour sessions on a spin bike in the Qualcomm training room.

1832
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:35,880
And I had gallons of water there, towels, of course, and carrots and celery.

1833
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,560
That was my nutrition for the fiber.

1834
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,200
And so, and a stack of DVDs.

1835
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,720
I was there at three.

1836
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,440
She rolls in at six or seven.

1837
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:48,080
And at that point, I think I had taken my shirt off and was just hammering.

1838
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:48,280
Right.

1839
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,640
I was not expecting anyone to come in on a Saturday.

1840
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,680
And so I throw my shirt back on and she gets on a spin bike and it was a, it's a

1841
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,720
fun story, but I won't tell it now, but I, she was, it was her, right?

1842
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:04,800
So I met her and we eventually went on a date and she and her dad, the Furnace

1843
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,160
Creek 508 were my crew on the Furnace Creek 508 later that year.

1844
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,240
She got me.

1845
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:14,080
I mean, I, I went, we went to Hawaii shortly after we met and I ran

1846
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:18,000
up polyacala, so I ran from paella at the beach up to the top of

1847
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,080
polyacala on the last day of our stay.

1848
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,560
And this is six weeks after we met and like, she gets me, she crude me in the

1849
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:29,560
middle of the night, running whatever, 40 miles up to top of, you know, this

1850
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:35,400
volcano, I, all right, she's the one we decided to get married after our third day.

1851
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,120
So she changed.

1852
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,320
I mean, it was, I'm done.

1853
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,960
I, you know, I had answered the questions, most of the big questions.

1854
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,920
I still had some bucket list things, but you know, where do you draw the line?

1855
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:45,320
Right?

1856
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:48,440
So I, it really comes down to the tree.

1857
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,680
I found myself asking the question, what am I doing?

1858
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,000
So I'd be out in East County doing my 300 miles training for a, I did the

1859
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,800
UMC a 24 hour race that fall and in training for that, for the first time,

1860
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,880
I had never asked myself that question.

1861
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,400
What am I doing out here?

1862
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,480
It's kind of like Forrest Gump when he's running back and forth across the country

1863
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,960
and he sort of stops and realizes he's done.

1864
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:12,240
Yeah.

1865
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,320
Like that's, it was that.

1866
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:19,480
And I, that was my last ride in East County that, you know, 10, 12 years ago,

1867
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,640
like I asked myself that question and I knew I was done because I wanted to be

1868
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,920
with her and so it was that simple.

1869
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,280
So I want to let you get back to your day.

1870
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,800
I know you got a hundred things to do today.

1871
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,440
You got three great kids.

1872
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:37,000
You are a man that I admire greatly.

1873
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,440
You've created a tribe where you don't have to leave.

1874
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,200
I mean, you can, you know, get to work from here.

1875
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,800
You get to play with the kids.

1876
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,360
You get to be with the kids most nights.

1877
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,440
Obviously you have to still have to travel because you're still

1878
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:53,360
running a startup company, but what do you take from all that stuff you learned

1879
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:58,120
about being at the, you know, right at that level of being among the world's

1880
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,600
elites, ultra distance athletes?

1881
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,680
How do you bring that?

1882
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,080
How do you bring what you learned from that to your, your ability to be a dad?

1883
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:08,240
Or maybe asked another way, what do you take from those experiences that you

1884
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,920
want to impart on your kids?

1885
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,800
That's a tough one because I, I only learn what I learned because I figured

1886
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:23,800
it out on my own and so I want to expose the kids to stuff and let them take to

1887
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,040
whatever they take to.

1888
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:28,960
I want them to know, I want them to be proud of their dad and their mom.

1889
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:33,440
You know, we liked my wife played college basketball and still holds records here

1890
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,280
in San Diego for shooting percentage, et cetera.

1891
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:39,800
So I want the kids to be proud of their parents, but at the same time, like I

1892
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,360
don't want them to feel like they're living our shadow.

1893
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:43,520
I try not to go to the pool.

1894
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,040
I know a lot of the coaches from my prior life, so I don't want the kids to get

1895
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:52,480
special treatment because they're the, the spawn of me.

1896
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,640
And so I try to actually coach them right now.

1897
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,000
They're eight, my twins are eight.

1898
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,320
My son's three.

1899
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:00,480
Have fun.

1900
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,920
It's really pretty simple.

1901
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:02,320
Have fun.

1902
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,720
I hated, I hated wrestling and then I grew to love it when I was in high school.

1903
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:06,960
I hated it when I was their age.

1904
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,280
But did your, did your parents make you go through to get you through that

1905
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,680
transition of not like me, but it was more pure, right?

1906
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,280
In Iowa, if you're not wrestling, something's wrong with you.

1907
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,240
I mean, I started wrestling when I was five.

1908
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,880
I thought it was ridiculous.

1909
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,160
Why are these guys crawling all?

1910
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,520
I mean, this is just crazy.

1911
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,400
Like, why are you wrestling?

1912
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,640
You know, it's smelly and I just didn't, you know, it didn't wasn't into it.

1913
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:32,640
And then, and then I grew to love it when I got stronger and I saw the

1914
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:37,400
strategy in it and loved wrestling in high school, but I grew to love it at my

1915
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,000
own pace.

1916
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,200
And so for me right now at the kids, I don't take a lot other than just,

1917
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,600
Hey guys, you may not, you know, when a lot of it's just nutrition and lifestyle.

1918
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,880
That's the biggest thing that I try to bring to them is this whole notion.

1919
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,040
You don't need a car bloat.

1920
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,840
You know, I'll make them this morning before my son went to his swim meet, you

1921
01:37:54,840 --> 01:38:00,200
know, I gave him some dry nuts and some cherries and my daughter's off for the

1922
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:00,920
rest of the day.

1923
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:06,600
And so a lot of us comes to nutrition in terms of the things that I've learned.

1924
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,280
It really comes down to adversity and hard work.

1925
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,440
I mean, like you said, we live in Nirvana.

1926
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,160
I've really tried hard to create an environment for my family that is they can

1927
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:21,120
feel safe, secure, they can explore, but I want them to see you saw me out with a

1928
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,520
chainsaw for a reason.

1929
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,880
First of all, I love chainsaw.

1930
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:27,960
You're the only friend I have who chops more wood than me because I thought I was

1931
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,480
the wood chopping, so Cal, like no one in San Diego could be chopping more wood than

1932
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:33,640
me.

1933
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,640
But I will say this in the last four weeks, you have broken me.

1934
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,200
You've taken it to a new level.

1935
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,200
And until four weeks ago, I had no idea you even chopped wood.

1936
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,520
Yeah, we need to take a picture of my pile right now.

1937
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,000
Yes, I want the kids for me.

1938
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,840
I really want the kids to see that hard war comes in many forms.

1939
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,400
It's physical, it's mental, etc.

1940
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,240
And I want them to see the perseverance lead by example.

1941
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:03,560
And we live in this society where everything gets outsourced and it seems to be like I

1942
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,280
let other people do the work for you.

1943
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,080
Look, like you mentioned, I, you know, we run a small company.

1944
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:14,000
There's 15 of us now, but I take out the garbage and I run the company and I'll do

1945
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,240
that until the day I die.

1946
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,320
And I want my kids to see that too.

1947
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:21,720
I don't think there's, you know, whether it's Iowa background or, you know, I think

1948
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,760
we were cut from the same cloth that way.

1949
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,440
Nothing is beneath me.

1950
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:29,240
Well, you know, I fully believe in scaling through people and all that great stuff when

1951
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,600
it comes to running a company.

1952
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,040
But at the same time, when it comes to my kids, I want them to see that dad will roll

1953
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:40,920
up his sleeves and whether it's cutting down a tree, taking care of the yard or taking

1954
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,840
care of the house, whatever it might be.

1955
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,640
I'm just putting a new faucet in yesterday because like, why are you down there?

1956
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,920
I'm fixing the faucet.

1957
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:47,560
Yeah.

1958
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,200
You're so far.

1959
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,960
I mean, I wish I had that desire, discipline, whatever.

1960
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:56,080
Like, you know, I've just taken this opposite approach and I do worry deep down that it's

1961
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:56,760
in the long run.

1962
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,640
It's not the right thing for my kids because I grew up around a dad who did everything.

1963
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,160
Yeah.

1964
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,360
My dad didn't do any of that.

1965
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,360
I so interesting.

1966
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,520
My dad, my dad was the handiest dude that ever lived.

1967
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:09,840
My dad, my dad, he couldn't fix anything.

1968
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,480
It was a joke.

1969
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,960
It's still a joke with our family.

1970
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And he, it's funny.

1971
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,920
He comes out here now and he's clearing brush with me.

1972
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,320
So, and he loves it.

1973
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,200
And I love it.

1974
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,000
But the kids will make their own decision.

1975
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,840
And of course we could hire someone to put a new faucet in, but I want them.

1976
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:23,760
I want them.

1977
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,600
First of all, I enjoy the accomplishment, sense of pride.

1978
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:33,080
If I just did that and enjoy tinkering around the house, but it's good for the kids to see.

1979
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:38,160
The biggest thing for me with the software company has been in terms of taking the lessons

1980
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:38,920
from endurance.

1981
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,280
And so my family and my company are like my two families, right?

1982
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,480
And never give up.

1983
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,680
It's that simple, right?

1984
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:52,080
And we've taken a lot of different paths to get to success for my training and my endurance

1985
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,760
accomplishments, our family.

1986
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:59,920
We've done a lot of different things to try to architect the best situation for our family.

1987
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,400
And we've done the same thing with my company.

1988
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,800
And you know, and I sit on the board of a few companies as well.

1989
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,400
And my only advice is don't give up.

1990
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,320
It's that simple.

1991
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,120
When training, don't give up.

1992
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,040
A lot of it, you get a lot of adversity, but don't give up.

1993
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,040
It's usually the person that keeps moving.

1994
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:17,520
If you don't win the race, you'll finish the race.

1995
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:18,800
So just keep moving.

1996
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,440
But there's something more to it, right?

1997
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,840
There's this intelligence like you knew the days that you needed to back off.

1998
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:30,880
And I suspect that your greatest asset outside of your mental toughness, which I just there's

1999
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,840
just no way to displace that or there's there's no substitute for just the raw mental

2000
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,400
toughness.

2001
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:40,720
But I think it's that you've been, for example, very fortunate in your career to not have

2002
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,200
many significant injuries.

2003
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,760
You've had one arthroscopic knee operation.

2004
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:49,440
I mean, there's nothing they like yank the little tiny sliver of meniscus off it for a guy

2005
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:55,480
who's run tens of thousands of miles and has done all you've done.

2006
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:57,920
You know, you've got a broken collarbone from a bike crash.

2007
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,200
You've got a broken elbow from a bike crash.

2008
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:04,120
You got a little meniscal nubbin that got cleared pretty quickly.

2009
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,960
I think part of that is just the intelligence with which you've been able to approach this,

2010
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:11,000
which is like you sort of know what are the days to push?

2011
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,200
What are the days to back down?

2012
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:16,800
And to me, that's the thing that like if that if that knowledge can be codified, that's

2013
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,240
probably the thing that people would benefit from greatly.

2014
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:23,160
Right. If you're listening to this and you're thinking, how am I going to run a marathon

2015
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:28,840
while I'm, you know, the VP of operations at whatever company I'm at or I'm the single mom

2016
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:33,200
who's trying to figure out how to get two kids off to school and back while working 40

2017
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:33,920
hours a week.

2018
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,880
But I still want to set these physical goals.

2019
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,840
Like you got to be able to train smart.

2020
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,600
Everything you do has to be purpose driven.

2021
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,960
Yeah, I'm going to read you a text I got late last night.

2022
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,280
Hey, Mike, quick question.

2023
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,880
Today was meant to be 20 per Higdon.

2024
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,400
That's how Higdon who fantastic marathon coach puts together training plans.

2025
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,560
Didn't realize that I'd be climbing a lot.

2026
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,440
Super awesome.

2027
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,720
Although after loop, I only got 12.5.

2028
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,680
And should I go pound more flat?

2029
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:00,720
Eff it.

2030
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,280
I'm also running out of time.

2031
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:06,640
And my response to him is the general rules to stick to plan, even if you didn't get all

2032
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,760
miles as scheduled.

2033
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,400
In other words, don't try to make it up.

2034
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,680
And he's the guy training for his first marathon.

2035
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,840
He's up in San Francisco.

2036
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:13,840
Good friend of mine.

2037
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,360
So I've learned through mistakes.

2038
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:20,400
If I push too hard, if I try to make up miles, for example, I'll blow up.

2039
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,480
How do you codify that?

2040
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:26,080
I mean, a lot of it's just it's just a voracious appetite for information and research.

2041
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,920
It's the literature is there.

2042
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,360
The information is there.

2043
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,400
It may not be in context, right?

2044
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:36,880
So I've learned a lot about running and fat adaptation, etc., through mountaineering and

2045
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,280
cycling through other.

2046
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,320
So it's there.

2047
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,560
It just needs to be translated.

2048
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,160
I mean, you and I are huge fans of Richard Feynman.

2049
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:47,840
And if you look at what Feynman did with the whole Challenger investigation, bringing

2050
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:53,320
together a cross-functional team of engineers and physicists, etc., in terms of problem

2051
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:59,160
solving and scientific reasoning, the best approach is a cross-functional world-class

2052
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:04,560
expert team because you think outside the box and you bring other ideas from other domains.

2053
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,400
So I think codifying it comes down to don't limit yourself to just thinking about a marathon

2054
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:10,040
or whatever.

2055
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,920
Think, you know, look at yourself and be objective and figure out what it's going to

2056
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,680
take to achieve whatever you define as success.

2057
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:22,960
If you're a VP of ops of whatever company and you want a marathon, you want a 5K, look

2058
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,720
around you, the information is there, the resources are there.

2059
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,640
I mean, it's so much, that's the thing, right?

2060
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,000
We talked about this.

2061
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:36,200
When I used to ride out east in the desert, I would print out maps scanned from an Atlas

2062
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:40,080
and then I put them in a Ziploc bag to keep them dry from my sweat.

2063
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,200
And I would literally, that was my navigation.

2064
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:45,080
I would chart out my 300 mollers, my 400 mollers.

2065
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:50,800
It's so easy now to get information, perhaps too easy because when you have to work for

2066
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,000
it, sometimes I think you're more vested.

2067
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:59,120
So in terms of translating some sort of general rules, don't be afraid to ask questions.

2068
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:03,960
My friends ask me, I coach a lot of people informally today and it's generally, you

2069
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:04,840
don't overthink it.

2070
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,480
I mean, while I definitely think there's something to be said for looking at the data

2071
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:13,800
and analyzing, et cetera, unless you're looking to break a world record, don't be too

2072
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,000
hard on yourself and just get out there and have fun.

2073
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,320
I mean, that's sustainable.

2074
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,120
You are very data light these days.

2075
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:25,560
We were out riding this morning and lamenting the heat and how slowly we were riding

2076
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,960
relative to what we would like to.

2077
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,560
And I was like, God, these power meters, they never lie to you.

2078
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:34,320
Just once I want this thing to lie to me and tell me I'm better than I am today.

2079
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,760
And you're like, dude, I don't know how to power meter.

2080
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,920
I don't have a heart rate monitor.

2081
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,520
I'm just out here having fun.

2082
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:42,040
And I was like, you know, why the hell do I have a power meter?

2083
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,040
I don't compete anymore.

2084
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,200
I don't do this anymore.

2085
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:44,640
Yeah.

2086
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,280
Why do I have this data?

2087
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:50,120
It's like, yeah, artifacts of the past.

2088
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:52,680
I don't even have a speedometer on my bike.

2089
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,080
I mean, I have my phone in my pocket for emergency.

2090
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:55,480
He's better.

2091
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,080
It's not even tracking me.

2092
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,080
Yeah.

2093
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,600
Next, we're going to ride Saturday.

2094
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,960
So you and I ride once a week.

2095
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,520
This has been kind of an amazing tradition.

2096
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,880
You've got me back on the bike.

2097
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:09,480
I took a three year hiatus and I've really enjoyed our Sunday morning rides.

2098
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,360
We only ride 40K.

2099
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,960
We ride 40K and you listen to me rant the entire time.

2100
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:14,680
I love every...

2101
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,880
But the only reason is if I were ranting, I couldn't keep up with you.

2102
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:23,080
So it's like I have to let you do the talking so that, you know, it can normalize

2103
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,600
us a little bit so I can keep up.

2104
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,280
No, but it's awesome.

2105
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:30,360
The last thing I'll say is, and this is going to be disappointing to the listeners

2106
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,720
because I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag.

2107
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:38,120
But you are the guy who has introduced me to the greatest beer in the history of beer.

2108
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,920
And this was probably four years ago.

2109
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,840
I came over to your place one day and you gave me one of these things.

2110
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,400
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I don't really like beer.

2111
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,160
Then you're like, yeah, just try this.

2112
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:50,880
I mean, that was the moment the rat hit the lever and got the cocaine.

2113
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:54,120
I was like, this is from another planet.

2114
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,320
This this isn't beer.

2115
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,880
This is all that shit I thought I hated.

2116
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:02,240
You know, Coors Light and Budweiser and every IPA on the planet like that.

2117
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,800
I just find disgusting.

2118
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:06,800
This was a different animal.

2119
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:11,200
And to this day, even though I don't drink much, I might have one bottle a month,

2120
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,520
including right now, I just finished one as we were sitting here talking.

2121
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,560
It's hard to put in words how good this stuff is.

2122
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,920
And I don't know if you know this, but you probably do know this.

2123
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,480
So once you introduced me to said beer, I don't do anything in moderation.

2124
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,520
So I wanted to make sure I could get enough of it for us.

2125
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,560
So I had one of my analysts start looking around the country to find it,

2126
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,200
because at the time you were only getting it in Belgium, right?

2127
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:33,840
Yeah, I would.

2128
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,840
I was bringing this into the country as yeast samples.

2129
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:43,480
I was ordering it online and the first shipment came as a box of yeast samples,

2130
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:45,120
which is, I guess, what they did.

2131
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,680
I I just ordered it online, right?

2132
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:50,400
And it was like 10 euro a bottle.

2133
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,280
It was not cheap.

2134
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,160
Yeah, it's not cheap.

2135
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:57,200
And you've since you know, I've traveled to Belgium to experience this firsthand.

2136
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:58,640
It's a great beer.

2137
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:03,520
And so I had Nick Stenson, who was at the time and still and still actually is working for me.

2138
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:07,000
And I was like, and Nick can figure out anything like he's just like a savant

2139
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,120
of figuring stuff out.

2140
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:12,280
And I was like, Nick, can you figure out if we can get this beer in the United States?

2141
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:17,280
Two days later, he calls me, he goes, all right, 13 bottles up at this liquor store

2142
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,200
in Alameda, California, 42 bottles in this place in New Jersey.

2143
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,760
He rattles off the whole country.

2144
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,840
And he's like, so how many do you want?

2145
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:27,000
I was like, I'm not trying to stand the question.

2146
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:29,240
He's like, well, which of these ones do you want?

2147
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:35,480
And I was like, all of them, every single one, 260 bottles of this stuff arrive.

2148
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,120
And, you know, that lasted us for a couple of years.

2149
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:38,600
It did.

2150
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:39,160
It did.

2151
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:40,800
And I've been fortunate.

2152
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,200
I have stockpiled.

2153
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,560
Because the last shipment I got for you was about what, six months ago, we got you.

2154
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,880
It was about six months ago.

2155
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:55,760
So the seller is full of this beer and every other beer this brewer makes.

2156
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,080
And they're all fantastic.

2157
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,080
Are there any, can we give the listener a bone?

2158
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,440
I can't, I don't want to name this beer because honest, I mean, not to sound like a dick,

2159
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:07,680
but I just, I'm not going to be happy if we can't get this beer anymore.

2160
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:11,240
And I'm worried that it's such a limited beer that if I say what it is, I'm never

2161
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,240
going to get to drink it again.

2162
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,320
So I'm just going to have to be a selfish jerk.

2163
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:18,760
Can we name the brewery and not screw ourselves or what people figured out?

2164
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,200
No, no, we can't name it.

2165
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:26,400
What I love about the brewer, the brewery in Belgium, they're truly authentic.

2166
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,280
They just don't give a shit, right?

2167
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:29,840
So they're just low volume.

2168
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,920
They're low volume.

2169
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,720
They do all these crazy runs.

2170
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,920
They experiment.

2171
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:35,560
They try different things.

2172
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,400
They have some of their, they do like 300 bottle runs.

2173
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,760
They just, they tinker and it's fantastic.

2174
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,600
I mean, it's all so bad.

2175
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,840
Everything share anything.

2176
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,000
Some of it's, some of it's not all of it's great.

2177
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,400
They have a couple of sours that I just don't care for.

2178
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:54,040
I'm not a fan of those, but yeah, from strong Belgian nails to quads and

2179
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:58,120
everyone I've introduced it to has just been blown away.

2180
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,560
You don't have to be a beer drinker.

2181
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:02,080
You know, you don't have to be a guy who even likes alcohol.

2182
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,000
Like there's just something about this that's so good.

2183
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
So, so here's the bone.

2184
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I think we can throw people in one of our droughts a couple of years ago,

2185
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,760
when we were between like being able to find more of this stuff, you introduced

2186
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,200
me to a beer that I think we can share with the general population that I

2187
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,080
honestly is 80% as good.

2188
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:19,880
It's close.

2189
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:23,200
It's not special, but it's fantastic.

2190
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,800
It's a great mass production beer.

2191
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:25,520
I agree with you.

2192
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,640
And that would be judgment day.

2193
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:28,200
Judgment day.

2194
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:32,040
Lost Abbey is a San San Marcos, California brewery.

2195
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,760
Judgment day is up there.

2196
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:37,600
So it's a strong Belgian quad, as they call it.

2197
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:40,760
There are a few others, Shemais Grand Reserve and others, but the

2198
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,640
judgment day is, it's a local brewery.

2199
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,000
It's the closest thing I've ever tried to this beer.

2200
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,360
There are a few, and I've come at it from a few different directions to try to

2201
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:53,520
find something similar to our favorite judgment days and judgment.

2202
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:59,160
There's a few other, you know, Cask aged judgment day equivalents that the

2203
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:05,320
Lost Abbey put out that are fantastic, but it'll a little too smokey or a little

2204
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,800
too oaky or et cetera.

2205
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,120
The judgment day is just the right taste.

2206
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:08,840
Judgment days.

2207
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,440
It is.

2208
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,040
It's dense.

2209
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:13,360
It's a dense, strong 10 plus percent alcohol.

2210
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:14,960
All you need is one.

2211
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:15,440
Yep.

2212
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,800
You know, and I find it to be the best beer when there are a lot of people over

2213
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,400
because a, I'm not going to drink any other beer.

2214
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,240
It's so gross.

2215
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,080
And B, I'm not sharing our special one.

2216
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,280
Cause that's just, yeah, that's.

2217
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,360
I've made the mistake.

2218
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:29,960
It's funny.

2219
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:35,760
I shared this beer with one other friend and he's not a beer drinker either.

2220
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,160
And he, he said, no, no, no, I drink wine.

2221
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,480
And I gave him this beer and he had two.

2222
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,720
And you're thinking, Oh my God, that's two of my beers gone.

2223
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,680
Well, and now he's going to go and get more.

2224
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,920
Yeah, I didn't go.

2225
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,080
I have stuff dating back dating back to the early 2000s.

2226
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,960
So I actually have a stockpile of age, really good stuff.

2227
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,400
So I, you know, I'm completely out by the way.

2228
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,520
I have you none.

2229
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:03,440
I gave you my last batch because I was so grateful for all the help you'd given me.

2230
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:03,920
Yeah.

2231
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,800
You can have one.

2232
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,840
I got my one for the month today.

2233
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,080
So they went and bought up everything they could find.

2234
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:17,040
And I've learned if I want to share it, I take off the label, put it into a glass.

2235
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:17,400
Yeah.

2236
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:20,200
It's other, the world's supposed to be the world's best beer.

2237
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,160
And I forget the name of it in Belgium.

2238
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,080
It's easier to get to this now.

2239
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:25,240
All right.

2240
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:27,960
So for the listener, Oh, and then here's another little point.

2241
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,160
I was at BevMo this week, totally opportunistic.

2242
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:34,880
I pulled in, I was looking for like a credit union that I needed to go open

2243
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:35,840
an accountant, blah, blah, blah.

2244
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,080
And I was like, Oh, there's a BevMo here.

2245
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,440
I'm going to go get some more lost Abby.

2246
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:39,880
Cause that's where I used to get the judgment day.

2247
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,360
And I go in and they don't have it.

2248
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,120
And they're like, yeah, we're not carrying it anymore.

2249
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:44,280
It's not profitable enough.

2250
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:46,560
I'm like, what the hell is wrong with you people?

2251
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,080
Who cares how profitable it is?

2252
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,080
It's the greatest fricking mass produced beer in the history of civilization.

2253
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,640
So now I'm sweating it.

2254
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,360
Are we going to be able to struggle to get judgment day?

2255
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,280
So what we need to do is go up to the brewery.

2256
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,520
That's what we need to do.

2257
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,240
And we'll just fix that.

2258
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:03,440
Maybe if enough people are listening to this and they can

2259
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:05,840
repique the demand, we're not going to BevMo.

2260
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,080
We might start stocking it again.

2261
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,280
And it's relatively cheap.

2262
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:11,440
I mean, it's, it's 10 bucks for a Magnum basically.

2263
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:11,720
Yeah.

2264
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,160
Pine or whatever, whatever that size is.

2265
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,160
It's cheap.

2266
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:16,080
It's cheap.

2267
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:20,600
Well, Mike, we've talked about what I consider some of the most ridiculous

2268
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:24,920
feats of human endurance, along with probably the most ridiculous

2269
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,440
feat of beer engineering in the same discussion.

2270
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:31,240
If people want to learn more about you, unfortunately, you are a hard guy to

2271
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:34,720
learn about a Google search of your name yields almost nothing.

2272
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,200
Is there anything you want people to know about you read about?

2273
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,560
I mean, we're going to figure out a way to find that Vogue article,

2274
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:40,560
which I think is great.

2275
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,800
We'll link to a page that you have that talk, you know, that kind of lists

2276
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,440
out some of these things that you've done.

2277
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,600
Is there anything else people can do to learn about you?

2278
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,880
No, I'm just go to Peter's website.

2279
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:51,760
Very well.

2280
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,840
No, I used to have a race website years ago.

2281
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:59,200
We've tweaked that to just be a landing page, but I, at this point,

2282
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:00,600
go to Peter's website.

2283
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:04,800
Well, maybe one day when you sell indigenous, your current company, you

2284
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,920
know, after you take a little hiatus and really relax, maybe you'll

2285
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:12,200
reconsider this idea of forming a coaching company, because I think in

2286
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,920
many ways you actually have the perfect skill set, right?

2287
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:18,600
Which is you're a software engineer who knows how to build huge products

2288
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:22,040
that can be scaled and more importantly, you bring an expertise to this

2289
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,880
field that nobody has.

2290
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:27,000
And I don't know, I get the sense that there are people out there who would

2291
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,320
really value being able to access your brain to help them accomplish their goals.

2292
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,240
So maybe we'll plant that seed here today.

2293
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:33,680
Maybe.

2294
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:35,920
All right, man.

2295
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,800
Thank you very much.

2296
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:40,240
And I wish you the best on the remainder of this smoking hot day.

2297
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,080
It's been a blast.

2298
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:41,520
Thank you.
