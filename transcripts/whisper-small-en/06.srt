00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,420
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,680
This podcast, I'll be speaking with my good friend, DA Wallach.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,500
I've known DA for maybe five years now, maybe four, I can't recall, but he is truly a Renaissance

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
man.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,960
I have been accused of being a Renaissance man on occasion, but I am not.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,600
DA, however, is.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
And if you look up Renaissance man in the dictionary, I think you'll just see his picture

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,500
with his curly hair sitting there.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,240
He is a recording artist, a songwriter, an investor, an essayist.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,000
He was discovered while an undergrad at Harvard by Pharrell, among others who signed him to

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
a deal.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,660
He went on to become one half of the band Chester French.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,800
They released three full length albums.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,600
And he also has a solo album called Time Machine, which was released in 2016.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,440
We'll link to all of that stuff.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,200
Well with Chester French, they toured with a number of legendary bands and artists such

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,480
as Lady Gaga, Weezer, and perhaps my favorite of them all, Blink 182.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,740
Beyond music, however, DA is sort of in a class of his own in terms of his intellectual

28
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:52,520
curiosity and his ability to assimilate information that seems so far outside of his area of expertise.

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,960
In fact, some of the most interesting discussions I remember ever having with DA is sort of

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
what prompted this podcast.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,160
I remember one day he came over, he was passing through San Diego on his way down from LA,

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,200
came by and we were sitting out at a park on the swings having a discussion about liquid

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
biopsies.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,080
And I was thinking to myself, how is it that I'm sitting here with this guy, my buddy,

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,400
who's a musician and a very good investor, having this discussion about liquid biopsies

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,440
at a level of detail that I don't get to have with pretty much anybody else outside of

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,960
people who are knee deep in this field?

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,800
And that was sort of when it clicked in my mind.

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
I was like, you know, DA would be a great guy to have on the podcast.

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,960
He's advised a number of startup companies, including SpaceX, Doctor On Demand, Ripple,

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,480
Emulate, and of course he was an artist in residence at Spotify.

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,320
And we talk actually quite a bit about Spotify on this episode for anyone who's kind of interested

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,800
in how it came to be.

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,920
The other things that we talk about, of course, is his background in music and his start.

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,080
My daughter is a great drummer for a little kid, and I've always been interested in how

46
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,080
one can continue to encourage kids to be involved in music.

47
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,920
And we talk about some fun times that we've had when he's been over and has jammed with

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
her.

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,120
We talk a lot about cancer screening, which anybody who's kind of ever heard me talk about

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,520
this stuff privately, I really think that when it comes to the major metabolic diseases,

51
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,600
cardiovascular disease and the other atherosclerotic diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases,

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,560
the big tool that is really missing is these liquid biopsies.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,760
By the time cancer becomes visible on an imaging study, you can make the case you've lost the

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
war.

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,520
I don't know that that's true, but I do believe that if we can catch these things when they

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,560
are not yet fully determined to be cancers based on either looking at a DNA signature,

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,940
an RNA signature, or even a protein signature, that we might have a shot.

58
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,840
We also get into some really kind of nerdy stuff that I think is very important for anybody

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
thinking about screening, such as positive predictive value, negative predictive value,

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,160
sensitivity, and specificity.

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,600
And we'll link to some information here that we use internally in our practice to help

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
patients navigate that.

63
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,320
So if you're interested in music, if you're interested in liquid biopsies, cancer prevention,

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,480
general cancer screening, and just interested in listening to a really smart dude who seems

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,160
to know a lot about a lot of things and can speak very articulately about them, I think

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,980
you'll really enjoy this podcast.

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,700
You'll be able to find the show notes for this at PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash podcast,

68
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,040
and we'll link to a lot of the stuff that we talk about that will hopefully allow those

69
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,780
of you who are interested to follow up and learn a little bit more.

70
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,400
So without further delay, here is my conversation with the amazing DA Wallet.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,920
DA.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,320
Peter.

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,680
Thanks for having me over to your lovely place.

74
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
You're welcome.

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Anytime.

76
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,160
I like how you saw that I was in the driveway before I got here and I was just hanging out.

77
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,040
Well, we have this thing called the door bird, which is the evolved version of a ring.

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,360
And since you're interested in all esoteric technical things, would be interested to know

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:12,200
that this is the only web-enabled cloud recording doorbell system that can hook into a electric

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
strike.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,960
A strike being the thing that opens a gate remotely.

82
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,000
And so I'm able to see who rings the doorbell and then if I want to let them in, press a

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,400
button from the same app that opens the gate.

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,880
Remarkable technology.

85
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Yes.

86
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,040
Technology, as Ali G would say.

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Yes.

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,280
So we have known each other.

89
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
I don't even remember how we met.

90
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,760
Actually, I think we met through Gary Tobs, didn't we?

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,840
We met through Gary Tobs and I met Gary Tobs because I cold emailed him, which is how most

92
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,040
things started my life.

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,960
And I cold emailed him because I became sort of obsessed with obesity and nutrition research.

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,320
This was maybe six years ago or there about six, seven years ago.

95
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,720
And then I had gotten coffee with Gary up in Berkeley and he thought it would be worth

96
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
our meeting.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,440
And now I talk to you more than I talk to Gary.

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Yeah.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,880
It was a love at first sight actually.

100
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,000
And one thing that's really funny, we're going to talk so much about sort of your musical

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,720
career and things like that, but I will forever be grateful to that one night that you and

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,280
Adam were over for dinner.

103
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,280
This was just after my daughter Olivia started to play the drums and you guys got up, Adam's

104
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,920
played the piano, you played the drums, Olivia then played the drums.

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,560
And it was really exciting to see.

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,000
She got to see in action what like improvised music can look like.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
And I really think that that's part of the reason she still loves the drums.

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Well, that's good.

109
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,000
I mean, part of the drums that's fun is that you don't necessarily need to know the musical

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,960
material as well as other instrumentalists do in order to play along with people.

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,880
You know, you don't need to sort of learn the song.

112
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,240
You can kind of, as long as you can learn the beat of the song or figure it out quickly,

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,840
you can play, which is as someone who doesn't necessarily love practicing something that's

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,920
always drawn me to drums.

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,680
And I remember her teacher when she was five and I started saying, you know, it's going

116
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,440
to be really hard because the music's really hard to read.

117
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,920
So the only shot she'll have at starting this young is if she sort of has an intuitive feel

118
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,760
for the music, in which case she can get by on that until she learns to actually figure

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,200
out that, you know, two sixteenths is actually an eighth and that kind of stuff.

120
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Right.

121
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Well, that's a good point.

122
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,920
And I think the best way to learn instruments or to learn music in general is kind of to

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,640
start without any framework, play around and explore yourself and then learn a little

124
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,440
theory because what you don't want to do is become imprisoned by theory.

125
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,440
But it does answer some important questions that you'll arrive at if you allow yourself

126
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,760
to get lost in the first place.

127
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,960
And so I've always said that, you know, when we have kids, my vision for piano training

128
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,760
would be you just have to sit there for half an hour every day and you can do whatever

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
you want.

130
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,080
You don't have to touch the piano if you don't want.

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,520
But of course, anyone sitting at a piano for 30 minutes will and you can figure out how

132
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,040
it works.

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:18,040
And then theory, if you have spent, you know, tens of hours messing around, is like an amazing

134
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,080
gift because it goes, oh, OK, well, that makes sense.

135
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
That's how it works.

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,120
Just like if you were trying to reinvent mathematics with no orientation.

137
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Like Ramanujan.

138
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,160
Yes, like Ramanujan, which, you know, I'm not.

139
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,920
You're almost a Ramanujan of music.

140
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,320
I wish.

141
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,280
So speaking of which, how did you what was your how did you get started in music?

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,960
Were you always musical as a child?

143
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,160
Were you playing instruments when you were young?

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,880
I don't think I was particularly musical.

145
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,440
I always liked listening to music and my dad would take me to jazz shows occasionally when

146
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,120
I was young, which sort of infected me with an interest in jazz.

147
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,840
The first instrument I tried playing was the saxophone because I thought it looked cool.

148
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,220
And I remember we rented one.

149
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,720
This was in the middle school band.

150
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
So it might have been fifth grade.

151
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,240
This would have been an alto sax or a tenor.

152
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
I don't even remember.

153
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,040
And in any event, we rented it.

154
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,200
I brought it home and I tried to learn how to just make a sound with it, which is not

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,200
trivial because with a reed, you have to purse your lips in a particular way and all this.

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,080
And I was so frustrated in the first hour of trying to play the saxophone that I gave

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,440
up and became a drummer and then played drums throughout middle school and high school.

158
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,100
And I had had sort of bands with high school friends and that sort of thing.

159
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,720
And then in college became a singer, which was something I had never done.

160
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,760
Oh, so I didn't realize that you had never sung until you got to college.

161
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,320
I had never sung and I met some cool guys in the dining room at my college.

162
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,120
And then they said, do you want to try out for this band we're thinking about starting?

163
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
And I said, sure.

164
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,680
And I tried out as the drummer, but I got beaten by my friend Damien, who then became

165
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
our drummer.

166
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
And as a consolation prize, they asked me if I wanted to be the singer.

167
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,040
And I said, well, I've never sung before, but I'll try.

168
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,560
And I've been trying ever since.

169
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,640
So I didn't realize that.

170
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,160
So you went into what became Chester French as the drummer trying to be the drummer.

171
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:27,080
And then Damien, who became the drummer, later quit and became a filmmaker and is now won

172
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,400
like 10 Academy Awards.

173
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,800
He did whiplash and then he did La La Land, which I have a small cameo in.

174
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,000
But whiplash, if you've seen it as about a drummer and it's somewhat autobiographical

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
about Damien.

176
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,960
Oh, I didn't that I didn't realize.

177
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,080
I mean, whiplash is there's only probably five movies I have stored on my iPad because

178
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
you know, it's just they take up a lot of room.

179
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,440
Right. So but the five that I have are like such that if I'm on an airplane and everything

180
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,560
goes to hell in a handbasket and the Wi-Fi is broken and I don't feel like doing work,

181
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,000
boom, boom, boom. And whiplash is one of those five.

182
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,480
It's great, which means it's a movie I've seen more times than I can count.

183
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,200
But I especially like the last scene.

184
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,760
Well, it's a high octane movie.

185
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,000
I mean, it's about human performance, basically.

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,760
So I get why you like it.

187
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,360
It is unbelievable.

188
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,480
Yeah. But I had no idea about this notion that it was not just purely fictional and

189
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,640
that there was some autobiographical component to it.

190
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,560
A little bit. I mean, I don't think there was anyone as sinister in Damien's life as the

191
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,120
teacher in the movie.

192
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,640
But Damien, both as a drummer and now as a filmmaker, is incredibly self-critical and

193
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,320
hardworking and perfectionistic.

194
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,720
And so I think those elements are definitely a reflection of his personality.

195
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,880
I'm always amazed when you look back at sort of the annals of rock and roll, how many

196
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,480
musicians didn't come into it as singers.

197
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,560
So, for example, I remember hearing about Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix and people who

198
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,440
really never thought of it as their voice was what was going to do things.

199
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,040
And yet we still think of them as completely iconic.

200
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,760
Can anybody learn to sing?

201
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,120
I don't know if anyone can learn to sing.

202
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,720
I mean, you need a certain amount of physical instrumentation that you just can't escape.

203
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, so there are things I wish I could do with my voice that I'll never be able to

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,360
do, just like I wish I could dunk a basketball.

205
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,760
That being said, I think there's probably an enormous I know there's an enormous range

206
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,520
of refinement that can be pursued because I started as a pretty bad singer and I think

207
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,080
of becoming an OK singer.

208
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,800
And a lot of that, just like any physical activity, is about learning how to mentally

209
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,520
control a part of your body to get it to do what you want it to do.

210
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,680
It's just that controlling your vocal folds and the way that you express air is a

211
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,560
relatively fine tuned set of physical processes.

212
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,440
And so the sort of detailed control that you need to physically command over your

213
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,960
anatomy is kind of difficult to obtain.

214
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,320
But, you know, I became a much, much better singer.

215
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,560
I think the thing that is probably more natural that you either have or you don't have is an

216
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,400
ability to know when you're making a noise whether it is on pitch.

217
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,200
And some people clearly don't have this.

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
But I think most people have a decent sense of pitch.

219
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,920
And if they didn't, then, you know, they wouldn't be pleased by harmonious music.

220
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,360
I mean, we have a natural ability to hear whether someone's hitting a sour note in a

221
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
chord or something or whether someone's singing off tune.

222
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,120
That that bothers most of us.

223
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,840
So if you can be bothered by that, then chances are you can hear the difference

224
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,600
between that and the right thing.

225
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,120
And that's what a lot of it comes down to when you're singing.

226
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
It's very important that you hear yourself because that's the feedback loop.

227
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Yeah.

228
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,160
So do you remember the first time you sang on stage in front of people besides your

229
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,760
bandmates?

230
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
Well, it would have been freshman year in college.

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,640
And we began by doing sort of weekly performances in the student commons at

232
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,800
Harvard and, you know, the audience was 20 or 30 of our friends.

233
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,240
And the band always had a sense of humor to the music, although that trailed off in

234
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,160
our final album, which was not really funny.

235
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,360
But earlier, we had always kind of been humorous at some level.

236
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:31,200
And I think that masked how poor my musicianship was for a long time because we

237
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,360
could kind of play it off as a bit of a joke band.

238
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,680
So sort of like bare naked ladies.

239
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,360
Like what was it?

240
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
Not that they were a joke band, but you know what I mean?

241
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,640
Like they were always having fun.

242
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
They were silly.

243
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:49,240
We were irreverent and somewhat subversive in the notion that what we did was meant

244
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,640
to almost be ironic.

245
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,880
So we would do songs about medieval knights.

246
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,280
We would do totally absurdist music.

247
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:07,240
And I think totally possible to hear it and either think that it was self-consciously

248
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,920
funny or to think that it was totally clueless.

249
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,600
And so that made it easier to sort of cut the tension a little bit and break the ice

250
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,160
or so to speak, you know, that it wasn't like you were scared to death getting up

251
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,600
there. For me, like if you said to me, Peter, you have

252
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,080
to either go and climb Mount Everest or K2 and there's, you know, like a 30 percent

253
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,880
chance you're going to die or you have to sing in front of a thousand people.

254
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm trekking. Like I'm going to the mountain.

255
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,600
Like the thought of actually singing in front of any human being.

256
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Right. Like including people like my kids.

257
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,080
Like there's no way I'm singing.

258
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,240
Yeah. I don't know why there is some sense of shame that attends singing.

259
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,880
I mean, I know what you're saying.

260
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't feel it, but I wish I could.

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,640
I mean, like part part of it is I think realizing that singing is just musical

262
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,080
speaking. So we're really singing all the time when we're talking.

263
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,880
We're just not using tonality and as deliberate a way.

264
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,440
I mean, there's a pitch to every time you speak.

265
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,040
So singing is just controlling that pitch, which is actually a helpful thing that I

266
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,280
learned from vocal coaches who when I went to go touring, I went to see

267
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,800
literally because it became more of a sport for me.

268
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,000
It was now something that I was going to have to do for an hour or two every day.

269
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,960
And I didn't have the physical endurance and the muscle control to endure that

270
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,840
without hurting myself.

271
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,800
So I would go to some coaches to sort of get ready to tour and they would make

272
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,480
this point that singing is just musical speaking.

273
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,280
And it really changed the way I thought about singing and made it quite a bit

274
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,480
easier. So let's talk through the transition.

275
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,440
So you guys start this.

276
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,160
Tell me about the name Chester French.

277
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Where did it come from?

278
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,080
Chester French was the name of a sculptor, Daniel Chester French, who did the

279
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,200
Lincoln Memorial.

280
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,160
And then he also did the John Harvard statue, which is in the center of Harvard's

281
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,520
main quad.

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,280
And we didn't know that when we chose the name, but we had a dining hall there that

283
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,080
all freshmen ate.

284
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,320
And that sort of looks like the Hogwarts dining hall in Harry Potter, big wood

285
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,880
paneled room with soaring ceilings and busts all around the walls.

286
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,960
So we were going into lunch and we saw one of these busts and it had a little

287
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,480
plaque under it that was, we thought, the name of the person who had been sculpted.

288
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,920
And so he said, Chester French, that's kind of a cool name.

289
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,880
And we picked it then and there.

290
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,400
And then we later, of course, learned that that was the sculptor of not only that

291
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
bust, but also these other great American sculptures.

292
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,920
Got it. So when did you guys start to get some traction?

293
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,560
And I mean, because most college bands don't end up going on tour.

294
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,440
So what was that transition like?

295
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,680
We basically got no traction doing what we initially set out to do, which was to

296
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,200
build a live performance following.

297
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,040
So the conventional wisdom, if you started a band on the East Coast in college,

298
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,760
which a lot of people did actually, if they were musicians, was start playing on

299
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,120
your campus, start playing at surrounding campus parties and sorority keggers and

300
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,920
whatever, and then ultimately get a van and start driving around the East Coast

301
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,280
and going to other colleges and you can build a following among college students.

302
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,920
And we tried to do this, but we just totally ate shit.

303
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,280
I mean, we could barely get people to come to our shows on campus.

304
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,800
And then we I remember booked a gig at a club called Great Scott in Boston, which was

305
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,840
kind of the Harper's Ferry was the was the specific one that I'm thinking of here.

306
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,400
Great Scott was another club.

307
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,920
We booked a show at this Harper's Ferry and we both tried to recruit our friends from

308
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,160
campus to to make a 10 minute journey to this club.

309
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,080
I think three of them came.

310
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,120
And then we also for the three nights prior to the show went and stood on the street

311
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,200
in front of the club, figuring that people who lived in the area probably walked by the

312
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,560
club and or people who went to the club might come and see multiple shows handing out

313
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,280
flyers, trying to promote ourselves.

314
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,000
And when we got there to do the gig on a Thursday night or something, I think there

315
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,280
was an audience of like five or seven people.

316
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,800
And, you know, that's particularly depressing when you've spent two and a half hours

317
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,720
setting up and sound checking and hauling all your gear.

318
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,760
So anyways, that strategy failed.

319
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm not sure why.

320
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,680
Maybe we just weren't good live or something, but we took a turn at the end of sophomore

321
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,200
year in strategy and our focus became just making recordings.

322
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,480
And the thought was ultimately the product is a recorded music product.

323
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,120
That's what we're really making.

324
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,080
We're songwriters and we're producers.

325
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,520
And so our focus shifted to essentially just living in the recording studio, making

326
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:10,000
stuff. And the idea became let's try and make an album that we think is a great,

327
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,880
complete representation of our musical ideas.

328
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,800
And if we do that and it's really good, it will speak for itself.

329
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,520
And no one in the record industry will care whether we have this big live following or

330
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,120
not. Luckily, that turned out to work.

331
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,960
I mean, it was not certain by any means, but we made this record over the subsequent

332
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,040
two and a half years.

333
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,360
And then in the middle of senior year started sending out that album to as many people as we

334
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,320
could send it out to.

335
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,840
And ultimately, it got to Kanye West, who gave us our big break and flew us out to Los

336
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,480
Angeles and offered us a record deal.

337
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,680
And then that spurred a number of other people attempting to sign us to record deals.

338
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,080
We ultimately chose to work with Pharrell and did a deal with him and a guy named Jimmy

339
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,240
Iovine who ran Interscope Records.

340
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,560
And as soon as we graduated, we moved out to L.A.

341
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,840
And that became our career.

342
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,680
I mean, just put that in context for a moment.

343
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,800
That strikes me as like a fairy tale, right?

344
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,920
I mean, what's the probability that Kanye West I mean, how many times is he getting

345
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,480
something pitched and having to pick a needle out of a haystack?

346
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,880
Is that how that works?

347
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,200
I think it was a little atypical that other artists supported us.

348
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,520
And now that I'm sort of not doing music full time in retrospect, when I look at the

349
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,840
band's career, it's kind of clear to me that we were an artist's artist.

350
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,040
In other words, our fans tended to be people who were quite musical, whether they were

351
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,000
famous musicians or whether they were just random people who played guitar at home.

352
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,720
But we were making a style of music that I think spoke to musicians specifically.

353
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,440
Part of that was the result of trying to make music that we wanted to listen to.

354
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,080
And so we were our own customer in a kind of weird way.

355
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,200
So it certainly wasn't typical that other artists would be the ones to jumpstart our

356
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,160
career. On the other hand, it was at a time when the music industry was changing.

357
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,720
And so all of the paradigms by which artists got discovered were being destabilized.

358
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,600
There used to be these armies of A&R people who worked at record companies and they

359
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,560
went to concerts and scouted.

360
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,920
And what was changing when we came onto the scene was that the Internet was becoming the

361
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,240
primary distribution channel for music and also the primary place where people

362
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,840
discovered new artists.

363
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,960
This is what, like, 2003, 2007.

364
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,000
OK. And so, you know, Facebook was a couple of years old.

365
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,480
MySpace was kind of at its height.

366
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,120
And we were one of the first artists to primarily build our audience online.

367
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,560
So, you know, that was unique.

368
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,560
And was Facebook a better channel for that than, say, having your own site that you're

369
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,320
hosting? Like, how were you?

370
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,560
Facebook was and remains a bad channel for that.

371
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,760
But MySpace was an amazing channel for that.

372
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:14,120
And MySpace had all of these features that allowed culture to kind of virally permeate

373
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,160
civilization. So tell me what What MySpace did better than Facebook with respect to that

374
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,000
or what it enabled.

375
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,320
Well, there were, let's say, two or three distinctive things about it.

376
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,000
The first was that it essentially was a place where spam was totally legal and

377
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,960
standardized. And so it was kind of like MySpace felt almost like Times Square in the

378
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,160
80s or something.

379
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
You know, it was like a little unsavory.

380
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,040
There were all these weird people on there.

381
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,760
People had avatars.

382
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,920
So you didn't know if it was really them or not.

383
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,120
Identity had not been formalized in the way that Facebook ultimately made it.

384
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,000
So on the one hand, you could spam people.

385
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,040
So for us, we could go on there and just randomly send our music to random people who we

386
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,080
thought might like it.

387
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,480
That was highly useful.

388
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,800
The second thing was that they had this thing top eight.

389
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,520
So on everyone's MySpace page, you could pick your top eight friends.

390
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And that became kind of like a prize to be one of the top eight of a famous person or

391
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
one of the top eight of a famous band or something.

392
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,320
And so you could kind of go on MySpace and try and find artists who you thought would

393
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,880
share an audience or whose audience you wanted to steal.

394
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,560
Essentially, it's not stealing because it's not a zero sum thing.

395
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,760
People can like a lot of artists, but we would identify these artists who we wanted to

396
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,640
steal the fans of.

397
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,400
And then we'd try and get our music to them to get in their top eight because then tons

398
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,680
of people would discover you.

399
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:54,440
And then the third thing was that MySpace allowed each user an incredible amount of

400
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,880
freedom in designing their page.

401
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,200
So you could go in and change the HTML or the CSS on your MySpace page.

402
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,440
And this, from a user experience standpoint, made it a very difficult place to navigate.

403
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,320
But I think what it brought out was that everybody, when you give them a creative canvas,

404
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,080
likes to paint on it.

405
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:25,400
And what you saw was that ordinary people who were just MySpace users, consumers of

406
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,720
content themselves would really wear their identity on their page.

407
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:38,400
And so you could kind of navigate this universe of MySpace and understand the cultural

408
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,600
orientation of every person on it.

409
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,840
And it made it really easy to figure out who were your people.

410
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,600
You know, I mean, if you were like a goth band or something, a metal band, it was very

411
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,240
clear who the metal people were.

412
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:00,000
And so for us, we could really take advantage of this and kind of hack the system to find

413
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,160
our people quickly.

414
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,480
I don't want to go too down the rabbit hole on this, but it's so interesting because I've

415
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,360
never I haven't thought about MySpace in probably 10 years or something like that.

416
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,120
When the history books written and it could probably be written now, I'm assuming, why

417
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,920
did Facebook win MySpace lose at the risk of oversimplifying things?

418
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,560
I think there are a few reasons I perceive and then there are probably many I have no

419
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
idea about.

420
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,080
You just strike me as having a better sense than the average person based on a pretty

421
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,200
robust understanding of how both of them worked.

422
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,960
MySpace was even if they maybe thought they were being scientific, it was not a sort of

423
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,360
science project.

424
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,560
In other words, the people building it were in L.A.

425
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,760
They were kind of more inclined to understanding culture and the thinking about personal

426
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,120
freedom and expression.

427
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:54,120
Whereas what Facebook was built around was the idea that if you created an accurate map

428
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,480
of people's real world relationships, then the behaviors that they exhibit in the real

429
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,760
world would end up mirrored in this digital environment.

430
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:14,280
So social values like trust were going to be essential in the Facebook universe.

431
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,080
Whereas in MySpace, like I said, it was like Times Square in the 80s.

432
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,840
It was like there were CD people on there.

433
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,160
You didn't know if people were who they said they were.

434
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,720
It was a fake place.

435
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,760
And the early Internet was much more like that.

436
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,320
You know, everyone was in chat rooms with aliases and stuff.

437
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,640
You never really knew who was who.

438
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,640
Facebook became a digital version of the real world.

439
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,160
And so it was kind of more valuable from the outset because things that you only previously

440
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,120
could do in reality, like talk to someone or share with them photos or something, became

441
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,360
something that you could do in a highly managed way through Facebook.

442
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,760
That's really interesting.

443
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,240
I have never I would have assumed just as a guy who knows nothing that, you know,

444
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,280
Facebook won because they figured out how to monetize this stuff better than MySpace.

445
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,960
But it sounds like there's much more cultural, emotional sort of philosophical differences

446
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,000
that that may have decided which direction was going to have greater mass appeal.

447
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,960
I think that's right.

448
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:28,320
And you sort of see this resuscitated in the rise of Snapchat because Snapchat is also

449
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
kind of back to that L.A. mindset.

450
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,320
It's much more expressive and irreverent and kind of culturally contextualized.

451
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,760
It's got a lot of character and personality.

452
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,640
Its logo is a funny ghost drawing and this sort of thing.

453
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,880
And so I wouldn't give up yet on the idea that the future of the Internet may allow

454
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,240
people to be much more expressive than you see them being on Facebook.

455
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,840
Facebook is a little bit totalitarian, not necessarily in a bad way.

456
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,920
I mean, that's that's a word that is pretty loaded, but yeah, loaded.

457
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:08,520
But I'm looking for a antiseptic or anodyne or I don't know what the right word is, but

458
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,840
it's it doesn't have a lot of flavor.

459
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,800
It's a reflection of the engineering mindset behind it, which itself is really

460
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,480
ingenious, but it as a digital place lacks culture.

461
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,680
Mark Zuckerberg, who I think very highly of and who's a friend, is a genius business

462
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,880
person and technologist, but he's never, I don't think, been especially interested in

463
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,600
culture.

464
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:47,200
And when he talks about Facebook being a community and a global community, I think he

465
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,560
is potentially always, you know, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think

466
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,880
he's maybe always thought that Facebook shouldn't have too much of a culture that it

467
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,840
imposes.

468
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,400
It should basically be a blank canvas for all of the diversity that is in the world.

469
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,600
And when you allow people to express themselves more, it's unclear whether what you're doing

470
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,560
is loading a place with some cultural precepts of your own, even by dint of the way that you

471
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,920
design what those expressive tools are or if you're actually giving people more freedom.

472
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,440
And so I think Facebook has always taken the approach of limiting people's expressive

473
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,800
capacity, forcing them to make comments or post things in these very structured linear

474
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:48,120
formats, whereas some of these other tools have been a lot more liberal in the attitude

475
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,760
that they take to personal expression.

476
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,640
When you went to college, what do you study?

477
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:01,240
I did African-American studies and I have a minor in Kikuyu, which is a Kenyan language

478
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,040
that I no longer speak.

479
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,520
Were you thinking about going to grad school after?

480
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,240
I mean, were you just pursuing your bliss?

481
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,600
Like what were you thinking you would end up doing before you ended up in L.A., of course?

482
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,760
I wasn't thinking much about it at all.

483
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,960
I mean, I think I'd been very interested in public policy and so politics interested me

484
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,640
and I think academia maybe interested me.

485
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,680
The arts certainly did.

486
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,120
And I think halfway through my freshman year, I decided that the goal I wanted to shoot for

487
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,280
was becoming a musician.

488
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:36,040
But part of that was a response to finding when I got to college that Harvard was

489
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,720
essentially a vocational school for investment banking and management consulting.

490
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,720
I didn't know that those were jobs in the world.

491
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,120
I had never heard of either of those professions.

492
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,280
And when it became clear to me that 40 or 50 percent of my classmates would end up in

493
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,000
those jobs, I was kind of horrified and I thought, oh, my gosh, is that the adult life

494
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,920
that awaits me?

495
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,720
And maybe as a bit of a rebellion against that, I went full bore into I want to be a

496
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,360
musician.

497
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,960
That is hilarious.

498
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,560
The vocational school for investment banking and management consulting.

499
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,800
I didn't realize it was that high.

500
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,320
So roughly, I don't know, but whatever.

501
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,040
Call it even if a third of people end up as investment bankers and management consultants.

502
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,600
That's a pretty interesting concentration.

503
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,280
Anything wrong.

504
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,800
I mean, I know you were a management consultant at one point, but there was a sense in which I

505
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:34,600
felt that my college and elite universities in general, I mentioned it a couple of times, but

506
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,480
I'm not someone who's a big booster.

507
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,960
I'm not involved in alumni stuff.

508
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,840
I don't take a lot of pride, particularly in having gone to Harvard or anything.

509
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,640
And part of why is because I'm very suspicious of these institutions, both because they

510
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,840
essentially serve a function in the society of reproducing inequality and social hierarchy.

511
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,560
And they've been doing that for hundreds of years.

512
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,080
And second, because they homogenize all of these talented young people.

513
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:08,040
So they do an extraordinarily good job of finding interesting, unique people in high

514
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,320
school and then turning them into boring, high achieving technocrats.

515
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,880
And that's kind of a tragedy for the world because it's a waste of the formidable

516
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,160
resources that those universities do have, that what they choose to do with it is

517
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,000
essentially pump out functionaries in the financial services.

518
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,480
But somewhere along the way, you learn to think.

519
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,960
And is it safe to then assume that you learned that before college and that college, if

520
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,840
anything, didn't diminish that ability rather than augmented it?

521
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,760
I'll tell you where I'm going with this.

522
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,760
You know, and we're going to talk a lot about biology and our mutual interest in, you know,

523
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,960
hacking and lifespan and all that sort of stuff.

524
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,640
But I remember after even the first day we met, maybe it was like after our second meeting

525
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,640
or something, I remember thinking, how does this guy know so much about this stuff?

526
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,120
Like you had more than just a superficial understanding of stuff that suggested like

527
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,360
you'd read a couple of things about it, which obviously just suggested to me that you

528
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,280
learned how to learn.

529
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,000
And as a result of that, when you decided, hey, I really want to understand this area

530
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,320
and I want to understand the science of this stuff, you at least had a toolkit that you

531
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,360
could use to do that.

532
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,760
Where do you think you got that?

533
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:25,320
I think I've maybe just always been curious and that is a personality trait or disposition.

534
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,400
Just wanting to understand things has always driven me to some degree.

535
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,600
When I went to college, I was interested in race and the history of race in America and

536
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,600
how this set of ideas about who we are influences what the world is and who we become as

537
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:54,760
people. And I was essentially interested primarily in these very complicated phenomena in

538
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,920
the social world.

539
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,600
So I wanted to you know, I remember the first time I read Marx and whatever.

540
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:09,160
It was so engaging to discover a set of these totalizing ideas about how history works or

541
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,480
something, you know, whether I agree with them or not, it's a separate issue.

542
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:22,040
But the idea that one could theoretically describe reality was always compelling to me.

543
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:30,400
And what has happened intellectually, as I've gotten older, is that I've realized that

544
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,400
science is essentially the best methodology that we have for describing reality.

545
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,880
And I've realized that I think the things that most interested me, like social phenomena,

546
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:48,760
government, public policy, history, are very difficult to address with the science currently

547
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,800
at our disposal.

548
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,600
So ultimately, I believe we will be able to have an empirical understanding of some of

549
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,800
these sorts of things.

550
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:05,040
But I was going after them back then, naively thinking that we already had those tools at

551
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,920
our disposal or that I could, by reading a lot about history, develop a accurate picture

552
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,080
of how it works.

553
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,480
And one, learning how to think is about understanding the limitations of our own biology

554
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
or our own cognition.

555
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,400
But then it's also about figuring out what's knowable and how you can understand things

556
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
and what processes you can use to understand things.

557
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:41,080
And so when I encounter a subject, I'm instantly tracking on what's the theoretical

558
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,680
framework behind it.

559
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,240
The details don't really interest me.

560
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,320
It's what's the skeleton behind it, what's the structure of it.

561
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,920
And for that reason, I don't think I've never been good at facts.

562
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm not good at dates.

563
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,480
I'm not good at memorizing names of biomolecules.

564
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,920
But what sticks in my brain are these kind of theoretical constructs.

565
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,120
Yeah, somebody asked me on Twitter a while ago and I decided it would be a good question

566
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,000
for an AMA at some point, which was if you could change something about the medical

567
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,600
school curriculum, what would it be?

568
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,160
And I wouldn't describe it probably as eloquently as you, but it's basically I remember the

569
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,240
first day of medical school, they said, you know, the average college graduate has a

570
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,760
vocabulary of X words.

571
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,360
And I don't actually remember what X is, but I feel like it was about 10,000 or something

572
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,840
like that.

573
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,560
And they said, you know, in the next two years, which is before you go into the clinical

574
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
stuff, you're going to learn.

575
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,880
And it was a little more than that.

576
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,520
So if it was 10,000, was the college grad, they said, like, you'll learn 12,000 new

577
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,280
words. And obviously you do need to learn a new vocabulary in medicine.

578
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,680
But when I look back at medicine or in medical school rather, I think the biggest deficit

579
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,960
was no attention paid deliberately towards how to think.

580
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,760
And that, of course, becomes relevant because, you know, all facts have a half life and

581
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,920
some facts like anatomical facts have very long half lives.

582
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,360
So in an area like that, it's probably reasonable to know stuff.

583
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,200
But in other things, like by the time you're done medical school, the information is wrong

584
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,000
or irrelevant.

585
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,840
And yet nothing's really put in place to teach that skill of how do you go about

586
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,240
you're now out there in the real world, you're taking care of patients and yet maybe

587
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,560
what you learned about cholesterol or maybe what you learned about subject X, Y, Z is

588
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,000
kind of not right, or at least should be revisited or the probability of it being correct

589
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
is lower. So do you and Liz think you'll have kids?

590
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,160
Yeah. And so how do you now I'm asking this as a curious parent, but how do you think

591
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,040
about creating an environment to produce that type of curiosity and that skill set?

592
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,440
What do you think a parent can do deliberately?

593
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,960
I'm asking this based on you having been the kid, not the parent so far.

594
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,360
Well, you certainly have more experience with this because you've got kids.

595
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,440
What I've heard people say and what I sense may be real is that you actually don't need

596
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,520
to teach kids this.

597
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,040
They're born with a lot of it.

598
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,680
And what the world tends to do is squeeze it out of them.

599
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,960
And so I guess I would invert the question and frame it as how do you not kill a child's

600
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,040
curiosity and how do you feed it?

601
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,960
Certainly one of the things I think my parents did was not sanction in a negative way asking

602
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,240
questions or asking why questions.

603
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:33,360
And by contrast, you can inculcate a child in religious ideologies or strictures about how to

604
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,960
live that are so imprisoning that becomes a fundamental part of their brain.

605
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,680
And so I think just not making those mistakes is probably the most important thing.

606
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,000
I like the example you gave earlier of your piano lesson is 30 minutes of sitting in front of a

607
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,920
piano for some period of time before you start to read sheet music and start doing drills and

608
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,640
things like that.

609
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,400
I like that idea.

610
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
That's absolutely.

611
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:07,480
I mean, look, there's a balance between the sort of rote discipline that is required in anything

612
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,720
and then the creative and exploratory potential within that area.

613
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,800
In my mind, I tend to weight the ladder.

614
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:24,720
And so what's difficult for me is the brutal, repetitive skill building.

615
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,880
And I've had to figure out ways in life of not making my success depend on that aptitude and

616
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,480
figure that's stuff that I look to other people to help me with.

617
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,800
My band is an example.

618
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,920
My partner Max is an I mean, he's good at everything.

619
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,800
He's a musically brilliant person at a compositional level, too.

620
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,040
I mean, he can write great music and he's very theoretical.

621
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,440
But he also has that OCD capacity to sit there and practice guitar for 10 hours.

622
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,640
And that's really fun.

623
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,720
That's his happy place.

624
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,600
I go crazy doing that.

625
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,040
And so I think to come back to your question about children, I think the struggle for me

626
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,400
will be figuring out how to impart to them a greater capacity to do the part that I don't

627
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,520
like doing, because if you can really have both, that's the superpower.

628
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,280
But it sounds like to me, at least maybe part of the the secret is knowing how much

629
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,120
emphasis to put on each of those two.

630
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,680
Again, they're not mutually exclusive, but you understand that this is a kid that if pushed

631
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,640
too hard on the road stuff will actually dampen the creativity versus sounds like in Max's

632
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,600
case, that's not the case.

633
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,440
He can live in both of those worlds and be quite successful.

634
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,960
And I think that's right.

635
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,880
You know, the one metaphor I used to think about this, because a debate that comes up in

636
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:53,600
all contemporary art, be it painting or writing or music, is essentially whether amateur work

637
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,600
can be just as valid as, quote unquote, professional work.

638
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,960
So if you think about punk rock, the whole idea is screw learning these instruments, I'm

639
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,480
just going to pick up the guitar and express myself.

640
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,680
And so, of course, there's a level of vitality that can be produced through that type of

641
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:23,120
artwork, both the absence of formal rules gives birth to a lot of expressive freedom.

642
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,240
And you can get a kind of visceral version of someone, but there are only so many ways to

643
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,000
smash a guitar on stage.

644
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,200
And so if a hundred people are as good as Jimi Hendrix at Monterey, none of them are.

645
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:42,360
And Jimi Hendrix can he can still smash a guitar on stage, but he can also do a thousand

646
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,600
other things that the Ramones can't do.

647
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,400
And so the metaphor that I've been thinking of lately is almost like granularity or

648
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,520
resolution.

649
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,840
So, you know, if you imagine a photograph of something in low resolution versus high

650
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,040
resolution, it's the same thing that's being expressed.

651
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,000
But the greater the resolution, the more detail there is.

652
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,960
And when someone is making music or singing or writing a poem or doing anything, what

653
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,520
you're essentially they're communicating and what you're getting is you're getting sort of

654
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:27,800
a photo of their brain and the more technical skill they have in this metaphor, the greater

655
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,160
the resolution of that picture they can produce.

656
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,600
And so I once remember being in the studio with Pharrell and Herbie Hancock came by and

657
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,520
Pharrell is a kind of folk musician.

658
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,680
I mean, he's incredibly successful and he's very, very talented, but he's not a trained.

659
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,920
He didn't go to music conservatory.

660
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,760
He can't play you a Bach sonata.

661
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,080
He can write amazing stuff.

662
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,760
He's a theoretical musician, right?

663
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,000
He's a great songwriter and he's got great taste.

664
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,920
And Herbie Hancock came and he was showing us a bunch of piano exercises that he and his

665
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,200
friends used to do in Chicago in the sixties.

666
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,160
And Pharrell kind of expressed that he was scared to learn that stuff because he was

667
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:23,720
worried it would eat into his roughness or his authentic expression.

668
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:30,280
And I remember Herbie Hancock saying it's just going to give you more colors to paint

669
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,120
with. It doesn't cost you anything.

670
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,720
It just it just gives you more things that you can say with those ideas you've got.

671
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,920
And I thought that was a great argument.

672
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,920
You know, I think it was convincing to Pharrell too.

673
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,040
When you were in high school, who do you in retrospect look back and say, you know, those

674
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:54,640
were really those musicians shaped my either my taste or my philosophy or my way of writing

675
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,960
or performing like who just broadly speaking, who were your influences in that regard?

676
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,600
They're a little bit mundane, but they're sort of the obvious suspects.

677
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,280
The Beatles, Bob Marley, Curtis Mayfield.

678
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,400
Those are the big ones.

679
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,240
Stevie Wonder, maybe maybe those four Motown.

680
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,440
You know, all the Holland, Dozier Holland were the three great songwriters who did a lot of the

681
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,120
Motown stuff, a lot of the four top songs, the Temptations songs.

682
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,040
Any James Brown?

683
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,600
Yeah, I like James Brown, but I would put I'm more of a songwriter.

684
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:37,800
And James Brown, I think, is most important as both a performer and as a groove guy.

685
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,960
So, you know, different music is good at different things.

686
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,080
And there's a tradition in black American music that I think ultimately begins in Africa and in

687
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,040
the African diaspora of music that is not really linear.

688
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,040
It's not about a narrative story being told through something like a song.

689
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,880
It's much more about setting a musical mood and almost being a place that you hang out.

690
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,880
Indian music is also like this.

691
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:14,280
If you think about Indian ragas, for example, it's sort of a tonal place and the piece of music

692
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,480
may be half an hour long, it may be two hours long, but you kind of go there and you're just

693
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,120
hanging out there in that vibe.

694
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:29,640
Whereas the sort of music that influenced me much more that I sort of work in is more about

695
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,800
it's again, it's kind of more theoretical.

696
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,160
It's more about a story.

697
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,920
It's a linear story.

698
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,720
It's a three minute song.

699
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,720
There's a beginning, a middle and an end.

700
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:44,600
It has some conventions about the way that it moves through those places.

701
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,560
And people I cited, I think, are emblematic of that style.

702
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,320
Now, you're a drummer.

703
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,120
So what drummer would you have identified with most?

704
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:02,160
I'm sort of now going to double back on what I just said, because the key function of the drums

705
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,840
is most highly expressed in those types of music that are essentially groove musics.

706
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,960
So Clyde Stubblefield, who played with James Brown, is one of my favorite drummers of all time.

707
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,560
That style of music that James Brown made is all about the drummer, you know, give the drummer

708
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:30,400
some and other people who are giants of that format are Bernard Purdy, who's just he's still

709
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,720
around and he's incredible.

710
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,800
I think he claims he's the most recorded drummer of all time or has maybe played on the most hits of any

711
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,840
drummer of all time.

712
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,000
And, you know, then there are great rock drummers like Keith Moon or John Bonham.

713
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,840
In jazz, the drums are much more of a instrument.

714
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:57,200
You can sing through the drums in jazz music because the drummer is not just hitting hard and

715
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,360
fast and loud.

716
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:07,040
The drummer has an incredible dynamic range of tonalities and expressive options.

717
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:14,480
So in jazz drumming, you know, Elvin Jones is probably my favorite, who played a lot with John

718
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,080
Coltrane.

719
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:21,400
But there are an almost unlimited number of incredible jazz drummers who I look up to.

720
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,400
I think in the show notes for this podcast, we should link to some performances that you find

721
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,640
particularly notable.

722
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,560
Oh, that'd be cool.

723
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,040
I remember once you gave me a nice list of stuff for Olivia, which was like, here are some great

724
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,160
Michael Jackson songs.

725
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,560
Here are some great James Brown songs.

726
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,640
Here are some great boom, boom, boom.

727
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,680
And it was like, this is a great way for a kid to start thinking about music.

728
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,120
And I thought that's such a helpful thing to provide.

729
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,080
So, okay, let's go back to LA.

730
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,920
So you get to LA.

731
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,840
You're living the dream, right?

732
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,480
Like it's you've hit a home run here.

733
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,800
It's hard to imagine, given what the denominator is on the number of people that are trying to

734
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,600
accomplish what you guys have accomplished.

735
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:05,000
And are you primarily now still a studio band or are you once you've got this break, are you

736
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,280
becoming kind of more performance based as well?

737
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,240
Well, by that time, the band was just me and my bandmate, Max.

738
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,520
So it was a duo, really.

739
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,360
And we, as we made music, were a studio thing still.

740
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,320
But we quickly realized you were playing.

741
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,920
So you were doing vocals, you were doing drums, and were you keyboard as well?

742
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,080
You know, I was primarily writing the songs with Max and singing them.

743
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,960
And Max in the band was the primary instrumentalist.

744
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,080
He can play pretty much everything and he can learn new instruments in a week.

745
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,080
So Max on the recordings was playing almost all the instruments.

746
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,840
Occasionally we would have studio musicians come in and do stuff that he couldn't do.

747
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,200
You know, if we needed a viola player or something.

748
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,600
But my function in the band was largely to write the songs with him.

749
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,720
I was writing all the lyrics.

750
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,840
I was typically writing the vocal melodies of the songs and then singing them.

751
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,480
So how did Spotify come into the picture?

752
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,360
Was that true, true and unrelated?

753
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,160
Was that just a did Sean start that or how did that?

754
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,440
No.

755
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,320
So let's fast forward a few years.

756
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,680
So we basically, because there's not a lot, I think, that is super interesting about this

757
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,480
period in my life, although you may disagree.

758
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,800
I don't know a period of your life.

759
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,920
Well, this is 2007.

760
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,400
We get our record deal, we move out here and then we spent three years making records and

761
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,480
touring and a lot of stuff happened.

762
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,400
And you toured with Blink at one point, right?

763
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,880
We toured with all sorts of people.

764
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,200
Lady Gaga, Blink 182, Weezer, huge number of really cool artists.

765
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:45,440
And then I concluded that I didn't like touring and it was around that time that I

766
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,640
discovered Spotify.

767
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,720
I think at the time I already had an interest in investing, but I didn't really know which

768
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,800
direction to go.

769
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:59,360
I had met Ashton Kutcher, who became a really good friend and he and I got along, I think

770
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,760
right away because we were both from the Midwest.

771
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,200
We were both artists and we both had an interest in business and technology.

772
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,920
But he was a decade ahead of me in terms of being a famous entertainer.

773
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,120
And he was three or four years ahead of me in terms of thinking that Silicon Valley

774
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,440
venture capital could be an interesting canvas for his artwork.

775
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,800
And so he gave me a little bit of a template for an artist who was going to get into the

776
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,280
technology business.

777
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:38,560
And the question became for me, you know, how do I go from being a musician who neither

778
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,240
has capital nor investing experience and become a professional investor?

779
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,320
And Spotify ended up being in retrospect the pivot that allowed me to do that.

780
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,800
Historically, the music industry has not birthed many good businesses.

781
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,560
And so it was a pretty happy accident that right at this time that I wanted to make this

782
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:07,080
transition, this company that would become now a twenty eight billion dollar public

783
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:13,880
market behemoth was starting to become ubiquitous in Sweden.

784
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,880
And I had friends who knew about it.

785
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:23,080
And when they told me about it, the appeal of that product of this idea that you could

786
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,880
install a thing on your computer and have all of the world's songs ever at your instant

787
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,680
recall was an incredibly cool thing to me.

788
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,040
And I was just thinking of it as the customer, basically.

789
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,920
You know, I was someone who collected tons of music, had hard drives full of it, was

790
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,320
always struggling to manage the data.

791
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,880
You know, I'd get a new computer.

792
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,880
Now I have to copy all the songs and I have to put them in folders.

793
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,040
And I it was such a pain in the ass that when someone showed me this, I thought, whoa,

794
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,680
this is what I've always wanted.

795
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,200
And was Pandora on the scene at that time?

796
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,480
Pandora was really popular.

797
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,440
And it was just streaming.

798
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,920
Pandora was streaming, but it was streaming algorithmic radio.

799
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,360
Right. In other words, you couldn't choose the song.

800
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:10,880
What was so cool about Spotify was that it recreated the experience of having

801
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,400
bought every song ever.

802
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,400
You had MP3s that you'd buy through the iTunes store, for example, and they'd be on your

803
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,040
computer, but maybe you'd bought 200 of them.

804
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,920
That was your library of music.

805
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,840
Whereas when I first saw Spotify, I thought, wow, for $10 a month, it's as if I bought

806
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,280
everything ever.

807
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:38,800
I mean, that was such a shocking value proposition to me that I thought this is almost

808
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,680
certainly what everyone should have if the powers that be allow it.

809
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:51,720
And the business question, which was much more difficult than the product design question,

810
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,200
was can this company get everyone who owns music to be a part of delivering this

811
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,680
experience to the consumer?

812
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,240
And so was the hardest sell with the artists or with the studios?

813
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,120
Everything was a hard sell.

814
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,640
Spotify was I'm not going to take much credit for it because there were thousands of

815
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,920
people working on this from the beginning almost.

816
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,400
But everything about building that business was difficult.

817
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,200
The first thing that was difficult was that record companies and music publishing

818
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,520
companies own the rights to the music.

819
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,160
And they had seen their business destroyed in the 90s.

820
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:35,400
The record industry went to a quarter of its former size in the 90s because of piracy.

821
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,360
And so you'll remember the record labels were suing individual customers.

822
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,200
Is that because CDs had become so ubiquitous that it was easier to copy a CD than say a

823
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,320
vinyl or a cassette?

824
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,360
I mean, not that it's not hard to copy a cassette, but the quality is not as good.

825
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,000
What was coincidental with CD-ROMs?

826
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,560
So two things happened.

827
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:02,280
One, sites like Napster arose that allowed people to trade music freely without paying

828
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:02,640
for it.

829
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,480
And then what they did with that music after they traded it on the Internet, which was so

830
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,080
difficult to control or put a lid on, was then they would burn CDs and copy the CDs and

831
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,440
whatever.

832
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:19,320
So not only did the format of CDs get unlocked with the ability to write CDs.

833
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,640
I mean, you remember getting your first CDR.

834
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,760
That was really cool.

835
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,840
But also you had this unfettered digital environment in which people could share music

836
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,480
without anyone getting paid for it.

837
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:38,440
What preceded this in the 80s and 90s, really in the 90s, was the CD revolution.

838
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:48,120
And so not only was piracy painful in its own right, it succeeded a decade during which the

839
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:54,520
music companies resold the entire history of music in a 10 year period.

840
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:01,920
In other words, they not only sold in the 90s on CDs the new music that was being made in

841
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,040
the 90s, but everything that had been made today.

842
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:10,080
So they sold you an entire library of the world's history of music in a 10 year period.

843
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,000
They were rolling in cash.

844
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:18,200
And when they made new music, they would sign an artist, they'd make one hit song that

845
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:26,160
they'd play on the radio, and then you had to go buy an 1899 album with 14 other songs you

846
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,160
didn't want just to get the one you liked.

847
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:36,160
So they were raking in the cash by completely controlling the consumer's experience.

848
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,000
Piracy blew the lid off that and the consumers rebelled and everyone stopped paying for

849
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,520
music.

850
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:49,240
And so the industry that Spotify came into was one that had been eviscerated by piracy.

851
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:58,840
And then to add insult to injury, the legal paid download model that Steve Jobs pioneered

852
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:07,160
with iTunes unilaterally recaptured the distribution system of what before then had been

853
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:07,880
fragmented.

854
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:14,440
So the record labels used to in the good old days of the 90s both control the radio stations

855
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,440
so they could make things get popular.

856
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:23,720
But then they had a variety of physical retailers, Sam Goody, Virgin Megastore, all these

857
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,600
different CD retailers that they could play off each other.

858
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,400
They had all the leverage.

859
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,080
They could make the thing big and then they could tell you at the record store that you had to

860
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,320
give them this promotion or else your artist wasn't going to show up there and do a CD

861
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,880
signing.

862
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:46,040
Well, when Steve Jobs invented the iTunes store, he became the only retailer that mattered.

863
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,360
And so the record labels had this one-two punch they'd been subjected to of the industry

864
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,520
disappearing and going to a quarter of its size.

865
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,720
And then this one guy who didn't need them, Steve Jobs, who made all his money selling

866
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:06,360
hardware, gaining total unilateral control over them because he became the only place they could

867
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,320
sell music.

868
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,200
And so they were desperate never to let either of these sorts of things happen to them again.

869
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:21,640
They were incredibly paranoid about a new model that they viewed as threatening the paid

870
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,720
download business.

871
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,080
So Spotify was showing up telling consumers for 10 bucks a month you get all the music ever.

872
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,840
The labels at that point were still embedded in a model where what you did was you sold people

873
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,640
downloads for a dollar apiece.

874
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,680
They were used to selling you 10 songs a month for $10.

875
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,840
And Spotify came along and said, let's give them 22 million songs for $10.

876
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,360
So selling the record labels was incredibly difficult.

877
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:55,200
And then the artists were ardently against this as well because for them, their lifeblood was

878
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,480
selling downloads.

879
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,960
They too were in an environment that was severely nutrition restricted from the past

880
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,480
decade.

881
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,760
And they were struggling to make money.

882
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,680
Most of them were only making money touring and recovering a little bit of income selling their

883
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,520
recordings.

884
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,640
Spotify came along and what we said was we're going to fix this problem.

885
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,600
We're going to convince most people in the world that they should pay for music.

886
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,960
And the way we're going to do it is we're going to give them an experience that is every bit as

887
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,120
good as the free illegal experience.

888
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,640
And we're going to get them hooked on it and then we're going to charge them 10 bucks a month.

889
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:42,480
And if we can get a huge percentage of them paying 10 bucks a month, that is far more than the

890
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,880
average consumer at that time was currently spending on music.

891
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,000
I still don't understand the economics of Spotify.

892
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,280
So if you're spending that 10 and by the way, I couldn't just sign up for 10 bucks a month today.

893
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,600
Could I? Aren't those sweetheart?

894
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,680
10 bucks a month.

895
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,160
I thought that was like a student deal or some you can sign up for three dollars a month for the first

896
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,640
three months today and then it'll go to 10 dollars.

897
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,640
I'm ashamed to say I still don't use Spotify.

898
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,120
I still wed to iTunes.

899
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:07,840
You got to get on there.

900
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,000
And I don't know if it's just like the hurdle rate of switching out of iTunes.

901
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,280
But it strikes me as ridiculous because I pay a buck twenty nine per song.

902
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,280
I probably buy an average of 10 to 20 songs a month.

903
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,520
So I'm obviously spending more money than I would.

904
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,640
But let's just talk about the remuneration for the artist.

905
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:30,280
So when I spend a buck twenty nine on iTunes, where does the rent go?

906
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,640
Thirty percent goes to Apple.

907
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,440
Seventy percent goes to the record label.

908
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:42,120
The record label pays out roughly 10 percent of their 70 percent.

909
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,840
So seven percent to the music publisher, which owns the song.

910
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,800
Note that the song, which is called publishing, is different from the recording of the song.

911
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:59,440
So if you and I write Happy Birthday and people sing it all over the world, we own the song no matter who's

912
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,960
singing it. But if Tony Braxton records a version of Happy Birthday, she owns the recording.

913
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,160
The song owner gets about 10 percent of the 70 percent.

914
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:17,200
And the artist will typically get somewhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of what's left after

915
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:26,000
their 15 or 20 percent cut has fully paid back the record label for all the money that label has spent promoting them.

916
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,480
So Apple's getting a straight 30.

917
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,680
That's pretty straightforward of the 70.

918
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,280
The label is getting the majority of it.

919
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,400
The label is getting the majority of it.

920
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,600
And the artist is getting anywhere from zero to maybe 10 percent.

921
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,880
Something like that. Now, that sounds grossly unfair.

922
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:54,160
What makes it less obviously unfair is that the record label is the one taking all of the financial risk in financing the music and very often

923
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,920
paying for the artist's life.

924
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:05,920
So in this economy, they are still the only companies that take a financial risk making original artwork.

925
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,240
And they certainly deserve to be paid for taking that risk.

926
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,600
So how does it work at Spotify?

927
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,240
So now you paid your 10 bucks a month.

928
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,120
How is that rent spread out?

929
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,480
Sure. So what happens is you listen to music all month at the end of the month.

930
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:33,040
Spotify looks at the amount of time that you spent listening to each of those songs and your ten dollars gets split pro rata to the originators of that

931
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,520
music in roughly the same distribution as the 70 percent out of iTunes got split.

932
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,400
Yes. How much does Spotify get to keep of the 10 bucks?

933
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:40,920
30 percent.

934
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,640
OK, so Spotify keeps 30 and the other 70 goes the same way, but now it's pro rata.

935
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,320
Yeah, that's correct.

936
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:59,160
And so for a consumer like you who maybe before Spotify was spending more than 10 dollars a month, it results in less financial benefit than it might have before.

937
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,480
On the other hand, depends how much you listen to those songs.

938
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:10,200
So if on Spotify, you know, if you buy the song on iTunes and you listen to it one time, you're paying a dollar twenty nine for one listen.

939
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:16,760
But a lot of people, when they fall in love with the song, listen to it thousands of times and they listen to it for years.

940
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:24,000
And if you take a dollar twenty nine and split it among thousands, effectively, they're paying very little each listen.

941
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,000
So the paradigm shift is towards a pay for listen model.

942
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,000
It's a consumption based payment.

943
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:39,440
Now, back before any of this stuff came along, if you had a radio station and you played a song, not satellite radio, just straight FM radio, for example.

944
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,360
Did you have to pay a royalty for that?

945
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:50,480
The radio station had an agreement with an organization called a Performing Rights Society.

946
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:56,040
These are societies that manage a particular type of right in music.

947
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:05,400
So if you and I write a song, we and record it, we've just generated a whole basket of different types of legal rights, all of which we begin by owning.

948
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:14,000
And then we can sell those rights off to different third parties that will help us collect the income that attaches to the exploitation of those rights.

949
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:23,080
In the case of songs that get played on the radio or performed at a basketball game or these sorts of things, that right is called a public performance right.

950
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:28,760
And the radio stations do deals with these rights societies in the US.

951
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,080
The two most prominent ones are called ASCAP and BMI.

952
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:39,920
And those organizations are responsible for monetizing that right on behalf of artists.

953
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:52,840
So the radio station at the end of the year will give ASCAP a million dollars and then ASCAP will do something like Spotify does, which is tabulate what that million dollars corresponded to.

954
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,080
And they'll pay out the royalties to artists pro rata in accordance with that.

955
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,240
And Sean Parker was involved with Spotify and with Napster, right?

956
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:01,920
That's right.

957
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,080
So he had kind of a this was this was the evolution of what he and Sean Fanning had done.

958
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:07,880
Yeah, it was.

959
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,920
They had intended Napster to become a legal service.

960
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,560
And what they wanted, you know, 20 years ago was to go do deals with the record labels to legalize it.

961
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:25,120
But the industry was so defensive towards them and so aggressive that it couldn't happen.

962
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:38,000
It took 20 years and it took the industry being decimated for everybody to be desperate enough that they were willing to entertain solutions to the Internet.

963
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,640
And that's what Spotify was.

964
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:46,920
You know, it's interesting when you look at all of the businesses that have been disrupted by the Internet and contrast it with those that have not.

965
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,960
Right. So you've just given us a very eloquent description of how the music industry was disrupted.

966
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,520
But you also pointed out something interesting, which is it wasn't just the Internet that disrupted.

967
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:02,000
It was the desperation that followed the decimation that permitted the restructuring.

968
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,000
Of course, then you can rattle off all the glib and obvious examples, right?

969
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,280
What Amazon has done to retail, what Netflix has done to, you know, blockbuster and, you know, stores on the side of the street,

970
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,400
what Uber has done to taxis, what, you know, all of the travel sites have done to travel agents.

971
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,200
I mean, it's been incredibly disruptive.

972
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:27,200
And yet when I think about medicine, it's like one of the least disrupted industries by technology.

973
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,840
And, you know, you basically still have hospitals eat all the rent.

974
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:36,680
Payers, although most people generally perceive them as bad guys, generally don't get paid that much.

975
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,360
Providers get less and less on a per encounter basis.

976
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:45,760
And it's, you know, overall a pretty much similar system to what it was 20 years ago.

977
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,680
And that's I don't know.

978
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:55,080
I mean, I guess I'd have to think about it, but I can't think of too many industries that are as unchanged in the presence of this revolution as health care.

979
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,480
No, I think you're right.

980
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:02,480
The appeal of investing in health care is exactly what you just expressed.

981
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,600
And that's what drew me into it several years ago.

982
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,880
And what I've learned since then has been slightly disillusioning.

983
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,880
But I'll give you my take on it.

984
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:21,680
The first thing I would say is that health care is still an industry that largely gets paid through labor.

985
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:30,120
So most of the money ultimately goes to labor, goes to doctors, it goes to health care personnel.

986
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,280
The hospitals don't make that much money.

987
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,920
They're not that great a business.

988
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:41,840
You know, if you look at Kaiser, for example, which is an integrated payer provider in California, I think they have a three or four percent.

989
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,840
Gross margin.

990
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,440
It's not a phenomenal business.

991
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,040
The payers, to your point, have very low margins.

992
01:07:49,120 --> 01:08:05,120
They in fact have legally imposed limits on the amount of gross margin that they can generate, which, you know, you can argue about the ethics of the pharmaceutical companies who everyone hates seemingly extract enormous profits.

993
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,760
On the other hand, it's a very competitive industry.

994
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:23,960
And apart from the legalized monopoly given to them via patents on new drugs, they are the only companies, sort of as I said about record labels, they're the only ones who are out here designing new solutions.

995
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,600
And taking an enormous risk.

996
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,800
Taking an enormous risk.

997
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:33,200
And their shareholders are taking that risk now, whether they're being overpaid or underpaid to take that risk is totally debatable.

998
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:43,120
The other thing is that it's unclear where technology can deliver dividends in terms of human health.

999
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:50,880
And so we're thinking about medicine at a moment in which we as a species have already made enormous progress.

1000
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,080
I mean, whatever we've doubled or tripled lifespan.

1001
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,320
And, you know, I mean, you know these numbers better than I do.

1002
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:08,160
But even if you get rid of the infant mortality factor and these other things that distort the numbers, people are living quite a bit longer on average than they were even seemingly 30 years ago.

1003
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:14,480
And that's especially true of affluent societies until they get afflicted by the diseases of affluence.

1004
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:26,320
So where can we get more life from or where can we reduce suffering and disease by way of technology is a little unclear.

1005
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:39,360
There are all sorts of things that we could, of course, do to make hospitals more efficient and to spend less than we do on things like end of life care that maybe aren't a good use of capital.

1006
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,920
But there's not so obviously a Spotify of health care waiting to happen.

1007
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:57,760
It's more like there are a million little IT operating efficiencies that McKinsey consultants will over the next several decades implement in large health organizations.

1008
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:09,360
And then the big promise is around new types of medicine that I think will arise in the biotechnology industry.

1009
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,240
And that's where I'm now spending a lot of my time and attention.

1010
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:26,080
Yeah, it's sort of interesting because I think one of the challenges of health care and I think this was most evident during the debates many years ago, not many, but what I call it eight, ten years ago around the ACA and around complete revisiting a restructuring of health care.

1011
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:34,160
And one of the things I found a little painful in listening to politicians talk about health care was they spoke about it like there was just one problem to be solved.

1012
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:42,840
But the way I sort of think about it is there are at least three completely separate but highly related problems, which is quality of care.

1013
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,640
And that can be broken down into two levels.

1014
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:50,960
You can sort of have it as just keeping people from dying versus like generating alpha.

1015
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,280
So, you know, really improving quality.

1016
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,720
There's cost, which is just the cost to the system.

1017
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:07,240
And about 90 percent of the dollars are basically spent by three entities, the government, the employer and the payer, depending on who's at risk.

1018
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,680
The consumer is on the hook for about 10 percent of that cost.

1019
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,360
So how could you reduce the cost?

1020
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,560
And then the third leg of that stool is access.

1021
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,600
How do you ensure access?

1022
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,840
And so when we talk about technology disrupting health care, it's like, where do you start?

1023
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:29,600
Right. Because, you know, for me, I can see things where technology can be quite helpful on quality of care.

1024
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,960
Not entirely obvious to me how to leverage technology to lower cost.

1025
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,120
People much smarter than me, I'm sure, think about that.

1026
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:41,160
And not entirely clear, at least at a practical level, how it can drive access.

1027
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,760
Although in theory, that should be the first place you'd want to go after leveraging technology.

1028
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:52,440
But I think I'm trying to think about what you said about how Spotify went about it and trying to see is there a parallel there?

1029
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,560
Because the thing with Spotify that was hard was you had multiple constituents, right?

1030
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,200
You have artists, you have labels, you have consumers and they all kind of want something a little different.

1031
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,120
And that speaks of an optimization problem, which is clearly what health care is.

1032
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:14,160
But going on what you said a moment ago, it sounds like today you're a little less encouraged than you would have been four years ago.

1033
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,480
And you're thinking on this problem.

1034
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:36,520
Well, let me try and recapitulate your three legs of the stool in one simple framework, which is something that we should all be aiming for is to generate universal access to the current best available health care that anyone in the world receives.

1035
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:44,640
You know, one of my favorite quotes, I always forget who's quoted is, but venture capitalists talk about it a lot, which is that the future is already here.

1036
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,240
It's just not evenly distributed.

1037
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,360
And I think that's almost always true.

1038
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:55,360
Look at what rich people are doing and assume that in 20 or 30 years, everybody will have that.

1039
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,200
And so what are rich people doing right now?

1040
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:14,080
Well, they're paying doctors like you a lot of money to do very bespoke types of medicine that leverage all sorts of deep biometric analysis of their bodies, a lot of thinking by you and your team.

1041
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:33,880
And a lot of spend on the usage of what are currently expensive machines, MRI machines to do preventative screening for tumors every year, things like this that if you're really rich, you know, you might as well go get an MRI every year, get a full body MRI every year.

1042
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,600
I mean, just see if there's anything going on.

1043
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,280
Why not?

1044
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:53,560
And so what stands between today and orphans in Somalia receiving that level of care and what stands in the way I think is to some degree, a level of technological leverage.

1045
01:13:54,160 --> 01:14:11,480
What is happening in your head when you look at a patient's blood tests and try to gel that with your biophysiological mental models is something that I believe computers will be able to do in the future.

1046
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:24,280
And so right now we use physicians for thinking and for bedside manner and for guidance.

1047
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:37,680
And then we use some physicians like surgeons for physical procedures that they're essentially athletes at, you know, you want high performing athletes who don't mess up, who are very precise, who've done it a million times.

1048
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:49,080
Well, the roboticization of physical medicine like surgery is something that I believe will just continue to get better and better.

1049
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,280
It may take longer.

1050
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:56,880
It may not be replaceable immediately, but that will, you know, we will be primarily doing robotic surgeries 100 years from now.

1051
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:13,680
The cognitive work that physicians do will, I believe, largely be replaced by computational systems that can leverage the same types of theoretical frameworks that our minds are utilizing to make good decisions.

1052
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:22,480
And what you're left with is all the touchy feely personal stuff that you as a physician and any other physician knows really matters.

1053
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,780
It's not superficial.

1054
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:48,180
The ability to help someone make good decisions about their own health, to make someone care about their physical health, to help them navigate difficult decisions that aren't straightforward that involve trade-offs are the sort of things that physicians right now don't have the time to do that they did when they were taking their medicine bag around to people's houses and hanging out for a couple hours.

1055
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:58,980
And so in a certain way, we may go back to an older style of medicine, but the people who do that may look more like highly skilled nurses than like physicians.

1056
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:16,680
So I believe that what you'll see is globally a lot more technology involved in the deployment of medicine and a shift in the composition of the labor market around medicine towards something that looks more like a large population of highly skilled nurses.

1057
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:27,480
Fewer overpaid or appropriately paid, but maybe overtrained physicians that right now are very scarce that only rich people can access.

1058
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,380
And then most excitingly, you're going to see a lot of new medicine.

1059
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,680
That's the stuff I'm focused on now as an investor.

1060
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:39,080
And that's the stuff that I think is going to be the most game changing.

1061
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,480
That's the stuff that's going to buy us years of additional life.

1062
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:51,780
So when did you make that transition where you sort of your big foray into this was obviously Spotify as far as like transition one.

1063
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:58,280
So DA 2.0 to DA 3.0 and then DA 4.0 doing the investing.

1064
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,180
So the biotech stuff specifically, when did you make that transition?

1065
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:05,180
Well, I'm still making it because it's a hard transition to make.

1066
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:09,980
And there's been so much that I've already had to learn and so much more that I have yet to learn.

1067
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:31,980
I think the starting point was this realization that what mattered most in healthcare as a capital allocator, meaning the most useful place that I could help direct money was to what goes through the pipes of the healthcare system as opposed to the healthcare system itself.

1068
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:41,780
The healthcare system in America for the reasons we've just discussed is a creaky old infrastructure.

1069
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:49,280
And it's important to fix it just like it's important to fix the government or the broken bridges that we have all over the country.

1070
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,580
But it's not the most interesting thing to do.

1071
01:17:53,180 --> 01:18:04,380
And it also doesn't have a global impact because fixing the US healthcare system doesn't do a lot for folks in Sudan or in Saudi Arabia or in Japan or anywhere else.

1072
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:13,380
You're just dealing with a human system where what's broken are the human structures that we've constructed to deliver the thing.

1073
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:19,180
So that was my starting point was realizing that the medicine itself was the thing that mattered more.

1074
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:30,580
And ultimately, despite all of the valuable things that physicians do, the biggest game changers in human health in the past 50 years have been pills.

1075
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:43,380
They've been pills that very brilliant people invent and that we can give to people through any number of channels and that actually fix the problem sometimes.

1076
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:58,580
And we're moving into an era of medicine that people call preventative medicine or precision medicine or whatever you want that really boils down to addressing illness at the level of mechanism.

1077
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:16,180
Understanding that diseases have a functional concrete explanation and that we can develop interventions that actually fix what's broken in a very precise way and without a lot of collateral damage.

1078
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:23,780
And our ability to do that better and better is what's going to give people much more health in the future.

1079
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:28,780
And we're in inning two or one of that journey.

1080
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:39,780
So as an investor, there couldn't be a more exciting place to hang out and the advances that we're making on a monthly or yearly basis are staggering.

1081
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:55,380
So when I noticed that that was happening in the world, it just became clear to me that this was not only an exciting and interesting place to be, but also one that could be enormously profitable both financially and in terms of the benefit to humanity that delivered.

1082
01:19:55,380 --> 01:20:01,380
What got you interested in the problem of living longer personally?

1083
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:14,980
Well, I guess I am not primarily preoccupied with living longer or with longevity as I am with the reduction of suffering that already exists.

1084
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:30,980
And so people who are really obsessed with longevity, maybe you are one of them, will make the argument that death is the great tragedy of human life and that we basically don't realize it's so bad because we take it for granted and can't see any other way.

1085
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,980
And I think that's an alternative.

1086
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:43,980
That may be right, but I also think there's a lot of evidence in nature that death and the turnover of populations has some utility.

1087
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:52,980
Steve Jobs talked about famously that this is nature's way of clearing out the old ideas and bringing in new ones and creating urgency and creating urgency.

1088
01:20:52,980 --> 01:21:08,580
I just think that there are enough people dying obviously prematurely from things that should be preventable and there are lots of people dying in the second half of their life or suffering from things that should be preventable that we should start by focusing on those things.

1089
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:34,180
Now, it may be the case that longevity is the skeleton key to all of those problems, that the number one risk factor for all diseases is age and that if we could just figure out what's happening with aging, then we could get out in front of all these other diseases as it was said in the last video.

1090
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:50,580
So what are you most passionate about right now? Not necessarily from the investment thesis perspective but from the technology or promise that the idea holds up.

1091
01:21:50,580 --> 01:22:02,580
Well, the holy grail for me is approaching what I think of as a singularity-like moment in the world.

1092
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:08,580
People throw around the term singularity mean all sorts of things but I actually believe it's useful.

1093
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,580
Who coined it?

1094
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:26,580
You know, it may have been Kurzweil, Ray Kurzweil, or I'm not sure, or it may have been some of those old cybernetics dudes like Robert Boehner.

1095
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:30,580
I first heard it from Ray's work, I don't know enough.

1096
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,580
Why don't you explain briefly how he's referring to it?

1097
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:44,580
Well, I think Ray Kurzweil is referring to the singularity as this moment when human minds merge with machines.

1098
01:22:44,580 --> 01:23:00,580
And so we, for example, download our brains into computers and then are effectively immortalized because our consciousness exists now in a digital format.

1099
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:04,580
That's not the singularity I'm talking about.

1100
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:16,580
But the concept of a singularity is that this is a moment at which sort of everything changes and there's an almost infinite acceleration in our capacity to do something.

1101
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:36,580
The singularity that I envision in our understanding of biomedicine is the moment at which we can digitally represent complex biology and therefore study it at zero marginal cost.

1102
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:48,580
So let me explain this right now. What we essentially do in biology and what medicine has always tried to do is understand how the machine of a living system works.

1103
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:56,580
And in the work you do on metabolism, for example, the ways that we try to represent how the machine works are incredibly complicated.

1104
01:23:56,580 --> 01:24:04,580
There are these flow charts with all these arrows and pictures and this connects to this and this connects to these 10 things.

1105
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:10,580
And if you pull this lever, these four things happen. And how do we even make sense of that?

1106
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:25,580
A way station to the singularity I'm talking about is the field of so-called systems biology in which what people do is they observe these biological systems and then they try to translate the mechanistic of the system.

1107
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:54,580
And then they try to translate the mechanistic connections that they have uncovered into code, into formal representations, into a formal language that captures how something works in a way that a computer can understand and in a way that is unambiguous and not sort of stifled by the inherent ambiguity of human language, by which we describe a lot of these things in everyday life.

1108
01:24:54,580 --> 01:25:06,580
And ultimately, systems biology, I think, will allow us to simulate biological systems in their full, glorious complexity.

1109
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:12,580
And when we can do that, which we might be 20 years away from or we might be a thousand years away from, I don't know.

1110
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:23,580
But once we can do that, then we can effectively run intervention-based experiments on digital systems at zero cost.

1111
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:33,580
And that would be the moment at which we will start to understand biology and the ways that we can intervene in it at an extraordinary rate.

1112
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:42,580
Until then, unfortunately, we have to do tests on humans or mice or dogs or monkeys.

1113
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:46,580
And unfortunately, we can only learn one thing at a time that way.

1114
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:51,580
We do controlled experiments where we hold everything constant except one variable.

1115
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:55,580
And in so doing, we try to understand how that variable works.

1116
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:58,580
And this is a very slow way of learning.

1117
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:00,580
And it's a very expensive way of learning.

1118
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:21,580
And although the people who participate in clinical trials are heroes to whom we owe most of our medicine, clinical trials are a brutal form of learning that cause many people to die from experimental medicines or that cause many people to endure enormous suffering without any benefit.

1119
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:30,580
And so that's the thing I'm most excited about, getting to that singularity of digitally representing complex biology.

1120
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:38,580
Most of the things that I'm focused on as an investor, I view as somehow being stepping stones towards that singularity.

1121
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:45,580
If you look at other fields that could benefit from the ability to do digital experiments, consider macroeconomics.

1122
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:50,580
Wouldn't macroeconomics be even more complicated than biology?

1123
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:54,580
In other words, this sounds like the hardest problem I've ever heard of.

1124
01:26:54,580 --> 01:27:08,580
All of these systems people put in the same bucket of complex adaptive systems, kind of ground zero for studying these things is the Santa Fe Institute, an organization in which I'm involved and I'm very passionate about.

1125
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:14,580
And part of the reason I'm passionate about all of these types of systems is because they share certain characteristics.

1126
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:20,580
So in a kind of vague way, they're all complex in just the colloquial sense.

1127
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:23,580
Like they're really complicated. There are a lot of moving parts.

1128
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:33,580
But it may turn out that we can come up with theories that actually describe all of these types of systems.

1129
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:46,580
So there's some sense in which these problems of economies and the weather and physiological systems are all kind of similar.

1130
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:55,580
And we may be able to come up with theories that are predictive that help us make predictions about these different types of systems.

1131
01:27:56,580 --> 01:28:02,580
So that's a kind of intellectual promise land that I think is worth chasing.

1132
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:10,580
Whether or not it's going to happen or not, I think even trying for those sorts of theories is going to generate useful information.

1133
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:15,580
Whether we'll be able to simulate these things or not is sort of an open theoretical question.

1134
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:26,580
But I'm optimistic about it because it seems like it's the logical endpoint of all of our digital technologies to create digital representations of reality.

1135
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:36,580
And on the one hand, reality is really complex. But on the other, it seems to be driven at the bottom from relatively simple theories.

1136
01:28:37,580 --> 01:29:00,580
And so to the extent that the laws of physics are ubiquitous and are driving everything from the bottom up and that everything that happens subsequent to the laws of physics are these emergent phenomena, it's not clear to me that we won't come up with simple parsimonious descriptions of these types of systems.

1137
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:09,580
And the physics of the universe before Newton probably also appeared intractably chaotic.

1138
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:25,580
So the way that anything looks to us before we understand it is, I think, pretty imposing, which is why when we have breakthroughs, they feel almost like this enormous relief because something that seemed really complicated becomes really simple.

1139
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:33,580
Yeah. I mean, the obvious example would be the coding of the human genome, which is now approaching 20 years in its anniversary.

1140
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:45,580
Do you feel that that discovery has underperformed, overperformed, or met expectations on what we would have thought prior to that codification?

1141
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:57,580
The pithy aphorism that I think applies to genomics and a lot of things in technology is that it's probably short-term overestimated and long-term underestimated.

1142
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:14,580
So certainly, when the Human Genome Project reached its initial milestones in Craig Venter's genome being sequenced, there was an extreme optimism that was unjustified that now that we've cracked this code, we're going to figure out everything.

1143
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:22,580
In five or ten years, clearly that has not happened. And so to that extent, those predictions have failed.

1144
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:43,580
On the other hand, the sequencing technology that underwrote that is now being used to sequence mRNA, to sequence methylation of the genome, to sequence neoantigens in cancer patients' tumors.

1145
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:52,580
This has become an extraordinarily useful set of tools for reading all kinds of biology.

1146
01:30:52,580 --> 01:31:12,580
And so long-term, I believe the impact of the human genome and our understanding of it is almost impossible to overstate because it represents a basic part of a toolkit that is now integral to everything at the core.

1147
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:18,580
Yeah, so in other words, the tool might actually be more valuable than the initial application.

1148
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:27,580
Absolutely. But the only way that people were able to justify pain for that tool was in this…

1149
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,580
In the hope.

1150
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:41,580
In the hope. That's what I say about Bitcoin and stuff, by the way, as well, because this is now part of my theory of technology, which is that you take something like Bitcoin and all these blockchains and all of this.

1151
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:48,580
I was an early investor in this company, Ripple, about six years ago now. And so I've been interested in all of this for years.

1152
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:55,580
But I don't take the view that there's any end point I predict and know with any level of confidence.

1153
01:31:55,580 --> 01:32:10,580
All I can tell you is that having the smartest computer science 19-year-olds in the world in mass shift their attention to an area of technology is going to produce something.

1154
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:17,580
So whether Bitcoin becomes a replacement for the United States dollar is almost irrelevant.

1155
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:23,580
What I'm interested in is what's going to happen now that millions of people are working on this thing.

1156
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:29,580
Similarly, the Human Genome Project was this kind of catalyzing event. It's very vivid.

1157
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:33,580
Bill Clinton had a press conference with Craig Venter and it got everyone excited.

1158
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:47,580
And that sort of moment is what inspires a lot of 18-year-olds or a lot of 15-year-olds to go into molecular biology undergraduate programs and then to become genetics researchers.

1159
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:54,580
And so this is how history happens. And a lot of things have already come out of genomics and will continue to.

1160
01:32:54,580 --> 01:33:01,580
Have you been paying a lot of attention? I mean, you alluded to it a moment ago, but have you just on a personal level been paying a lot of attention to the liquid biopsy space?

1161
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:05,580
A lot. Yeah. I've been following the liquid biopsy space now for about four years.

1162
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:10,580
Yeah. You and I spoke about this a couple of years ago and I wasn't sure how much you'd still been into it.

1163
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:22,580
This is something that's very interesting to me. You know, one of the things I talk about with patients is even with my most best attempts at providing the most bespoke insights into how to prevent diseases.

1164
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:35,580
When you take a big step back and say, let's look at the three main diseases that are going to kill most people in a civilized society where you're basically taking care of the blocking and tackling that you've alluded to earlier.

1165
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:39,580
It's atherosclerotic diseases, it's cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

1166
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:46,580
And my personal viewpoint is that the atherosclerotic diseases and the neurodegenerative diseases, we have much more insight into how to prevent.

1167
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:55,580
Cancer is tough. And I sort of explained to people when you look at a blood test and let's talk about the best blood test money can buy.

1168
01:33:55,580 --> 01:34:08,580
It's probably offering you 70 to 80 percent of your predictive value on the atherosclerotic side, probably offering you 60 to 70 percent of your predictive value on the neurodegenerative side.

1169
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:17,580
It probably isn't offering you even 30 percent of insight on cancer because, of course, the mutations that kill are somatic, not germline.

1170
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:23,580
So we're not measuring those. We don't have great assays for measuring adoptive immune cell function.

1171
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:28,580
We can measure innate immunity, but that's so crude and it's irrelevant in cancer.

1172
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:46,580
And so we talk about something else you alluded to, which is how aggressive can we be in screening whilst solving for or optimizing around minimizing physical harm and emotional harm, physical harm from the actual screening tool, emotional harm from risk of false positives, because the harder you look, the more you'll find.

1173
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:53,580
And the open, gaping open hole in this is we can't do a liquid biopsy.

1174
01:34:53,580 --> 01:35:01,580
So we got interested in this together, you and I mutually, around this enox two protein, which was quite interesting.

1175
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:05,580
But unfortunately, that company, that technology doesn't really seem to exist right now.

1176
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,580
It also had a number of issues with it. But basically, it was a Western blot. It was a protein assay.

1177
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:13,580
They were looking at a protein, this enox two protein.

1178
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:27,580
And the belief was that that protein was found exclusively on malignant cells and could only be shed off not just cancer cells, but cancer cells that had the potential to spread and attach to other cells.

1179
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:34,580
Now, a company that we both know pretty well, GRAIL, is taking a different approach that seems slightly more logical. Tell us a little bit about GRAIL.

1180
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:43,580
GRAIL is an interesting company. It's a spin out of Illumina, which is the behemoth genome sequencing business.

1181
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:58,580
They make all the machines that do sequencing that most people use. And the premise of GRAIL is that by sequencing peripheral blood, you can find all sorts of cellular refuse from somatic tissues.

1182
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:08,580
And that this refuse, if you are able to amplify it, will tell you about the cells that it's coming from.

1183
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:23,580
And so one of the proofs of principle of this concept in general was noninvasive prenatal screening. Pregnant women have in their blood, I think, potentially 10% of their peripheral blood is actually coming from the fetus.

1184
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:38,580
And so you can detect a lot of things about the fetus by looking at the mother's peripheral blood. And in that case, maybe what you need to effectively do is separate the 10% from the 90% in order to look at it.

1185
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:52,580
When you're talking about early cancers, you might be dealing with sub half percent or sub 10th of a percent concentrations of tumor DNA that are showing up in the blood.

1186
01:36:52,580 --> 01:37:07,580
And so the premise of GRAIL is that if you sequence the blood with enough depth, meaning you sequence it over and over and over again, you can detect just that DNA that's coming from the tumor.

1187
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:18,580
And by doing so, you can identify things about it that give you a guide to where the tumor is and what its genetic characteristics are.

1188
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:28,580
And this is much harder than what you just said a moment ago because the problem you described earlier has two things going for it, which is one, you've got much more of it there.

1189
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:40,580
Let's just assume the number is 10%. But the other thing is half of that DNA is foreign. 50% of that DNA is from the father, 50% is from the mother. So you have half foreign greater quantity.

1190
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:50,580
If you have colon cancer and we are lucky enough to get the RNA or DNA of that colon cancer, it might have 20 mutated genes. It's effectively self DNA.

1191
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,580
Well, it is self DNA.

1192
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:53,580
Exactly.

1193
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,580
But it's maybe tumor DNA.

1194
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,580
It's tumor DNA.

1195
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:56,580
Which is still a self tumor.

1196
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:03,580
Yeah, exactly. So I mean, that's a double whammy. It's not just a needle in a haystack. It's like a needle of hay in a haystack.

1197
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,580
That's correct. And it's also difficult because...

1198
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,580
I just came up with that, by the way. I'm really proud.

1199
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,580
That's the first smart thing I think I've ever said.

1200
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:11,580
The needle of hay in the haystack.

1201
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:12,580
I like that.

1202
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:13,580
You can use that as much as you want.

1203
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:24,580
I will. I'm going to start right now. When you're looking for that needle of hay in the haystack, the premise of your search has to be that you know what you're looking for.

1204
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:46,580
In other words, you have to identify a series of potential oncogenes in which you're seeking aberrant genetic variants that would indicate the gene has essentially been co-opted by the disease and is now working for the cancer as opposed to working for you who want to defeat the cancer.

1205
01:38:46,580 --> 01:39:04,580
And there are so many different ways that this technology is going to be difficult. That is matched by billions of dollars that people are investing in this because solving this problem is, as the company's name suggests, sort of a grail.

1206
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:09,580
I'm not an investor in grail, but I've looked at them. And I've also looked at many of their competitors.

1207
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:22,580
There's another approach that's really cool that I'm investing in right now. A company out of Boston called Glimpse is a business that was founded by Sangeeta Bhatia, who's an extraordinary researcher at MIT.

1208
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:32,580
Sangeeta is a hepatologist, but a bioengineer whose work has uncovered two really interesting ideas that I think are useful in cancer screening.

1209
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:46,580
One is that when cancer is setting up shop in a tissue, it remodels the micro environment so as to build defenses for itself against the immune system and against the other physiological processes that would stand in its way.

1210
01:39:46,580 --> 01:40:01,580
And it turns out that there are in the human genome 550 different endoproteases that are in some combination utilized in the remodeling of tissues in different processes.

1211
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:13,580
So they're used primarily in healthy processes. But when cancers are beginning, these proteins get recruited or these enzymes get recruited rather to do this remodeling work.

1212
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:37,580
They're sort of the construction workers of the disease as it gets set up. And Sangeeta's work and the work of several other researchers that she's leveraging has identified what proteases tend to be implicated in the early formation of different diseases ranging from fatty liver disease to liver cancer to lung cancer and a set of others.

1213
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:59,580
And if you can, it turns out, identify 10 or 15 enzymes that you basically only see upregulated enormously when a particular disease is beginning, then there's another way of detecting it that Sangeeta is working on, which is to engineer nanoparticles that you send into the body.

1214
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:10,580
She calls them a synthetic biomarker. You let them circulate and you design them such that they break apart if they encounter those enzymes.

1215
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:18,580
And when they break apart, they fragment into smaller nanoparticles that can be detected in the urine.

1216
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:34,580
So Sangeeta's approach is rather than look for these trace amounts of refuse in the blood, why not send essentially a team, a SWAT team into the body to circulate and hunt for a thing?

1217
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:43,580
And if that SWAT team finds the thing, get a much larger signal in the urine. I think that's a very elegant approach.

1218
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,580
Will that have tissue specificity?

1219
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:57,580
It'll have tissue specificity to the extent that the disease you're looking for has a different enzymatic signature when it's in different tissues.

1220
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:14,580
Got it. So in the context of, let's say you get the signal and you would have to believe then that you're going to have different enzymatic pathways in the mesenchymal system of colon cancer versus lung cancer.

1221
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:29,580
I see. So it's not, you know, when you were saying this, I wasn't, I'm not familiar with the glimpse. So I was, I was wondering if what you're going to say was it got taken up in residence and then you basically would do, you know, it was labeled with gadolinium or something and you do an MRI and you'd say, well, hey, this stuff is being broken apart in the lung.

1222
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:35,580
Therefore, that's where we want to look. But that's not what you're saying. No, this is all happening in the periphery in the blood itself.

1223
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:47,580
The breakup of the nanoparticles is occurring at the site of the disease, but the refuse from that interaction is going through the kidneys and into the urine.

1224
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:54,580
It would be interesting if there was a way to see if there's a way to capture the local signature at the tissue site of origin.

1225
01:42:54,580 --> 01:43:05,580
There may in fact be ways to do this and there are several nanoparticle based approaches that follow the lines that you described where it's an imaging agent that is meant to bind specifically to the tissue.

1226
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:19,580
What's cool about this though is you don't need to target. You just use the circulatory system to get these things everywhere. And if they detect the thing that you're probing, they change. And that's what you measure.

1227
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:29,580
I think this is a really clever workaround for some of the problems that I think have been bedeviling liquid biopsy. But I do think liquid biopsy will probably work.

1228
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:35,580
And the other reason it may work, and there's a company called Freenome, for instance, that's taking a different angle on it.

1229
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:49,580
Freenome's approach is don't look for the tumor DNA in the blood. Look at the entire genome and see if there is any sort of smoke from the fire.

1230
01:43:49,580 --> 01:44:00,580
If the cancer is the fire, try to detect the body's systemic response to the cancer and recognize that as aberrant.

1231
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:10,580
In other words, even if the cancer itself is sending off a very small signal, maybe the systemic response to it is a much larger signal and you can detect that.

1232
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:20,580
So people are going to try and get after this in many different ways. My prediction is that within a decade, we'll have one or more of these that work quite reliably.

1233
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:32,580
And each of us will, at our annual physical, have a routine blood test that is pretty good at detecting cancer. Now, that begets another problem that people have raised, which is, you know, what if we're all getting cancer all the time?

1234
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:46,580
And most of the time, the immune system is disposing of it in short order. If that's happening, then we'll have another problem to solve, which is how do we know when we should treat people who are detected early versus when shouldn't we?

1235
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:52,580
But that's fine. Problems create solutions which create more problems. And that's what we do.

1236
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:59,580
You know, that's the problem that I probably worry about the most. I mean, I guess the second most. The problem I worry about the most is can we crack this?

1237
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:13,580
But that problem I got this glimpse into with all the deep dive I did into Oncoblot three years ago, which was I was asked by a company that was interested in acquiring them to help with the due diligence.

1238
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:36,580
I actually thought it was complete buffoonery, total quackery, complete and utter nonsense. But after about a year and a half, I thought there really was something there that unfortunately had been sort of bastardized by unsavory characters that were involved in basically creating kind of a profit center around selling alternative products that were complete nonsense.

1239
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:47,580
But when we did our own analyses on raw data that they gave us, we saw something pretty interesting. There's two questions you have to ask when you're doing this.

1240
01:45:48,580 --> 01:46:05,580
The first is, and rather than describe them in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive value, just describing this stuff in English, you want to understand something, which is if you do a blood test on a person and it comes back and says nothing, how confident are you that they have nothing?

1241
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:18,580
That's the concept of negative predictive value. And then conversely, if the test comes back and says you have something, how confident can you be that you have something? That's the idea of positive predictive value.

1242
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:31,580
Now, if you look at how OncoBlot was created and you look at how the FDA gave it a type of approval, which is not an FDA approval, but there's, you know, and I don't want to get into the weeds on that stuff.

1243
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:46,580
But basically it was approved, quote unquote, only for patients presenting with metastatic cancer of it with an unknown primary because of its remarkable ability to create a differentiation around 27 different types of tissue.

1244
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:56,580
So someone shows up with a lung nodule that's not lung cancer. It's actually important to know is that breast? Is it thyroid? Is it what? Because they could have a primary that's occult, but it's still metastatic cancer.

1245
01:46:56,580 --> 01:47:15,580
And this is a life and death decision as to how to treat it. And that's where OncoBlot was actually very useful. And so OncoBlot became really, really good. If someone had cancer and you did a blood test on them, you had about 99.4% likelihood of correctly guessing, not just that they had cancer, but what kind of cancer it was.

1246
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:24,580
But the flip side is really important, which is if you take a whole bunch of people that don't have cancer and you can only do this out of a blood bank prospectively, you can't even do this in the population.

1247
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:33,580
What's the likelihood that you're not going to be over calling cancer? And when we did an analysis and it was not a huge analysis, we were limited by the amount of data we had.

1248
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:55,580
What we saw was by about 5x, it overestimated the prevalence of cancer at a given age for a given histology. And our interpretation of that was either this is categorically useless or it's picking up a bunch of cancers that don't go on to become cancers.

1249
01:47:55,580 --> 01:48:08,580
They get winnowed out by the immune system, which is exactly what you just described. And that raises a very difficult question as a physician, as a patient, which is what do you do if it's your annual physical?

1250
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:18,580
Now, sometimes you'll get lucky, right? What's getting lucky? Getting lucky is it says you have colon cancer and you can go into a colonoscopy, which is a great way to assess that.

1251
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:34,580
It's not a great way though if a colonoscopy costs the system $3,000 or $4,000 and you now are giving people a thousand times more colonoscopies than we're giving today because we've got some screening test that suggests this.

1252
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:44,580
I'm reading right now a phenomenal book that everyone listening to the podcast and you should read the book of why by Judea Pearl or Udaya Pearl, who's a professor at UCLA.

1253
01:48:45,580 --> 01:49:03,580
And his area is causal inference. And he goes through in the book some of the fascinating math that corresponds with diagnostics in particular. And frankly, I'm always confused by sensitivity and specificity measurements and which is the inverse of which.

1254
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:05,580
Do you want me to send you my primer on this?

1255
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,580
Please send me it.

1256
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:09,580
We've put so much work into this. It's our favorite topic.

1257
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:21,580
I believe I understand it now, but for your listeners, I'll just from the book give you one example of it and the conditional probabilities that express it.

1258
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:30,580
People will probably remember a few years ago, the guidelines on mammography changed to suggest that women, I think what under 40 should not get mammograms as a screen.

1259
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:43,580
And I was always a little bit skeptical of that conclusion because there's a certain intuitive way in which you think, well, if it gives you a false positive kind of who cares because just go get a CT, whatever.

1260
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:56,580
You know, I mean, what's obviously don't go get your breast cut off. But if all the cost is to a woman is that she goes and gets another test, maybe that's not good for the system from a cost standpoint.

1261
01:49:56,580 --> 01:50:07,580
But if you're the patient, you certainly don't want to not get screened if you do have breast cancer. And so Pearl, though, in his book, walks through the actual statistics of this.

1262
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:20,580
So if the incidence of breast cancer in the wild population is one in 700, that means that out of 4000 women, say five of them would have breast cancer is what you'd expect.

1263
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:33,580
If the sensitivity of the test is 73%, which sounds high, that means it's deplorable. That still means, which is what the sensitivity is of a mammogram, 73%.

1264
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:44,580
It means that if you get a positive test result, you still have a sub 1% chance of having breast cancer.

1265
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:56,580
Now, Bayesian statistics adds another level of level of complication to this in that Bayesian statistics gives us a way of updating probability estimates that we make.

1266
01:50:56,580 --> 01:51:09,580
And so there's a difference between you being a member of the random population and you being a woman who, say, has a BRCA mutation that radically increases your chances of getting breast cancer.

1267
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:27,580
And so if you are someone who, say, has a 50% chance of getting breast cancer in your life, then a positive mammogram gives you a much, much higher likelihood because it effectively updates your estimate that you began with of your likelihood of getting the disease.

1268
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:38,580
And so what we probably end up with in any of these tests is a way of stratifying populations based on their genetic risk of getting different diseases.

1269
01:51:38,580 --> 01:52:04,580
And it's only within each of those cohorts of relative risk that we can consider the importance or usefulness of a screening test like a liquid biopsy because its utility to each person depends upon the extent to which that person is already at risk of the disease you're surveilling.

1270
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:15,580
Yeah, the other thing I add to that is the way we think about this problem clinically is if I gave you a piece of Swiss cheese and I said, how many pencils could you drop through here? It's a lot.

1271
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:24,580
But what if I put four pieces of Swiss cheese on top of each other and rearrange them in such a way that one and only one whole could accept the pencil?

1272
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:37,580
And so where I see the real application of the liquid biopsy is as follows. So let's use the mammography example. So mammograms are good for some things and bad for some things.

1273
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:45,580
And let's ignore cost because I think once you layer cost into this, it becomes way too complicated a problem. So it's highly relevant.

1274
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:51,580
But as a physician, I'm trying to solve the problem of the patient, not society. That's my cop out.

1275
01:52:51,580 --> 01:53:01,580
So then it becomes a question of is the radiation significant? And the radiation mammography is trivial. MBI, of course, which is a more elaborate type of mammogram has very high radiation, but we almost never do that anymore.

1276
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:12,580
So now we've taken away physical harm and we've decided to just discount cost. Well, mammography is good for seeing calcified lesions, but it's not good for seeing non calcified lesions.

1277
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:23,580
Conversely, MRI won't pick up a calcified lesion. But if you're using something called diffusion weighted imaging, it's infinitely better for picking up pretty much everything else.

1278
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:32,580
So then the question becomes what happens if you layer the mammogram with the DWI MRI with the liquid biopsy? Those are three pieces of Swiss cheese.

1279
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:49,580
And then the fourth layer would be the Bayesian piece, which is what is the woman's probabilistic likelihood of breast cancer based on her family history, known mutations and known mutations of unknown clinical significance, which is basically the types of mutations we have.

1280
01:53:49,580 --> 01:54:00,580
And now all of a sudden you've got a much smarter way to think about it. So my only take on this one is if and when the liquid biopsies become viable, I don't think they should ever be leading candidates.

1281
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:12,580
I think they should only be used as confirmation. So once you do, you know, X, Y and Z, you then come back. So, for example, if you do, you know, you go and get a whole body MRI and there's a little shadow in the pancreas.

1282
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:21,580
Well, what's the next step there? That's a big step. Are we going to submit that patient to an ERCP or a biopsy of that? That's the real deal.

1283
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:36,580
Well, I think you're right to some degree, but I would push back to lead with it. You'd still think against the a priori assumption that we wouldn't lead with it because that does really hinge on sensitivity and specificity.

1284
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:50,580
You know, I mean, if we have ninety nine percent specific sensitive and one hundred percent specific liquid biopsies over what time frame, though, that's see, I think that that's the challenge with the liquid biopsy is you're right.

1285
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:55,580
I mean, technically, there's no test that can have one hundred percent specificity, one hundred percent sensitivity.

1286
01:54:55,580 --> 01:55:00,580
That's sort of like having a rock receiver operating characteristic curve that's a square. No such thing exists.

1287
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:15,580
What I think is you take something where you can can you generate a liquid biopsy that has one hundred percent sensitivity, even if specificity is only ninety five percent, which a lot of people think is great, but ninety five percent.

1288
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:29,580
No, I actually think you want the inverse. I think you never want false negatives. In other words, you want a hundred percent specificity. You never want to talk. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I misspoke. You want you want negative predictive value to be a hundred percent.

1289
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:39,580
You never want someone who has cancer to be told they don't have cancer. You can tolerate some people who don't have cancer being told that they do. That's right. The other dimension here.

1290
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:47,580
I mean, I know we put cost aside, but you can't really because the question is, what are the relative costs of these different surveillance measures?

1291
01:55:47,580 --> 01:56:02,580
If liquid biopsies are trivially inexpensive, which is the goal, say this glimpse test, you know, I forget all the health economics of it. Just the cost of doing it might be five or ten dollars or twenty dollars or something.

1292
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:16,580
If the sensitivity and specificity are both high enough, then of course you would rather use them as a universal screen and then follow up with much more expensive interventions.

1293
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:31,580
Yeah. And with things like fecal occult blood testing or fecal DNA as a precursor to colonoscopy, it makes tons of sense because we have a pretty well understood pathway for the tumor.

1294
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:45,580
Again, not having an answer to this dilemma, my big concern with everybody shows up and Willie Nilly gets a liquid biopsy that shows you've got pancreatic cancer is what do you do next?

1295
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:55,580
Well, that's a question of sensitivity. Yeah. So you go and you get the MRI and the MRI shows nothing. To me, that's a great outcome. That's the best outcome is the MRI shows nothing.

1296
01:56:55,580 --> 01:57:18,580
And if the test is vetted and you're positive and you can be confident that that was not a false positive, but rather it's a preclinical tumor, then you're in a pathway of what's the righteous path of surveillance going forward and equally important, if not more important is what steps can the patient take in that moment to ward this thing off, to aid their immune system.

1297
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:29,580
Is that something as quote unquote simple as you got to sleep more, give your immune system a boost, figure out ways to de-stress yourself, which of course is pretty hard given that I just told you you have pancreatic cancer.

1298
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:38,580
But you know what I mean? So anyway, that's the art of how to think about using these things, which I look forward to being able to think about these problems.

1299
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:55,580
I think what we're getting at is a really interesting framework though, that is almost certainly going to become standard, which is the utility of the genomics and family history, which is, you know, genomics tells part of that story, but it doesn't tell you what happened with your ancestors.

1300
01:57:55,580 --> 01:58:15,580
So family history remains incredibly important, but you'll start when a baby's born with a whole genome and a family history and that will generate for you the prior probabilities of different diseases, being the diseases that afflict that person in the rest of their life.

1301
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:43,580
Those prior probabilities will in a personalized way determine the utility of a wide array of low cost screening tools that we're going to have at our disposal and will also lead you to make personalized estimates of the sensitivity or rather the diagnostic power of those tests for that person, which to the Bayesian point is different for every person.

1302
01:58:43,580 --> 01:59:03,580
This is a fundamentally different way than how we think about using diagnostics today. There's one detail of it that I don't have enough knowledge about, but you've made me interested in in your Swiss cheese metaphor, which is what from a probabilities and statistics standpoint is the right way to think about that Swiss cheese metaphor.

1303
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:24,580
Does adding tests on top of each other, how do you mathematically combine the sensitivity and specificity of the different tests and can you even do so without running clinical trials on the combined usage of the tests to have some ground truth to reference them against?

1304
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:44,580
My intuition is directionally you can do it, but you will not have a number. In other words, you can't say that mammography plus DWI MRI plus liquid biopsy will have this sensitivity and this specificity calculated from the three pairs that you layered on.

1305
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:55,580
But I think philosophically what you're trying to do is arbitrage each strength and weakness of different screening tools.

1306
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:56,580


1307
01:59:56,580 --> 02:00:00,580
So it's a conceptual model more than it is a theoretical and precise model.

1308
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:06,580
100% where it gets interesting though is in the math because that's where it gets very counterintuitive.

1309
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:24,580
So if you think about the example that I'm citing from Pearl's book, the sensitivity of the 73% test says that if you have breast cancer, there is a 73% chance that this test is positive.

1310
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:38,580
The much harder probability is what is the chance that you have breast cancer if this test is positive? These are two different conditional probabilities.

1311
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:49,580
And the shocking result is that if the test says you are positive, you have less than a 1% chance of having breast cancer.

1312
02:00:49,580 --> 02:01:01,580
So what's counterintuitive is if we thought, oh, we have one test that's 73% sensitive, we have one test that's 90% sensitive, we have one test that's 85% sensitive.

1313
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:14,580
You would assume that if you layer the three pieces of Swiss cheese, the possibility that if you are positive on two of those three and you have the disease is quite high.

1314
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:17,580
It may turn out though that it's not very high.

1315
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:23,580
The thing I always caution people against is you never want to talk sensitivity without remembering the specificity and vice versa.

1316
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:30,580
So in our little primer that we use with our patients, we use two extreme and very glib examples.

1317
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:40,580
If I mail a letter at random to a thousand women and tell them all that they have breast cancer, I have 100% sensitivity.

1318
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:48,580
I have 0% specificity, but I have 100% sensitivity because let's just assume three of those women have breast cancer.

1319
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:57,580
We told them all they have breast cancer. Never mind the fact that 997 of them don't have breast cancer and I incorrectly told them they do.

1320
02:01:57,580 --> 02:02:04,580
But you can have 100% sensitivity and you're still, it's a dog shit test if the specificity is really low.

1321
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:13,580
Similarly, you can send a thousand letters out to women at random and say you absolutely don't have breast cancer and you will say that with 100% specificity.

1322
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:24,580
Now what's cool about, and this may be true of incumbent diagnostics as well, but what's kind of cool in the liquid biopsy companies I'm looking at, and I'm here exposing my lack of statistical knowledge,

1323
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:37,580
is that because the test is effectively a computer analysis of data, you can manually trade off between sensitivity and specificity.

1324
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,580
And that's like a PSA. Where do you decide the cutoff is?

1325
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:46,580
So for the liquid biopsies, what everyone is doing is they're saying we have to have 100% specificity.

1326
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:50,580
We can't tell anyone who has the disease that they don't have it.

1327
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,580
And that's the way it should be.

1328
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:52,580
That is how it should be.

1329
02:02:53,580 --> 02:03:00,580
So if you picture one of those, and maybe we'll link to this in show notes so people know what we're talking about when we talk about a receiver operating characteristic curve,

1330
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:09,580
but you picture pulling to the upper left, tightening that curve, getting it as close to an area under the curve of one.

1331
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:16,580
And that was the thing I could never get those oncoblock eyes to understand, was they couldn't understand.

1332
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:19,580
They thought of this exclusively as a binary, yes, no.

1333
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:21,580
And it's like, no, no, no. The thing is, yes, no.

1334
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:32,580
You could say PSA is prostate cancer if it's higher than one, and you will catch every single person who had prostate cancer and a million people who don't.

1335
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:38,580
Conversely, you can make the cutoff 20 and you'll miss a million people with prostate cancer,

1336
02:03:38,580 --> 02:03:42,580
but you'll be guaranteed that everyone who you say has prostate cancer has prostate cancer.

1337
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:48,580
That's facetious and not even true, but directionally, that's the problem that you face.

1338
02:03:48,580 --> 02:04:01,580
And I like the question you posed, which I've never thought of, which is, could you take my sort of hand waving Swiss cheese approach and mathematically map it out without doing the clinical trial?

1339
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:06,580
And that also goes beyond my pay grade. I would have to consult with a statistician.

1340
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:10,580
You could certainly do it retrospectively.

1341
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:22,580
The way that these tests are developed is that a researcher gets lots of tissue and blood samples from patients and they know which of those are coming from cancer patients or not.

1342
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:31,580
And then they build a set of assays and analytics pipeline that look at the samples and try to class them correctly.

1343
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:47,580
And so you could certainly run multiple of those types of tests on the same samples from the same patients if you have large enough sample volumes and you could develop these tests in a layered manner.

1344
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:53,580
I don't think that the statistics would hold if you developed them separately from one another.

1345
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:57,580
But that effectively is a controlled experiment that I'm describing.

1346
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:08,580
Yeah, if you did it as a biased and unbiased sample, so you'd have to bifurcate the sample, do all of your learning on the biased piece and then only verified on the unbiased piece.

1347
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:11,580
That's correct. And that's how they do these.

1348
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:12,580
And I hope that you had the data.

1349
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:20,580
That's how they develop these, is they teach an algorithm essentially what the differences are between healthy and disease.

1350
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:29,580
And then they feed it new samples and they ask whether those new samples can be classed algorithmically into either of the buckets.

1351
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:30,580
I don't know.

1352
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:32,580
The liquid biopsy space is so interesting to me.

1353
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:43,580
I really, you know, I tell my patients that I think this is the single area that will most influence our care, hopefully in the next five years, is right now.

1354
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:47,580
Like, you know, we're learning a lot about cardiovascular disease.

1355
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:51,580
We are still learning, especially in the inflammatory side of that disease.

1356
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:58,580
We're not learning a hell of a lot around the lipoproteins that, you know, we're just trying to educate people to actually know what's true and what's not true.

1357
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:09,580
But where we're learning geometrically is around inflammation and potentially with these two clinical trials that were published this year or one that was published this year, one that was halted likely.

1358
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:13,580
The the methotrexate study was halted early, likely because of a positive effect.

1359
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:15,580
And that won't be announced until the fall.

1360
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:19,580
But that's two really interesting proof of concept.

1361
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:28,580
So the anti-IL1 study and then the methotrexate study, where making no change in lipoproteins, you're improving cardiovascular outcomes.

1362
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:33,580
In my mind, the next frontier in cardiovascular is what can we do to strengthen the endothelial resilience?

1363
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:44,580
Because if you have a strong endothelium, a muted inflammatory response, and you can control lipoproteins, you're taking the only inevitable disease our species has ever faced and knocking it on its heels.

1364
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:50,580
But cancer, man, like we're no better at curing cancer today than we were 40 years ago with five exceptions.

1365
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:58,580
Well, cancer like aging seems to be an enormously resilient set of processes.

1366
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:03,580
And, you know, biology and evolution have been pretty thrifty.

1367
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:11,580
So the mechanisms, as you know, of many cancers are mechanisms that are used in early fetal development by the body.

1368
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:17,580
So these are tools that our organism has for developing in the first place.

1369
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:25,580
And unfortunately, they run some risk of getting reactivated later in life and doing crazy stuff that's contrary to our interests.

1370
02:07:25,580 --> 02:07:39,580
And so this trade off between the apparatus that we've been given to become healthy and mature and the processes that ultimately are undoing seems quite difficult to overcome.

1371
02:07:40,580 --> 02:08:00,580
Atherosclerosis is a less obvious one, although the sort of endothelial damage that is at its core and the function of the immune system in the processes that ultimately degrade that juncture are also used for all sorts of good things.

1372
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:15,580
I mean, the immune system seems to be at the core of much of this that, you know, if you do view atherosclerosis ultimately as a sort of auto inflammatory disease, then you can think of it as a trade off against the immune system.

1373
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:18,580
Yeah, just like allergies. Right.

1374
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:19,580
Yeah, exactly.

1375
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:29,580
And, you know, we I'm getting allergy shots right now, which funny enough, I guess, have always been referred to as immunotherapy before it was hot.

1376
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:39,580
But, you know, I mean, I would still rather have to get allergy shots than be susceptible to almost certain death if I didn't have this immune system.

1377
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:43,580
Do you have any anaphylactic reactions or are your allergies pretty mild?

1378
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:54,580
Thankfully, no. And thankfully, I haven't had any anaphylactic reactions to the immunotherapy, which is still which is still which doctor science.

1379
02:08:54,580 --> 02:09:06,580
One of the things Sean Parker is working on is allergy. And it's one of the things that led him into immunotherapy because he has horrible allergies and so has always been fascinated by the immune system.

1380
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:17,580
And when he perceived that there was a crossover between his allergies and cancer biology, he got obsessed with the idea that immunotherapy was going to be the root.

1381
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:25,580
But allergies themselves as mundane as they are still can't be addressed in a particularly rigorous or precise way.

1382
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:33,580
So precision medicine for tree pollen allergies is still beyond the frontiers of current medicine.

1383
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:41,580
Although the work that Dr. Naidu, who is the largest sort of recipient of the work that Sean's doing up at Stanford, I mean, she is amazing.

1384
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:48,580
And the work that they are doing. I mean, I've sent multiple patients there. Carrie's always very kind and takes my referrals.

1385
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:57,580
I mean, I have seen before my own eyes people who once would have died from peanut dust and they can eat peanuts again through this sensitization.

1386
02:09:58,580 --> 02:10:13,580
Yeah, I sometimes wonder if Sean gets enough credit for the amazing stuff he's done both in terms of funding cancer research, but also this incredible center at Stanford that, you know, little by little we're seeing, you know, Mount Sinai is doing this in New York.

1387
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:26,580
CHOP is doing it in Philly. I mean, other centers are still are taking this research forward. And I don't know. I mean, I think for people out there listening to this who have children or who themselves have anaphylactic reactions, I am way more optimistic about this than I was four years ago.

1388
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:30,580
Well, and this is, you know, it comes back to the earlier point about the future is already here.

1389
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:41,580
Yeah. Now, how do you make that accessible to everyone? How do you make it accessible to everybody? And how do things that make sense and have been proven in a sense become standard of care?

1390
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:55,580
Unfortunately, in the United States, and this is something that I discovered very slowly. It's not as if there's one arbiter of standard of care. You've got all these different medical societies that govern physicians, and you know, you've got all these different medical societies that govern physicians.

1391
02:10:55,580 --> 02:11:10,580
And standards in clinical guidelines in every specialty area, they have their conferences and their board of directors, and the payers sometimes respect their clinical guidelines and the government sometimes respect their clinical guidelines.

1392
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:33,580
So one of the things that in terms of human systems, we should absolutely put more energy into is how once something like Dr. Nadeu's work is sort of definitive science, do we rapidly make sure that it becomes standard for every patient everywhere.

1393
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:48,580
And right now, it has to go through this long cascade of human minds and bureaucratic organizations, which is an enormous detriment to patients. I mean, this is something that has nothing to do with science, it just has to do with people.

1394
02:11:48,580 --> 02:12:17,580
And it's the sort of thing that physicians should care much more about as a community. It's the sort of thing that people like I think Atul Gawande rightly, are always reminding us to think more about, you know, it's very easy to get drawn into the science and technology frontiers, but we forget that we could make such an enormous impact with just these simple changes in our own behavior.

1395
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:33,580
DA, I know I could sit here and have this discussion for another two hours, but I want to be respectful of your time. And you've been super gracious to open up your home this morning. Where can people learn more about you? I know you've got a huge following on Twitter, so they can obviously see you there. What's your Twitter handle?

1396
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:55,580
It's dawalick, that's D-A-W-A-L-L-A-C-H. And I have a website, which is equally simple, dawalick.com. And I'm on Instagram, also dawalick. I tend not to do that much social media these days, but I still occasionally post pictures. And I'm very easy to reach too.

1397
02:12:55,580 --> 02:13:11,580
So I presume that in your audience, there is a mixture of crazy people, geniuses, and smart, nice people who think they're geniuses but are not. And I'm particularly interested in meeting the geniuses.

1398
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:22,580
So right now, anyone listening, please put yourself in the bucket of crazy, genius, or smart, not genius. Correct. And if you're in bucket two, can you reach out to DA?

1399
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:31,580
If you're smart, not genius, but do have an interesting novel idea that itself could be deemed genius, I'm also interested.

1400
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:33,580
That's great. Do you still perform?

1401
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:51,580
Not regularly. The most recent performance I did was after a dinner party when I was embarrassingly asked to play a song on someone's piano in their living room and got peer pressured into doing it.

1402
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:55,580
But most of the time, I don't perform because I don't have a great way of performing.

1403
02:13:55,580 --> 02:14:01,580
If someone was going to buy just one piece of music, would it be your most recent album? What would you recommend?

1404
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:07,580
I think so. I would recommend my most recent album, which came out in October of three years ago. Yeah.

1405
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:15,580
Called Time Machine. I thought it was 2016. It came out. Was it 15? It may have been 16. You're not good with dates. You told us this. I'm terrible with dates.

1406
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:31,580
I think it was 2016. I was thinking the other day that it felt like it was a year ago. And then when I sort of realized it was three years ago, I thought, oh, shit, I should probably finish some of these songs I've been writing, you know, because I can't go like a decade between now.

1407
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:37,580
I don't have the Axl Rose credibility to wait that long between albums.

1408
02:14:37,580 --> 02:14:48,580
All right. So Time Machine, it is, which I believe came out in 2016, but I could be wrong. Of course, like a fool, I bought all your stuff on iTunes, so I overpaid for it. I could have just been on Spotify.

1409
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:52,580
Well, if you're not listening to it much, I made out like a bandit on that. So thank you.

1410
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:59,580
No, I tend to. When I listen to music, I just listen. I'm like a big repeater. Right. It drives everyone around me nuts.

1411
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:06,580
See, you've got that OCD focus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could go. I can go five songs on repeat for an entire five hour flight.

1412
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:16,580
Amazing. Yeah. Usually Zeppelin. Right. Zeppelin is good. I don't know if I mentioned Bonham before. You did. Yeah. I wouldn't have let you get this far in the conversation if you hadn't at least mentioned John Bonham.

1413
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:28,580
What's cool about both Bonham and Elvin Jones is that they both play behind the beat. They're always kind of catching up with the song. And when you play behind the beat, it sounds cool.

1414
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:37,580
I don't know why, but just like you can recognize cool if someone dresses cool or is cool. Playing behind the beat sounds cool.

1415
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:53,580
I to this day listen to Good Times, Bad Times at least once every couple of days. And I think to myself, how is it possible that this was the first song on the first Zeppelin album and Bonham's opening riff? It's like incredible.

1416
02:15:54,580 --> 02:16:03,580
And I think to myself, what would it have been like to have heard that for the first time on vinyl as like a new sound? I just I mean, I would have worn that record out.

1417
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:15,580
Well, and they had a level of mystery too. I don't know if you know this, but they were never on the album covers, pictures of them. So people would go to the concert to figure out what they looked like.

1418
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:26,580
Yeah. So this I do somewhat regret not having been. Yeah, I've been around in a time where there was that level of magic around who was making some music you heard.

1419
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:42,580
I mean, it must have been even crazier with wax cylinders and stuff like this. People famously thought when they heard the phonograph that they needed to pull the curtain back and see the source of the audio there because it sounded so realistic.

1420
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:53,580
Now, if you hear a primitive wax cylinder recording, it's like shocking that anyone could have thought that was in the room because it's so scratchy and simplified.

1421
02:16:53,580 --> 02:17:03,580
But the magic's happening in people's brains. So they just couldn't piece together how that was coming out of the speaker if it wasn't there. Do you ever listen to vinyl anymore? Yeah, I love vinyl.

1422
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:17,580
I mean, vinyl is great. Vinyl is a peak technology in music reproduction. So you get a level of accuracy with digital music that you don't get with vinyl, but analog media are pretty cool.

1423
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:32,580
Yeah, golly. And last question, just because we're bringing it back to music, if you go back in time and see three or four concerts, actual pick the date, pick the band, pick the venue, that you just otherwise wouldn't have been able to have seen because you weren't old enough for it.

1424
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:46,580
What do you think they'd be? Well, I would have liked to see, I saw Prince one time and it was the most virtuosic live performance I've ever seen. So I might devote two of those concerts to Prince or something.

1425
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:55,580
People say Chuck Berry was pretty awesome live and pretty unhinged. I bet, you know, I don't love early rock and roll and I don't love blues.

1426
02:17:56,580 --> 02:18:06,580
But some of those early rock folks, you know, if you had never seen it before, probably would have been incredibly shocking. So I would have liked to see that.

1427
02:18:06,580 --> 02:18:21,580
And watching the documentary on Nina Simone that I saw a few years ago, I concluded that she must have been one of the greatest live performers ever. She's just a virtuosic live performer. So I would have liked to see her.

1428
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:30,580
It's like one of my favorite games to play in the time machine. Oh, yeah. All right. Well, thank you so much. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Peter.
