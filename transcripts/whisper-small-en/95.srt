00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,240
today's episode. My guest this week is Dr. Luke Bennett. Luke is the medical and sports

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,760
performance director for HINSA Performance, a company focused on human wellbeing and athletic

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,920
performance with a particular emphasis in motorsport. Luke received his medical degree,

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,240
as well as his master's degree in sports medicine at the University of Queensland. He then spent

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,880
seven years training in intensive care before working for six years in remote emergency

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,040
aeromedical retrieval with the Royal Flying Doctor service of Western Australia, something

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,960
that we actually talk about in this episode that despite knowing Luke, I didn't know this

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,160
about him and didn't understand what that meant. I wanted to interview Luke because I talk a lot

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,440
about my interest in Formula One, my passion for it. I realized that a lot of people who listened

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,320
to this podcast might not fully understand why. I thought that no one could do a better job

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,840
explaining some of the ins and outs of it the way Luke could. He does a really great job of

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,720
that. Again, you can come into this without having ever watched a Formula One race or finding any

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,680
interest in it. I think you're going to come away from this thinking, wow, you learned a lot and

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,200
you have a greater appreciation for the sport of Formula One, what makes it special, why it's so

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,560
emotionally, cognitively, and physically appealing. We talk a lot about Luke's background. We do,

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,280
again, an overview of F1, including the races, the driving, the unbelievable travel and physical

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,600
and logistics and sleep constraints and everything that are placed on all of the drivers and the

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,160
teams. We decided to release this episode specifically to coincide with the release of

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,600
season two of the Netflix documentary series, Formula One, Drive to Survive, which just came

28
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,120
out on February 28th. If you haven't seen season one of that, I recommend going and watching that

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,280
first. I think I binge watched it in two days when it came out. Can't recommend this series

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,400
enough. It does a really good job of showing you not just the drama of what happens on the tracks,

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,480
but perhaps more importantly, the drama of what happens off the circuit. My hope is that if you're

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,360
not a fan of F1, this will give you a great overview of the sport, why I love it so much.

33
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,240
And if you're already a fan, you're definitely going to enjoy this. So without further delay,

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:16,280
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Luke Bennett. Luke, it's so good to see you, man.

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,360
Thanks Peter, back in Austin. Yeah. And thank you for making time. We had spent a couple of weeks

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
trying to figure out how we were going to make this happen with your schedule because obviously,

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,800
you have more important things to do than sit here and goof off with me. So I really appreciate

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,400
you making time. That's why we're doing this so late at night. No problem. We got the races the

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,960
other way around this year with Mexico and Austin. So we actually had a free day beforehand. It worked

40
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,240
out well. So let's start with the most interesting thing on your CV and we're going to get to a lot

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,880
of things that you do, but tell me what a flying doctor is. The Royal Flying Doctor Service of

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,720
Australia is pretty unique. I don't think there's anything like it anywhere else in the world, even

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,200
considering the continent of Africa. Western Australia in particular is a state that's about

44
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,440
the same size as Western Europe. It has only 2 million people by way of population and only

45
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,160
really one. And one of those is, I mean, most of them are in Perth, right? Exactly. So all of the

46
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,120
clinical services essentially are in Perth and it's actually more economical for the health

47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,800
system to fund an aeromedical retrieval service by fixing aircraft for the entire state rather

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,240
than building and funding hospitals around. So it's this huge expanse with a vibrant sort of

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,720
mining industry in particular, lots of underprivileged indigenous communities, a big tourist

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,320
industry during the winter months and all sorts of crazy action happening out there. And a couple

51
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,360
of these flying doctor bases where you'd have a crew of a doctor, a nurse and a pilot flying to

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,800
retrieve patients and then taking them to the capital city. So regardless of the problem, you

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,760
are usually at best three or four hours from help, but more often than not up north, half a day to a

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,000
day away from tertiary specialist care and some really, really sick patients on a daily or weekly

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,080
basis. So when you take something like childbirth, for example, where there was at least some

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,080
anticipation of when a person is going to need medical care, do those patients just sort of come

57
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,560
to Perth or is childbirth something that would be done locally? There's often a plan to fly the

58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,480
patients to Perth and also there's high rates of unexpected premature labour. So we spent a lot of

59
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,520
time actually on obstetrics, which terrified me to be honest, I came from adult intensive care

60
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,280
medicine and learning obstetrics and pediatrics on the fly like that was sometimes a pretty nervous

61
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,360
situation. So if somebody suffers a motor vehicle accident or a heavy machinery accident in the

62
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,840
field, the first responders could take how many hours to get there? So first of all, when I started,

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,640
the first responders were often volunteer ambulance crews. So it might be the local teacher or the

64
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,240
local shopkeeper going out to do the first response. They can be easily three hours each way drive back

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,440
to the nearest small hospital. And there's even parts of the state where we would land on the road

66
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,440
on the highway because it was the fastest way of retrieving the patient. Now that was pretty

67
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,080
uncommon, but typically patients have had a pretty good trial of life by the time we got to them. It

68
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,640
was minimum three to four hours after the insult. Wow. So there's just things we take for granted as

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,720
far as, I mean, do they have AEDs locally and things like that for people who are having heart

70
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,280
attacks? Yeah. So there's reasonable basic resuscitation equipment in these small nursing

71
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,720
posts. A lot of really nurse led clinics around the place and these nurses were unbelievable. You

72
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,640
know, the stress they must face on a daily basis, having to deal with whatever comes in the door.

73
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,160
Good resuscitation facilities were there, but it's a case of getting the patient to them and then the

74
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,680
appropriate medical skills to them as well. Now you're from the other coast. You're from the east

75
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,440
coast of Australia. Yeah, grew up in Brisbane and live more recently on the Sunshine Coast,

76
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,480
beautiful place called Noosa Heads. So what took you out to Perth? Did you train there?

77
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,080
I did not. The flying doctor job was something that had interested me. And in fact, the Western

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,680
Australian division had a lot more of this primary retrieval work, which was far more

79
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,920
interesting than routine shuttling of patients between regional hospitals, which is more the

80
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,000
case on the east coast. So it was really the nature of the work attracted me to WA and it's

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,360
a beautiful part of the world and this amazing remote desert and coastal scenery up there. And

82
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,720
it was just a new adventure and something that I look back on as probably the most professionally

83
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,880
satisfying part of my career clinically so far. So what was the transition from that

84
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,680
which I think sounds like it came out of critical care, big hospital critical care to that to what

85
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,920
you're doing today with HINSA, which we'll talk about what of course what that is.

86
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,160
Throughout my time working in hospital intensive care and then in the flying doctors, I was

87
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,400
essentially volunteering to work trackside doing trauma and rescue for different motor

88
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,360
sport events. So we worked at the Australian Grand Prix for about 11 years in Melbourne.

89
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,800
The Australian team did the Korean race when it was there for a couple of years. And then I also

90
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,600
did a lot of rally and off-road and that stuff was a lot of fun and very interesting medicine-wise.

91
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,920
You had long response times. You typically had two injured patients. You had to do your own

92
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,280
extrication and fire suppression and the patients were generally more heavily injured than in

93
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,400
circuit racing. So that was the overlap in terms of career during that phase. And then at the

94
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,080
Australian Grand Prix, I met a guy called Adam Costanzo who was Lewis Hamilton's first physio.

95
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,880
He was an Australian guy who'd been to university in my sister's year group. And so we got talking

96
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,880
one year and I met his boss and our founder, Dr. Aki Hinsa, who we can discuss perhaps and kept

97
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,760
in touch with them over subsequent years to the point where Aki was eventually looking to step

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,640
back from travel and I was in the right place at the right time to take the role that we're in now.

99
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,480
And when was that?

100
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,680
2014 was my first year. So just coming up to the end of my sixth full season in Formula One.

101
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,600
Tell me a little bit about Aki and his philosophy of training.

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,880
So Dr. Aki Hinsa was a Finnish trauma surgeon. He was actually doing humanitarian work in Ethiopia

103
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,480
in the mid 90s. And he was thinking about human well-being through a humanitarian sort of lens,

104
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,160
but met Halley Gabrissoulasi and those legendary Ethiopian Olympic runners during his time there

105
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,320
and translated some of those principles into the needs of an athlete. When he moved back to Finland,

106
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,600
Mika Hakkinen asked him to start to support him and his family trackside and Mika won a couple of

107
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,440
world championships side by side with Aki in 98, 99. He became sort of the McLaren team doctor and

108
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,000
then famously had long associations with Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raikkin and Sebastian and

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,480
other young drivers as they came through. And Aki unfortunately died a couple of years ago,

110
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,760
but he attained this guru-like status in the paddock. He was a really kind and inspirational

111
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,440
figure, a great doctor and a real father figure to many of the drivers that we see doing so well

112
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,560
today. And how did he overlap with Sid in the role that Sid played beginning probably in the 70s,

113
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,720
right? Yeah. So Professor Watkins was appointed and employed by the FIA. So the governing body

114
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,760
of the sport, Sid was doing all of the trackside rescue. He was in the medical car, which chases

115
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,120
the first lap of the race. And in those days, he was kind of the only doctor around through the

116
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,240
70s and the 80s. And I guess as the 90s wore on, there was a little bit more of a trend towards

117
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,520
teams having some of their own doctors, which is what Aki was. So I don't think Sid overlapped

118
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,240
directly with Aki. There was a gentleman called Gary Hartstein who followed Sid and did a great

119
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,920
job. Sid retired what in the late 90s? That's correct. Yeah, it was the mid to late 90s. Yeah.

120
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,840
And he was around at FIA conferences and things for a number of years. I met him a couple of times,

121
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,720
a guy who really established trackside medical care from nothing in the 1970s. And a number

122
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,640
of drivers probably owe their lives and their health to Sid and his successors.

123
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:56,520
I was recently rereading Damon Hill's biography. And it's sort of interesting to go back to even

124
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,040
25 years ago and think about how dangerous that sport was. And it went through sort of these step

125
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,880
functions of improvement and safety sort of in the mid 70s, there was a big step up. And then

126
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,680
there wouldn't really be another huge step forward until the mid 90s after Senna's death.

127
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,280
And even just two years later, you see how in just a span of a couple of years, the sport got

128
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,240
considerably safer, which is something I'd love to dive into with you. So let's talk a little bit

129
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,960
about F1 because for many people listening to this, they probably don't understand so many

130
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,640
dimensions of it. Starting with the way I describe it to my friends who don't follow it, it's like

131
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,520
having a Super Bowl every two weeks. That's the only way I can explain it to people who

132
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,760
don't pay attention to Formula One, which not a lot of Americans do. Would you agree with that

133
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,880
assessment? Yeah. It's the world's most interesting and expensive circus really. It's endlessly

134
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,720
fascinating on the social level and the human level. And I'm not sure if you saw there was a

135
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,560
Netflix series which came out based on last season's Formula One.

136
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,120
I've only watched each episode 14 times. So now I have no idea what you're talking about. My family

137
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,200
knows every episode off by heart and then actually they keep calling for more and more. I

138
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,320
heard there's going to be another season. They are filming this year as well, but you wouldn't

139
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,680
be surprised to learn that many of my friends and families, and particularly female family members

140
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,080
and friends, people who've never had more than a passing interest in motorsport, have suddenly seen

141
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,680
this series and understood the human story that's unfolding all through the midfield and the teams

142
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,520
and the politics and the appreciation that you can have for not just the on track action, but the

143
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,560
human stories that are going on behind the scenes is phenomenal. In terms of a comparison to Super

144
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,600
Bowl, I mean, it is a massive television event. It's outside of probably Summer Olympics and

145
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,200
Football World Cup. It's got, if not the largest TV audience of an annually recurring event. It's

146
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,440
certainly up there in the top three. I mean, it's not uncommon for 200,000 people to show up at

147
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,240
every race throughout the course of the weekend, correct? Yeah. I think we had 360 odd thousand

148
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,640
attendance over the three days in Mexico last week, for example. Some races are better attended

149
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,320
than others. The TV audience is there regardless. And we got new owners of the sport a couple of

150
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,880
years ago, so they're modernizing a lot of the approaches to digital coverage as well, which is

151
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:18,120
starting to get some traction. And this year, there are 20 races, 21 races, 21 in next year, 22,

152
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,400
and possibly 23 or 24 the year after. So we're probably going to hit a ceiling there somewhere

153
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,040
of what the human beings involved in working the sport can take. There's a lot of discussion

154
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,720
about how the teams will approach, for example, a 24 race season, because there's a lot of travel.

155
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,280
It's a great life. It's a great privilege to work in Formula One, but it's very, very hard on

156
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,480
particularly mechanics, engineers, catering staff, people with families at home. There's a limit to

157
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,440
how much you can sustain being away. And the teams are going to be budget capped in 2021 at the same

158
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,320
time as they're going to have this interesting problem of perhaps rotating staff. So it's never

159
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,720
a dull moment. Things are changing all the time. One of the things that first intrigued me when I

160
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,360
really started to think about this through the lens of human performance was the management of

161
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,480
jet lag. Walk me through what a typical travel schedule would look like, especially when they're

162
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,960
on the one week pace, which is quite common. Maybe just stepping back and thinking about the

163
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,240
structure of the Formula One calendar. So we have these 20 on races and they're organized in

164
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,720
absolutely no logical geographical order. The races pay to be the first or the last race of

165
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,000
the season. They pay to be on a traditional fixed date. They might be aligned with a particular

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,640
public holiday or a school holiday block. And that's always the priority over any sort of

167
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,200
travel planning logic. So we start the season with four races, which are long haul, mostly in

168
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,480
Australia and Asia. Going to be five races next year when the Vietnamese Grand Prix starts. We

169
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,760
then have a slightly nicer period sort of through the European summer where we are on the road,

170
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,880
working out of trucks in Europe, a little bit less flying. And then we're in this phase now,

171
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,720
which is the hardest part of the year. So seven or eight long haul flyaway races again, back and

172
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,520
forth to Asia a couple of times, Russia, three races in the Americas now, and then finishing

173
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,120
in the Middle East. And again, most personnel will go back to Europe in between each of those races.

174
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,480
So most people have done a dozen long haul intercontinental sectors over the last month or so.

175
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,120
And this is the time when championships are being won or lost. And it's in terms of sleep management.

176
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,560
I listened to your Q&A with Matthew Walker a couple of days ago, and there's an ideal to

177
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,360
sleep management, which we really try to adhere to as much as possible. But there's a really

178
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,120
pragmatic element to that as well. And particularly around the psychology of arriving at an event.

179
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,000
And this is not as much the drivers, but the crews, the mechanics and the engineers,

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,880
people who probably have a very narrow window to either get onto the new time zone or not.

181
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,640
And if they get to a point where there's been two or three nights of disrupted sleep, getting into

182
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,640
the phase of the week where the cars are on track, it can be actually quite a disturbing thing. So

183
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,200
we try not to use sleep aids, sleeping medications too much. But there is probably a case where

184
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,600
athletes and others around them need to perform for just having that one night reset with a

185
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,240
sleeping pill on arrival in the new location. As much as that's kind of the lesser of two evils,

186
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,760
it can improve somebody's outlook and mindset for the rest of the weekend to come. We do quite

187
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,320
detailed sleep and jet lag planning for the drivers and on occasion for the teams as well.

188
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,200
But the reality of the schedule, the weekend schedule, the flights that can be chosen,

189
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,200
there's a limited number of flights to take a thousand people into each destination

190
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,400
with limited flexibility. So it's a case of being very pragmatic, not letting the perfect be the

191
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,280
enemy of the good. And things just move so fast. You have to just keep getting through each day

192
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,560
the best way you can. I think a number of people watching Formula One casually might not appreciate

193
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,960
the magnitude of the team that supports the two drivers. So again, let's start at the top of the

194
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,920
food chain with the two biggest teams, Mercedes and Ferrari. 10 teams, 20 drivers, so two per team.

195
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,240
How big is the entirety of the Mercedes team or the Ferrari team?

196
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,880
So you're looking at probably between 900 and a thousand people at the Mercedes Formula One

197
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,240
factory, for example. Ferrari would be very similar. And then again, in the Mercedes case,

198
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,200
you've got another six or 800 just building the engines in a separate facility, a separate

199
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,880
company. So probably looking at an average of a thousand people per car up and down the 10 teams.

200
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,640
And again, that's going to be challenged soon when there's a budget cap and there's going to have to

201
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,720
be a lot more rationalization and prioritization of how teams approach building the fastest car

202
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,440
possible. Will that budget cap apply? For example, you have some teams that aren't building their

203
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,280
own engine. Mercedes is building the engine and the other team is buying the engine from Mercedes.

204
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,960
Will that cap still apply the same to those teams? It seems a bit unfair.

205
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,760
So this hasn't been announced yet. I think the final regulations are due to drop any week now,

206
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,440
but these are precisely the topics that have been so controversial. A car manufacturer under a budget

207
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,240
cap faces a completely different scenario to one of the traditional privateer teams like Williams

208
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,360
or McLaren. So for precisely those reasons, it's not resolved yet. And I suspect the regulations

209
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,360
will continue to evolve over the next couple of years. Now, of those people, how many are actually

210
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,480
traveling to support the drivers and actually be at the race versus stay in the factory?

211
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,280
So there's a core race team of about 43 people with a specific pass, which is all electronically

212
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,680
regulated in terms of the times they can be at the circuit. So those 43 people are operational.

213
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,520
They're allowed to touch the car and interact with the race event itself. At a typical large event,

214
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,520
like Monaco or Austin, the traveling staff might be something around 150 per team where there's a

215
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,880
huge marketing and communications and media apparatus that goes along with the team's

216
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,320
activities for that week. There's a core bunch of engineers, of course, and the catering team and

217
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,680
the truck logistics guys, because they all are guys at the moment. And those teams are pretty

218
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,760
constant, but they'll vary. For example, a European versus a long haul flyaway race.

219
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,360
Yesterday, I was in the car with my daughter coming back from a cross country meet and we were on

220
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,040
the freeway and driving 75 miles an hour, which feels like nothing when you're just driving in a

221
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,120
straight line. And I said, Olivia, do you realize that those cars we watch every Sunday can go three

222
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,320
times this fast in a straight line? It was fast enough that she sort of got what that felt like.

223
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,440
And then I tried to explain to her the difference in G-forces that we feel when I would break really

224
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,480
hard for her to feel a hard break or turn relatively quickly. It's very hard, I think,

225
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,280
for people who haven't been inside a race car to even try to extrapolate what's happening in

226
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,520
Formula One. I was actually trying to reflect as I was having this discussion with her about the

227
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,840
greatest G-forces I've felt inside of race cars that I've been driving. Nothing like what those

228
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:08,600
guys experienced. Maybe 2G, 1.9, 2.1G. What type of forces do drivers experience in F1 today?

229
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,520
So we're between 5 and 6G on some of the fastest very high speed constant radius corners,

230
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,560
like the final turn of Monza, for example, a couple of the Suzuki turns as well. So it means

231
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,160
your head, your four kilo head plus helmet is four or five or six times its normal weight,

232
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,120
and you've got to resist that with your neck muscles. So it's an extremely physical activity.

233
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,040
And I had a ride in, there's a two seater F1 car, which is used at some corporate events. I did some

234
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,160
laps of Mexico as a passenger last year. And we got to drive two of the X Minardi drivers with the

235
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,800
greatest names ever in the history of Formula One. We had Patrick Freesacker driving around,

236
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,880
and Zolt Baumgartner was also there helping out. So I honestly couldn't have done five or six laps

237
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,120
as a passenger. The forces and the experience was so brutal. And our guys, it's probably equivalent

238
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,080
to doing a pretty intense CrossFit circuit for two hours with a maximum of five or 10 second brakes

239
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,800
around it. While someone else is doing CrossFit trying to push you out of the way of your

240
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,040
equipment and someone's in your ear asking you to solve maths equations. And there's two or 300

241
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,960
million people watching. And maybe you don't have a contract from next year either that you're sort

242
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,520
of thinking about at the back of your mind. So there's an enormous amount going on while a driver

243
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,280
has to hit that millimeter perfect apex every lap. And it all just happens so fast. It's a lot more

244
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,360
instinctive, I think, than people think, especially when the drivers are in traffic, but very,

245
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,880
very physical. Yeah, I think I'm probably more empathetic to the mistakes that drivers make.

246
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,080
What race was it when Seb came back on track without looking left, Stroll almost hit him,

247
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,160
and then Stroll did the exact same thing 30 seconds later? So the Italian grown pretty

248
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,200
a couple of months. Yeah, that's right. It was Monzo. So I got to tell you, people were up in

249
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,680
arms and, oh, he should know better. He's a four-time world champion. My view is in the heat of the

250
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,680
moment. I don't even understand how people can be critical. I mean, I guess that's the nature of

251
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,880
what we do as spectators. And you can't see out. No, that's the other thing. The cockpits are so

252
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,320
high now. Yeah, and you can turn your head only a couple of degrees in each direction. The mirrors

253
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,280
give you a little bit of view. The halo, which we'll discuss, does restrict a lot of vision as well.

254
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,040
And it's a difficult problem. The drivers can see sort of the top of their tires. They can't see

255
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,840
most of the extremities of the car. So those front wings hang out a long way and they're very

256
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,240
susceptible to damage. So it's almost unfathomable the way they can race in close quarters and

257
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,880
literally millimeter perfect, sweeping the front wing of one car across and missing the tires of

258
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,800
their colleague and the other. So crazy. It never gets old to me when I'm trying to show someone

259
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,760
what type of precision and proprioception is necessary. Because when we think of athletes

260
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,000
having proprioception, I mean, that's one of the hallmarks of all great athletes. They sort of

261
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,760
always know where they are in space. But driving takes it to another level because it's not just

262
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,280
where you are in space. It's where this car is in space. And I mean, because I'm biased, of course,

263
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,760
watching Senna onboard laps in Monaco. I mean, I could do that all day long because you realize

264
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:23,080
he's coming within three to six inches of curbs of walls lap after lap after lap at speeds that

265
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,040
are sort of dizzying. Yeah. Change of gears manually, no power steering. Yeah. Incredible

266
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,360
footage, some of that stuff. But you touch on an interesting point there, Peter. I think this

267
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,160
proprioceptive aptitude is something that really separates the great drivers from the good. And

268
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,840
as someone who thinks about driver performance, I haven't worked out how we could even study this,

269
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,800
let alone modify it. But the way a driver senses what's going on in the adhesion between their

270
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,680
car and the track, the fine movements of the car, they sense it sort of through their back,

271
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,440
through their legs, through the contact that they have with the seat. And I think the truly

272
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,200
great drivers just have this unbelievable level of truncal proprioception and sensory awareness

273
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,080
that allows them to feel what the car is doing. And I think perhaps if there's ever a way that

274
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,640
we can measure and train that, it might lead to some step forward in driver skills training.

275
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,280
Well, that's a great point. And I mean, I think anybody who's been in a simulator will tell you

276
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:25,880
that's true. I mean, I have a simulator at home and I know it's so much harder to catch oversteer

277
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,240
in the simulator because you don't have that feeling of oversteer that comes before your visual

278
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:38,200
change. Whereas understeer is all visual anyway. So the simulator seems great for helping you correct

279
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,760
that. But that to me just says exactly what you're saying, which is when you deprive somebody of the

280
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:51,400
ability to sense that in their trunk, in their butt, there's that scene in Rush when the character

281
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,320
playing Nicky Lauda talks about how he was gifted with a great ass. And that's how he sort of knew

282
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,960
that this tire was a little bit low in pressure. But I think that stuff's all true. I mean, I just

283
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,680
think that the great ones, they feel something. Now, of course, the more interesting question is

284
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,240
the one you pose, which was how would you train that? Most great drivers come from a karting

285
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,200
background off the top of your head. Are any of the 20 guys on the grid now not from a karting

286
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,000
background? No, everybody would have started in karting. Yeah, they've taken different paths

287
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,280
through Formula Four, Formula Three and different ways to the top, but everybody starts out karting.

288
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,480
Yeah, karting is thought to be probably the best training that a Formula One driver can do. There's

289
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,280
very limited testing nowadays. So if a driver does want to train skills, then karting is

290
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,000
typically the go-to activity. Why do you think that is over, for example, being in a simulator?

291
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,520
Is it because you still get the feeling of the experience? You still have to manage the slide

292
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,000
and all those things? Yeah, it's a very raw experience. It probably comes back to the very

293
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,320
stripped out basics of feeling tire adhesion and car control and car movement in a very accessible

294
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,920
way. Going and running a Formula One car of any recent era on a track is not a trivial exercise.

295
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,040
It probably takes a team of at least 20 people just to get the thing fired up. But karting is

296
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:14,360
a pure technical skills exercise that's still worthwhile doing. I know, I sure enjoy it. Any

297
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,840
time I can take my daughter karting, I'm like, this is the greatest thing in the world. There is

298
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,200
no greater smile on your face than when you're sliding around on your side on those things.

299
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,600
So you alluded to the complexity of the cars today. Give people a sense of that. You also talked a

300
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,800
moment ago about how in addition to doing the CrossFit thing and getting screamed at and blah,

301
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,760
blah, blah, blah, blah, you've got an engineer talking to you. When we're watching television,

302
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,600
we hear a fraction of that discussion between the driver and his engineer. How much is actually

303
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,240
going on and what are the sorts of things that a driver is actually being expected to manage?

304
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,120
So there's a number of layers to that. On the team level, there's probably 10 or 20 different

305
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,880
radio networks involving all of the key personnel. So from the team boss to the strategist to the

306
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,360
chief engineer to the individual driver engineers. There's also a huge infrastructure back in the

307
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,760
factory in the UK. And they might be looking at the radio messages from other vehicles. They might

308
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,480
be looking at all sorts of telemetry from the car. There's hundreds and hundreds of streams of data,

309
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,120
which sort of ultimately have to feed through this one person, which is the individual driver's race

310
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,040
engineer. So it can get pretty busy on the radios. And the art of being a race engineer is

311
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,880
probably being able to not only understand and manage your driver emotionally, but to filter that

312
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,880
information and deliver it in a way that's concise and useful. A related question, I guess, is what

313
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,600
is the driver doing around a lap? And there are limitations on what the car is allowed to do.

314
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,160
I mean, just for perspective, when I'm in a car and my coach is talking to me,

315
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,240
there are only certain parts of a circuit when I can even talk back. I have to be on a straight away

316
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:03,880
to even just have the presence of mind to push the radio button and say, got it. Okay, we'll do.

317
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,640
Yep. Noted. Next lap. I'll hit that apex a little different. I can't do that when I'm cornering.

318
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,360
Yeah, for sure. And in the ideal world, there are structures to the radio talk that occur at a

319
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,400
certain point around the lap. But there are times when you don't have that luxury and

320
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,320
you reference sort of button pushing, but the modern Formula One steering wheel is an

321
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,560
unbelievable piece of complexity in its own right. I mean, these steering wheels are worth

322
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:35,640
50 or 60,000 pounds each. And there's probably 20 or 25 buttons on there, all of which have sub

323
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,800
menus and sometimes sub sub menus. And the drivers by regulation have to drive the car themselves.

324
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,880
They can only be given a limited amount of instruction from the pit wall as to what

325
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,200
settings to use. And it's got to the point now where they're more or less changing the

326
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,840
settings of the car between each corner so that it's optimized for each particular corner. So

327
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,400
the really great drivers not only have this proprioceptive feel, they've got a bandwidth

328
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:07,560
excess where they can really tune into the car. They can make all these changes fairly automatically

329
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,120
around a lap. They have just the experience and the knowledge to understand how the car is going

330
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,720
to work. And then on top of that, they have enough cognitive capacity left over to sort of

331
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,320
sit above the race to understand what their competitors are doing, what is the context of

332
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,520
their pitstop strategy and when they need to push, when they need to conserve tires. So it's really

333
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,000
an incredible cognitive load. And that's a big part of what we are managing with our coaching

334
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,800
staff across a race weekend. Give me an example of some of the complexities that can be managed

335
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,280
corner to corner by the driver. Things like brake bias, diff settings, and then these modern

336
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,120
engines are absolutely incredible hybrid pieces of art. They're hybrid electric engines. Tell folks

337
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,680
what that means. So we had the last reg change. So these came in in 2014, 2015. Okay. Yeah. So

338
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,840
prior to that, we were talking a pure naturally aspirated, was it a V10? 1.6 litre V6. Yeah.

339
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,200
The V10s were the good old days, some time ago now, but these are electric hybrid engines. So

340
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,120
they have a couple of different methods of energy recovery. There's braking energy recovered from

341
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,080
the vehicle. There's heat energy from the turbocharger. And these are fed back through a battery

342
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,800
to augment probably about a quarter or a third of the engine's power comes from this recovered

343
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,320
electrical energy. But to reference your previous question, so deploying that energy in the most

344
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,160
appropriate way around a lap is an enormous part of driving a current F1 car and save the energy

345
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,400
for a period where you might be trying to defend from an overtake, but deploy it in the parts of

346
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,840
the lap where it's going to give you the maximum benefit in terms of lap time is just a massive

347
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,880
engineering puzzle in itself, which the drivers have to keep on top of. So the engines themselves,

348
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,400
I mean, this is incredible. The internal combustion engine was invented what in the late 1800s,

349
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:02,680
early 1900s and for the entire history of the engine to 2014, the thermal efficiency went from

350
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:12,440
maybe 20, 25% to 28 or 30% at the very best scenario. But since 2015, Formula One has taken

351
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,800
that efficiency from about 28, 29% to over 50% now. So just a massive quantum leap in the way

352
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,240
engines work and for all of its faults in terms of carbon footprint flying this great circus around

353
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:31,080
the world and racing cars, when you multiply that kind of engine technology by 80 million

354
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,720
new cars sold around the world each year, you can see that there is a case to be made that Formula

355
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,520
One does a lot of good as well in developing these technologies. I think it does good on two

356
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,280
main fronts, that being one of them and of course, auto safety being another one. Let's go back a

357
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,840
little bit to the efficiency. How long do you think it takes for those types of benefits to

358
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,760
trickle in? Certainly, it trickles to the very high end halo supercars quite quickly within a

359
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,280
couple of years. But I think if you look at some of the technology that's coming into your average

360
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:08,280
medium family sedan nowadays, it's probably reasonable say within 10 or 15 years, a meaningful

361
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,320
amount of this stuff becomes relatively standard. And I guess it depends on regulatory pressures in

362
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,120
different jurisdictions around the world. But the technology is there if governments mandate the use

363
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,160
of it, I suppose. And we'll see, I guess, where we are on this planet over the next decade or so,

364
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,320
we're going to see a lot more emphasis on these technologies. I want to come back to safety in

365
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,480
a moment, but I can't help but ask a question that actually, I mean, I've thought about in the past,

366
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,080
but I still don't really understand all of the complexity you've discussed. It's mind boggling.

367
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,800
I know that if I spent the rest of my life, I could never drive one of those cars. I could do

368
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,920
goofy sedan laps, but I could never do a real lap, let alone race with anyone else out there. We might

369
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:52,360
have trouble just driving it out of the garage. I mean, they're not easy. And yet the drivers are

370
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,000
getting younger and younger. Sometimes, again, I'm sitting there, we always watch the races together

371
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,560
every Sunday. And because we're in California, we actually like watching them in real time. So we do

372
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,720
get up at five to watch them first thing in the morning or whatever. And I'm trying to explain to

373
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,440
my daughter in particular, because she's old enough, how old Norris is and Leclerc and even Verstappen.

374
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:21,640
I'm like, these guys are really young. And there was a day when a 30-year-old was in his prime. A

375
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,840
30-year-old is not in his prime in this sport anymore. And certainly by the time you're a

376
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,120
30-year-old couldn't break into the sport, put it that way. Whereas Damon Hill was 30 in effectively

377
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,200
his rookie year, 29, perhaps. But how is it that these drivers are getting younger and younger as

378
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,120
the complexity of these cars is getting greater and greater? I'm just blown away by it.

379
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,200
I think there's a couple of dimensions to that. One of them is purely cultural. I think people

380
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,200
just didn't think you could be a Formula One driver at all before the age of 23 or 24 previously.

381
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:01,160
I think maybe some of that complexity plays into a gaming culture. A lot of our younger drivers do

382
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,280
a lot of gaming. And it's kind of a bit of a cliche to make the comparison. But I think there

383
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,400
probably is an element to that. But I think now that it's been done, we had Max Verstappen come

384
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,520
into the sport just out of his 16th year, I think. And we've had a couple of teenage drivers

385
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,760
since then, Lance Stroll, Esteban Ocon, and others. I think now that it's accepted that it's possible,

386
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,760
the teams are more open to looking at younger talent. I think the pathway to Formula One

387
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,680
previously, let's think about the 90s or the early 2000s when we did have these brutal V10

388
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:39,480
engines and the cars were physically very much harder to drive. I think there was a physicality

389
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,320
about that that probably suited a slightly older driver as well. The cars are not easy to drive

390
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,320
nowadays by any means, but they are probably less of that brutal, raw, explosive, muscular power

391
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,440
required for perhaps an individual more well-developed physically. And it remains to be

392
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,320
seen, of course, but does this mean that Formula One drivers will have longer careers today coming in

393
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,640
earlier and staying longer? Or does it mean that the turnover is going to be higher? And it's sort

394
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,080
of interesting when you consider, I always think of Lewis as really young. I don't know, 2007 seems

395
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,400
like it was sort of yesterday. And yet Lewis is what, 34? Yeah, Lewis and Sebastian are both 33,

396
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,560
32, 33 now. Which would make them two of the oldest guys in the grid, right? Yeah, we had

397
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Kimmy turned 40 last week, but he's a bit of an outlier. I think there's an opposing sort of

398
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:36,040
trend though. The seat time is so valuable now. There's so little testing. It's relatively

399
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,280
difficult to get a super license, which is the qualification. You need to collect points in other

400
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,800
series. You need to do well in other series just to get to Formula One. And then on top of that,

401
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,920
the cars are just so complicated to drive that there's a huge premium placed on anyone with seat

402
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,880
time and seat experience. So I think that will trend very strongly towards longer careers. So

403
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,680
people will come in earlier and they'll be retained for longer. You'll have to have a much stronger

404
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,400
case to bring an unproven rookie into the sport. Let's take a step back a little bit and kind of

405
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,200
talk about some of these changes that have really taken over. You've alluded to the halo. Explain

406
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,800
what the halo is, when it came about and what the effect of that has been. So the halo is a cage

407
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,240
like device, which sort of sits over the top of the driver's cockpit. So just going back to basics,

408
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,920
we're talking about open cockpit racing here. And that's one of the classic characteristics of a

409
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,800
Formula car. It's got open wheels and an open cockpit. And traditionally you could see the driver.

410
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,920
The halo is this device which has been constructed over the top to protect the head of the driver,

411
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,800
which was the one last remaining big vulnerability in terms of safety. And the halo has been in for

412
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,440
two seasons now. I must admit personally, I was a little skeptical. I could understand

413
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,560
the rationale for it. I did wonder whether it was a solution in search of a problem. Having said

414
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,520
that we've had probably at least four distinct incidents now in Formula One and Formula Two,

415
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,640
where the halo has prevented a significant impact with the driver's head. So regardless

416
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,040
of what anyone thinks of it now, it's here to stay. The current halo is not a pretty thing. It's

417
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,680
definitely probably in its first iteration at present and it will be developed. I think in

418
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,360
IndyCar this year, they're using an evolution of the halo, which has more of a jet fighter screen

419
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,920
around it, which is much, much more aesthetically pleasing. And I think instead of that bar down

420
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,360
the middle, correct. And I think when things like fogging and airflow and you have to account for

421
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,440
all weather conditions and all visibility conditions and when those problems can be solved,

422
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,480
probably we'll move towards an arrow screen with an opening out the top so that it's still

423
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,040
technically open wheel racing. And it's a pretty impressive piece of kit. I mean, it's seven kilos

424
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:55,560
of titanium. The test, the halo apparatus has to pass by FIA regulation is something like a 10 to

425
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,200
12 ton load, a large bus being sat on the top of this seven kilo device and not deforming at all.

426
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,000
Just again, another example. That's unbelievable. Remarkable technologies that go into these

427
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,160
beautiful works of art, these cars that we can sometimes take for granted. And there's another

428
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:18,360
thing that we wear in a car called the Hans, which it's been around almost exactly 20 years now. It's

429
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,320
been in Formula One a little bit less than that, maybe 15 years. You've indirectly alluded to it

430
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,840
by explaining why the driver can't turn his or her head. Well, in Formula One, his head, I guess,

431
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:35,720
but left to right. What is the Hans doing and how is it saving a life? So the Hans is a head and neck

432
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,200
support device. Hans is actually one of several brands that are on the market, but it's the one

433
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,920
used most commonly in open wheel series. It's a carbon fiber device that sits on the top of the

434
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,240
shoulders of the driver. It has the race harness, the seat belt straps over the top of the device.

435
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,120
Pressing it down into the driver's shoulders and then the helmet is attached by some very

436
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,720
high tensile straps to this device. The effect of that is that if the driver has a head on or a

437
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,400
rotational impact, the movement of the head, especially the flexion of the neck is greatly

438
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,800
limited. And the Hans device has no doubt across many categories of motorsport, saved many, many

439
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,000
drivers from high cervical fractures. So fractures of the neck that would have killed them or severely

440
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,560
disabled them for their life. It's interesting. We probably only have anecdote about this and

441
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,000
don't get me wrong. I think that the Hans and other devices like it have been an innovation

442
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,880
in motorsport that shouldn't be questioned at all. But the force transmission down the spine is

443
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,160
interesting to think about. And I think if you look at a lot of the accidents we get in rally nowadays

444
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,120
and also in close foot racing, we seem to get these thoracic and lumbar crush factors a lot

445
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,840
more commonly. And I don't think this has been formally studied, but it seems like the Hans

446
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,240
probably changes the loading on the spine and produces something that's transmitted more

447
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,960
axially down to other parts of the spine. Do you think that's something that they experience when

448
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,640
they hit a bump or is it more when there's a head on collision? It would be more in a very high

449
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,480
speed impact where the loadings on a driver and an impact like that vary with the exact circumstances.

450
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,880
I mean, it totally makes sense because if there's a vector that's going forward

451
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,800
and that normally would have been distributed between C1 and C3, and now you've locked that

452
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,640
up with the Hans, well, then you're going to see that presumably below about T1. The force has to

453
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,120
go somewhere. I think the thoracic spine is braced somewhat by rib structures and the drivers in their

454
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:41,720
cars are in a highly recumbent position. They're almost lying flat on their backs, which a lot of

455
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,520
people don't appreciate. And that also adds to the unbelievable skill required to just control

456
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,200
one of these vehicles, the fact that you're more or less lying flat on your back with limited

457
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:56,040
visibility. So that changes the force distribution as well. I was in Italy last year and I got the

458
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,360
chance for my wife to see a Formula One car and get inside one. And she's like, what, five, seven

459
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,080
or something like that. And I'm like, okay, so a Formula One driver might be a total of an inch

460
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,680
taller than you, two inches taller than you. Get in there and now try to imagine doing what they're

461
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,880
doing from the position. And she couldn't believe how little she could see from being in this

462
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,960
position. It was just, it is overwhelming. The modern F1 car is very long and very wide and

463
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,960
very heavy as well. And controlling those cars with limited visibility in traffic is a very

464
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,280
underappreciated part of the art. I think it's the hardest, I mean, there's nothing I've ever

465
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,360
dabbled in that I could extrapolate to and say that's harder. I just don't think anything is,

466
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,160
people say, oh, you've swum from here to here or something. And I'm like, that is a trivial,

467
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,520
trivial task. That is simply a matter of just putting your head down and trying harder.

468
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:57,000
That doesn't speak to what you're describing here. It's a sport with many complex layers and a lot

469
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,360
of that social complexity too. Yeah. How do you manage? I mean, is that part of your job

470
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,960
description or is that just something that based on your own personality, you're obviously very

471
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,680
thoughtful, you're very introspective that you've sort of gravitated to, which is you have the

472
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:19,160
luxury of not being, you have the luxury of being sort of there to serve everyone, but you have huge

473
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,200
personalities. You have a sport with only 20 athletes, but 10 owners and they all have to be

474
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:31,480
under one roof effectively 21 times a year. Yeah. First of all, like, yes, with reference to our

475
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,360
position, we're extremely privileged to be working across multiple teams. How many teams do you work

476
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,880
with of the 10? We work with at least one driver in every team at present. So about 14 drivers in

477
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,800
some form are under our care. I never take that for granted. It's an enormous privilege. And it

478
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:54,760
goes back to Aki's time really when the model we use is medically led and the medical services that

479
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,720
we provide, I think are kind of the glue that cement those relationships. And I would say,

480
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,840
so our model is that we have a performance coach that people would refer to as the trainer or the

481
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:11,000
physio companies each driver. This coach will attend all of the races and normally train with

482
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,640
the driver in between races as well all year. So they have a very close one on one relationship.

483
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,240
We tend to use mostly sports scientists in our team. They have a good broad understanding of

484
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,000
the physical preparation, the nutrition, the sleep management, and the other things that we need to

485
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,480
think about across the race season. We do use some physiotherapy staff as well and increasingly dual

486
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,560
qualified sports scientists, physios are probably the ideal for this job. But all of that specific

487
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:45,160
preparation aside, probably the most important role for our coaches is management of the cognitive

488
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,280
bandwidth of the driver across a race weekend. So we discussed driving the car and the drivers will

489
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,360
have about seven hours in the vehicle across a race weekend. But on top of that, there's probably

490
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:01,160
10 hours of engineering meetings in which they get very, very deep in the data and the analysis

491
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,040
of what's happened on track. And then endless other hours of media and marketing commitments,

492
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,400
as well as just all managing the politics of any athlete's career. So as you referenced,

493
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,880
you might think about the NBL or the NBA, sorry, or the NFL, where most weeks you're going to have

494
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,000
two team bosses under one roof at any one time. But in Formula One, every two weeks you have 100%

495
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,080
of the competitors in the world, all 20 seats, they're all there. You've got all the team

496
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,800
principles, you've got a good percentage of the team owners, you've also got the principal

497
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,080
regulators of the sport and the owners and promoters. And all of those people are mingling

498
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,480
freely with the media, you know, there's nowhere to hide in a Formula One panic. It's a, it's a

499
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:50,840
big traveling family. So that does add a certain level of political, I wouldn't say tension, that's

500
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:57,880
probably pejorative or negative, but it does add a real social complexity to what these athletes

501
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,680
need to get out and do, which is ultimately drive the car. And our coaches get to know their

502
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,480
drivers, they manage a lot of their key relationships, they manage the time of their driver,

503
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,920
they will usually develop a role where they can sort of interface between the marketing team and

504
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,760
the media commitments and things and certainly recognize when the driver needs to be left alone,

505
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,480
where they may need a holiday, when they can push, when they can train, when they can do more or

506
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,480
less. So that's probably, and these drivers are all human beings. People think of professional

507
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:36,120
sport and especially Formula One as a place where everything is done with an unlimited budget

508
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,360
to absolute perfection. And I think Peter, you probably have contact with enough professional

509
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,200
athletes in various categories to understand that it's just not like that, is it? Regardless of the

510
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,120
funding, regardless of the techniques and the science and the innovation available,

511
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,880
professional sport is just about human beings and all their flaws and faults.

512
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,520
Well, yeah, I probably don't have nearly as much experience as you, but I think what's most

513
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,680
interesting to me is that even the people who are the best, most of them still have the same sorts

514
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,040
of doubts that quote unquote normal person would experience. And you see it across seasons where

515
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,480
people get into slumps and you get a bad bounce, you get things that just don't go your way for a

516
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,320
period of time and all of a sudden it sort of shakes your confidence. And I don't know. I mean,

517
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,040
I think in a sport like Formula One, I would have to guess that the toll of that is really great.

518
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:32,440
There is nowhere to hide. It's like tennis. There's no ambiguity about who's driving that car or

519
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,960
who's on that side of the tennis court or that side of the tennis court. And yes, there are

520
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,840
plenty of examples when a driver is doing everything right and the car fails. Certainly

521
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:46,600
Seb a couple of weeks ago, best line of the whole Formula One season, by the way, bring back the

522
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,600
bleep in F12s, V12s rather. I just have, like I said earlier, I think I just have great empathy for

523
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,560
the load that they must be under. And yeah, you can say, well, come on, they're athletes. They're

524
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,840
doing something really fun and it's really great. But I often wonder if it's as fun as we think it

525
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,280
is compared to, you know, I'm always reminded of Senna at the very end of the documentary,

526
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,920
talking about how you get the sense that Formula One just wasn't as fun to him at that point in

527
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,240
his life because he was hearkening back to his days of karting. He just kept saying like, there

528
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:23,720
was no politics. There was no money. It was just about the pure joy of racing. And I do wonder

529
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,520
when you talk about some of those obligations that these guys have in the political games that they

530
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,640
have to play and just the unhappiness. You referenced the younger drivers coming through.

531
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,720
Yeah, there's a lot of satisfaction to be derived, of course, from working with world champions and

532
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,520
winning championships. But actually one of the joys of my job as well as bringing these young

533
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,320
kids through and we typically start working with them in F3 or F2. Can you explain to folks the

534
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,240
difference between F1, F2, F3 and what does that look like? I mean, we're going to come back and

535
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,280
talk about the recent events of F2, but help people understand what those different formula mean.

536
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,000
So this has been greatly simplified in the last couple of years to the credit of the FIA. There's

537
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:09,160
a more or less straight pathway through F4, F3, F2 and then F1 nowadays. Formula Two occurs at

538
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,520
F1 race weekend. So the drivers in F2 are very much on the radar of the Formula One teams and

539
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,800
bosses. They're a car which is maybe five to 10 seconds a lap slower than an F1 car. A lot simpler

540
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,600
in terms of the controls. They're not these remarkable hybrid sort of engines. They've got

541
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,400
some similarities, probably the most important element being the tires. So tire management is

542
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:38,280
incredibly important in Formula One and the drivers in F2 and to a lesser extent F3 have to learn that

543
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,680
art in those categories. F3 cars are a little bit simpler again. Sort of no power steering, a lot

544
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:50,360
more physical, a lot more brutal to drive, but slower. And typically how old are the folks in F3

545
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:59,160
and F2? You're probably talking an age range of 16 to early 20s. These guys and girls are playing

546
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,440
for keeps. Every year could be the end of their driving career. So I commend anyone who has a bit

547
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,720
of time to watch the F2 racing. It's genuinely exciting. Week in, week out. And it's a big job

548
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,480
for the stewards to keep on top of driving standards because you know so much is at stake

549
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,280
in those categories. And then F4 is more or less the graduation point from Carts to Open Wheel

550
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,000
Racing and national F4 championships in many different countries that sort of feed through

551
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,080
to the higher categories. So the cars get a little faster and a little more complex as you go each

552
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:33,800
step up the chain. What's the role of money as one goes up the chain? When you look at a sport like

553
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:41,080
basketball, you referred to the NBA a moment ago. If you're good, if you live in the United States

554
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:47,960
and you are really good, you can make it to the NBA. You don't need any money. Usually that'll

555
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,760
take you through a college scholarship through to the NBA. But if you're exceptional enough,

556
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,640
you could even go straight from high school into the pros. Same is true in baseball. Again,

557
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,400
you almost always go through the minor leagues. You very rarely go straight from high school into

558
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,920
the major leagues, but you could go through college. You could go from high school into minor

559
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,240
league baseball, et cetera. But Formula One is not quite like that, which doesn't mean you have

560
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,240
to come from wealth, but you certainly have to get the endorsement of someone with a lot of money.

561
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,040
Where does that begin in the chain? So you take a really promising kid in a go-kart. How do they

562
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,960
get to Formula Four, Three, Two, and One? So first of all, I guess, karting as a hobby and karting

563
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:34,360
starts at the age of six or seven or eight years old. So it's not like strapping on running shoes

564
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,640
or football boots. You have to have a parent with a little bit of budget and a little bit of interest

565
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,400
in motorsport, even to start karting. Typically, motorsport can run within families. So often,

566
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,640
there's a father, usually there's a father who's competed and who has the funding to bring a young

567
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:57,880
competitor through. And then I guess as you get good at motor racing, there's two streams. There's

568
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:03,560
those who continue to pay their way and roll the dice and take their chances and hope that their

569
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:09,640
day will come. And there's others who are really an obvious, outrageous natural talent who will get

570
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,360
picked up by one of the three or four big teams and inducted into a junior driver program. So

571
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:21,080
those opportunities are relatively scarce. But if you're really good, you'll probably find yourself

572
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:26,280
aligned with one of the big teams. And are those geographically relevant? Are you more likely to

573
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,000
get one of those streams if you're coming out of Europe than if you're coming out of South America?

574
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,840
I think Europe is absolutely the geographical center of the sport. It's very difficult to

575
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,680
succeed from Asia or from any of the Americas without ultimately ending up in three or F2 in

576
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:48,600
Europe, because that's simply where the racing is conducted under the nose of the F1 teams. And

577
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:54,440
that's where those top levels of category actually unfold. So yeah, there's 20 seats in Formula One,

578
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:00,040
unlike tennis or golf or football, where there's 100 or 200 or more competitors at the very highest

579
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,720
level. These drivers are competing for an extraordinarily small number of positions. And

580
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,080
everybody who's there, regardless of how they've been funded, is there on some kind of merit.

581
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,960
They've had to win championships or do well in junior categories just to get the super license

582
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,880
points to be eligible to drive in F1. So I would posit that the depth that we see in the field

583
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:27,160
currently is by far the best it's ever been. And it's getting better every year and really adds to

584
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,640
the stories all down through the midfield where some of the most interesting action unfolds. It's

585
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,520
not just about the Mercedes cars or the Red Bull cars in recent years dominating at the front of

586
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,080
the field. There's all sorts of fun to be had. I think that's actually, and I heard that this

587
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:47,560
year for Netflix, both Ferrari and Mercedes are being filmed. Is that true? So the Netflix series

588
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,880
has focused on the midfield where a lot of these stories are. Mercedes have agreed to some limited

589
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,200
involvement this year. And I'm not sure actually what Ferrari is doing, but I think they probably

590
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,440
will feature to a limited extent. That'll be great because I'd love to see it. But I actually think

591
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:06,120
last year worked out really well not having them in the story because you could have just talked

592
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:11,720
about Ferrari and Mercedes the whole time, but to talk about everybody but them made it incredibly

593
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,200
interesting. I agree. It was one of the really powerful outcomes of the series. And it's actually

594
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,080
one of the hazards of work in the paddock at the moment. Trying to avoid the camera. Well, I spent

595
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:26,120
a lot of time talking to drivers about their health or their medical issues or the troubles

596
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,360
that they're having in their career. And it can be very easy to be having a private conversation

597
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:35,480
in a corner somewhere and suddenly find a Netflix boom microphone over your head or a camera for a

598
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,000
distance. To be fair, the team are relatively sensitive to that sort of thing. And it's probably

599
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,960
not just Netflix. I mean, we are performing our work in front of cameras day in, day out,

600
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,720
the entire year. And it's just something you've got to be a little bit mindful of.

601
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,960
How would you handicap the safety of Formula One today? To put it in perspective,

602
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,480
in the 1960s and in the 1970s, there was a very good chance that if you did this for a living,

603
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,840
you were not going to retire. In fact, it's kind of amazing the exceptions to that rule because

604
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:12,280
they're the ones that we tend to know about today. Most people, unless you're sort of a diehard fan,

605
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,880
you've forgotten the names of all the people that died. I think Yawken Rent is the only one to have

606
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,080
won a Formula One title posthumously. So by definition, if you're rattling off the names

607
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:28,840
of Formula One champs, they usually at least lived long enough to win. And many of them went on to die

608
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,320
prematurely in retirement. But the list of people that most people wouldn't remember,

609
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,880
like the Peter Revsons of the world. And I mean, everybody remembers Joel Vilnev, who never won a

610
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,960
title, but would still be considered one of the greats of all time. But there's this belief that

611
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:49,640
Formula One today is so insanely safe to is not be interesting. But one, do you think that that's

612
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:55,000
true? And two, can we learn anything about the recent fatality in Formula Two that can give us

613
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,320
a sense that no, actually, it's still a very dangerous sport. It's a really delicate argument,

614
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:05,160
because I think if we're honest with ourselves, the danger, there has to be a small element of

615
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,760
danger, at least to provide that depth of interest in what the drivers are doing. It has to be hard.

616
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,840
It has to be something that has to be something that we can't do. Yeah, exactly. So Formula One

617
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,400
is extremely safe. And we referenced all of the terrible things that happened in the 70s and early

618
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:27,000
80s. But there's a number of strands that track design is getting much better. The car design has

619
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,800
come on in leaps and bounds. And the trackside intervention, the medical and rescue services are

620
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,560
also light years ahead of what they used to be. But we have had three or four notable fatalities

621
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:44,040
over the last two decades. And so there is always some part of the Swiss cheese that lines up some

622
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,880
unaccounted for possibility that can still result in a death. And one of the big vulnerabilities

623
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,760
is a side on impact with a stationary vehicle. And unfortunately, we had a terrible accident

624
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,440
about six or eight weeks ago at the Belgian Grand Prix in Formula Two, where a car who'd

625
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:07,080
had a relatively innocuous spin Antoine Hubert was stranded side on stationary in the middle of the

626
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:14,120
track and was just hit at well over 200 kilometres an hour, 170 miles per hour by one of his fellow

627
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,760
competitors who was just unsighted. So we had this nose to side impact, which as good as the F2 and

628
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,800
the F1 cars are. And believe me, they're very, very good. The intrusion properties of the chassis,

629
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:31,480
the tub are exceptional, but there are some forces that you just can't account for in every situation.

630
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,240
Yeah, I'll never forget the press conference a couple of days after Senna died when Max Moseley,

631
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:43,800
then very new in his post as president said, and I thought he was so spot on by the way, he said,

632
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:50,440
the question isn't why did Senna crash? Because that's all anybody wanted to talk about. To this

633
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,320
day, there's still great debate about why he crashed. So the question is, why did he die?

634
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,400
And he said something I'm paraphrasing, and he said it much more eloquently.

635
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:07,800
You are at the highest level of the sport at the absolute limit of mechanical and human capability.

636
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:14,680
There are going to be crashes all the time, but nobody should die in one of these crashes.

637
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:20,360
I don't know if the statistics bear this out, but it certainly seems like they do just watching

638
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,800
races. It doesn't seem like there are any fewer crashes today, but there's no denying that the

639
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:32,360
fatalities are an epsilon fraction of what they used to be. And let's be honest, the crashes are

640
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:37,480
a massive part of the appeal of motorsport, especially to the more casual fan. It's spectacular

641
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,280
when a vehicle crashes and there's parts flying everywhere and it adds to the drama and the human

642
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,800
tension as well. So that will always be part of the sport, but as you reference, it needs to be

643
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,480
made as safe as possible. And you talked about the Senna footage driving around Monaco. And one of

644
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,720
the remarkable insights there is how high the drivers are sitting up out of the car. And

645
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,760
after Ayrton died, that was one of the big innovations. So the head and the shoulders of

646
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,320
the driver were much better protected. There's a shroud around the head and the helmet,

647
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:11,640
which limits any sort of intrusion. And the cockpit sides are much higher nowadays.

648
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:18,840
Senna's death probably had a greater impact on the safety of F1 than any single tragedy in the

649
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:24,520
history of this sport. When Jim Clark died, it's not like the sport changed that much. And Jim

650
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:30,040
Clark was to Formula One in the 60s almost. I mean, no one was quite to F1 what Senna was, but

651
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,360
comparable, certainly. There was an enormous amount of low hanging fruit in terms of safety

652
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,440
during that time. So a lot of the simple things were done. Yeah, yeah. I mean, but they still

653
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,200
drove unmartialed. They still did. I mean, I guess to this day, I don't think anybody knows

654
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,720
what actually happened to Clark's car. Yeah. Senna's death was the first in a generation,

655
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,360
really. There had not been a death apart from Roland Ratzenberger the previous day. There had

656
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,760
not been a death for 14 years. And so it was a bit of a shock. And so there was another step

657
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:02,200
change in safety for sure. The wheel tethers, all sorts of things. You recall, it wasn't even 10

658
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:07,080
years ago when Mark Webber had that unbelievable crash. You know the one I'm talking about?

659
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,400
In

660
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,160
To see the wheels not coming off was sort of unbelievable. Yeah. And he walked away, went

661
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,400
back and did his TV interviews. Yeah. It's very hard to injure yourself in a Formula One car.

662
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:24,280
I had a look at this in a couple of years ago now, but just the accident patterns in Formula One. And

663
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:31,160
it was interesting. I defined a medical incident as any time a driver was reviewed and assessed at

664
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:36,200
the track medical center, either because they had an injury or because they had a mandatory

665
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,040
attendance. And what forces a mandatory attendance? It's come down a little bit in

666
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:45,000
recent years, but it's 15 G on the car now. So there's an impact light which comes on in the car.

667
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,760
So the trackside marshal, the medical crew can tell if the impact has exceeded this amount,

668
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,480
then they automatically are assessed at the trackside medical center. It was actually

669
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,960
quite revealing to look at these incidents over a couple of years, because it was a little bit

670
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,720
counterintuitive to be honest. So more than two thirds of the incidents happened on the Sunday,

671
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,680
on the race day, and 90% were in dry weather. So this is medical incidents.

672
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:16,520
What fraction of those were in the first lap? I'd say most were in the early laps, but you do

673
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:22,120
definitely get mid to late race safety cars as well, where a car can go off at high speed by itself.

674
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,880
So the bigger impacts were on Sunday in the race. They were in the dry when drivers are perhaps

675
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,120
self-evidently pushing and they're doing their high speeds in close quarters with other cars.

676
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,200
But there were five rollover accidents, I think, during the time that I looked at,

677
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,520
only one of which resulted in injury. That was Fernando's massive crash in Melbourne a couple

678
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,240
of years ago. The impacts that happened in the wet, they're often very spectacular. There's lots

679
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:50,200
of parts flying off the car, but they tended to be sort of low to medium impact. And the real

680
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:56,760
high risk for injury was a 40 G plus impact in dry weather. Can you even put that in context for me

681
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,160
for what a normal person would experience on a freeway? We don't have the sensors, I know,

682
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,040
but can we even estimate? The impact on a car, it's a very crude measurement actually, because

683
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,680
it's measured sort of on the chassis. It doesn't really correlate that much with what the forces

684
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:16,040
are on the driver. And of course, the direction of the impact influences the vector of that measure.

685
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,760
And where is it picked up on the chassis? Because if it's before the chassis collapses,

686
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,680
then obviously a much lesser fraction of that would hit the driver, hopefully.

687
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,160
That's a very good question to which I do not know the answer. So the drivers also have this

688
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,640
in-ear accelerometer. They have three axis accelerometer in their earpiece,

689
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,000
and that's interrogated later. So there's a much more accurate data analysis, which comes after

690
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,600
an accident by the FIA. But usually that information, it comes not going to benefit

691
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,280
the treatment or the management of the driver on any given day. That's going to be a lesson

692
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:52,760
for the future. And that reflects, of course, the forces on the skull much more closely,

693
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,560
because it's actually sitting in the middle of the air. The driver can sustain very, very high

694
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:04,520
peak G forces if they're instantaneous or very, very rapid in terms of a spike of force. The

695
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,720
lower forces, if they're sustained over a longer period, and we're talking sort of

696
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,800
tenths of seconds rather than thousandths of seconds, those are the impacts that can do a

697
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,800
little bit more damage. That's interesting. And of course, if you come down to seconds,

698
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,080
holding 5G for two seconds on part of an arc is... Yeah, that's not going to injure you,

699
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,840
but it's because... It's not going to injure you, but boy, that's next level. People don't get,

700
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:33,720
I suppose, how tired drivers are after the race. I mean, I've got to see some drivers after races,

701
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:41,080
and they look as exhausted as someone who's, as you said, done two hours of a brutal crossfit

702
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,800
workout. And even walking up a flight of stairs looks like it's asking them a lot.

703
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,800
The cars took a step change in speed and power and grip. It was the beginning of 2017, so

704
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,800
they became much more physical to drive at that point. By and large, an experienced F1 driver

705
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,000
will cope with most scenarios. They'll be tired, but they're well within their physical capabilities.

706
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,040
How much weight will a driver lose during one of the harder races?

707
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,800
I guess Singapore is the archetypal physical race. It's a race which always goes for the full

708
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:17,880
two hours. It's a city-street race. It's got more corners than any other circuit, 24, 25 corners,

709
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:24,680
and it's all 90-degree turns at moderate speed. So in tropical heat and humidity, the drivers,

710
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:29,960
they will often lose three or four kilos in weight. They have in the car a drinks bottle.

711
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:36,440
If their engineer is being very kind to them, that might be 1.2 to 1.5 litres for a race like

712
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,320
Singapore. Usually, it's about half a litre, but it's hot. It's like drinking tea after a few

713
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:46,520
minutes in the car. So the driver area at the end of the Singapore Grand Prix is quite something to

714
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:52,040
behold. It's a driver coming in flushed and exhausted in a far away look in their eyes.

715
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,160
And that's a race where recovery is particularly important.

716
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,960
Now, there was a rule change a few years ago with respect to drivers' weight. What was that?

717
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,920
Yeah, the drivers have always had a pressure on them from the engineering teams to maintain

718
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:13,240
their weight at the minimum possible. And I guess you're trying hard and spending millions of

719
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:19,080
dollars in some cases to shave hundreds of grams off the car. So losing a kilo off the driver is

720
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:24,200
a relatively easy thing for the teams to ask with a favorable cost benefit analysis.

721
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:30,760
My favourite example of this was back when I used to be a sort of pathetic cyclist. I remember once

722
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,880
going to the bike shop to get some new bottle cages and they had like the regular cages were

723
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:42,920
this much. And then the super duper fancy carbon fibre cages that were 19 grams lighter were

724
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,480
10 times more. And the guy at the bike shop was trying to talk me into getting them. And I was

725
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:53,880
like, look, dude, before I go and drop an extra couple hundred bucks to save 19 grams, I've got

726
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,960
about two kilos I could afford to shed. I think I'll save my money for now. Yeah, fair cool.

727
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:05,240
So we were at the point where we had these younger drivers, these teenage drivers coming in,

728
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:10,360
a number of whom were quite tall. We had some of the older drivers like Mark Weber who were in a

729
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:15,400
continuous battle to save weight. And honestly, we were starting to see some unhealthy.

730
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,160
What was the minimum weight set at?

731
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:22,040
So minimum weight was car and driver combined. So at that time, there was no reference to the

732
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,040
driver's weight. It was just lose as much as possible. We had people running into problems

733
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,200
with overtraining, undernutrition. We had some eating behaviours coming out, which I was not

734
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,920
comfortable with. And we had Charlie Whiting, who unfortunately passed away earlier this year,

735
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,480
was the great technical leader of the sport for the last few decades. And to Charlie's credit and

736
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,880
the FIA's credit, I raised this issue with them and they acted very quickly. So we have a new

737
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,840
regulation this year where 80 kilos is the mark. That's the driver plus their helmet, their race

738
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:54,920
suit and their seat. And any driver who's below that level is ballasted up to 80 kilos. So it

739
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:59,960
basically takes the driver weight out of the equation to a large degree. And I must say the

740
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,600
drivers are absolutely delighted with this. They've just got the luxury of being a kilo or a kilo and

741
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,400
a half heavier. They can put on a little bit more muscle. Their nutrition is just not quite the

742
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,480
chore, the daily misery that it used to be. And I think we're in a much better place for that

743
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:20,520
regulation. Now, we've had women get very close to F1. I think there's even been women that have

744
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,840
competed in races, but not for a complete season. Is that correct? Yeah, there've been two or three

745
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:31,400
women who competed and one scored half a point, I think, in the 1970s when half points were awarded

746
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,960
from time to time. So it's been a pretty rare thing. We've had Susie Wolf drive in free practice

747
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:43,080
on a Formula One recandis recently, it was a couple of years ago, but it's been a long time since a

748
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:49,880
female driver has raced in a Sunday race. Are there any females in the F2, F3 pipeline? Not

749
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:56,440
obviously at the moment, no, but we have this year seen the advent of an all women's racing series in

750
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,880
Europe called W series. And we've been closely involved in that. And I must say it's been really

751
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:07,400
a huge success on many levels and a wonderful experiment. And I look forward to seeing that

752
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:13,160
develop over the next decade or so because it's a really vexed question, gender and motorsport.

753
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,920
I think there's a perception that driving F1 cars like being a fighter pilot, for example,

754
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:23,800
where I think intuitively men and women should be relatively equal. It's a fine motor and a

755
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:28,920
cognitive skill. But the truth is that as we've discussed, Formula One is an extremely physical

756
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:35,320
activity and it's not so much F1. I think F1 maybe does play to the strengths of women in some ways,

757
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:40,680
some of the social complexity, some of the spatial stuff, the power steering. I think a woman

758
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,960
absolutely can succeed in F1. But the problem comes at the grassroots levels of motorsport where we

759
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,080
A, have a very small pipeline of competitors coming through and B, the environment in F3,

760
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,160
for example, is pretty hostile. The cars are more physical to drive and they're up against,

761
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:01,320
frankly, teenage males with differences in risk taking behavior, testosterone levels.

762
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:06,440
There's both physical and- Right. So the lack of prefrontal cortex in these male drivers

763
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,600
is actually a competitive advantage to them at that stage in driving probably.

764
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:17,480
Again, I mean, there is academic literature of this kind of stuff in Olympic sports, for example.

765
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:22,440
There is some evidence for the physical and cognitive differences between male and female

766
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:28,200
athletes. But I think basically to find a woman who can succeed in F1, they are absolutely out

767
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,160
there, but they'll probably be an outlier. And by definition, then you have to be bringing more

768
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:38,920
women through the pipeline to find those outliers. And W series is a great first step, in my opinion,

769
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:44,120
towards just providing another avenue for women to get to the top levels of motorsport. And

770
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,440
certainly there are cultural things that need to change as well. I mean, fathers who are funding

771
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:53,320
motorsport careers undoubtedly favor sons at the moment, but hopefully that will change as well.

772
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:59,880
W series has proven to be a great TV success and the TV ratings have been great. The depth of the

773
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,600
driving talent has been, I think it's exceeded all expectations. The racing has been really good to

774
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:11,880
watch and they'll go to an expanded calendar next year and probably in the future more powerful cars

775
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:18,440
as the series becomes established. For perspective, what are the, if you go through the W series,

776
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,920
the formula three, two, and one, what are the relative horsepower of each of those cars?

777
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,800
Oh, I don't have that on the top of my head. Well, a formula one car today is less than a

778
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:33,000
thousand horsepower, correct? Yeah. The electrical power makes them very talky as well. So it's not

779
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,880
just a top line power. Yeah, the acceleration is staggering. Yeah. It's kind of amazing in the

780
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:44,440
eighties. You look at the MP4, four, which is 1988. I mean, that was a 1200 horsepower car.

781
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:51,560
Yeah. A beast, absolute beast. With no downforce and a manual gearbox. Yeah. Yeah. And back then

782
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,560
they had much more power available to them at qualifying. They would detune the car for the

783
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,640
race and they would use the engine once for an hour and then throw it away. Right. So the engine

784
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,680
was there to be blown up essentially at the maximum speed possible. It is crazy. This is

785
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:10,600
the other, I guess, environmental dimension to current formula one, the reliability of these

786
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:16,600
engines is unbelievable. They have three engines to do the entire season. Yeah. Explain to people

787
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:22,680
what a team has at their disposal. How many tires, how many gearboxes, how many engines,

788
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:28,920
what are they trying to manage over the course of these 21 races? And this is all part of the chess

789
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:34,360
game, part of the really interesting strategy. So you have, as I referenced, three engines across

790
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:38,760
and the engine comes in different parts. There's the heat recovery system, the kinetic recovery

791
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:44,360
system, the battery. So you can replace some of those parts individually without some penalty,

792
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,400
but basically you've got to do your Friday practices. You've got to do your Saturday qualifying

793
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:54,760
and a third of the races on one engine. And I mean, that again is an extraordinary step forward

794
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:00,760
from where we were even 2010, 2011. So principally a cost cutting measure, but something that

795
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:06,680
absolutely will flow through to the reliability of road cars. Tires, there's 12 sets of tires for

796
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:12,520
the weekend. And again, you have to select well in advance, eight or 12 weeks ahead of the race,

797
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,360
what tires are you going to take to that event. There's three compounds to choose from. So

798
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,920
the different compounds are either faster, don't last very long or a little bit slower in terms of

799
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,600
lap time, but they'll get you through a much bigger chunk of the race and the engineers and

800
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,840
the strategists need to work out what tires they're going to bring to a race weekend and then how

801
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,120
they deploy them in each session, which ones are you going to use to practice, which ones you're

802
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,040
going to qualify on and then leave yourself with enough options for the race. Let's talk about the

803
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:44,680
2021 rule changes. How many of those have been solidified? I think they're getting closer to

804
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:50,520
the final document. There were some meetings I think last week in Geneva between the regulators

805
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,640
and the various team bosses and other stakeholders. I think we have a bit of an understanding of

806
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,880
the fact that the car is going to have some simplified aerodynamic characteristics.

807
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:06,760
The engines probably will stick to something very similar to the current formula. And then the

808
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,560
budget cap will probably more apply to the teams and the operations and what they can do in terms

809
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,360
of the number of upgrades, the number of different parts, the level of activity that they can bring

810
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,440
to upgrading the car through the season. What kind of changes will take place with the tires?

811
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:25,240
The tires, there's going to be quite a big change. So we're going from 13 inch wheels to 18 inch

812
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:30,920
wheels. So the tire will be a lot smaller in profile, which is, it may not sound very significant,

813
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:37,000
but actually the tire currently is relatively old school, big balloony piece of rubber that

814
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
is a big part of the car's suspension at the moment. And bringing in an 18 inch wheel with a

815
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,920
very much narrower tire sidewall is going to change everything in terms of suspension and

816
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:54,120
breaking and aerodynamics over the cars. So that's a huge challenge for the engineers are working on

817
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:59,800
even as we speak. What got you interested in motorsport in the first place? In 1985, the

818
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,880
Australian Grand Prix returned to the International Formula One calendar. And so

819
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,400
for whatever random reason, I happened to watch the Australian Grand Prix this weekend in October

820
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:15,320
in 1985. And the TV coverage was done with a huge amount of enthusiasm. This was a big international

821
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:20,680
event coming to Australia. And I just caught the bug. I haven't missed a race in the 34 years since.

822
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:26,120
It's been an incredible ride. You were a triathlete, right? Did a little triathlon. I have to say not

823
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,000
a lot of training in the current schedule, but did my first race in 1988 and struggled through

824
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,560
a couple of Ironmans. Yes. Learned a lot about being an athlete actually, even by being a

825
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,480
hopeless weekend warrior. Yeah. What did you learn from that that translated to what you're doing

826
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:45,560
today? I think you have a basic understanding of what it's like to train. I think what it's like

827
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:50,040
to get up in the morning and have to do a training session that might be a bit of a chore on that

828
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:55,720
particular day. I think you have a fundamental understanding of the difference between aerobic

829
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,800
and aerobic training. Some of those really simple things. I mean, as we referenced, I come from an

830
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:05,640
intensive care, critical care background. So I rely very heavily on my coaches and my coaching

831
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,960
director, Pete McKnight, to implement the technicalities of coaching for our drivers.

832
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,520
This is not my strength or forte, but I think just having been an amateur athlete gives you a little

833
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,880
bit of appreciation for what it's like to have to stick to a training program and then compete even

834
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,760
on whatever level. Race day is a race day, right? No matter what the stakes are. Yeah. It's

835
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:29,240
interesting, right? I mean, it's sort of like you can take your own race as seriously as it's being

836
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:34,440
taken on the world's biggest stage. Yeah. And I look back now and Ironman in particular so badly.

837
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:39,400
There are so many things I would do in terms of nutrition, in terms of sleep, in terms of

838
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:44,360
structure of training now. I'm looking forward at some point in the next decade to having a second

839
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:48,760
triathlon career and implementing a lot of the things I've learned from my fantastic coaches

840
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:55,960
in recent times. It seems that the drivers today are much more tuned into nutrition and exercise

841
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:02,040
than drivers of 25 years ago. Again, Senna, I keep referencing him, was kind of the outlier. I mean,

842
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:07,800
the seriousness with which he took his fitness, with which he took his training was the stuff

843
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:13,560
of legends. That was not the norm. I mean, when you look back and you watch James Hunt, amazing

844
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:18,600
driver, not training. It's interesting that you mentioned James. I think probably Nicky

845
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,760
Lowder was the first and Nicky in recovering from his horrendous injuries in the Nürburgring in 1976

846
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,960
was maybe the first example of somebody who really implemented a serious physical training regimen,

847
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,160
but certainly Senna was a big standout in his time. And then Michael Schumacher perhaps built

848
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,880
on that into the current era. But yeah, the benchmark keeps rising and most of the drivers

849
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,920
even if they're not particularly interested in the absolute peak of physical preparation,

850
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,800
they have a pretty reasonable understanding of what a strength workout is and what their aerobic

851
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,600
capacity needs to be to get through a two hour race. So I didn't know this about you until

852
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:01,320
somewhat recently, but you survived cancer and it was quite advanced. I sort of don't think of that

853
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:07,000
time as any sort of great survival threat. Like an F1 season, it all happened so fast. It all

854
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,960
moved so quickly. But 10 years ago, just last month, actually, I was working in the north of

855
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:17,640
Australia with the flying doctors in a very remote area. And I had developed testicular cancer, which

856
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:23,080
I diagnosed by myself on one of the very early portable ultrasound machines we had up there.

857
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,160
As you know, it's a cancer if you had to choose a cancer to have, it's the one with

858
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:33,320
the best survival prospects, you know, in excess of 90%. So whilst it was, you know, it was real

859
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:39,000
chemotherapy and real surgery. You did not have seminomatous cancer, right? So it was non-seminoma.

860
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,280
And I actually did have pulmonary metastases as well. And looking back now, it was a relatively

861
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:49,080
rough ride. I had some thrombotic complications as well, had a pretty profound paraneoplastic

862
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:54,280
thrombophilia. Can you explain to folks what that means? So in some cancers, in some people,

863
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,640
you'll develop a clotting tendency. And in retrospect, the first day I went in for a scan,

864
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,120
I had an IV drip put in and a sort of a little clot formed all the way up my arm,

865
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,280
that should have been a bit of a warning sign. But you then have a permanent catheter implanted to

866
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,400
receive the chemotherapy drugs, a portacath. And that sits in the large vein next to the

867
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:18,280
heart and mind, in fact, clotted up completely. So there's something called superior vena cava

868
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:23,720
syndrome, which every medical student sees in the textbooks. And I had never seen really in real

869
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,800
life. And I woke up one morning, looked in the mirror. And yeah, I had basically a complete

870
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:33,000
blockage of blood returned to the heart from the upper part of my body. And but it was a an

871
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,120
interesting lesson in the realities of being a patient. I think I had always been a relatively

872
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:43,320
empathetic doctor, but just the logistics of having to go to appointments, having to be stabbed with

873
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:48,600
needles multiple times a week, the fatigue of the drugs, having to find a car parking space at the

874
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,480
hospital every day, I think it just gives you a great appreciation for the experience of being

875
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:59,000
ill and being a patient. And I had access to really good private care, I had access to

876
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,880
virtually my handpicked specialists in the different fields that I utilised. But even then

877
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:09,560
things go wrong, you're still subject to the same vagaries of nursing and nursing shifts and blood

878
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,120
collectors and adverse reactions to drugs, no matter who you are, we're all still human, right?

879
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:19,240
Was there any point during your illness when it wasn't a given that you were going to survive,

880
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,960
even getting through all the chemo? So not to get too deep into the weeds, but I did have

881
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,600
these lung lesions which... Yeah, I mean that stage four non-seminomatous

882
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,160
testicular cancer is not a walk in the park or a given that you're going to survive.

883
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:40,920
Lance Armstrong also had stage four non-seminomatous testicular cancer. His odds were 50-50 at the time

884
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:45,480
of his diagnosis. I mean, mine were a lot better than that, I think closer to 80 or 90%, but it's

885
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:50,440
still a non-significant, non-trivial chance of death, I suppose. But I'd travelled in Africa a

886
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:56,200
lot. I'd had a couple of screening chest x-rays in the past, an occupational screening x-ray,

887
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,160
and then another one when we... Was this part of your TB screening?

888
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:04,040
We'd actually had an intensive care patient who turned out unexpectedly to have a diagnosis of TB,

889
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:09,800
so the staff in the unit had been screened. So I'd had two little lesions on my lungs which were

890
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,840
known from previous x-rays, whether it was an old granuloma from somewhere in Africa or whether it

891
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,560
was... I think one of them was probably an intra pulmonary lymph node. So there were these lesions

892
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,240
and they were on the scan and nobody sort of really knew if that was significant, but lo and

893
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:28,040
behold, they actually disappeared with the chemotherapy. So it was really only at the end

894
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:34,920
of the process that it was absolutely understood to have been a stage four tumor. So I didn't get to

895
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:38,760
necessarily live through all the anxiety of that and it was only in retrospect that

896
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:44,360
the understanding was there of perhaps the prognosis wasn't as good as we had thought all along.

897
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,000
So how much time are you on the road each year now?

898
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,840
I had about 40 nights in my own bed in Switzerland last year.

899
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,440
You don't live in Australia anymore?

900
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,160
No, I'm a Swiss resident present. I do get to spend about seven or eight weeks per year at

901
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:02,920
home in Australia. So we have a race in Melbourne, so get a little bit of time before and after that

902
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,880
event. And then around some of the Asian races, I try to sneak home for a week. It's always very

903
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,840
refreshing to see friends and family and have a surf as well.

904
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:17,560
So how do you manage this toll of the schedule on you? I mean, your job is to take care of

905
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:22,120
everybody else and manage the toll, but what do you do to manage it in yourself and your team?

906
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:26,600
I mean, you have a very large team, of course, of people like Pete and Tommy, and then of course,

907
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,400
all of these trainers that are working with the drivers. I mean, how do you manage yourself and

908
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,120
that team?

909
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:36,280
Managing a business, as you probably know, as a clinician, is not necessarily something that

910
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:41,800
comes naturally. So it's pretty demanding. And honestly, if it wasn't a sport that I had a great

911
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,760
passion for, I wouldn't do this. If I was invited to a similar job in football or basketball or

912
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:51,400
something else, I probably wouldn't do it. It's passion for the sport and living in the middle of

913
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:57,480
the history that you make in appreciation of where the sport has come from that makes it work.

914
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:02,280
I think it's been really difficult to do any sort of structured formal physical training.

915
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:08,840
I have tried to pay a lot of attention to sleep. It's very difficult at this time of year in terms

916
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,920
of the travel schedule, but I really try and prioritize seven or eight hours sleep wherever

917
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:19,320
we do, wherever we go. And nutrition, I suppose, I've used a lot of time restricted eating in

918
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:23,560
recent years, as you saw last year when you visited us in the paddock, we're presented with

919
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:31,560
an abundance of really palatable, excellent food and team buffets. And it's remarkable to the extent

920
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,960
to which you can eat quite healthy if you choose to. But there's certainly some desserts there,

921
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:40,440
which are hard to pass up. And I think time restricted eating and a little bit of fasting,

922
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:46,360
not to the extent of long and fast like you've famously experiment with yourself, Peter, but

923
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,280
that stuff can be really powerful. And just trying to get outdoors, get in the sunlight,

924
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,680
it might be only every three or four weeks that you get to get outdoors three or four days in a

925
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,600
row, but just try and get on the bike, try and paddle, try and do something and also move

926
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:03,080
throughout the day. I'm lucky that in the F1 paddock, we are on our feet and getting our

927
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:09,480
10,000 steps almost in the course of a routine workday. So that helps. So basically, you got

928
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:13,320
to be a little more careful with respect to your sleep and your exercise than your default

929
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:18,520
environment would allow you to be. You could very easily sort of fall off a cliff doing this. Yeah,

930
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,680
it could be an extremely unhealthy job. And part of our work is managing the team members through

931
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:29,880
their same experiences. We have two or three of the teams with an embedded coach or physiotherapist.

932
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,640
And so we try to pass on this kind of insight, these healthy habits to the teams as well. And

933
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:39,880
many of the traveling team members are very invested in this. Others are less interested,

934
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:45,320
but I think it has an impact for sure. What have you not yet brought to this sport that you think

935
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:53,320
you're capable of bringing through your team? So Formula One is perceived as being the pinnacle

936
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:58,600
of excellence in every area, certainly in motorsport. And in terms of the engineering

937
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,120
and the development of the car, that's absolutely true, probably operationally as well. On the human

938
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:09,320
side, honestly, there's still a lot of low hanging fruit. And we've spent a number of years, Pete and

939
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:14,440
myself, just honestly getting basic systems in place. Our coaches have a fair bit of latitude

940
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:19,320
and freedom to work within their individual skills. And very importantly, they work within

941
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:26,360
the individual skills and strengths and weaknesses and attention spans of their own driver. So making

942
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:31,800
our system a system though has been priority. So it's just getting everybody doing some basic

943
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:37,640
fundamentals of monitoring, working to a schedule of assessments across the year. So that job is

944
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:43,480
done now. And I think we're looking to start to innovate. And I think, again, in any sport, there

945
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,680
are literally hundreds of scientifically proven interventions that you can make for an athlete.

946
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:54,280
But the art of what we do is fitting that into the lifestyle and the travel schedule. And again,

947
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,680
the attention span and interest level of the athlete that's in front of you. So I think there

948
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:04,360
are things that we can do in terms of cognitive skills, perhaps eye training, perhaps proprioception.

949
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:08,280
I don't know what those things are yet, but I'd like to study them in a little more detail.

950
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:13,800
There's an incredible lack of physiological monitoring of any driver in the car, even now.

951
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,200
And perhaps we can talk about that a little bit in a moment. But the other interface probably is

952
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:23,640
bringing together the way that an engineer manages their driver across a race weekend

953
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:28,200
with the coaching that we are doing. And we've started over the last year to really

954
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,960
try to get the engineers to work more closely with the performance coaches. And likewise, to

955
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,920
give our performance coaches a bit more engineering knowledge and understanding of what the overlays

956
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,560
of a good lap time looks like, what it means to brake later, to steer differently, and try to get

957
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,040
those two streams of information coming to the driver to talk to each other and integrate a lot

958
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:56,520
more. Why is there such a dearth of physiologic information going back to the paddock? I mean,

959
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:03,080
when you sit in one of these garages and look at the information that's coming in about the car,

960
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:10,840
it makes the information that the mission control was getting from the moon landing.

961
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:17,080
There is more information coming in about tire pressure than the entire Apollo 11 rocket going

962
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:21,400
to the moon. And yet you don't know their heart rate. You don't know their heart rate variability.

963
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:26,680
You don't know their electrolytes. You don't know fluid status. There are so many things about the

964
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:31,160
actual driver you don't know. In fact, do you know anything about the driver in real time?

965
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:36,440
In the car, very little. And there's a few historical reasons for that. One is a simple

966
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:42,200
matter of the regulations. So there's race suits and the fireproof underwear that the drivers are

967
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:47,320
wearing are heavily, heavily regulated. So right down to the stitching on the sponsor labels,

968
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:52,200
there's actual standards for that kind of stuff. And it has to be tested and homologated.

969
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,480
So there's a safety issue there.

970
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,720
Yeah, there's been a real limitation of what you can attach to a driver in terms of physiological

971
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:04,360
monitoring. On top of that, the teams will not add any weight to the car. So even 100 grams of some

972
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:09,320
kind of measuring or monitoring device in the vehicle would not be acceptable. And then whilst

973
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:15,400
what we do is absolutely incredibly valued in terms of promoting human performance, it's often

974
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:20,920
a bit of a low priority compared to the time pressure that's involved in just getting a car

975
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:25,800
out on the track and getting it developed. The bandwidth for any sort of human innovation has

976
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:32,920
traditionally been relatively narrow. The FIA also mandate that any sort of monitoring on the driver

977
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:39,800
has to be purely for a safety purpose. So at present, there's not a lot of interest from

978
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,120
the governing body in terms of performance or physiological measurement for understandable

979
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:49,240
reasons. But wouldn't those translate to safety? For example, we don't really have a sense of how

980
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:55,400
often accidents are taking place because of fatigue that is physiologically predictable.

981
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,720
Yeah, indeed. I think we're a long way from measuring that probably. But this last two years,

982
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:05,320
we've had a biometric sensor glove introduced for the driver. So they have essentially heart rate

983
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:10,280
and oxygen saturations measured in the driving glove. And the defined purpose of that is so that

984
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:17,480
the trackside intervention services can see what the driver is physiologically doing after an impact

985
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:22,520
whilst they are on their way to the scene. So that's a first step. And I suspect we'll be a

986
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:27,160
little more liberal in the future. There's going to be some pressure from television and digital

987
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:31,640
streaming as well to measure physiological parameters of the driver in the car as well,

988
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:38,040
which I must say is not an idea that has received such a warm reception from the drivers themselves.

989
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:42,280
It's a potential competitive advantage and information advantage that they're giving away

990
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:47,160
to their competitors. But I think we'll see more of this. We're looking at a couple of devices now,

991
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:50,840
which will probably be compatible with the regulations. And we'll have a couple of projects

992
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,280
potentially next year where we're measuring in the car a lot more.

993
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:59,320
How long does it take a driver to learn a new circuit? So this race in Vietnam next year,

994
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:03,640
how long does a driver have to prepare to learn that in a simulator?

995
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,800
It's probably less than you think. The good drivers will get out there within half a dozen

996
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,200
laps and they should be pretty close to on the pace. You know, they'll take another 10th or two

997
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:18,040
off across a race weekend as they get better. But the SIM is a very important part. They'll

998
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:23,560
prepare for each circuit specifically with a simulator session, but it's not the same as

999
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,440
being out there sitting in the seat and feeling the forces.

1000
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:31,800
So as they go from this weekend, let's just say when we're done with this race on Sunday night,

1001
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:36,920
two weeks from now, they'll be in Brazil. So that's a long enough stretch that many of them

1002
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,960
I assume will go home. Everyone will go home for sure. Yeah.

1003
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:45,080
When did they start getting in the simulator and driving in our Lagos before they get down there?

1004
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:50,280
So simulators are a limited resource. And depending on the infrastructure of the team,

1005
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:54,040
there will be junior drivers, there'll be test drivers, there'll be others who need to use the

1006
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:58,760
SIM. So probably somewhere next Wednesday or Thursday, most of the race drivers will

1007
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:02,680
have their day or their half day in the simulator. They are learning the circuit for sure, but

1008
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,240
actually a big part of their job on that day is evaluating other aero parts and other upgrades to

1009
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:12,360
the car. So it's not just there for the luxury of the driver learning the circuit.

1010
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,720
Is it expected the driver learns the circuit in the off season and they've-

1011
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:20,120
At the European circuits, they will have driven most of the circuits many times in the junior

1012
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:25,160
categories. It's in these long haul flyaway races where a rookie driver will be encountering the

1013
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:29,240
circuits for the first time. And honestly, they'll have a lot of engineering briefings across the

1014
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:33,960
weekend to help familiarization, but they'll get into the swing of the circuit within a handful

1015
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:39,160
of laps and then build on that across the race weekend. By Sunday, they should have a very limited

1016
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:43,320
disadvantage to people who've been there before. It's still amazing to me when I think about how

1017
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,560
long it takes me to learn circuits. You've got to remember, I guess each circuit is different

1018
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,880
from year to year. The adjustments that are being made to the car from corner to corner

1019
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:56,200
will change with the characteristics of the car from year to year. So even people who've been

1020
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:01,720
there before are kind of relearning how to drive the circuit in this year's car to achieve the

1021
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:08,280
optimal lap time. It's unbelievable. I don't know that I'll ever be able to successfully communicate

1022
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:14,680
to my friends, to my family, to listeners of this podcast who if anyone's not a fan of Formula One

1023
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,360
and they're still listening at this point, that would be kind of a minor miracle, I guess. But

1024
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:23,880
this has been a great discussion because I think it has probably been the most complete discussion

1025
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:29,000
I've brought to the podcast of this sport, why I think it's so special and what's involved in it.

1026
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,040
I think that this sort of physical, emotional, and cognitive piece, I don't think we've talked

1027
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:38,200
much about the emotional. I think we've talked about the physical for sure. The cognitive

1028
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:44,760
overload is staggering. I don't consider myself one who lacks in cognition, but I could never

1029
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:49,000
manage the cognitive load that these guys manage. But then there's this other piece, which is the

1030
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,320
emotional piece, which is it's not a sport where getting pissed off does you much good.

1031
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,680
Emotional control in the car is incredibly important. And it's in the car, it's in front

1032
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:06,200
of the media, because you can easily with an errant comment, create an enormous amount of stress

1033
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:11,880
next week at the next race, let alone contract renegotiations and fighting for one of those

1034
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:18,680
precious 20 seats. And as we reference, we're dealing now with teenagers in many cases and

1035
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:24,360
teenage drivers are just like other teenagers. We may have an enormous amount of wisdom to impart,

1036
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:30,840
but there's a point where a young person perhaps doesn't even have enough life experience to

1037
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:37,560
understand the lesson that they're being given. And it's gratifying, obviously, to see a driver

1038
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,400
develop through the junior categories. And then some point in their early 20s, the pennies start

1039
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,720
to drop and the pieces start to come together. And they just have gathered enough experience to

1040
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:52,520
understand how all the strands of their behavior and their approaches to things and the motives and

1041
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:57,720
the layers of social complexity around them all come together and can be coordinated in a way

1042
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:03,640
that's to their advantage. And they have relationships, they have family relationships,

1043
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:08,760
they may gel well with their race engineer, there may be other team members that they have to

1044
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:13,320
manage more judiciously. So all of this stuff is going on all the time. And it's a privilege to be

1045
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:18,840
there, sort of helping and guiding in some way, making a small contribution to not only growing

1046
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:24,040
competitive race drivers, but good human beings in this crazy sport that we live in. Do you think

1047
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:29,880
2021 will sort of reshuffle the order of the teams a bit? There's reason to think that the midfield

1048
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:36,680
teams might have their day more often, we may get more variability occasionally in the results. But

1049
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:41,400
whenever there's a large regulation change, the teams with the most resources are the ones who

1050
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:46,920
will exploit that to the best of their abilities. And you do risk the top teams getting further

1051
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:51,800
ahead for a period of time. Although with the last reg change, we did see a big swap between

1052
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:57,720
Red Bull and Mercedes. Indeed. So Mercedes, to their credit, were well ahead of their competitors

1053
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,800
on the engine development. Red Bull and Ferrari were busy fighting for championships through

1054
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:07,720
2013, 2014. And Mercedes had put a lot more resource into the new engine regulations and

1055
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:12,920
probably stole the march on everybody by a year or more. And that's taken five or six years for

1056
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,960
that convergence to happen. You add aerodynamic changes on top of that. And I think it's going

1057
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:21,960
to be a fascinating year. What's been the biggest surprise for you this year performance wise? Has

1058
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:28,680
it been the sort of mini sort of performance comeback of McLaren? What has surprised you?

1059
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:33,800
We've got a long history with McLaren. I worked closely with McLaren for a number of years. And

1060
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:38,520
it's a team that's had a massive cultural transformation in the last 18 months. And

1061
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:42,440
I think you're right, it has been a surprise to see how quickly they've started to turn things

1062
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:47,720
around. They're the solid number four team and they've had some really bad luck and they're still

1063
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:51,400
right there in number four. They really are the best of the rest. Yeah, absolutely. And you can

1064
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:59,000
make a case that the traditional private team that's not a manufacturer owned team could be a

1065
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,560
truly endangered species in Formula One now. So it's to the credit of everyone at McLaren

1066
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,960
who's been able to turn that project around, bringing a lot of fresh momentum, fresh blood.

1067
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:12,360
And I think they're going back to Mercedes engines in a couple of years. I think their future is

1068
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:16,920
looking pretty good at the moment. Luke, this has been awesome. It's so late here in Austin

1069
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,000
tonight. I'm just glad we got to record this. I knew that it was going to be really hard for us

1070
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,320
to find a window to talk. So I'm grateful that we've been able to find this one and I'm grateful

1071
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:30,680
for all the insight you've shared with us. And I never get tired of talking about Formula One with

1072
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:35,480
you. So thank you for humoring me, continuing the discussion and doing so in front of a few other

1073
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:40,440
people. Yeah, well, we've got a couple more days to dissect a lot more detail about the sport.

1074
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:44,920
Can't wait to do so at the track. I appreciate the opportunity, Peter, particularly to talk to

1075
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,600
a North American audience about this sport because it is traditionally very European centric. And I

1076
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:56,440
think anyone who watches the sport for a couple of months or watches the Netflix documentary gets

1077
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:02,040
into a little bit of the soap opera, understands a few of the personalities there. There's a richness

1078
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:06,760
there, which is pretty difficult to stop watching once you're into it. I agree. I actually just had

1079
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,480
this discussion with my wife yesterday is tell me another professional sport where you can name

1080
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:15,880
every athlete. Yeah, indeed. There's only 20 of them. I know every one of them by name. I'd

1081
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:21,080
recognize any one of them if I bumped into a grocery store or an airport. And as you said,

1082
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:27,560
the Netflix special gives you a layer of nuance in the tension that you don't even catch off TV.

1083
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:32,280
And it shows you the drama that exists up and down the field, even when it's not about winning the

1084
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,920
championship. Yeah, very special. Thanks for the opportunity. All right, Luke, I'll see you

1085
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:42,920
tomorrow. Indeed. Looking forward to it. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.

1086
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:47,320
If you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership

1087
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:52,600
program that allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads.

1088
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,080
It's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of this attrition.

1089
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:01,800
Now to that end, membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass,

1090
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:06,200
comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person,

1091
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,920
thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these.

1092
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:16,120
Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely.

1093
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:21,800
Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen

1094
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:27,240
to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast, typically less than five

1095
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,560
minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics,

1096
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:36,200
and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

1097
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,120
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1098
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:46,120
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,

1099
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:50,280
and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you
