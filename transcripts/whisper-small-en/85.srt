00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,400
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Inigo Sanmala. Inigo is a

46
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,040
assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine where his areas of research

47
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,320
focus on exercise metabolism, nutrition, sports performance, overtraining, diabetes, cancer, and

48
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,520
critical care. And I realize at least one of you at this moment is thinking, how in God's name can

49
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,720
one person study all of those things? And the answer is if you come out of the lens of the

50
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,400
mitochondria, it turns out you can have a breadth of focus that covers all those things. And of course

51
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,360
that's exactly what Inigo does. He studies mitochondrial performance and mitochondrial

52
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,480
efficiency. And it's based on that that the moment he and I met a year ago, it was a sort of love at

53
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:00,120
first sight. And we've been geeking out together ever since. Inigo has had a profound impact on

54
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,720
my training, the way I talk to my patients about exercise, and the way I've thought about

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,720
longevity through the lens of mitochondrial performance. He is an internationally renowned

56
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,360
applied physiologist. He's worked for at least 20 years with many professional teams,

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,880
elite athletes across all sports. He himself is a remarkable athlete, which we barely get into. He's

58
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,240
so modest and unassuming. He currently works with a number of professional cycling teams at the

59
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,920
highest level, including at the level of the Tour de France. He's pioneered a number of things

60
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,160
that we get into here, everything from using high frequency ultrasound to assessed glycogen levels,

61
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,800
to more importantly, ways in which we can use biopsies at the invasive level and blood tests

62
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,680
at the less invasive level to draw on the insights of mitochondrial performance. It would take me an

63
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,680
hour to simply explain the treasure trove of stuff we explore in this episode. So I'm not even

64
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,720
going to try to say what we get into other than if you're interested in mitochondria, if you're

65
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,960
interested in fitness, if you're interested in exercise, if you're interested in metabolic health,

66
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,040
all of the above. I think you just need to listen to this one and take my word for it without seeing

67
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,720
the running commentary. The show notes, of course, will be especially important for this one because

68
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,240
some of this stuff just is better explained through pictures than words. And of course,

69
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,200
there will be a nice effective table of contents there. So without further delay,

70
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,760
please enjoy my conversation with Inigo.

71
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,000
Inigo, thank you so much for making time to sit down today in your new office here.

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,920
Thank you very much, Peter. It's my pleasure and honor that you're here with us at the University

73
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,040
of Colorado at the School of Medicine. I emailed my team. I emailed Nick and Bob and a couple of

74
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,880
the guys today when I was on the way over here. I was on the plane and I was reviewing my notes.

75
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,960
And I thought, I am so excited to sit down with you today and Rick tomorrow, because we've had so

76
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:07,000
many kind of off the cuff sidebar conversations about mitochondria, mitochondrial function,

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,880
health, efficiency, etc. And it's sort of like we never have enough time. It's like 15 minutes here

78
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,960
and 12 minutes there and an email here and an email there. But it was in preparing for this,

79
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,800
the team helped me really kind of put a lot of my thoughts together. But I think

80
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,720
before we kind of get into the really hardcore stuff around mitochondria, which is something

81
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,400
that I think anybody who's interested in health at any level, whether it's really at the deep cellular

82
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,360
level or just at the level of I want to live as long as I can, as healthy as I can, everybody sort

83
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,320
of has a sense that all roads point to the mitochondria. But your path to getting there to

84
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,240
me is particularly interesting because it starts with looking at athletes and you yourself, even

85
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,800
though you downplay it a lot, you were quite the athlete growing up. So you grew up in Spain and

86
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,920
what sports did you play? Yeah, I grew up in Spain and I played for Real Madrid for the academy for

87
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,960
six years. And I was always very passionate about sport. Then I, when I turned 16, I discovered

88
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,240
cycling and that's the way I changed sports. So my dad still thinks that was the dumbest decision

89
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,760
of my life. But is that true statistically with a child growing up in Spain who's already in the

90
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,960
feeder program for Real Madrid, would they have a better chance of having a career as a professional

91
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,520
football player than a professional cyclist? That's hard to say, but when you're already

92
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,440
at that age in Real Madrid, you can be getting to the top team is very difficult obviously, but

93
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,720
definitely be a feeder to other smaller teams. That's a higher possibility, but you never know,

94
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,520
but you have to follow your passion, I guess. And I followed it and I changed to cycling and

95
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,600
I got to race professionally for two years at a low level. So I always say that I admitted I'm

96
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,080
a truncated and a frustrated professional athlete because I never got to the top. But that said,

97
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,200
I learned a lot and it's been a school of life all my life since I was nine years old. I've been

98
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,200
in the high level of competition up until today on the other side of the table, working with

99
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,440
athletes. And that's what I became very familiar with everything related to the elite sports and

100
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,520
that everything that involves. I don't think most people who have not themselves been on a bicycle

101
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,280
and trying to do something at a reasonably high level can appreciate that even being a professional

102
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,480
quote unquote low level, I guess what you're saying by that is you were not necessarily on a team that

103
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,200
was even going to go to the big grand tours and such, but I still think most people don't understand

104
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,360
the level, how much higher that is above a general fitness athlete type of thing. So when you were

105
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,960
at that level, what was your specialty? Were you a time trialist? Were you, you look too tall to

106
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,800
be a climber, but who knows what you weighed back then? Yeah, I was very skinny though. You're

107
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,440
taller than me. I'm like 5'11. Okay, so you're an inch taller. But I used to be 143, 145 pounds.

108
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,960
Oh wow. So I was very skinny. So I used to be a good climber. I was good overall, but I'm better

109
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,560
as a climber. But yeah, I, is that I appreciate it now when I see people who are category ones or

110
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,480
twos or threes as a cyclist or so that their fitness level is very good, that definitely my

111
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,400
fitness level was better. But at the same time, there is like a whole world between my fitness

112
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,280
level and what the two of the friends guys have. It is unbelievable when I was sort of going

113
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,800
through category five, four, three, two, by some metrics, I could maybe time trial at the level of

114
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,640
category two, three, but of course, my climbing and sprinting and everything else would have been

115
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,240
like a category four. And you realize that the guy who's category one, the guys I used to train

116
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,880
with who are collegiate athletes who are exceptional at category one, they're still not even pro.

117
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,240
They're still a step between them and a domestic pro. And then the domestic pro to get from that

118
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,400
level to a European pro and then the European pro to get to a major team. And then to be on a major

119
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,160
team and the difference between the GC contender and everybody else. We're talking about log orders

120
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,080
of ability. It's not subtle. No, and I have all the data from all these years collecting the data.

121
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,360
And I know very well the physiological parameters typical of a top junior athlete or category three

122
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,720
category two, one domestic pro average pro tour, cyclists and best of the best. And the difference

123
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,880
is amazing, but they're very significant. You can really categorize people accordingly. We're going

124
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,400
to come back and start to talk about professional cycling and things. And there's so many things I

125
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,880
want to talk about because I think for also the person who's not immediately wed to the sport,

126
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,960
might too easily want to dismiss the accolades of these athletes and the physiologic prowess

127
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,560
as simply, well, you know, those guys all use drugs. And while that's probably true at some level

128
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,720
with respect to some drugs and certainly a certain class of athletes, it in no way diminishes what

129
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,000
their physiology looks like completely off drugs. So we'll come back to all that, but going to you.

130
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,840
So after two years at a professional level, what made you decide, I'm not going to continue doing

131
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,520
this. I'm going to pursue my education and the other things that you've gone on to do.

132
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,840
I realized that it's very difficult and you need to be in the right place at the right time,

133
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,120
at the right moment, and that different planets need to be aligned. It is not just the best.

134
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,080
Always get up there to call it destiny, call it whatever. But a lot of things have to happen to

135
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,600
become a pro and I were not on my side. What at the same time I needed to make a decision either

136
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,000
trying to get an education that can not assure me, but at least give me some future,

137
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,120
professionally speaking, outside the sport or try to go for the sport where the planets were

138
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,320
not aligned. I didn't know if I could even make it and it would take that sacrifice. So that's

139
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:44,680
what I decided. I think this is not good for me. And then as I was studying also, I had a good

140
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,520
possibility of doing a very good internship at a top, if not the top sports medicine clinic in Spain.

141
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,120
In fact, the famous PRP therapy was born in that clinic. And that's where I said,

142
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,040
I had a good possibility to start internship and then became a part-time job. And at that time I

143
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,920
said, okay, I'm just going to stay here and continue. And how long have you been here at

144
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,440
the university of Colorado? 11 years. Okay. Now you and I met through an interesting circumstance.

145
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,680
It's a funny story. I don't know if you remember the very first time, but I had just flown into

146
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,400
Abu Dhabi and I think I came straight from the airport to the training facility and it was like

147
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,440
11 o'clock at night or something. And you put me right on the bike and we did a VO2 max test. And

148
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,520
which anybody who's done a VO2 max test on a bike knows there's nothing very pleasant about it.

149
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,040
You've got this mask that is incredibly restrictive. I hadn't done one since I stopped cycling. So that

150
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,680
was probably six, five years or six years. And then I think you weren't happy with the air mixer

151
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,880
because we were getting weird numbers. And it was at some point, I think when I hit about 50 milliliters

152
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,160
per milligram per kilogram, we sort of said that's enough. And that was a good thing because

153
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,160
I don't think I had much more. It's amazing how much you lose when you stop training that zone.

154
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,520
I never thought there could be a day when my VO2 max could be below 50. I thought it'll be 50

155
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,400
when I'm a hundred, right? That's not true. It really falls away. Yeah, it falls apart. Yeah.

156
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,840
So I would be surprised if I could hit 55 today actually. But we connected immediately because

157
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,320
it was a great point in my life where I was almost, I was sort of looking for direction

158
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,440
as a former, I don't even want to use the word athlete to describe myself, but as a person who

159
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,960
formerly took training very seriously to now someone who was trying to think about reshaping

160
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,480
my training around longevity, it was a perfect collision of ideas because I was sort of in

161
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,480
search of what to really focus on. And what we immediately clicked over was your protocol for

162
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,000
zone two training, which you were instituting heavily with the UAE team and other folks that

163
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,960
you were training there. And the rest is history. I mean, it's really completely shaped the way I

164
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,840
think about using this type of training as a way to improve mitochondrial function and as a way to

165
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,480
test it. I almost think at this point for the listener, we should pause for a moment and explain

166
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,280
these energy systems because so much of what I want to ask you about and so much of what your

167
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,640
research focuses on assumes a level of understanding I don't want to take for granted.

168
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,520
So maybe explain for people what aerobic metabolism means.

169
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,120
Okay, so there are different energy systems and those energy systems, they're also used by

170
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,840
different muscle fibers in the muscle. There are different conditions like the aerobic condition

171
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,120
and anaerobic condition. We tend to believe that the immense majority of activity that we do is

172
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,520
aerobic. We tend to believe that any hard effort is anaerobic and therefore the concept of anaerobic

173
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,880
threshold. But actually even what we call the anaerobic threshold is an aerobic activity. So

174
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:48,120
the majority of the efforts that we do are in an anaerobic environment except for when you do

175
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:55,320
sprint or when you do maybe like a one minute maximum. I would say that the majority of the

176
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:04,040
activities that we do are in the aerobic state. Then what changes is the fuels that you use to

177
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,840
produce energy. So at the end of the day what we want to do is to contract the muscles and not only

178
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,320
to contract them as fast and as forceful as possible but what we want also is to do this as

179
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,040
efficiently as possible. So for example for a marathon race or for a 1500 meter race you need

180
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:31,080
to calculate when you pull the trigger and go for it and then when you have to deploy all the

181
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,440
maximum efficiency that you have. So you need to be very efficient metabolically speaking. So the

182
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,560
fuels are very important for that. So the main fuels that we use for exercise are the fatty acids

183
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,840
and glucose and those are oxidized or burned in the different skeletal muscle fibers that we have.

184
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:57,000
So we have the slow twitch muscle fibers and the fast twitch muscle fibers. The fast twitch muscle

185
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,880
fibers are divided into the type 1a and type 2b if you will. Two people contact 2x as well but

186
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,600
there are two kinds of muscle fibers. I just want to interject for a moment because I know a lot of

187
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,480
people listening to this have heard the term fast twitch and slow twitch and the assumption is that

188
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,120
they twitch at different speeds but really it's that they twitch with a different force and the

189
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,560
speed is referring to how quickly they fatigue not the speed with which they fire. So when you're

190
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,640
talking about a type 1 or a slow twitch muscle fiber it's just a less forceful fiber whereas a

191
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,960
type 2 fiber and as you said they're divided into a's and b's with each firing with each time the

192
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,720
muscle fiber fires there are more motor end plates and therefore it's generating more force

193
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,920
but the trade-off is it's going to be more quick to fatigue and why is that? Why does it fatigue

194
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,600
faster because it comes down to what you're talking about. Yeah it's because metabolically

195
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,520
they're more stressed. The way we recruit muscle fibers or base sequential pattern that is very

196
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:04,040
similar to the stick gears of a manual car. So you first start and you go on first gear and as the

197
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,560
rpms go up then you get to a point you get to the red zone so that car cannot keep up with that

198
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,920
first gear. You need to shift the second gear and you speed up and the rpms go higher and then

199
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,280
eventually you need to shift to third gear. This is very similar to what happens at the skeletal

200
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,920
muscle. The type 1 muscle fibers slow twitch they can produce ATP which is the energy coin

201
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,480
the classic that we always hear about which is what releases that muscle contraction. So at low

202
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,040
exercise intensities we don't need to contract the muscles nearly as forceful nor as fast as when we

203
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,920
do high intensity. Meaning we don't need to go back and keep firing and keep firing and keep

204
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:51,800
firing. Exactly and for that we don't need to generate ATP as fast as we do at higher intensities

205
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:58,760
and it's about ATP generation that's exercise intensity. So at low exercise intensities those

206
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:05,880
slow twitch muscle fibers or type 1 muscle fibers they are very well designed to use an energy

207
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,360
that is good enough to provide ATP and yet you can do this for a very long time and that's the

208
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,520
diesel gasoline and that is the fatty acids. However as exercise intensity increases

209
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,360
the necessity to produce ATP at a higher rate increases as well and it gets to a point where

210
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:33,320
fatty acids alone are not enough to produce ATP and therefore you need another energy system

211
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,600
and that energy system is the glucose which is a faster energy system which going back to the

212
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,960
analogy of the car is like if we had imagine a car with two tanks one is gasoline and the other one

213
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,040
or regular gasoline and the other one is diesel gasoline. So if you were to go from here to Denver

214
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,160
to Kansas where everything is flat and you need to accelerate or go fast you would try to be more

215
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,120
efficient and we'll try to use then the diesel gasoline it's more economical you get more

216
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,720
malaise per gallon but if you want to go to the mountains and you need to accelerate fast that

217
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,320
diesel might not do the trick you need extra acceleration so that's where you utilize the

218
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,560
glucose and that's a very I mean the regular gasoline which is like the glucose for the

219
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,600
muscles and that's kind of how the bioenergetics or the muscles kind of principles start. I like

220
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,400
the way you've explained it and I did a much worse job I think probably seven years ago I wrote a

221
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,440
blog post on this the insight I was trying to get across I don't know if I did was that we should

222
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,560
not think of aerobic and anaerobic as with or without oxygen which is sort of the way people

223
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,520
are taught in high school biology aerobic means in the presence of oxygen anaerobic means not in the

224
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,680
presence of oxygen no it's always in the presence of oxygen it comes down to the speed with which

225
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:54,680
the muscle is demanding ATP aerobic means you're generating ATP at a rate that is slow enough that

226
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:02,360
all of the metabolic demands can be met through mitochondrial oxidation of hopefully mostly fatty

227
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:10,040
acids but even glucose anaerobic just means exactly as you said the demand for ATP has now exceeded

228
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,240
the capacity of the mitochondria do you agree with that and even the cytosol so the cytosol which

229
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,520
is part of the cell that's where you can oxidize glucose there into parruvate and that parruvate

230
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,600
doesn't enter the mitochondria but you produce lactate but you produce energy and ATP there

231
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,120
and that can perfectly be still aerobic capacity and my colleague George Brooks from Berkeley he's

232
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,560
been studying lactate since the 80s and he's the one who proved that that you can produce lactate

233
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,520
under fully aerobic conditions not necessarily in the mitochondria but in the cytosol however

234
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,640
when the ATP demands even exceed the cytosolic production of ATP that's what you need to use the

235
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,280
ATP that is already stored in the muscle you just don't have time to synthesize it you need

236
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,360
just to use it and that's why the body stores very very minimal amounts of ATP and that's what

237
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,720
you develop in the sprint where you use in the sprint but you need to re-synthesize it very fast

238
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,840
that's the pure anaerobic you don't need any energy systems and that goes also that of the

239
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,480
confusion that is out there too and are you saying this is distinct from the creatine phosphate system

240
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,960
yeah you can use the creatine phosphate as well so you can have ATP and you can use the

241
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,680
creatine phosphate systems those two they don't need oxygen necessarily anything else can be under

242
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,120
fully aerobic conditions like even cytosolic production of ATP in in the cytosol without

243
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,320
mitochondria oxidation necessarily can happen under fully aerobic conditions and in fact

244
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,280
that's what we also call aerobic glycolysis and in other areas of biomedical research or medicine

245
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,240
it's called the Warburg effect which is now a lot of people are into cancer talk about it

246
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,920
the Warburg effect is that is the production of lactate or the utilization of glucose

247
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,040
in the cytosol not in the mitochondria but in the cytosol outside the mitochondria production of

248
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,040
energy well i want to come back to the warburg effect but you brought up brooks and there's a

249
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,040
paper that the two of you wrote together somewhat recently i think it was maybe 2018 if not this

250
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,600
year but it's actually i'm in the process of writing a book as you may recall and in the

251
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,400
exercise chapter i actually really explore that paper that you guys wrote which looked at the

252
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,960
zone two efficiency of world-class cyclists recreational athletes and people with diabetes

253
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,920
that's an unbelievable paper and that's an unbelievable example of i think the clinical

254
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,960
applicability of what we're talking about so to put it in context when we got talking back in

255
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,640
Abu Dhabi last year about this i remember you saying i'm paraphrasing so you should clarify if

256
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,920
i'm not saying it correctly that your interest in athletes is in large part due to your interest in

257
00:23:52,920 --> 00:24:00,200
diabetes because if you want to understand how to fix an example of arguably the most

258
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,800
effective mitochondria why not at least study what the perfect mitochondria look like is that

259
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,400
a fair statement yes and that's kind of what i'm trying to bring to the table in the elite

260
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,480
athletes have the perfect metabolism and mitochondria is at the epicenter of metabolism and health as

261
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,760
you said earlier there are no other population in the planet with the mitochondria of elite endurance

262
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,840
athletes i was about to say yeah you said elite athletes i would go even sharper it really in

263
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,680
my mind comes down to cyclists and runners yes and triathletes even more than swimmers because of

264
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:39,720
just the duration of it it's these people who can go out and function at their anaerobic threshold

265
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,040
for hours and that's only really found in two sports oh yes and that's what we we see that even

266
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,240
with an elite athlete and i work with many elite athletes yeah you compare them and they're huge

267
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,440
differences i guess i should add one i think cross-country skiers are probably yeah those

268
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,840
levels as well yeah so this population is the population in the planet with the healthiest

269
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,120
mitochondria so that's what i call perfection and that's what i try to bring to the table that

270
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,880
in order to study other diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction is at the epicenter as well

271
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,320
we need to understand what perfection is in order to understanding perfection and what we see in

272
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,480
people with type 2 diabetes for example they are on the opposite metabolic pole of what a war class

273
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,680
cyclist or runner is so by knowing the mechanisms of why that metabolism in this war class athletes

274
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:36,440
works we can get to understand the imperfection or the imperfect metabolic pathways and potentially

275
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,280
develop diagnostic tools and even therapeutics for them as well as prevention programs yeah and

276
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,200
really cancer and type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance as part of a spectrum do represent two

277
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,480
very common findings in the population so if you look at what percentage of the united states

278
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,960
population either has cancer or is insulin resistant or has metabolic syndrome and or

279
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,480
type 2 diabetes or fatty liver disease all of these things which are part of a continuum

280
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,920
you're talking about half the country basically that has some form of dysfunction in the mitochondria

281
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,640
in the case of cancer we can debate how much of that is a genetic insult versus other things but

282
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,960
because i want to talk so much about that i want to go back and understand perfection a bit more

283
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,400
so there are lots of different ways people codify energy systems when i was cycling we used seven

284
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:28,440
because that was andy coghans ftp based energy system you write about six zones and others have

285
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,560
talked about five but i want to talk about your six zones because one i think they're a little

286
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,520
easier to explain than the ftp based ones which if you don't know if a functional threshold power

287
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,480
number doesn't mean something to someone then seven energy systems based on it is harder to

288
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,440
understand how would you walk us through zones one through six what do they mean because when we

289
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,320
start to talk about zone two i want people to understand the difference between the normal

290
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,240
person and the super person and the sick person so what is zone one what does that so that's from

291
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,560
25 years working with athletes and also my experience from being a former athlete and

292
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,720
being obsessed with training and and all these things that's kind of it led me to develop this

293
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,600
i'm not saying that they're the right things and maybe in 10 years i change my mind or someone

294
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,040
else comes with different things are better but that's what i have right now at least so i do this

295
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:26,680
along with the muscle fiber recruitment pattern and the energy systems so the type one muscle fibers

296
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,960
we know also that because they're the ones who oxidize fat burn the fat very well they have the

297
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,640
highest mitochondrial density and content because fat can only be burned in the mitochondria type

298
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,800
two muscle fibers especially the first type of muscle fibers type two the type two a's they have

299
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,520
lower mitochondrial function because lower mitochondrial function or density i'm sorry

300
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,760
because they don't necessarily need to oxidize glucose in the mitochondria they can do it in the

301
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,000
site in the cytosol of the cell and therefore i produce lactate but they can produce it to be fast

302
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,840
so those muscle fibers they don't content as much mitochondria and then the second type of muscle

303
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,080
slow fast twitch muscle fiber the type 2b or 2x that is the one that is the pure anaerobic if you

304
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,080
will and that is the one that barely has mitochondria has very minimal mitochondria so starting with

305
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:26,280
that that's why i start breaking down the zone so the zone one would represent the minimum stimulation

306
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,840
the muscle fibers receive it's just pre-reconstruction that's what will you do on a recovery day or

307
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,960
recovery mode you have very low exercise intensity and you burn a little bit of fat

308
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,280
mainly and that's what we see also we look at also fat and carbohydrate utilization

309
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,080
scientifically we call it fighting carbohydrate oxidation rates how many grams per minute of

310
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,000
carbohydrate and fat you burn so we know that at this intensity is you burn mostly fat although

311
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,560
you also burn a little bit of carbohydrates which we can go through that yeah i want to come back

312
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,080
to it because there's such an interesting clinical observation that i've seen over the past five or

313
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,400
six years and your paper your recent paper with brooks just hammered it home in a much more rigorous

314
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,960
way so yeah we are going to come back to our queue at rest as a harbinger of these other things that

315
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,880
follow under distress yeah so that's the zone one so just to put that in energy terms for people

316
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,240
you and i walking up the stairs we were coming from the lobby we're in zone one yeah walking down

317
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,720
the street walking down the street or review or very fit and you go for a jog very easy recovery

318
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,560
day that's your zone one and then for the elite give us an example so if you took meb or someone

319
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,840
who's going to run a sub 210 marathon you have a sense of how fast they could run and still be in

320
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,560
zone one someone who's used to running 445 to 450 miles could their zone one be as fast as like a

321
00:29:53,560 --> 00:30:00,040
seven minute mile yeah yeah absolutely you can see world class athletes that their zone one it's

322
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:06,440
my sprinting for example it's kind of what we see also in cyclists the recovery day is 200 watts

323
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,320
average and for most murmurals 200 watts they can do that for 15 minutes yeah i just wrote a post

324
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:20,280
about this recently using as an example for people who ride a bike 200 watts is about how fast it would

325
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:28,200
take you to go 30 kilometers an hour without wind or without elevation and that's certainly not all

326
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:35,400
out but that's pretty fast and if you can imagine being able to ride at that level indefinitely

327
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,240
without any metabolic consequence that's what an elite athlete is doing and that says nothing by

328
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,520
the way about their weight they're doing that at a body weight that is a fraction of most people

329
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,240
yeah that's what they call the coffee right yeah they go for a coffee or ice cream right and

330
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:58,280
you cheat chat and they're like it's an unbelievable so zone one does lactate get produced it should

331
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,440
not get produced well we start from the base that there's always lactate producing the body

332
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,760
so if you were to poke my finger right now or poke your finger right now we measure lactate

333
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,360
in millimolar what would you expect to measure in me or you you would be about one millimole okay

334
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,760
0.7 to one millimole that's kind of like a standard resting levels in a healthy individual

335
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,480
and in a normal person so not an elite athlete but sort of a recreational athlete

336
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,360
what's the highest lactate you'll typically measure in that person if you put them in a

337
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,720
treadmill test or it depends on the protocol that you do if it's a very violent protocol or is a

338
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,440
longer protocol violent protocols they produce more lactate you might see 10 12 millimoles whether

339
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,160
that protocol let's say a six minutes maximal effort and a rowing machine right and the concept

340
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:55,800
for example i've seen war class rollers it's a maximal effort with 20 millimoles of lactate

341
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,680
it's very rare you see very easily 15 16 17 that's because we can talk about that later their

342
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:09,560
glycolytic capacity it's off the charts whereas people who they're not elite athletes it's for

343
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,440
them that's in protocol it's more difficult to go over 12 millimoles 10 millimoles because

344
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,760
their glycolytic capacity is not so good as the one that the elite athletes have and sometimes

345
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,960
elite athletes have the opposite issue which is they don't make much lactate at all they're so

346
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,640
efficient i've actually discussed this with lance armstrong after i erroneously had been on a podcast

347
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,680
and made the case that he had a very high lactate tolerance he were talking about it one day

348
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,680
informally and he said no it's actually the opposite i would barely produce any lactate

349
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,000
he was usually producing less lactate than others and again this was when everybody's on the same

350
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,080
drug or everybody's off the same drug i mean just genetically there are some people who probably have

351
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,720
more mct which will come back and talk to and they become more efficient at it but okay so that gives

352
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:00,040
us a sense that lactate will go from maybe one to ten if you're a normal person maybe one to 20

353
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,640
i actually measured it difficult i measured a lactate of 24 and a friend of mine once wow the

354
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,840
highest i've ever measured in myself was 19.7 wow and that was only a four minute protocol

355
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,480
wow pretty impressive but also i almost wonder like maybe it's i wasn't even in particularly

356
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,320
great shape at the time but i wonder if that same exertion under better fitness would have

357
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,280
produced less lactate potentially right it depends on the protocol right if the protocol stops there

358
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,040
and what you intend is to produce mobilize the glycolytic system to the maximum yeah you will

359
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,240
produce a lot of lactate if you want to continue and do a longer protocol eventually you just

360
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,520
cannot mobilize as much lactate i mean as much glycolytic system because you have a little more

361
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,440
of fatigue i think the difference between the really good people i mean i hit if i hit and

362
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:53,400
i've been above 18 and maybe a dozen times i'm done for half an hour like i can barely get up

363
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:01,720
off the floor to go and take a shower whereas this friend of mine who was at 24 i saw him go

364
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,520
from 24 to 14 in a span of about seven minutes and then jump in the pool and swim another race

365
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,040
and he's world-class so that's sort of the difference i think the world-class athlete

366
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,160
can also clear the lack much quicker than i can for sure and that's what happens in the mitochondria

367
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:23,160
and any other part of the body because one thing with lactate we believe that is a waste product

368
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:29,880
however lactate is the most important if not the most important fuel for the body that's a profound

369
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,520
statement yes i completely agree with you that lactate is not a waste product but

370
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,920
say more about that point so one of the things the brain prefers to use lactate so i have heard

371
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,880
this talk to me about the data on this so my colleague george brooks who is lactate man

372
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,640
so yeah he started in doing research with tbi traumatic brain injury patients at ucla it's

373
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,840
typical to give them glucose and then what there's like a brain injury but the brain in the first

374
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,000
place has evolved to use glucose as the main fuel so when the brain is injured they use more

375
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,040
glucose however when it's injured different metabolic pathways might be dysregulated so

376
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,040
what my colleague george brooks suggested was to give them lactate and he showed and he probably

377
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,880
stayed do better better than beta hydroxybutyrate which also seems to be really beneficial in tbi

378
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,720
patients for maybe a different reason than lactate although it could be all similar which is

379
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:34,920
if you buy the argument which i find favorable that part of the insult of tbi is pyruvate

380
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,200
dehydrogenase becomes resistant to insulin that would explain why glucose becomes ineffective in

381
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,000
those patients and it would explain why beta hydroxybutyrate can bypass it and the same could

382
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,720
be true of lactate yes absolutely it's an alternative substrate that doesn't get limited

383
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,200
through pyruvate dehydrogenase is that what you think is happening yes because it has its own

384
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,640
transporter in the mitochondria and doesn't need pth for that it can enter the mitochondria

385
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,760
directly for energy systems like hydroxybutyrate as well but the thing is like lactate is a faster

386
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,120
fuel so the thing is like also yeah bhb is not a fast fuel exactly whereas lactate is as fast if

387
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,840
not faster it's glucose because it doesn't have to be processed if you will now the listener might

388
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,160
say wait a minute what are you guys talking about anyone who's ever done a lactate test knows how

389
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,840
much pain you're in when your lactate level goes up so one of the other i think misunderstandings

390
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,800
is what's actually causing that pain because that's i think why so many of us have a negative

391
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,600
association with lactate it's not actually the lactate that's causing the physical discomfort

392
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,240
that you feel when you're vomiting on the floor after a maximal lactate test it's the hydrogen

393
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,200
so explain why that's the case and why we tend to confound the two i mean there are many causes for

394
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,120
pain or fatigue that in different hypotheses from the central fatigue to the peripheral fatigue

395
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,760
and it's very possible that both are interconnected at some point and we don't know the exact

396
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,520
mechanisms at some point the central fatigue calls for the brain to be the ruler where the

397
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,400
peripheral fatigue is what happens at the cellular level so it is possible that there's like a

398
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,480
crosstalk among both of them and either the chicken or the egg right either one of them says stop but

399
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,560
what we know is that yeah it's not lactate itself but the hydrogen ions associated to lactate they

400
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,320
build up one of the things that and it's been researched they can decrease both the contractive

401
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,880
capacity of the muscle fibers as well as the force by up to 50 percent or more so that's one of the

402
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,440
things that what we see is like the muscles they cannot contract as fast or as forceful as before

403
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,560
and this is an important point for people to understand because if you haven't taken a

404
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:48,120
physiology course when why would most people do so it's also not obvious why you even need ATP

405
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:54,760
to make your muscles contract it's actually to unleash or unlock the actin myosin contact it's

406
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,320
the relaxation phase of the muscle that requires energy exactly so now if you imagine anybody

407
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,960
who's done that sit on the rowing machine for four minutes and go as hard as you can well

408
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,200
at the end of that anyone who's done it will acknowledge it feels like you can't actually

409
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,000
contract your muscle you've lost the voluntary ability to make them do what you want to do

410
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,840
and it's really two things going on it's this hydrogen poison and then on top of that you're

411
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,400
not generating enough ATP to hit all of those fibers that need to be uncoupled from their actin

412
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,360
and myosin so anyone who's been there knows like it you think i'm going crazy why can i not make

413
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,400
myself do this yeah and that's where maybe the central fatigue component the brain might be

414
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,120
factoring in as well kicking in and say hey dude you know you slow down you're getting to a point

415
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,320
that this is not physiological so i'm going to protect your muscles and they're telling me through

416
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,240
different signals one might be the hydrogen ions which also are produced from the hydrolysis of the

417
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,000
breakdown or ATP they produce also hydrogen so you have the lactate on one hand and the ATP of the

418
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,160
fast rate of ATP hydrolysis also produces hydrogen ions but yeah as you said very well like you're

419
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,480
conscious once but there's something at the neuromuscular level also that impedes that could

420
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,280
be at the local level specifically but could also perfectly be that the brain says hey let's stop it

421
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:25,000
and one of the things that we know when people are fatigued is that there's a decrease in adrenalin

422
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
secretion to protect yourself because adrenaline or I mean epinephrine we call it here in the US

423
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
epinephrine in europe is called adrenaline is the major or one of the major elements involved in the

424
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,800
breakdown of glycogen into glucose we can talk about that later as part of the overtraining but

425
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,520
uh the adrenergic activity it's also decreased as well when someone is in a fatigued state so by the

426
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,080
way Alex Hutchinson has written a great book on this have you have you read his book Endure i

427
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,800
heard about it but it's really good again it's good for someone like me who comes into this without

428
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,800
world-class knowledge and i found it a very interesting survey in fact i hope to have him

429
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,200
on the podcast at some point to go into some real depth on that so now we've talked about the two

430
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,600
ends of the spectrum the most extreme end and the first end let's now get into zone two what's

431
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:16,840
happening physiologically is that athlete or that person enters zone two so the zone two is that now

432
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:23,400
then when you start stimulating those slow twitch muscle fibers to the fullest let's imagine that

433
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:29,320
you're in that first gear that i mentioned earlier in the manual stick car and then you're in that

434
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,760
red zone and that's where the car is asking you hey shift the second gear and that's where like

435
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,600
you're forcing physiologically because the body adapts to say no you get stronger at this gear

436
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,560
that's kind of that zone too is like when you stimulate those muscle fibers before you start

437
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:54,200
changing to a whole different environment where you start then recruiting fully the type two or

438
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,240
fast twitch muscle fibers and therefore the different energy system which is the glucose

439
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,760
so the zone two coincides also with what we call the fat max which is exercise intensity at the

440
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,200
one you oxidize the highest amount of fat and then we can see that clearly in the laboratory

441
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,240
as we saw in the graph that we can show yeah we're going to include a lot of great pictures here

442
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,280
so if you're looking at the show notes there's something called the metabolic map which is a

443
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,240
great slide that we'll walk through this and i think what's very interesting here this occurs

444
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,760
so often in physiology it's a bit counterintuitive as you go from zone one to two to three to four

445
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:38,120
five and six you're generating more and more ATP as you go up that chain so that part is monotonic

446
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,400
it's increasing without stopping but there's a local maximum that's occurring in zone two

447
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:50,280
which is your highest amount of fat oxidation so as you go from zone two to three to four

448
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:57,000
you will still produce more energy you will consume even more oxygen your vo2 max has not

449
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,600
been achieved which is your maximal uptake of oxygen but you will now become less efficient

450
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,240
and you're moving to a less efficient fuel you're moving away from this diesel example or the fat

451
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,680
so again i think for a lot of people the semantics get confusing here because you just said that

452
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:19,160
zone two is your maximum i mean maybe a better way to explain it for me is zone two is the place

453
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,000
at which your mitochondria are producing the maximum amount under purely aerobic conditions

454
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,800
of ATP is that fair i would say that too and that's where you're still recruiting those type

455
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,240
one muscle fibers that's the extra intensity where you're cruising the most and they had the

456
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,240
highest stimulus without tipping into the twos that's basically it and since that type one muscle

457
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,760
fibers have the highest mitochondrial density you're really stimulating them a lot as you said

458
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,360
before you need to tap into the fast twitch muscle fibers and in the moment you tap into the fast

459
00:42:52,360 --> 00:43:01,480
twitch muscle fibers is because the ATP demand that you need cannot be covered by fat and you

460
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,400
need to switch to a different fuel and that's where we see a big drop in fat oxidation and we

461
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,280
see an increase also in glucose oxidation and that's when we start seeing also an increase in

462
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:22,040
lactate as well because lactate is always and we forgot to mention that earlier lactate is the

463
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:29,560
mandatory byproduct not waste product byproduct of glucose utilization mandatory every time you

464
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:35,000
use glucose you use lactate and at higher intensity you produce more let's talk about that because

465
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
again i think that's more nuanced than most of us would come to this discussion with we learned in

466
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,600
physiology class that a molecule of glucose in the cytosol is turned into two molecules of pyruvate

467
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:55,080
under conditions of sufficient cellular oxygen to meet the ATP demand the pyruvate enters the

468
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:02,200
mitochondria where it undergoes oxidative phosphorylation to make ATP and no lactate is generated

469
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:09,640
if that ATP demand exceeds the capacity that you just described in zone two we now have to

470
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:16,200
start turning some of that pyruvate into lactate to generate additional ATP that's faster to generate

471
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,120
in the first case that i described is there still by necessity some lactate production yes there's

472
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,640
some lactate production and and we can see that even at rest we have or with a little bit of lactate

473
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,800
in our bloodstream which is what you said at the outside you said if you checked my finger or your

474
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,680
finger now we would probably still have somewhere between 0.7 and one millimole of lactate why is

475
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,880
that that's where we're trying to understand and we believe my colleague george brooks and i

476
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:48,840
that lactate is a major signaling molecule that when it's regulated it can signal and maintain

477
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,600
homeostasis of different metabolic pathways it's kind of like a visa for the body as my

478
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,400
colleague george brooks calls it when it's dysregulated as we're starting to see in cancer for

479
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:06,040
example or we can see in type 2 diabetes it can dysregulate different pathways every cell in the

480
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,640
body produces lactate and pretty much every cell in the body consumes lactate including red blood

481
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,280
cells i'm guessing yes they produce a lot of lactate red blood cells because they don't have

482
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,600
mitochondria yeah i wonder it's glycolytic mechanism yeah do the red blood cells account

483
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,560
for most of the lactate production we see at baseline not necessarily because there's not

484
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,200
so much hemolysis and there's not so much lactivity in the red blood cells but there's

485
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:36,200
always some metabolic lactate produced from glucose utilization because we always use a

486
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:42,600
little bit of glucose of course the brain but uh that lactate escapes to the blood to the circulation

487
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,760
and for us is significant that is always so steady also and every cell in the body produces lactate

488
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,680
and almost every cell in the body utilizes lactate so it's gotta be a why and we believe

489
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,880
and that's what we're trying to scratch the surface that it's a very important signaling

490
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,560
molecule that goes beyond being a byproduct or metabolite and that's something that we're

491
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:13,160
already seeing in cancer where we have seen that lactate stimulates the expression of the major

492
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:19,880
oncogenes transgusion factors and cell cycle genes in breast cancer so it acts and we have

493
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,840
the paper under review now it acts as a signaling molecule so this is interesting because again in

494
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,280
physiology class you sort of learn that all of that waste lactate goes back to the liver and the

495
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,960
core cycle converts it into glucose and it becomes now stored glucose but what you're saying is it's

496
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,480
much broader than that i mean obviously the core cycle still exists but it's not even clear how

497
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,800
much of the lactate that we're measuring is undergoing that pathway to be converted back

498
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,560
to glucose versus itself being consumed as a fuel correct yes and thanks to the great work that my

499
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:58,280
colleague brux did starting the 80s what he saw is that the majority of that lactate is oxidized

500
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,720
by the slow twitch muscle fibers by the mitochondria of the slow twitch muscle fibers

501
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,720
and each mole of lactate gives how many moles of ATP under those conditions i don't have it on top

502
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,840
of my is it a small number or big yeah it'll be smaller number as well but it's not like the 16

503
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,760
or whatever you know no no no no i don't think i don't have it on top of my head but the thing is a

504
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,840
constant flux of lactate from the fast twitch muscle fibers to the slow twitch muscle fibers

505
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,880
that's when you start entering that zone three you start mobilizing more of the glycolytic system

506
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,680
and that's kind of a transition state where you still mix fuels fatty acids and carbohydrates

507
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,640
but you start using more carbohydrates and therefore you start producing lactate

508
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:50,200
that say that lactate is transported from mainly from the fast twitch muscle fibers into the

509
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,240
mitochondria of the slow twitch muscle fibers where is used for energy it enters directly

510
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,880
the mitochondria for energy purposes and that is the ability that elite athletes have they can be

511
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:08,120
recruiting fast twitch muscle fibers they can be utilizing a lot of glucose and producing a lot of

512
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:14,840
lactate but since they have a very well developed mitochondria in the slow twitch muscle fibers

513
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,840
they don't need to export it to the blood and it doesn't accumulate yeah this to me is the grail

514
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:27,320
this is the stuff that sets apart the best from the rest going back to zone two tell me where

515
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,680
you typically see a lactate level there you and i have talked about a bunch of these numbers when

516
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,400
i try to explain this to my patients because i have many of my patients on a zone two protocol

517
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,640
for a lot of the time we just use voice we use ability to talk i sort of say look if you don't

518
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,680
want to go through the protocol of poking your finger zone two is about the highest level of

519
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,560
exertion at which you're still able to carry out a conversation but let's talk more technically

520
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:59,080
we're really seeing what lactate levels of about 1.7 to 1.9 millimole yeah 1.5 to 2 that's something

521
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,840
what we see and that's kind of what corresponds also to that fat max so today my data that i showed

522
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,480
you from my ride this morning i was 1.3 and 1.2 on my two meters so i always do two separate meters

523
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,560
so i averaged 1.25 millimolar that was clearly not zone two that was a zone one the feeder

524
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,960
that you get like for example a world class athlete at zone two is really high yeah well

525
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,400
i'm not world class but just by lactate levels that's probably not quite there yeah it might

526
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,600
not be quite there because it's slightly above resting levels so there's no accumulation and

527
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:39,960
it's this accumulation there's a homeostasis or a steady state below two so call it 1.7 1.8 1.9

528
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,840
where you're right at the limit of not accumulating at a net level correct yes yes so you're pretty

529
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:52,520
much that lactic comes you obviously see it in the blood and it comes from the muscles so that means

530
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:59,240
that the muscles overall are good first they're not very metabolically stressed so therefore

531
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,200
they're not utilizing a lot of glucose and even if they're stressed they're clearing the lactate

532
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,840
very well because you see in blood 1.5 1.7 2 millimoles slightly above resting levels

533
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:17,400
however when you start seeing higher lactate levels in the blood that means that your muscle

534
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,400
clearance capacity cannot meet no i think what you're saying if i understand is once you hit

535
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,880
two three four five millimolar you're saying that the muscles ability to recirculate and utilize

536
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,600
the lactate is going down it has to export into the circulation exactly and that's where it goes

537
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,160
to every cell in the body it goes to the brain it goes to the kidney goes to the heart the heart is

538
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,200
great utilize or lactate and obviously as you said earlier goes to the core recycle to be

539
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,000
resynthesized back to glucose or to a certain length for form of glycogen but yeah that's when

540
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,600
we see that in blood that means that that athlete cannot clear the lactate efficiently and therefore

541
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:00,280
that's why it shows up in the blood and that's where we can see that for example one professional

542
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:06,840
athlete a 300 watts a world-class athlete my let's say yeah 300 watts might have three millimoles of

543
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,920
lactate let's say or two and a half and a mermural might have 12 that means that the power output is

544
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,160
the same but how do you get there it's different in the first place the elite athlete might not

545
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:25,080
need to use so much glucose and if they do they produce lactate but they clear out so efficiently

546
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:32,280
in the slow twitch muscle fibers that it doesn't have to go to the blood whereas the person who

547
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:39,000
doesn't have a very good mitochondrial function cannot oxidize lactate very efficiently locally

548
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,680
in the skeletal muscle and they have to export it to the circulation and that's a way to see the

549
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:51,640
metabolic stress and indirectly as we published a way to look at what is the matter kind of function

550
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,120
so let's talk about that now i do want to come back and talk about zones three and up but because

551
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:01,720
this is the perfect point to go back to the paper you and brooks recently wrote what you showed that

552
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:07,640
i just thought was so elegant was as you said you can either cap the output or clamp the power

553
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,840
required or clamp the lactate production and look at the power required and you did the latter you

554
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,960
basically said we're going to find everybody's zone two meaning we're going to find everybody's tipping

555
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:24,520
point at which point their mitochondria are no longer high enough in function to meet the

556
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:31,960
requirement and what you showed was world-class cyclists were able to get to an average of

557
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:38,680
something like 300 watts before they would finally flip that switch and have to start

558
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,080
recruiting the fast switch muscle fibers which was measured indirectly by lactate production

559
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:52,760
conversely the weekend warrior reasonably fit people guys like me could get to 200 watts

560
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:59,240
before that switch got flipped but most interesting was the people with type 2 diabetes

561
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,080
i think we're like 120 watts is that about right yeah we've been knowing for years now that are

562
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:10,680
typical characteristic that we know of people with pre type 2 or type 2 diabetes is that they have a

563
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:18,200
poor metabolic flexibility that is called also a poor capacity to oxidize fuels one of them is fat

564
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,720
we know that fat can only be oxidized in the mitochondria therefore by measuring the fat

565
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:30,760
oxidation of these patients we can indirectly see the mitochondrial function especially when

566
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:37,800
we put them in context or in comparison with those ones who are healthy individuals that could be

567
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,120
moderately active individuals who don't have diabetes or pre-diabetes or don't have any

568
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:48,440
medications or elite athletes so that's what we see that their fat capacity is very very low

569
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,640
and that's gonna but we can see directly but it's not often you see in biology such a difference

570
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:01,240
because if the numbers 300 versus 200 versus 100 sound extreme that's nothing compared to when you

571
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:08,200
normalize by weight so really the answer is in watts per kilo what's the difference and 300 watts

572
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:15,400
to a professional cyclist who only weighs 60 to 65 kilos is just below five watts per kilogram

573
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:23,400
whereas the person with diabetes almost assuredly weighs more so their 120 watts is probably 1.5

574
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,240
watts per kilo they're not a lot of examples of things in physiology where you see that much of

575
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,800
a difference you rarely even see that much of a difference in average glucose level between

576
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:39,960
someone with diabetes and not so this is this functional definition that you guys have proposed

577
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,720
is to me very important just as a clinician just as someone who's trying to gather more data

578
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:54,760
about a patient to understand their health it's sort of like in a magic scenario in a magic world

579
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,280
you would have these data on every single person you would want to know what is your zone two

580
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,840
threshold and that becomes a way to assess mitochondrial function now the story i was going

581
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,160
to tell earlier at this is as good a time as i need to tell it about five years ago in some of

582
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:14,840
the most insulin resistant patients that i was taking care of i began looking at baseline resting

583
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:22,680
respiratory quotient which you alluded to earlier this is the ratio of produced carbon dioxide to

584
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,720
consumed oxygen say a little bit about that number and how to interpret it and then i'll finish the

585
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:34,760
story so that's kind of we can see through expired gases we can see the amount of co2 that you produce

586
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:41,880
and the amount of oxygen that you utilize so under resting conditions and that's what's called

587
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,560
the respiratory coefficient or the respiratory exchange ratio the respiratory exchange ratio

588
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:53,480
is purely at the respiratory level at the lung level with the respiratory coefficient it's at

589
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,280
the muscle level they're quite similar but not academically you know that might not the same

590
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:05,640
but we can call it rq or rr2 so under normal conditions you don't produce much co2 so the

591
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:12,520
ratio it's always below one could be 0.7 something like that for example that means that it's co2

592
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:20,120
divided by oxygen so that's where you don't produce a lot of co2 you use more oxygen and

593
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:27,720
therefore the ratio is 0.7 as exercise intensity increases and so that ratio of 0.7 we can impute

594
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:34,120
from that that a person is virtually all dependent on fat oxidation at that moment probably yes and

595
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,400
that's what we can use through what's called stoichiometric equation you can deduct the amount

596
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:46,680
of fat it is oxidized because to oxidize one mole of fat you need x amount of oxygen and you produce

597
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,280
x amount of co2 so by measuring both you can see what kind of fuel you're burning and that's what

598
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:58,280
we're doing in our paper so as exercise intensity increases or if the person is not metabolically

599
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:04,280
flexible they cannot oxidize fat very efficiently so normally these people they tend to depend to

600
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,600
depend more on glucose or any other extra source of fuel and that's why you see use already people

601
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:18,840
at rest they have a higher rq or rr we could be in the 80s then as exercise if you were to do

602
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:24,920
exercise as exercise intensity increases you start producing more co2 and therefore the ratio starts

603
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:31,160
getting closer and closer to one when you and that's when we see that you start oxidizing more

604
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:38,920
glucose than fat when the ratio gets to one yeah it's just 100 of the fuel that you use is glucose

605
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:45,480
and you don't see any fat which is kind of what we also call kind of that end of the zone four

606
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,680
yeah so this was the observation i was noticing a subset of patients again very hyperinsulinemic

607
00:57:52,680 --> 00:58:01,240
insulin resistant by whatever metric you would use to explain it that had resting rr or rq of 0.9

608
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:10,760
to one easily 0.95 so what does it mean when someone who is laying down to do this test under

609
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:18,920
no physiologic distress has an rq of 0.95 what does that mean obviously based on what you said it means

610
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:26,040
they are almost exclusively relying on glucose and not oxidizing any fatty acid but what is that

611
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,240
telling you at a molecular level about the illness or the function of that person's mitochondria it's

612
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,920
a red flag for mitochondria dysfunction right there because that's not normal obviously after

613
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:42,200
eating a meal of carbohydrates yeah for a while you're going to have a higher rq but at rest in

614
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:48,520
the fasting state when someone is in the 90s this is a morning fasted resting it's a red flag that

615
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,640
is already telling you that there's something going probably at the uh manaconda level and this is

616
00:58:53,640 --> 00:59:00,120
what we wanted to do this paper that we wrote we want to see the same thing that is done usually

617
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,560
at the ekg level so when a cardiologist wants to study the heart if there's any abnormality

618
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:13,720
resting ekg has a reliability about 50 so you could see some red flags already but you don't

619
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:19,080
see everything you have to stress the heart exactly and you stress the heart and similar

620
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:25,560
protocol than what we did here and that's what you do when you do ekg in stress right situations the

621
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:32,440
rail ability is about 95 97 so you see a lot of things so i decided to take the same approach

622
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:39,160
and say okay now at rest as you very well said you see people in the 90s with rq and that's our

623
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:44,440
red flag now okay let's trace those mitochondria right so in other words the analogy is sometimes

624
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,080
you'll do an ekg on somebody at rest and you'll see changes in the st segment that tell you

625
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:53,800
immediately there's a problem but there are many people who have a normal resting ekg but only when

626
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,640
you put them on the treadmill and make them run do you see that change in the electrical signal

627
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,040
that tells you there's a problem and so similarly maybe somebody walks around with a resting rq of

628
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:08,040
0.8 and you think oh they're perfectly fine but you see that they're zone two level the level at

629
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:15,080
which they tap out at their fat oxidation maximum or their maximum aerobic output is much lower

630
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:22,120
than predicted and now you have a functional assay exactly you can categorize people by looking at the

631
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:28,360
fat and also looking at the lactate if you burn very little fat that means that you don't have a

632
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:34,200
good mitochondrial function and that confirms it that test if you produce a lot of lactate

633
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,280
that means that you don't have a good like a mitochondrial function either because lactate is

634
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,400
metabolized in the mitochondria so if it's in the blood that means that the mitochondria cannot

635
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,760
metabolize it so what we did with the three populations from war class athletes to morally

636
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,960
active individuals with people with metabolic syndrome which is a companion of type 2 diabetes

637
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,240
protect to cardiovascular disease as well or what we call not cardiometabolic disease because

638
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,280
80% of people with diabetes has cardiovascular disease and vice versa so these people what we

639
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:11,640
did then with these three groups is then we paired both the fat curve burning curve in the test as

640
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:18,920
well as the lactate and the correlations were in the 90s so we see that it's a valid indirect test

641
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:24,600
to see the mitochondrial function now as we speak and in this office right now we have all the

642
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:31,240
supplies we're going to do this now with muscle biopsies and we're going to try to prove not just

643
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:36,040
this but what are the metabolic pathways do you have the irb approved already yes we're going to

644
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:41,000
start next week we already have it tomorrow we don't have the laboratory set yet we're in the

645
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,320
recruiting patient's face i might have to come back and do this man we'd love to get a muscle

646
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:50,040
biopsy yeah we can do that because we're going to be looking at the muscle biopsy mitochondrial

647
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,000
density respiration we have uh two different machines or a boros and seahorse where you can

648
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,040
how many subjects are you looking to recruit well so far we want to have about 50 we're going to be

649
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:05,800
recruiting people who are well trained it's difficult how will you define well trained well

650
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,440
yes so well trained are people who are usually competing like for example in cycling would be

651
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,720
like a category three two and one okay so pretty serious yeah pretty serious cyclists i'm going to

652
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,680
try to see if i can fool a professional athlete to get a muscle biopsy which is might be difficult

653
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:26,040
but i'm trying to then we're going to have also moderately active individuals who are healthy

654
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:32,440
then we're going to have another group that is masters athletes those masters who are 50 60 70

655
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,160
years who don't develop type 2 diabetes and they're very healthy don't take any medication

656
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,520
to match for the age of diabetes and then we're going to be looking at pre-diabetics

657
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:47,720
and type 2 diabetics and we're going to be looking at mitochondrial function mitochondrial respiration

658
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:54,280
genomics proteomics metabolomics as well and try to find the exact mechanisms that go wrong

659
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,280
something that we see in this paper indirectly we know that something wrong but we don't know the

660
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:04,760
exact this is pdh enzyme or it is something that an ldh in the mitochondria that is not working

661
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:10,200
or is faulty or is both of them and that's where we're going to try to target the mechanism so that

662
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:15,640
it can give us maybe better diagnosis or open the doors for maybe potential therapeutics to

663
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:20,200
target those mechanisms that we have seen that they're dysregulated well my guess is people

664
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,600
listening to this if they're interested we'll be able to very easily come and find where the

665
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,520
enrollment is and i might have to come back and even if i don't fit into one of the nice neat

666
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,160
buckets i'll just i'd love to do the muscle biopsy now of course you talk about the need

667
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,600
for a treatment here but you already know you've already discovered arguably the single best

668
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:43,480
treatment imaginable for this which is more zone 2 how do you increase mitochondrial function

669
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:48,840
you train at the maximum level of mitochondrial output correct that's my hypothesis and that's

670
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:54,680
what i have been seeing for 25 years working with elite athletes that this is the exercise intensity

671
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:59,880
where i see the biggest improvement in fat burning and the biggest improvement in lactic

672
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:05,080
clearance capacity therefore that means that the mitochondria is where you see the biggest

673
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:10,200
improvement we see also the biggest improvement in performance pause there for a moment you're

674
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,960
coaching professional cyclists in the Tour de France so do they need to exercise at that low

675
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,240
level of intensity it's not at low level well for them for them it's low but for us it would be

676
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:26,440
excruciating but even for them because for them their mitochondrial density infection is so

677
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,760
incredible and the way they recruit the type 1 muscle fibers it's so big that you need to push

678
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:39,160
it so it's having a much bigger gear range exactly exactly it's like in the first gear that we say

679
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:46,200
when you get to the 70 000 rpm you're in the red zone okay you push it there these guys first gear

680
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:53,720
is in the 15 000 rpm so you still need to push into the 15 000 which could be uh they really go

681
01:04:53,720 --> 01:05:00,680
very fast but then you see their lactate and the lactate is not more than 1.8 so it's telling you

682
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:06,280
that they're just so efficient they're incredibly efficient reusing that lactate and keeping it

683
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,960
confined to the muscle as another fuel for the adjacent fiber exactly and if you see that in the

684
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:17,320
blood there's such a low levels of lactate that means that they have a very good mitochondrial

685
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:23,000
function and they're stimulating that system there when you see that any athlete or any person is in

686
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,360
the three four five millimoles then you see that that system has given up already it has to be

687
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,840
exported in the to the circulation is the biopsy that you're going to do in this subsequent study

688
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:37,800
going to allow you to differentiate between two plausible hypotheses to explain this observation

689
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:43,960
one being that they actually make less lactate the other being their muscles actually utilize

690
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,680
more of it before it gets back into circulation both of those could explain the observation

691
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:53,480
because you're only sampling in the blood so you're only looking at how much lactate is making

692
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,800
it of the blood you don't know if it's just that they make less or they make the same amount but

693
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,600
use it much more efficiently do you have a sense of we know that because my colleague george brooks

694
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:09,000
will be also a co-author in this paper he already has described that that uh well trained individuals

695
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,520
they can get to produce more lactate and at the same time they utilize it better so their gift i'm

696
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,520
using air quotes the gift of the gifted athlete is not the production of less lactate it's the

697
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:26,200
ability to re-utilize it exactly yes and we choose the skeletal muscle and this is a very important

698
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:33,240
point in my opinion because it's the probably the first tissue where diabetes starts skeletal muscle

699
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:40,920
about 80 of all the glucose or carbohydrates that we oxidize in the body after a meal they're

700
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,240
oxidizing the skeletal muscle and within the skeletal muscle is in the mitochondria so that's

701
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:51,400
why looking at the mitochondria of skeletal muscle it gives us a very good ability to describe this

702
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:57,800
in a more precise way so again if you could sort of as a thought experiment if you're looking

703
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:04,360
at the muscle of someone who's going to get diabetes in two years versus the muscle of

704
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:10,360
someone who is not what do you think they look like in terms of differences so there'll be many

705
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,800
but i just want to hear you talk through them right in terms of so not talking functional at

706
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,960
this point i'm just talking purely visible will there be differences in glycogen capacity of the

707
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,680
muscle will there be differences in the actual density of mitochondria will you see differences

708
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,840
in the types of fibers i mean again just playing that game of you know this person's going to get

709
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:31,960
diabetes this person's not what looks different so you would see very clearly for example that

710
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:37,640
well trained athlete has at least three to four times the amount of mitochondria and the size of

711
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:43,800
the mitochondria that's very visible that you would see it right away and this is Toledo from

712
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:49,720
the university of pittsburgh he did a great paper where we can show it in the slides as well where

713
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:56,520
he can show that very well so three to four times the number plus larger yeah and that's the number

714
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:03,160
and the density of the mitochondria then we delving the function of the mitochondria how well they

715
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,000
function that's the zone two that you've been talking about yeah that's one of the things that

716
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,240
we believe in my stimulate different pathways for mitochondrial biogenesis as well as different

717
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:19,400
pathways for the improvement of the efficiency of the mitochondria itself are there other functional

718
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:25,480
tests used besides the amount of basically ATP to lactate which is what you're doing in a zone two

719
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:31,720
test non-invasively to my knowledge there are no other ways to look at mitochondrial function you

720
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:36,600
would need to look at a muscle biopsy and when they do a muscle biopsy what functional assay

721
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:41,800
are they doing in vitro when you look at muscle biopsy you can this is kind of what we're going

722
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:48,120
to be doing you can expose the tissue or the muscle to glucose pyruvate or fatty acids

723
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:55,480
and see what is the metabolism you label them and you see what goes where i see so you will

724
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:01,240
use metabolomics to get a signature of the preference for different circulating fuels

725
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:07,160
exactly so we would be seeing like this type two diabetics for example they barely use fat

726
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:14,040
when they're exposed to fat we trace that fatty acid but they have a much higher capacity or

727
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:19,320
willingness to use glucose for energy and that energy is might not be happening in the mitochondria

728
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:24,440
either happens in the cytosol that's one of the things that there's what's called the metabolic

729
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:30,120
reprogramming that happens in these patients happens in type two diabetics happens in cancer

730
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,240
patients as well and in other diseases there's like a local metabolic reprogramming but there's

731
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:41,240
also a whole body metabolic reprogramming where you just cannot synthesize fatty acids i mean you

732
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:46,040
cannot utilize fatty acids for energy purposes very efficiently because you don't have the

733
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:54,040
mitochondria and you need to rely more on glucose and at rest glucose is mainly oxidizing the

734
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,520
mitochondria as you said earlier goes to pyruvate pyruvate into the mitochondria but when your

735
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:04,680
mitochondria at rest are not functioning very well you need to rely on the cytosolic production of

736
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:11,880
ATP through pyruvate and then lactate so this is why we believe these patients rely on the most

737
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:18,520
to this cytosolic glucose utilization which is what we see in higher exercise intensities in

738
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:23,800
athletes and that's what we see higher lactate levels as a biomarker for mitochondrial function

739
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,320
do you see other differences between the very very fit and someone again who's going to go on

740
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,400
to get diabetes just to make the experiments such that you're not looking at someone with diabetes

741
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,920
in terms of glycogen storage capacity yes we see that too we see that so i developed with a

742
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:43,640
colleague here john hill from the school of medicine we developed a methodology to indirectly

743
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,000
look for glycogen content in a non-invasive way using ultrasound high frequency ultrasound and

744
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:55,480
we validated with the muscle biopsy as well and another researcher david neiman also validated the

745
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:00,360
system and we saw very good correlations with the scale that we use so you just doing a high

746
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:06,120
frequency ultrasound of the quadricep you can get to within what degree of accuracy of a muscle

747
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:11,880
biopsy with the muscle biopsy we saw in the 90s they are the correlation pre and post exercise

748
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,080
using the scale that we use there are a couple of authors that have done a replication of the study

749
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:23,000
but they have used a completely different scale we know that the skeletal muscle glycogen is stored

750
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,920
in different parts of the body i mean in different pockets of the muscle and in different muscles so

751
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:35,240
what we do is we look at the entire image of the rectus femoris for example but in the validation

752
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:41,800
we did not validate the score of the rectus femoris with the high frequency ultrasound

753
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:49,560
with the one square centimeter biopsy sample we validated the image the one square centimeter

754
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:55,800
image sample from the muscle biopsy with the muscle biopsy and that's where you have the same size

755
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,040
in image and therefore you have the correlation whether a couple authors they have correlated

756
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:07,960
the entire muscle with different pockets of glycogen everywhere with only the specific

757
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:14,920
you did apples to apples yes and you have an r squared of 0.9 the r is yeah it's in the 90s

758
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:21,800
93 94 pre and post wow without the need of doing this so if you had to guess two individuals

759
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,120
could differ how much between a person who's fit and someone who's in yeah so this is exactly to

760
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:33,240
your question so we see it very well others have done it before with muscle biopsies where they

761
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,120
have shown that fewer individuals they can store more glycogen than other individuals and that's

762
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:43,480
what we see so on a scale from zero to a hundred that we have you see the world class athletes

763
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:50,920
they can go to 85 90 100 whereas someone like myself i'm considering now like a weekend warrior

764
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,040
right i just you know try to exercise hang on hang on what's your ftp right now i'll be the

765
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,760
determinant of whether you're a weekend warrior not to be honest if you had to guess what is your

766
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:09,720
ftp above 300 or below no no i i don't know 275 yeah i would say something like that okay it's

767
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:14,680
still you're not a weekend warrior 275 is still a respectable i exercise four or five times a week

768
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:20,040
but to be honest and i don't use a power meter i i don't use a heart rate monitor i just go to

769
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:26,360
enjoy the ride how long does it take you to climb mount evans oh i've only done it once and it took

770
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:32,040
me a long time since years ago when i've been playing with numbers all my life and being my

771
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:37,560
own guinea pig i got to know myself quite well so i should not say that but um reading numbers all

772
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:42,040
day and the last thing that i want to do is like just read my own numbers you know when i go there

773
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:47,800
i haven't got there yet i've thought about it a lot but i still obsessively look at all my numbers

774
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,920
and i still use a power meter when i'm doing all of the zone two training like i could at this

775
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:58,520
point probably just put it away and ride based on feel but i don't know why i still love the

776
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:04,280
numbers even though it depresses me a little bit because the numbers are so bad but it's interesting

777
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,520
that you've been able to sort of separate yourself from that and say look i eat sleep and breathe the

778
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:14,200
numbers in the lab and with my athletes but when i'm riding it by myself you know what yeah just

779
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,160
enjoy myself yeah i mean the laboratory for eating all these numbers all day and working with athletes

780
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:25,480
and patients i just i just go riding and i know that i'm stimulating my mitochondria and here and

781
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:30,520
there that's right too i bring my portable analyzer with you here and there and i just double check

782
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,720
like okay the zone too so i sort of interrupted you but you were about to guess what your glycogen

783
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:41,080
storage capacity would be relative to the so the world class would be say 85 to 100 yeah so i might

784
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:47,960
be maybe 60 to 70 whereas uh people would like maybe type 2 diabetes might be 30 to 40 or 50 they

785
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:53,480
might have a normal glycogen storage capacity or on the low side but the well-trained athlete they

786
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:59,400
will increase it as well it's an irony because the fitter you are and the more glycogen you store the

787
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:04,280
less you are dependent on it yes isn't that interesting yeah exactly but at the same time

788
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:10,040
it's that energy that you need to move quickly for energy purposes this is the very interesting thing

789
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:15,000
on the other side looking at the fat oxidation the fat droplet if you heard about that the

790
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,520
intra muscular triglycerides they are highly related to cardiovascular disease and type 2

791
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,400
diabetes and insulin resistance and this is the athlete's paradox what's the name of the researcher

792
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:30,600
like sorry i blanked right now but what he did is like the same approach of looking at they had been

793
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:36,920
seen that people with type 2 diabetes they have this fat droplet it's like a little deposit of

794
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:42,520
fat right outside the mitochondria and it was a characteristic so what he did is like okay i'm

795
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,720
going to look at and then that was in comparison with people without type 2 diabetes they didn't

796
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,520
have this fat droplet so what he did is like okay i'm going to see if elite athletes or

797
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,840
world-torn athletes what histologically characteristic they have and he found a big

798
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:02,920
fat droplet as well adjacent to the mitochondria so that's the paradox it's like wow why in the

799
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,840
world they have that fat stored by the mitochondria so what it was found that in the people with type

800
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:16,680
2 diabetes that fat is not active and in fact it can produce ceramides and other pre-inflammatory

801
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:22,360
mediators that are not only involved with the insulin resistance but maybe with cardiovascular

802
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:28,520
disease or atherosclerosis they cannot be oxidized in the in the mitochondria so they build up

803
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:35,080
outside whereas in the well-trained athletes it's an rest reward there the fat that we burn in the

804
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:42,760
mitochondria it comes mainly from the succoutaneous fat and it has to travel it's a long trip all the

805
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:49,240
way to the muscle so why not from an evolutionary perspective why not having a reservoir right there

806
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:55,400
by the mitochondria and effectively about 25 to 35 percent of all the fat oxidation that elite

807
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:00,920
athletes do during exercise it comes from fat droplet it's very active so do you suspect that

808
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,360
in the study you're about to embark on the biopsies will also show this that in your fittest and your

809
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,600
least fit you'll see the droplets yes we're going to look at that as well why do you think that the

810
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:15,320
average people don't have droplets does that mean you and i probably don't have too many fat droplets

811
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:22,440
in our muscle probably not i would understand that if everybody had it sort of like structurally

812
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:27,640
but then there's a functional difference where there's a gradation from the person with diabetes

813
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:32,680
to the world-class athlete the gradation is in the utilization and activity of it but why do you

814
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:37,960
think people in the middle of the road like us have actually lost the capacity for that reservoir

815
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:42,920
well i think because we're not elite athletes but why do the people with diabetes still retain it

816
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:48,680
but in a static non-utilizable fashion that's what we're trying to find out why and in my opinion

817
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:53,400
is that hypothesis one of the one of tests is that the mitochondrial function is not good so

818
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:58,520
therefore fatty acids cannot be transported into the mitochondria and they're sort of building up

819
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:04,040
outside the mitochondria we can i see but we haven't completely built our capacity to use it

820
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:09,480
at high amounts so we don't have the reservoir it's like the glycogen thing we don't store 80 or 90

821
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:15,480
or 100 because we don't need it and at the end of the day the body is very wise and it's based on a

822
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:23,000
lot of evolutionary mechanisms and this is one of them glycogen storage capacity as well as the fat

823
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,240
right outside the mitochondria i've always thought of that paradox through the lens of fat flux which

824
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:33,800
is when you take a snapshot in time which is what you're doing when you do a blood test or a biopsy

825
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,880
you're looking at something in a moment it tells you nothing about the velocity and what i think

826
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:47,880
your example illustrates is that there's such a high turnover of things in the really really

827
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,200
fit person that even if it's elevated it's not problematic another place you see this by the way

828
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:58,280
in the blood is free fatty acid concentration so when you're doing a blood test to screen for

829
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:03,160
diabetes if you're doing very advanced testing you're looking at lots of things not just something

830
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:08,920
as sort of banal as the hemoglobin a1c but you'll you'll look at insulin and you'll look at insulin

831
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:14,840
under sort of provocation and you'll look at free fatty acids under provocation and amazingly

832
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,480
under the most metabolically flexible and least metabolically flexible conditions you see the

833
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:25,480
same pattern which is higher free fatty acids but again it comes down to flux exactly i suspected

834
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:31,480
in the person with diabetes it's just an accumulation of free fatty acid in the plasma whereas in the

835
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:37,080
very metabolically flexible person if you were putting a tracer on that ffa you'd see rapid

836
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:43,080
turnover exactly exactly and exactly and this blood analysis they don't use the tracers so you

837
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,920
just see whoa there's a lot of free fatty acids going around there and like what are they doing

838
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,400
where they're being metabolized for energy purposes in the metabolically flexible and you

839
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:56,680
see it very well kind of they're accumulating the other ones is this is kind of what we probably

840
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:01,400
see at the cellular level so i want to kind of finish the energy zones obviously at zone three

841
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:08,440
you're getting into you're exceeding the capacity to maintain a stable level of lactate which tells

842
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:15,800
you you're now exceeding the mitochondria's capacity to be the sole provider of ATP you are now

843
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:23,560
becoming obligately dependent on glycolysis in the cytosol by definition the percentage of fat

844
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:29,880
oxidation is now going down as the percentage contribution from glycolysis is going up is this

845
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,680
where the lactate threshold now occurs because i'm sure that people listening to this who are going

846
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:38,760
to say wait a minute wait a minute i always thought lactate threshold was around four millimolar so

847
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:44,520
how does that concept fit in so i would put the zone three as a transition zone where your

848
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:51,080
glycolytic system starts kicking in at a very high rate because the ATP demand and your fat

849
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:56,520
oxidation says okay i think i'm starting to be done here now you take over and that's where you

850
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:03,080
start seeing a decreasing fat yet you use fat so it's not a completely glycolytic state it's a

851
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:09,400
transition phase that is when we move into the zone four in the zone four that's where we see very very

852
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:15,640
well that the lactate also you see an inflection point that kind of where we could see the lactate

853
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,360
threshold where like all of a sudden the lactate accumulation is not steady it jumps and you see

854
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:26,440
the inflection point and at the same time that's where you usually start seeing the r of 1.0 the

855
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:34,280
rq and there's zero fat oxidation so we know very well it's like if there's a lot of lactate

856
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:40,040
and there's no fat oxidation that's another metabolic transition point that is indicating

857
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:47,720
that you don't burn fat anymore it's just dependent glucose yet you can breathe and it's

858
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:54,360
probably done in the cytosol so you're aerobic and that's the zone four we'll be calling the

859
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,920
lactate threshold if you will and what's the clinical significance of that or the even the

860
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:04,600
athletic significance of that i mean once an athlete goes above their lactate threshold

861
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:10,200
how long can they sustain that pace there are many lactate thresholds so we might believe that

862
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:15,880
lactate threshold could be maximal effort you can sustain for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or the ftp

863
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:20,440
the ftp could be away also of lactate threshold for a fat of 40k so for the person listening to

864
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:24,920
this who's not familiar with that ftp is defined as functional threshold power in cycling we use

865
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:30,760
it as the the maximum power that can be sustained for 60 minutes or sometimes we do a 20 minute test

866
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:37,560
and discount it by about 10 but i mean an ftp test for me has never felt linear you know what

867
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:46,440
i mean like if your ftp is 300 watts the pain at minutes 10 20 30 40 50 60 is not linear like the

868
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:53,800
last 10 minutes hurt more than the first 50 but now that i think about it whenever i did ftp tests

869
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:59,640
i was usually doing them on the road not on a stationary bike i never had lactate levels

870
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:05,480
throughout but my intuition is my lactate was increasing non-linearly i would always ftp test

871
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:10,840
on a hill because it was easiest to maintain a fixed power output but what's actually what do

872
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:15,160
you think is happening to a person's lactate when they're at that threshold i have seen that and i

873
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:20,440
presented american college of sports medicine poof like about 10 years ago and i have to publish it

874
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,520
is one of the things that you have so much things going on that sometimes you don't have the time you

875
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:29,560
need to get some med students working for you know i'm looking at the poster you're bringing up but

876
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:35,320
you haven't even published yet no 10 years ago yeah this is 2009 or something like that but this

877
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:41,400
is where back in the days a lot of people talked about power everybody would just train by power

878
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:47,320
and what's our what i started to see at the pro level a lot of people using just power output

879
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:52,120
and heart rate like as an old school i was one of those people actually you know five years ago

880
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:58,360
where it was i really didn't pay attention to heart rate at all except to notice that there

881
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:03,640
were some days when at the same power my heart rate was much higher and i felt and performed much

882
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:08,680
worse that was about the extent of my observation yeah i wanted to kind of show that with numbers

883
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:16,040
and that's what i say like okay power is power and speed is speed the ability of humans to perform

884
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:22,280
relies on the ability to convert chemical energy into mechanical energy the mechanical energy

885
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:28,200
that's your power output the chemical energy is like all the metabolic adaptations that get you

886
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:33,160
there so this is what i saw and we can put it as this is a poster you presented about 10 years ago

887
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,720
and by the way this is i hope there's a med student out there at the university of colorado who's

888
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:42,360
listening to this who's uh figured out what their next summer's task is going to be which has helped

889
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:47,320
turning this into a manuscript but tell us a little bit about this experiment and what it showed

890
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:52,840
because it's as i look at the figure i see it is answering it is answering the exact question i just

891
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,040
asked actually so yes one of the things is that a lot of people start to talk about watts are watts

892
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:04,200
right they ditched the heart rate monitor because watts are watts therefore metabolically speaking

893
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,520
is the same thing but as i said earlier the ability of humans to exercise depends on the

894
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:13,640
ability to convert chemical energy or biochemical energy into mechanical energy the mechanical

895
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:18,600
engine is the end product what but how do you get there so i wanted to see and put it to the test so

896
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:25,000
i had both a group of elite cyclists professionals and a group of recreational cyclists but well

897
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,560
trained as well and i did a maximal test where i could get that peak power output at the end of

898
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:39,240
the maximum test one group deleted cyclists the next test i put him at 80 percent at the big power

899
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:46,360
output from the first test and the second group at 75 and then i just let them stay there for 20

900
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:57,240
minutes so if the elite cyclist hit a peak power of 400 watts on the previous test 80 percent of

901
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:03,560
that so now you put him at 320 watts and say you're going to spend 20 minutes here and it's

902
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,880
like similar calculation for the recreational athlete though at a lower level exactly okay

903
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:12,600
so the whole thing was like if watts are watts it was like the whole bottle back in the days

904
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:17,640
is like okay then metabolically speaking we're not going to see changes in other words five minutes

905
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:22,840
into this test whatever is happening in you physiologically since you're not changing the

906
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:29,320
output or the demand for ATP there should be no change in anything else exactly so what happened

907
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:35,320
so what we saw is that after five minutes both groups they had about four millimoles of lactate

908
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:42,440
okay in the elite athletes five minutes later which is minute 10 they had about seven millimoles of

909
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:48,600
lactate and five minutes later which is minute 15 they had nine millimoles of lactate so right there

910
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:54,840
we see that watts are not watts at the metabolic level it was very stressful for them and they

911
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,640
could not keep it and this is kind of to what you alluded that you notice that towards the end of

912
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:06,360
some of this FTP it feels worse and this is exactly what i was observing with many professional

913
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:11,560
athletes and elite athletes as well i mean cyclists that they would get over trained more

914
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:17,640
and they said hey i i had to do let's say my coach told me i had to do five hours or four hours at 200

915
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:23,640
watts and i do the job and you can see i'm training picture so yeah you do 200 watts but

916
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:29,080
what's the price i used to be obsessed with training peaks and what was the other program called

917
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:34,680
there's another program we used to use but where does the TSS show up the training stress score is

918
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:40,680
that also training peaks yes and i remember i used to mostly just keep track of kilojoules

919
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:48,040
in the end of the day it was how many kilojoules today what's my TSS and my training score balance

920
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:52,920
and things like that but i think with this and by the way i'm looking at the graph the recreational

921
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:59,320
athletes basically had the exact same pattern just at lower levels meaning they fatigued quicker

922
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:05,880
at a lower level but the pattern is identical so heart rate lactate and and percentage of V2 max

923
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:11,080
and percentage as well as V2 max in liters per minute they all show statistical significance

924
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:18,040
so we see that watts are not watts that's when it's time to throw because i've been always like a

925
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:24,120
big believer of heart rate and when i was 15 i saved all the money that i had and i bought the

926
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:30,520
sports tester that back in the days was like 200 dollars no it was sorry it was like back in the

927
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:39,320
day it was about 500 dollars so i'm talking about 84 83 no 86 sorry i was my sports tester the year

928
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:45,560
greg lemond won his first exactly yeah and that's what i since then i've been looking at heart rate

929
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:51,160
a lot because we forget that heart rate is a physiological parameter watts is a mechanical

930
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:55,880
parameter but heart rate is a physiological parameter and response to the physiological

931
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:00,840
metabolic stress so if you look in the graph that the audience can see later when we look at

932
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:08,200
the graph of the lactate and the heart rate they go side by side when heart rate goes up lactate

933
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:13,400
goes up well i've noticed this and i'll show you more of my data over dinner tonight but for the

934
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:21,080
past year i've been recording four times a week my lactate levels on both devices plus heart rate

935
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:29,640
plus power at the end of i always like i'll do a minimum 20 minute steady power in a zone two

936
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:35,320
so anywhere from basically 20 to 45 minutes where the power is clamped i'm on a bike on an erg so

937
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:41,640
there's no deviation of power and there's a very interesting correlation between so even if you do

938
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:47,080
the same power for four consecutive workouts you can have different heart rates and you can have

939
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,360
different lactates now we're going to come back to this because i want to talk about it later

940
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:55,160
there's another confounder here which is metformin which will back burner even with or without

941
01:29:55,160 --> 01:30:00,840
metformin there's a coupling between heart rate so for example if you don't sleep well and your

942
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,760
heart rate's higher you're not recovered your heart rate's higher you're under more stress for some

943
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:10,200
other reason and heart rate is higher lactate tends to follow it even at the exact same power

944
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,320
output yes yes and that's what we're showing and that's where like then joe freel started to talk

945
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:20,200
about the coupling where you should maintain the power output and the heart rate as well

946
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,200
so among a bunch of us we kept pushing for heart rate because it was getting to a point that it was

947
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:32,040
going to be erased and now everybody trains with both power output and the heart rate in fact now

948
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:38,200
the whole hrv the heart rate variability it's a big big deal and a lot of people look at and

949
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,040
listen to their hearts and i always tell the athletes the heart rate is going to tell you a lot

950
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:48,040
this is one of the things also why i decided to try to develop a way to look at glycogen

951
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:54,280
because i would see that in in maximal physiological states many athletes who were fatigued

952
01:30:54,280 --> 01:31:02,360
or restricting carbohydrates they had a very low maximum lactate levels very low maximum heart rate

953
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:09,160
let's say that athlete that i have tested multiple times let's say a lactate of 12 and a heart rate of

954
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:16,280
190 when that athlete is fatigued or tired or restricting severely carbohydrates that

955
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:22,600
lactate could be maybe four and the heart rate could be maybe 162 and how much adaptation do

956
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,640
they have because i know you and i have spoken about this before and i don't know if we're going

957
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:30,680
to get into it on this podcast because there's so many things i want to talk about but your view

958
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:37,160
has always been that the fat oxidation data that we sometimes see in heavily heavily carbohydrate

959
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:42,120
restricted or ketogenic athletes may actually be an artifact we might not actually be seeing fat

960
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:49,800
oxidation of 1.7 to 2 grams per minute you're saying in a gc contender been the best cyclists

961
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:55,080
on the planet what is their maximum fat oxidation in grams per minute well what we're seeing here

962
01:31:55,080 --> 01:32:03,400
normally in the 0.7 0.8 grams per minute under normal and we have done these experiments although

963
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:10,280
we haven't published them but we have done a normal athlete like category two or three they do

964
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:16,200
under normal diet not super high in carbohydrates not super low normal diet and their fat oxidation

965
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:22,760
the fat max it's uh let's say 0.4 then they do one week of carbohydrate restriction or two weeks of

966
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:30,280
carbohydrate restriction and their fat max yeah it's 0.8 but at the same time we see that the power

967
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:38,040
output decreases at least 0.5 watts per kilogram so about 30 or 40 watts and also we see that the

968
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:43,720
maximum heart rate decreases and the maximum lactate decreases that said this is more in uh

969
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:49,320
if you will a more cute situation i'll tell you this from my experience and i go when i began

970
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:56,680
carbohydrate restriction which was uh i went on a ketogenic diet in may of 2011 the first 12 weeks

971
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:05,000
were hell i couldn't even imagine approaching my anaerobic fitness so forget lactate threshold or

972
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:12,440
anything i couldn't even get to the same aerobic level i remember i still remember very clearly

973
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:21,640
november 2012 18 months later it came back and then some what that suggested to me and if i could

974
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:28,200
go back in time and do anything different i would have had muscle biopsies done all along the way

975
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:34,280
but it struck me at how long it took for that adaptation to take place now i only stayed in that

976
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:39,560
state for three years so i'm long out of that state now there's the only time i'm really in

977
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:47,400
ketosis is around fasting but it's always sort of piqued my curiosity what a very very very long term

978
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:53,240
state ketogenic state can do for everything outside of peak sprinting capacity because i just

979
01:33:53,240 --> 01:34:00,040
i don't think there's any dispute that peak sprinting capacity has to be glycolytic and anything that

980
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:04,840
impairs glycolytic function makes no sense so there's such a debate about all of this stuff

981
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,760
i don't think it makes sense for someone trying to win the tour de france to be on a ketogenic diet

982
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:16,200
it's just too glycolytic even though 96 of that race can be done below peak power output

983
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:24,280
the race is won and lost under peak conditions so it makes no sense but if you're training to win

984
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:31,080
the western states 100 you technically don't need to sprint ever if you have a high enough threshold

985
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:36,840
so i still have that sort of point of view but again i'm very curious as to what those adaptations

986
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:40,920
are and how long they take because i don't think they're going to take place in a month

987
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:47,480
you bring up a great great point i'm extremely curious about that as well because i have never

988
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:52,760
seen an athlete at the elite level adapting and i'm going to tell you why in a second but at the

989
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:59,480
same time i believe that it cannot be possible that thousands of people around the world who are

990
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:05,240
getting into the ketogenic diet it might be working for them and they're making it up so i believe

991
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:10,200
there's something there at first when these things come up and i say come on man give me a break

992
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:14,280
but then i say there's so many people out there there's got to be something well there's one other

993
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:22,600
data point i'll add for you when i was on a ketogenic diet and cycling voraciously my

994
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:28,440
capacity to consume carbohydrates was much higher than what people think of as a ketogenic diet for

995
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:35,320
someone at rest as a general rule for somebody who's normal about 50 grams of carbohydrates is

996
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:40,760
the limit above that you begin to suppress the production of beta hydroxybutyrate but i used to

997
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:48,200
do lots of experiments and at my most extreme you know days when you'd have a three-day period where

998
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:54,760
you would do a hundred miles each day for three consecutive days at very high output so for me at

999
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:04,600
the time that might have been average power of 185 watts normalized power of 240 watts for seven hours

1000
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:12,120
on three consecutive days when you're at that much demand i was able to consume 600 grams of

1001
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:19,960
carbohydrates and stay in ketosis now wow i think that's because i'd spent so long adapting i don't

1002
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:26,440
think you can show up and go into ketosis and then a week later eat 600 grams i mean i was pushing as

1003
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:31,400
hard as i could to see how much of this can i consume but so there's the other thing to keep

1004
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:36,920
in mind which is at some point the body became flexible enough that i could break all the rules

1005
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:45,800
i could have 200 grams of protein 600 grams of carbohydrate and still maintain beta hydroxybutyrate

1006
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:51,960
levels above two to three millimolar because i think the machinery with which the bhb was made

1007
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,960
was i'd had two years of in fact this would have been probably three years in this is the summer of

1008
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:03,560
13 maybe so you know i'd really been at it for quite a while and again biggest regret is not

1009
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:07,880
having that there are lots of athletes out there that i think would be interesting to study so

1010
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,320
that's something worth considering starting to interrupt the thing what i haven't seen that

1011
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:17,320
adaptations in elite athletes is that they cannot afford it you mentioned that it takes months to

1012
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:23,400
get there you don't have months because you get dropped in the races your performance is very poor

1013
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:28,440
your contract is going to be trust they're not going to renew you and you're going to feel like

1014
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:35,160
crap every single athlete who has tried to go whether you call it like a ketogenic diet or

1015
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:42,120
carbohydrate restriction while training and competing for an event they fail that's what i've

1016
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:48,440
seen in 25 years and the reason probably is this because they didn't have one year to say hey you're

1017
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:53,800
not going to race in one year you can train very little your mission is to get adapted that that's

1018
01:37:53,800 --> 01:38:00,040
the way sports works but what i see is if you restrict carbohydrates we do blood analysis a lot

1019
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:05,800
we do this metabolic testing in the laboratory while these athletes are competing we see right

1020
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:11,080
away there's a catabolic response the body says holy crap what's going on here i need to survive

1021
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:18,200
somehow so you enter in a in an evolutionary survival mode so obviously yeah your ketones

1022
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:23,720
production might increase your fat oxidation might increase as well but your protein breakdown

1023
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:28,600
increases substantially as well and we see this in the blood analysis that's why you see muscle

1024
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:33,400
breakdown all the time although again it's transient which again speaks to because if it

1025
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:40,760
wasn't transient i mean evolution would absolutely demand we preserve protein under long periods of

1026
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:46,600
nutrient deprivation which of course is what the carbohydrate restriction is mimicking but it's this

1027
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,920
time course that i think is very unusual and you're right there's no professional athlete that could

1028
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:55,720
take that chance and again i we were talking about this earlier it's like there are some people whose

1029
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:00,120
entire lives can be built around chat rooms and discussion boards where they can debate these

1030
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:05,160
things endlessly neither you nor i have the time for that so i've largely stopped paying attention

1031
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:11,080
to this debate truthfully but it's always struck with me how long it took to adapt and the price i

1032
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:16,840
paid during that adaptation period if you were a professional athlete you would be out of the job

1033
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,400
yeah oh absolutely and this is why i think that i have never seen that because sooner or later the

1034
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:27,640
athlete they hit the wall they just cannot finish races or they just like hey what's going on here

1035
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:32,520
and then that's when they have to go back and we see this quite often athletes don't always listen

1036
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:38,040
to us they always go to the blocks and see things you know internet or they find where the neighbor

1037
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:44,920
is telling them and a lot of people try many diets and the tendency now and it was before also was to

1038
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:49,960
restrict carbohydrates and again i really think that you can adapt because the human physiology

1039
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:55,880
is a wonderful machine but do you have the time to that while you're a competitive athlete that's

1040
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:00,760
what i have a lot of thoughts that i don't think so yeah and again i think the discussion is

1041
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:05,800
is interesting in academic but of course in the end i still think carbohydrate restriction is a

1042
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:10,360
great tool for anyone who's not trying to win the Tour de France i think that's where people

1043
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:15,880
sometimes get hung up right it's if you want to win an olympic gold medal there are very few sports

1044
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:20,760
in which you could probably do that on a ketogenic diet and if you want to be the best cyclist or

1045
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:25,800
runner or swimmer on the planet very hard to do that on a ketogenic diet the good news is by the

1046
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:31,640
way if you're at that level your mitochondria are so remarkable that your carbohydrate tolerance

1047
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:36,040
is unbelievable where it comes back to and i think where the biggest opportunity is

1048
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:42,520
is the person who is not metabolically very healthy who thinks they need to drink a liter

1049
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:48,440
of Gatorade an hour and no actually that person can absolutely be on a carbohydrate restricted

1050
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:54,440
diet and they can exercise and yes maybe their performance initially is less than what it would

1051
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:58,920
be if they still mainlined all the carbohydrates in the world but in the long run they're going to

1052
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:04,920
produce a much more metabolically healthy phenotype even though they won't be in the top 0.1% of

1053
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,960
athletes who will no exactly i agree and the thing with the elite athletes too is that yes and this

1054
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:17,240
is kind of what i keep bringing up all the time there's no population on earth who has as many

1055
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:23,000
carbohydrates and simple sugars as these athletes by a landslide right this guy said the Tour de

1056
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:29,160
France for example yeah tell people like let's take a long stage of the tour so a 250 kilometer

1057
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:39,480
stage that has say four high category climbs and one hc climb so one climb beyond category yeah so

1058
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:45,960
these people they take first of all how long would it take them to complete 250 kilometer stage with

1059
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:50,680
four high category and one non-category which means it's just a brutal yeah it would be more

1060
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:55,800
like a 200 and it would be like a five five and a half hours and how long would that take you or i

1061
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,760
to ride right now man that would take us two hours more easily yeah and how long would it take an hour

1062
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:06,440
and a half or take me two hours more if i'm lucky how long would that take a person who

1063
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:13,160
doesn't ride their bike too days yeah i mean 14 hours something like that because they will have

1064
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:19,640
to do multiple stops and at the hc they might not even make the climb yeah yeah or much slower yeah

1065
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,960
while they do this climbs that the Tour de France depends on the weight but they usually they go

1066
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:30,440
between six and six point five watts per kilogram let's say a person of 70 kilos which is 70 kilos

1067
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:41,720
is probably 150 154 pounds so that would be about yeah 420 450 watts so we cannot do that you know

1068
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:49,480
like a normal well-trained person who exercises regularly can maybe do that in 300 watts but uh

1069
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:55,400
person who doesn't train can do that in 150 watts only so that's poof that's a long long time and

1070
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:01,560
their weight is usually significantly higher so that day it's hard to believe they can do that in

1071
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:07,160
five to six hours by the way but they would consume how much on that day both on the bike

1072
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:12,440
and off the bike so normally what they do and i have haven't published this but we keep track of

1073
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:17,480
this all the time we keep track of how the amount of carbohydrates per hour we keep track of the

1074
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:22,200
breakfast what they eat on the bike after the bike recovery right away we have these protocols

1075
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:28,040
and these protocols are very up to what they need or what we think they need and also based on what

1076
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:32,760
their demands are because they're the ones who like they need it you know and again as i said

1077
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:38,040
earlier i've seen athletes even restricting carbohydrates in the races and they get totally

1078
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:45,400
destroyed so these guys they consume a total or about 12 grams per kilogram of body weight per

1079
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:52,360
day of carbohydrates so if you're 155 pounds which could be an average weight let's say 70 kilos

1080
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:59,240
we're talking about close to 150 grams a day of carbohydrates more than 150 you said how much 12

1081
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:05,160
850 yeah yeah yeah so i thought you said 150 okay which is 850 grams of carbohydrates

1082
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:11,400
that's over three that's almost 4 000 calories yeah 3 500 calories of carbs and out of those

1083
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:19,560
at least a good 30 percent of those 250 is simple carbohydrates let's say 30 percent of those so

1084
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:28,120
we're talking about these people are having daily about 1500 grams of sugar i'm sorry 1500 calories

1085
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:33,320
of sugar so almost give me an example of what type of sugar they're consuming like gels and yeah the

1086
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:40,200
gels the goose the drinks and then obviously at breakfast at lunch and dinner they're more complex

1087
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:45,560
but during the race in the first part we do more solid versus liquid but towards the end of the

1088
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:51,480
race we do more liquid so more pure sugar simply because it's sub-sort faster and that's what you

1089
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:58,760
need more energy but yeah these people again they do about 1500 calories a day just in sugar imagine

1090
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:04,920
pretty much your entire daily caloric intake of a normal person a bowl of sugar if you want to do

1091
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:10,120
this if you go to a nutritionist and you say i want to do this they will shoot you yeah look if i did that i'd have diabetes in a month

1092
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:14,360
of course of course of course and we know that they don't have it in fact this is the

1093
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:21,480
healthiest metabolically population in the planet now the irony of it is on two-fold one in many

1094
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:26,840
other ways they're wildly unhealthy the rate of catabolism the bone density loss that these guys

1095
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:32,200
experience over the tour de france is debilitating i mean these guys they lose so much muscle they

1096
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,880
lose so much bone density the other thing we see is for many of these athletes the transition out

1097
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:45,800
of being at that level to being normal again is devastating because especially i actually read an

1098
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:52,360
article on this once i wonder if i could find it i believe that the answer was more common in males

1099
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:59,480
than females where the rebound effect to becoming metabolically unhealthy was unbelievable it's very

1100
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:06,120
hard to turn that spigot off of you're basically a non-stop eating machine and then all of a sudden

1101
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:11,400
you're on the path to having diabetes three years five years ten years after being the fittest person

1102
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:18,280
in the world yeah and that happened to me when i quit cycling between school work i was working

1103
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:26,680
and traveling i was working 70 hours a week at least i was from doing 500 kilometers a week

1104
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:33,320
to do 500 kilometers a year i would exercise literally six seven times a year and traveling

1105
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:39,480
and eating and and one thing that i have observed is like insulin sensitivity these athletes have

1106
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:44,600
the highest insulin sensitivity of any humans as well there's no insulin resistance because

1107
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:50,200
first we know very well that exercise increases insulin sensitivity and they need it to utilize

1108
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:55,480
carbohydrates it increases insulin sensitivity as well and the transporters there's all that

1109
01:46:55,480 --> 01:47:00,040
efficiency in the mitochondria comes with another benefit which we didn't really talk about which was

1110
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:07,160
non-insulin dependent glucose uptake is also going up so now if you take a normal person

1111
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:13,880
we are able to take up glucose with insulin that's the insulin sensitivity but we have a second door

1112
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:20,280
that doesn't get utilized much which is the non-insulin requiring door to put glucose in the muscle

1113
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:24,040
and there's no better way to stimulate that than zone two i mean i don't know if i have a study

1114
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:29,480
that i can point to but i can clinically tell you without a shadow of a doubt and i'll tell you how

1115
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:34,360
i know it's looking at people with type one diabetes exactly i was going to mention that yeah

1116
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:39,080
you take people for whom you know exactly how much insulin they require i'm actually going to

1117
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:44,040
be writing about one of these patients in my book he's type one diabetes completely dependent on

1118
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:50,840
on insulin he's completely maniacal i love him three hour brisk walk every night so that's his

1119
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:57,720
zone two three hours of zone two a day right you know how much insulin this person with type one

1120
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:05,400
diabetes requires a day to five in units about eight to ten units a day he has the highest sex

1121
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:10,200
hormone binding globulin i've ever seen in a human being which is inversely proportionate to insulin

1122
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:15,320
level this guy has no insulin he doesn't require anything i learned from this a lot i was working

1123
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:20,920
with team nova nordisk yeah tell people about what team nova nordisk is a professional team

1124
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:26,760
where 100 of the cyclists are type one diabetics these are professional cyclists with type one

1125
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:32,680
diabetes so the whole purpose of team nova nordisk was first to show the world that you're not going

1126
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:38,040
to not only not die if you have type one diabetes but you can't become a professional athlete to

1127
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:43,400
spread the word because a lot of people think it's a devastating diagnosis for many oh you're type one

1128
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:48,280
you're going to die soon like no you're not going to die soon if you take good care of yourself but

1129
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:53,880
and even you can become a professional athlete so that was the one message to spread the world and

1130
01:48:53,880 --> 01:49:00,120
the second is that to study diabetes and type one diabetes and the metabolic effects of exercise

1131
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:06,360
because nowadays most endocrinologists working with diabetics they're telling to exercise the

1132
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:13,560
problem is like they go to exercise and they have many hypoglycemias or hyperglycemias and they need

1133
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:18,840
to correct it and all the hormonal system goes all over the map and they go back to their doctors

1134
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:27,320
and they have no answers so it's the number one barrier they defined from exercise and they many

1135
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:32,120
decide not to exercise because they can control their doses very well and let's explain why that's

1136
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:37,960
happening to people we've talked a lot about the consumption of glucose but as you're alluding to

1137
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:43,640
whether it's you me or someone with type one diabetes when i exercise very strenuously my

1138
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:51,240
glucose goes way up so if i'm doing twice a week i do high intensity exercise as you can see on my

1139
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:57,400
arm i wear a continuous glucose meter it's not uncommon especially if i do it right after a

1140
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:03,080
zone two this is funny because zone two my glucose steadily falls let's say i get on the bike at 100

1141
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:08,840
i do 45 minutes of zone two i get off at 75 you get too bunk sometimes you've enhanced

1142
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:15,320
i don't go long enough to vahank for sure so then let's say i get on the air bike and i do a four

1143
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:23,640
minute protocol it's not uncommon for me to go from 75 to 160 because of the hepatic glucose

1144
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:29,240
output yeah like which in lysis yeah and that person with type one diabetes that number could

1145
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:34,520
easily be 250 because they don't have the insulin to correct it exactly so then they need to correct

1146
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:38,920
and they freak out so they use a lot of insulin they overshoot it exactly they're

1147
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:44,120
reshooted and this is exactly to what you pointed out about the non-insulin dependent system which

1148
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:50,120
is the muscle and this is what it was an educational process so then with jdrf the juvenile diabetes

1149
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:55,720
found a research foundation that we put together they put together like a group of experts if you

1150
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:03,240
will to train clinicians about this so what did you learn i mean how do people compete in

1151
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:10,680
professional cycling without being on that glycemic roller coaster we learned a lot to work on

1152
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:17,800
insulin usage as opposed to insulin correction and that's what we're taking now to the clinical

1153
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:22,920
space because type one diabetes has been about correcting insulin and insulin and insulin and

1154
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:28,600
eating carbohydrates oh you go low sorry man you just keep eating candy or things like that and

1155
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:33,320
we know that that cannot be very healthy for you in the long term but the approach has been

1156
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:40,120
always that to correct by either eating or using insulin but we're trying to really correct it by

1157
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:46,360
really tackling insulin administration so using just longer acting forms is that either you're

1158
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:53,000
longer acting or less insulin and therefore also to do exercise so when you do exercise if you say

1159
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:59,480
first your insulin sensitivity increases so you don't need so much insulin and as i said earlier

1160
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:05,320
the first tissue that develops type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance is the skeletal muscle

1161
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:10,760
so when you eat carbohydrates the big percentage of that are going to go into your skeletal muscle

1162
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:17,480
are people with type 1 diabetes who are exercising even more insulin sensitive at the muscle than

1163
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:24,760
non-insulin dependent individuals who are matched they could probably be so the long-term exposure

1164
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:30,280
this is what i observe for example about glycogen unfortunately it wasn't published because the end

1165
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:35,240
was very low but the reviewers they didn't understand that you cannot do muscle biopsies to

1166
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:39,240
a professional cycling team and there's only one professional cycling team in the world so i did a

1167
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:45,080
the tour of colorado i did the team novone or disc and another team and look at the glycogen

1168
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:51,720
what did you see about 25 higher glycogen content before the race and after the race in type 1

1169
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:59,560
diabetics and about three times less carbohydrate needs than the non-diabetics which we already had

1170
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:07,560
seen because we count carbohydrates and we know that a normal cyclist they have 20 grams per hour

1171
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:13,720
of carbohydrates they're gonna hit the wall in a race type 1 diabetics they have 20-25 average

1172
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:18,520
and they never have any issues you must see higher free fatty acid levels then yes so all

1173
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:23,320
things equal do they just have higher fat oxidation across the entire spectrum they're not very good

1174
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:28,600
necessarily at that and i'm trying to understand that puzzle but what i believe is like i have a

1175
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:35,160
higher glycogen content because insulin drives glycogen synthesis is the main hormone behind

1176
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:41,160
glycogen synthesis so if you've been for and the issue of people with type 1 diabetes they go from

1177
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:47,640
non-physiological state which is not producing insulin to the exact opposite they use a lot more

1178
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:54,840
insulin than normal people over years so 20 years usually insulin it must maybe elicit some

1179
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:00,200
adaptations that might one of them could be increased glycogen synthesis i have no idea

1180
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:04,840
but that was kind of what we would like to explore further so do you think that those athletes who

1181
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:11,080
were able to get by with as little as 20 grams of glucose per hour which seems impossible to

1182
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:15,960
imagine given their energy requirement do you think at some point that would cease to be the

1183
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:22,040
case and in the tour of colorado maybe the longest stage is what four or five hours yeah yeah but

1184
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:26,040
still that's hard to explain it's still a week-long race isn't it yeah yeah did you say that their

1185
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:31,560
glycogen levels still were 25 higher at the end of the race before and after yes that's counter

1186
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:37,400
intuitive yeah sorry was it i know it's 25 higher than the non-diabetic but what about relative to

1187
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,520
themselves as the way they decreased how much do they decrease i don't remember because not a whole

1188
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:47,560
lot because i mean in this stage you have to do within the same time and in the tour of colorado

1189
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:52,520
in the mountains why not hotel is here there one is 20 minutes away so i had to do it in one stage

1190
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:57,160
where all of them were on the same floor two teams that was a short stage it was like two and a half

1191
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:02,360
hour stage so they eat normally and they decrease like 15 for 20 percent or something like that so

1192
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:07,560
they didn't deplete completely by you could make the case that that team had some of the highest

1193
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:12,840
levels of non-insulin dependent glucose uptake you've probably ever measured probably probably

1194
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:18,600
yeah so that's what to your question of that the non-insulin uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle

1195
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:22,840
that's what is a great approach we don't have a way to measure this in those of us who don't have

1196
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:27,560
type 1 diabetes we're sort of taking a leap of faith that the more we work on our mitochondrial

1197
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:33,240
efficiency the more we will drive that non-insulin dependent pathway but really it's only the person

1198
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:39,080
in type 1 diabetes where that can be quantified it needs a skeletal muscle contraction first of all

1199
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:45,960
in insulin what it does it initiates the cascade of events that translocate the transporters of

1200
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:52,360
insulin called the glut-4s to the surface of glucose yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry to the

1201
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:59,000
surface of the muscle and those transporters are stimulated by insulin so a skeletal muscle

1202
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,240
that's the exact same action it translocate those glut-4s to the surface so therefore there's that

1203
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:13,320
the non-insulin dependent and why does exercise increase that ability we don't know the exact

1204
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:17,160
mechanism it just seems too good to be true i want to make sure that the person listening to

1205
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:21,640
this understands what you just said so i'm just going to repeat it because it's so profound and

1206
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:25,720
you said it like sort of you know you said it sort of like matter-of-factly because of course for

1207
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:32,120
you it's common knowledge when insulin hits the insulin receptor on a muscle it sends a cascade

1208
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:38,760
of chemical reactions inside the muscle that ultimately results in a tube called the glut-4

1209
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:45,240
transporter being raised to the surface of the muscle and translocating across the membrane and

1210
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:52,120
now you have bypassive diffusion glucose can enter the muscle the key is this insulin in the

1211
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:57,560
lock is the insulin receptor and the downstream effect that occurs inside the house opens the

1212
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:03,560
door and lets the glucose in what you said after that is you explained how non-insulin dependent

1213
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:10,600
glucose works which is somehow just the contraction of the muscle so something that's going on inside

1214
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:17,800
the house squeezes and out comes the same beautiful glut-4 transporter which now allows

1215
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:23,000
the same passive diffusion of glucose into the cell but this time it didn't require insulin

1216
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:29,080
this is the best of both worlds this is what henry richer from denmark and lori goodyear from

1217
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:35,240
harvard they've been in dedicated many years to study these pathways so they found that this muscle

1218
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:42,600
contraction stimulates pathways to translocate those glut-4 transporters to the surface and this

1219
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:49,320
is why the pancreas in regular people who don't have type 1 diabetes decreases insulin secretion

1220
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:55,800
about 50 percent during exercise because the muscle they do the rest and this is what causes

1221
01:57:55,800 --> 01:58:03,240
also that hypoglycemia in athletes if they don't correct their insulin before exercise they go

1222
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:09,880
hypo so what we were doing and now we're doing clinically we're telling people to reduce the

1223
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:15,960
dose wait a minute this is interesting now this is suggesting that the reduction that i'm seeing in

1224
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:22,280
glucose when i do my zone 2 which is by far the most profound thing you don't see this at higher

1225
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:27,000
levels of intensity see the opposite you see the opposite glucose going up but zone 2 is a sweet

1226
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,880
spot where my glucose level always falls precipitously i shouldn't say precipitously

1227
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:39,000
steadily and consistently i never thought of it this way it must be almost entirely the non

1228
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:45,240
insulin dependent glucose uptake because it's a low enough level of intensity that my internal

1229
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:52,280
glycogen stores are easily providing glucose what is needed so this is an additional amount

1230
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:57,800
through that so that's i feel like this is another metric i want to start keeping track of each day

1231
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:02,680
i'm doing zone 2 it's not just power it's not just heart rate it's not just lactate it's the delta

1232
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:07,720
in glucose from start to finish could be yet another metric we look at and in fact one of the

1233
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:12,760
things is like i'm trying to try to take this to the clinic for people who take two diabetes

1234
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:18,600
it's like uh if you eat go exercise right away because when you exercise right away that muscle

1235
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:24,440
contraction is going to translocate these glute IV transporters without the need of insulin

1236
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:29,160
and i thought it was the opposite you know i thought that exercising will increase the

1237
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:34,840
insulin dependent portion and therefore the best time for someone with diabetes to eat was right

1238
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:40,840
after exercise it could be both it could be both yes i think there might be an patient by patient

1239
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:47,640
base but if you have insulin resistance you're going to need to use more insulin after you eat

1240
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:53,880
which it's a patch it doesn't solve the problem but if you exercise then you might need half of

1241
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:58,520
the insulin because the other half is going to be provided of the glucose intake into the cell by

1242
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:04,920
the muscle contraction so learning a lot from type one diabetics we can apply things to type two i

1243
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:10,280
believe one of the things that we see the opposite effect that we saw in the races normal people who

1244
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:16,600
are told to exercise they're not fit enough and they start jogging right and they're in zone four

1245
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:22,760
already very glycolytic they see the opposite they see in a post-exercise hyperglycemia where

1246
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:29,240
there as you said in the 260s so and they inject themselves insulin and they go down and sometimes

1247
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:33,320
in the middle of the night and then they go home if it's towards the evening they eat and they

1248
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:39,240
correct it again and sometimes end up in the er because they have a severe hypoglycemia but so one

1249
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:45,800
of the things that i started to apply first to the cyclists and then to patients is the cool down

1250
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:52,840
so after people would have this high post-exercise hyperglycemia the muscle contraction stops

1251
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:59,160
and that's why i believe this is why it is happening first you have a very high adrenergic activity

1252
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:04,200
high intensity a lot of adrenaline and that's what causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose

1253
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:11,960
as well as the glucose export from the uh from the liver but then when you stop that muscle

1254
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:17,960
contraction stops completely so you don't have that you've taken away one of your sinks exactly

1255
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:22,840
so that's when you start doing the cool down and that's a study another study i have the data i

1256
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:27,240
have to publish but we could see clearly that everybody started to go down there's definitely

1257
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:31,960
going to be some university colorado medical students or hopefully undergraduates who've just

1258
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:37,240
lined up potentially a half a dozen interesting things to write with you we started to see the

1259
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:41,880
cool down and the cool down would take care of it so people to the point that they would not need

1260
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:46,520
insulin anymore to correct it whereas before they might need three four five units and now they

1261
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:52,120
don't need it anymore because that cool down took care of it so through jdrf we've been traveling

1262
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:57,240
throughout the country and other places in europe and even australia training clinicians about this

1263
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:02,600
so they can go back to their patients and the cool down has been a basic thing and the feedback

1264
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:07,960
we're getting is awesome this is incredible you know it's such a shame that the disease type one

1265
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:13,080
diabetes and the disease type two diabetes share the same name in diabetes because i do think for

1266
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:18,920
many people they just sort of think someone has diabetes but the nomenclature of one versus two

1267
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:24,200
is profound they are really different diseases very completely they almost have nothing in common

1268
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:29,960
except for high glucose as a potential consequence i agree hundred percent it's a real shame it's

1269
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:34,440
there's an artifact of history and this is what i'm trying to also bring the concept of double

1270
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:40,520
diabetes that very few people talk about it because it's mixed type two diabetes especially

1271
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:46,440
now in the u.s. Novo Nordisk told me that i think about two-thirds of the entire insulin that is

1272
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:52,600
sold in america it's for type twos not for type ones and this is the animal that is different

1273
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:57,480
the type two diabetic people is a way different animal than it was 50 years ago i've always been

1274
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:02,360
sort of critical of these companies like Novo Nordisk because i feel like there's just too great

1275
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:06,840
a conflict of interest for them right i mean first of all insulin should be basically free

1276
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:11,800
there's absolutely no from an ip perspective there's absolutely no reason insulin should

1277
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:18,440
cost anything above some nominal amount so it's this cash cow for drug companies like Novo Nordisk

1278
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:21,400
don't worry i'm not going to put you on the spot and have you speak critically at all i'm going to

1279
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:26,280
do all the critical speaking yeah no because we get funded this group is funded by Novo Nordisk

1280
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:30,600
indirectly what i'm going to do is come around and sort of pay them this compliment and say i like

1281
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:35,080
realizing that there's something good that's done by an entity that i generally view not favorably

1282
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:40,680
because again one the price gouging on insulin to me is the most unethical part of pharma but then

1283
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:48,280
on top of that there's this issue of two-thirds of your sales come from a patient who shouldn't

1284
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:54,600
be using your drug the drug really is for people with type one diabetes if you have type two

1285
02:03:54,600 --> 02:04:01,160
diabetes almost without exception changing the way you eat and exercise will at least get rid of

1286
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:06,120
the insulin requirement you may still require other medications but you shouldn't require insulin

1287
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:11,640
and that's been repeatedly demonstrated so all that said rant over it's nice to see that this

1288
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:17,560
type of research is being done because these patients offer us a beautiful physiologic milieu

1289
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:22,680
in which you otherwise couldn't see this so this kind of brings me to while we're on the topic of

1290
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:28,760
diabetes something else that i want to talk with you about which is my recent and by recent i mean

1291
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:35,080
over the last six months frankly maybe nine months it's sort of back and forth exploration of my use

1292
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:39,560
of metformin when we very first time met a year ago we talked about how i use metformin i've been

1293
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:45,800
using it for years with the basic belief that even though i don't have diabetes or insulin resistance

1294
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:51,640
it offers some measure of protection from cardiometabolic disease inclusive of cancer

1295
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:58,360
and that's all based on data that unfortunately is confined to people with insulin resistance

1296
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:03,320
hyperinsulinemia or type 2 diabetes so there was always a leap of faith i was taking that if you

1297
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:09,080
took a metabolically healthy individual they would still have some benefit and when patients would

1298
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:16,280
ask me about it i would say my belief is that i'm probably receiving less benefit than someone who's

1299
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:22,200
more metabolically unhealthy but i think i'm receiving benefit and i don't see a downside

1300
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:28,360
and then all of that changed a year ago when we met and i started keeping track of my zone two

1301
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:37,560
numbers and what i immediately realized was a gross mismatch between where i knew physiologically

1302
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:44,200
i was clearly in a zone two just based on perceived effort and my understanding of my fitness level

1303
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:49,400
but i couldn't get over how high my lactate levels were and then i remember you and i would speak and

1304
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:53,400
you would say well what is your lactate level fasting and i'd say you know sometimes it's like

1305
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:59,400
1.6 even before i start i mean this was back when i was in the business of using as many strips as

1306
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:06,280
possible so expensive those stupid things so i would check two times fasting and then every

1307
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:13,480
10 minutes check double double double double double man and there was no denying it i mean

1308
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:18,200
my lactate levels were through the roof and i said to you do you think it could be the metformin

1309
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:23,160
and then around this time a couple of papers came out that suggested that metformin could be blunting

1310
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:28,360
the benefits of exercise so i mean let's go back to then and then we'll talk about where we are today

1311
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:32,200
in our thinking but at the time that i told you all of this what was your thinking about my use

1312
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:38,040
of metformin and these numbers we were seeing did it make sense to you yeah they make sense in a way

1313
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:44,520
that we know that i've seen patients with metformin pre-type 2 diabetic or type 2 diabetic right before

1314
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:51,480
entering insulin states where at rest i have even seen two millimoles also are you able to differentiate

1315
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:55,640
how much of that was due to the metformin versus there because there's such a confounder when you

1316
02:06:55,640 --> 02:07:01,480
look at that population had you seen anybody like me where they're no i've seen these high levels of

1317
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:07,480
lactate at rest but again i could not differentiate that but all these people coincided they were on

1318
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:13,720
metformin one of the side effects of metformin is lactic acidosis right this is rare but it can

1319
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:18,920
happen so we know there's something wrong with the lactate what we don't know are the mechanisms

1320
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:25,640
it would be great to study the mechanisms whether or for to improve the cardiometabolic health or

1321
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:31,960
maybe we might find that might not be what we thought we know there are some studies that show

1322
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:38,120
that metformin decreases mitochondrial function it could be that magical drug against cancer

1323
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:42,920
because one of the things that we see in cancer many forms of cancer they have a mitochondrial

1324
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:49,400
dysfunction yet not enough for that cancer cell to be apoptotic oh i see so you're saying that

1325
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:56,760
maybe in that patient metformin pushes them over the edge towards apoptosis towards the cliff that's

1326
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:02,360
what i believe if in case that is true that metformin can cause mitochondrial dysfunction

1327
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:09,720
but the fact that the metformin increases lactate it's either because it increases the glucose flux

1328
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:17,160
into the cell and saturates pdh and then pdh the hydrogenase has a very what we call low

1329
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:22,920
micaelis constant so it saturates very rapid and in my opinion acts as a fuse in the body

1330
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:28,440
from an evolutionary perspective if the body sees there's a lot of high flux of glucose the

1331
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:32,280
body might mean hey what's going on here we need to stop it because it's not good to become

1332
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:39,400
hypoglycemic and maybe the majority of those glycolytic enzymes in the downstream action of

1333
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:46,440
glycolysis they usually have a high micaelis constant but when they get to pdh it's like a fuse

1334
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:53,800
so when that fuse goes then pyruvate is converted to lactate so that could be it either increases

1335
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:59,480
the flux of glucose into the cell and that's why it could work well for diabetes or acts as other

1336
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:03,480
sub shows this is very interesting so this suggests that let's just talk for a moment about

1337
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:08,760
someone with type 2 diabetes who's not taking metformin their lactate levels are higher at

1338
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:16,200
baseline you're now really offering two explanations for it the first is pdh because

1339
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:23,640
their pdh is seeing higher glucose than the non-diabetic so that's the first thing it's doing is

1340
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:29,480
as you say i like that analogy of the fuse it's just triggering the fuse and shunting more glucose

1341
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:35,720
down the pyruvate to lactate pathway and then of course there's everything we spent the first

1342
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:41,800
hour talking about which is in addition to that their mitochondria just tap out very early they're

1343
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:47,960
not working well so those two things that are related but quite distinct would both push up

1344
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:53,720
lactate so now the question is which one of those is more likely being driven by metformin is it the

1345
02:09:53,720 --> 02:10:00,440
inhibition of complex two in the mitochondria and it's simply reducing mitochondrial efficiency

1346
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:05,640
if you picture a curve where the x-axis is mitochondrial function it's just moving you to

1347
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:11,560
the left exactly it could be that and maybe it could be both it could be both what we know

1348
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:18,920
epidemiologically speaking is that metformin doesn't cure diabetes and the immense majority

1349
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:24,600
of patients they end up using insulin down the road so we know that metformin is not that magical

1350
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:31,160
drug for type 2 diabetics it just kind of gets them by it buys them time but eventually the

1351
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:36,680
majority enter insulin it didn't change their lifestyle the nutrition exercise they enter

1352
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:42,760
insulin so why i mean so the first thing i did so i used to take one gram twice a day a gram in

1353
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:46,280
the morning and a gram before bed i always do my zone two first thing in the morning so i was

1354
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:52,200
basically doing a zone two right after taking a gram and basically 12 hours after having taken

1355
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:57,240
another gram so you could argue i had very high levels so i think the first change i made was i

1356
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:03,560
just stopped taking a gram in the morning and increased my nighttime dose to 1500 milligrams

1357
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:08,840
so i reduced my overall dose by 25 but shifted it to the nighttime thinking well i should have a

1358
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:14,600
lower concentration in my bloodstream in the morning i saw no meaningful effect so 1500 at

1359
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:20,920
night was still producing basically the same effect as a gram twice a day now again keep in

1360
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:25,480
mind when you're doing an n of one you can't actually make any statistics out of this it has

1361
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:30,760
to be a big signal for me to notice it so then i lowered it to a nighttime dose of one gram

1362
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:39,240
i still didn't really see much of a difference and then what i did is i stopped taking it the

1363
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:47,400
night before doing zone two so that meant i now went from taking 14 grams a week a gram twice a day

1364
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:54,520
to only one gram three nights a week because there's only three nights a week where i don't

1365
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:59,480
follow the workout by a zone two so you've gone from taking 14 grams a week to three grams per

1366
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:04,600
week you could argue why are you taking any of it at that point and that's when i saw the reduction

1367
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:09,880
that's when i saw the lactate levels start to come down okay and in fact that latter part of the

1368
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:14,840
experiment's only been going on for about three weeks so the next step is to stop metformin

1369
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:20,760
all together and ride this out which makes me think we should do a little experiment in me

1370
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:27,560
which is yeah we should do muscle biopsies complete proteomics complete metabolomics

1371
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:34,840
everything that is doable in vitro in the muscle tissue along with the lactate testing and all the

1372
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:42,360
other metrics under three states of physiology one under full dose of metformin two under a complete

1373
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:48,520
washout say 30 days of no metformin and then the third one i think would be very interesting is

1374
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:54,360
under complete water fast where i also by the way whenever i water fast i have no metformin

1375
02:12:54,360 --> 02:13:00,280
and i'd like to see what seven days of water fasting with no metformin looks like versus

1376
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:04,840
again these other two states so i think there's an interesting pilot study here to come to our

1377
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:09,800
our study and be part of it and we can do extra biopsies yeah yeah i'm totally game to do this

1378
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:14,440
yeah it would be very interesting because it's fascinating the the whole role of metformin and

1379
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:20,120
also how it can be used in other diseases as well and it's fascinating the the little that we know

1380
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:27,000
about the mechanisms of action at the molecular level yet i think you bring great point is to try

1381
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:33,000
metformin in different states and try to learn what happens at the mixed level metabolomics

1382
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:38,120
proteomics level especially the latter ones because yeah we might see pathways maybe it's

1383
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:43,800
mitochondrial dysfunction that causes that and we can see that quite well or uh maybe it's at

1384
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:48,920
that translocation level that transporters and it would be really interesting assuming the irb gives

1385
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:54,520
a quick approval for this little added protocol that includes me if we could recruit somebody

1386
02:13:54,520 --> 02:14:00,680
with type 2 diabetes and have them parallel me with without the metformin with without the fast

1387
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:06,520
because my new hypothesis around metformin is i just have a stronger conviction i think around

1388
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:12,200
my old hypothesis which is the healthier you are the less helpful it is i'm now wondering if it goes

1389
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:16,040
one step further which is the healthier you are the less i mean it might actually cease to be

1390
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:20,760
healthy in other words let's take the extreme example what would you predict would happen if

1391
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:26,920
you gave a tour de france team a gram of metformin twice a day during the tour no other change you

1392
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:31,080
just give them a gram of metformin throughout the tour do you think it would have no impact on

1393
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:36,120
performance or a negative impact i mean based on looking at that it can affect mitochondrial

1394
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:41,000
function and we see because there's increased lactate in my opinion and that's the very first

1395
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,960
take and by no means i'm an expert on this it might be detrimental that's my first take if you

1396
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:50,040
think you had a hard time getting professional cyclist a volunteer for muscle biopsies think

1397
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:55,000
about how much harder it'll get them to volunteer for the take metformin and go off and do the vuelta

1398
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:01,560
i know it would be really really difficult to get i or before that in the first place

1399
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:06,440
and the permission from the manager livelihood yeah there's so much more i want to talk about

1400
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:10,360
and i want to tell real quick that the double diabetes and i forgot and i'm sorry to interrupt

1401
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:15,160
you is that that's something that worries me because there are many people with type one

1402
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:20,200
who also have type two and they're not diagnosed and i think we need to raise the awareness

1403
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:25,000
because if about 50 percent of u.s adult population has type two diabetes

1404
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:29,320
yeah a big number of people with type one diabetes are going to have also type two is that a

1405
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:34,600
projection of how many people in the united states will have type two diabetes right now about 50

1406
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:39,640
of u.s adult population have either pre-diabetes or diabetes correct yeah and it's about is it maybe

1407
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:45,960
10 percent have type two diabetes and the remaining 40 percent is pre-diabetes yeah and i was thinking

1408
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:51,240
there's not such state as being pre-pregnant or pregnant you're pregnant or you're not so yeah

1409
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:56,120
that pre-type two diabetes wouldn't see clinical symptoms yet but the disease is there already

1410
02:15:56,120 --> 02:16:01,080
yeah it's just i mean our definition of diabetes is so arbitrary and stupid that it's just a

1411
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:04,760
continuum and we somehow decide oh you're hemoglobinate once you cross this threshold

1412
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:09,000
and now you need or not it's kind of like with the symptoms with cholesterol oh you're 200 boom

1413
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,640
you need a statin or 220 you need a statin and that no that's the other thing with statins

1414
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:17,480
is that we know that they affect my kind of function how do we see this because in the

1415
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:23,560
published literature five to ten percent of people experience muscle symptoms from statins

1416
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:28,920
but what is the functional impact the function impact i mean we don't know much about it so

1417
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:34,040
you're talking outside of myalgias and muscle pain the good news is i always say this to patients

1418
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:38,360
when you're taking a statin you're going to get the feedback very quick one in ten of you

1419
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:44,440
is not going to tolerate this and it won't be very subtle and you'll stop the medication

1420
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:50,760
and within a week you'll feel better and again what's interesting is the disparate data based

1421
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:55,880
on how it's studied but at the individual level it's pretty straightforward yeah it is pretty

1422
02:16:55,880 --> 02:17:01,160
straightforward and one thing that we know too is that it increases also in this research done it

1423
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:05,720
increases the possibilities of becoming diabetic yeah so that's the two things i usually say to a

1424
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:09,480
patient i said there's because everyone says look if you're going to do a statin what are the risks

1425
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:15,800
and i say the short term risk is myalgias and again i just say directionally it's one in ten people

1426
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:20,680
maybe it's 15 maybe it's five percent but you get the feedback quickly and you move on so the second

1427
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:26,040
risk is a long-term risk which is about a four percent increase in the risk of diabetes the good

1428
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:30,680
news there is that's not a sudden thing i think the literature is still pretty clear that the

1429
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:37,080
benefit still outweighs that risk in terms of mortality but again it comes back to the idea of

1430
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:42,920
the most potent drugs we have are food and exercise absolutely and it comes back to me as well

1431
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:47,720
that it's not about how many years we live our longevity and it's how are the last years that we

1432
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:53,240
live right and if statins are going to come back to hunt you in 20 years because they're going to

1433
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:59,240
have extra or increase in diabetes for example yeah might buy you extra time now but again if

1434
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:05,480
you have food and exercise as your main medicine the zone two training for me it's just become such

1435
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:09,720
an important part of my training for myself and for my patients i question i get asked a lot that

1436
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:14,360
i don't know the answer to so i'm going to ask you is what's the minimum effective dose because

1437
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:21,400
obviously i would love it if i could wave a magic wand and have one hour per day to do zone two and

1438
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:28,520
then on top of that layer in all other exercise that would be amazing but it's not i only do three

1439
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:34,840
hours a week of zone two typically in four 45 minute to an hour sessions do you think that's

1440
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:40,280
enough yes so this is what i've seen and i've learned from the athletes and i would love to do

1441
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:45,400
this now with patients what's the right dose but we know or at least i've seen with athletes that

1442
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:51,480
if you do that two days a week one is the dose and the other thing is the frequency so if you do

1443
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:57,320
that two days a week you maintain and we see athletes who in the off season cyclists for

1444
02:18:57,320 --> 02:19:03,640
example runners or triathletes or swimmers or rowers if you do the zone two five days a week

1445
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:09,160
for example you really push the needle then once the season starts you need to do more higher

1446
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:14,600
intensity exercise and training and then you have the races and you need to recover so definitely

1447
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:20,200
you cannot do it on two every day so what we see is like two days a week it tends to maintain so

1448
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:24,840
that that's the frequency what's the dose yeah and the dose what i see is like obviously these

1449
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:29,800
elite athletes they need to keep pushing the needle one hour is not going to do much for them

1450
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:34,680
because they have that stimulus already or two hours they might need four or five hours but a

1451
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:38,760
patient would tell you one diabetes maybe one hour is enough and that's what i'm trying to

1452
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:45,240
fine tune you know what would be what i know very well is that three days a week it starts

1453
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:51,080
moving the needle four five for sure and what i've seen or guessing that that's because we

1454
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:58,360
don't have any real data this is about one hour to one hour and a half it does the trick for those

1455
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:04,840
who have type 2 diabetes or pre-type 2 diabetes for example so we have last year a patient who

1456
02:20:04,840 --> 02:20:10,760
was diagnosed with uh that's what we're saying is like late pre-type 2 what the heck is that you

1457
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:16,760
know and then uh with one year doing an hour into an hour and a half four days a week she

1458
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:21,880
reverse that completely okay that's a pretty big dose so i mean for me just it's always for me

1459
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:26,680
tuesday thursday saturday sunday is zone two it might be that those saturday sunday workouts i

1460
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:31,400
need to push them longer maybe i need to do 90 minutes on each of those days and stay at 45

1461
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:35,960
minutes on tuesday thursday it could be but at the same time it might be your right dose because

1462
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:41,960
you're not in that unhealthy population side so your dose might be lower but my thinking now is

1463
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:48,280
that this is such an important part of cellular longevity that this is the difference between

1464
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:54,680
being a healthy 90 year old and being in my framework it's one quarter of the equation

1465
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:59,000
what would you do i would do and this is my case when i stopped cycling when i told you earlier

1466
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:05,480
right i gained 65 pounds because i was working 70 hours a week and exercising six seven days a year

1467
02:21:05,480 --> 02:21:10,200
and still eating like a cyclist and eating like a cyclist and i'm from the bus country and we like

1468
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:15,240
to eat food because it's one of the best areas in the world and and probably also i had insulin

1469
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:21,320
sensitivity developed from i was a cyclist which i would choose poor carbohydrates you know and then

1470
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:27,800
i would not burn them so maybe i just transform more into fat i also have a familiar dyslipidemia

1471
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:35,000
so i have a high triglycerides and high cholesterol genetically so i didn't take care of myself i would

1472
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:41,640
not exercise and eat a lot so i gained 65 pounds in about eight years or so and then i i said wow

1473
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:52,840
i went and did myself a checkup and then my blood pressure was 125 i was in my mid 30s 125 over 85 so

1474
02:21:53,800 --> 02:22:00,120
was getting there and my triglycerides once i saw them 800 which is huge off the chart right back in

1475
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:05,240
the days people didn't do a1c that's when i started to work on these concepts too and so i

1476
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:11,000
started to apply this to myself so i started doing four days a week even one hour was poof i was

1477
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,240
banking because i was not used to that it was very depressing going to i was about to say that must

1478
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:21,720
have just been devastating gosh to go from being a professional cyclist to struggling to do four

1479
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:27,560
hours a week of cycling yeah and knowing the same roads that you go to and that you couldn't go up

1480
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:33,720
the hill but i lost 35 pounds within seven months did you make much change to your nutrition exactly

1481
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:40,280
that was i mean i decided to i was willing to eat a little bit less but not sacrifice many things

1482
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:45,640
because again i mean for me nutrition is very important from my culture standpoint i love

1483
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:52,680
chocolate i love wine i love pasta and bread it's ingrained in my culture i was not going to renounce

1484
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:56,120
these things so that's what i said okay i'm going to try to give it a shot so you weren't going to

1485
02:22:56,120 --> 02:23:01,080
go on a ketogenic diet and it's an interesting example of there's give and take the more you're

1486
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:07,960
willing to push this type of training the more you can keep on the other side versus you know

1487
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:14,360
i've seen more patients than i can count with type 2 diabetes not exercise at all but go on ketogenic

1488
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:20,520
diets within six months they're off insulin within a year they have a normalized hemoglobin a1c

1489
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:26,040
but again so it's almost like two levers how hard are you willing to pull on each of the levers

1490
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:31,560
exactly no that's a great great comment for sure and i think is the debate many for some people

1491
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:37,800
giving up chocolate is not a problem for me it's death you know i just love chocolate it's not that

1492
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:43,640
i eat it every day a whole bar but it is or a bread you know that's one of the things too that

1493
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:50,680
is the the balance i lost 33 pounds and i stopped there i could not lose more than that i needed to

1494
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:55,800
then i increased my dose so i went from one hour to an hour and a half four days a week i lost

1495
02:23:55,800 --> 02:24:03,960
another 10 pounds so i lost a total of around 50 pounds 47 to 50 pounds i was 11 years ago before

1496
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:08,520
coming here and i kind of keep it like that now this is interesting as you're probably aware the

1497
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:15,320
exercise and weight loss literature suggest that exercise alone is not sufficient for weight loss

1498
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:20,360
i've always wondered if that was an artifact of the fact that they're studying exercise incorrectly

1499
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:27,560
that the prescription it's either the dose or the frequency or the intensity were not optimized

1500
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:33,400
you were doing a very specific type of exercise you were not exercising for the number of calories

1501
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:39,480
you burned you were training your mitochondria to become better at fuel partitioning that's a very

1502
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:43,560
technical description of what you did i think it's important for people who are listening to this to

1503
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:48,920
appreciate that nuance you were not there calorie counting saying okay i'm doing six hours a day at

1504
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:54,680
this many calories because you can achieve that in many different ways it was almost the maniacal

1505
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:59,160
specificity with which you approached this that you basically said you didn't think of it as i'm

1506
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:04,120
exercising six hours a week it's i'm doing mitochondrial conditioning or reprogramming

1507
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:09,080
six hours a week exactly yeah i believe so and that's what we know now with patients when we

1508
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:13,960
start in the laboratory that they always tell you i always train at this intensity and you know that

1509
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:19,880
intensity they burn zero grams of fat they burn a lot of calories but zero are derived from fat

1510
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:24,840
they're actually working too hard too hard and eventually number one you don't burn much fat you

1511
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:31,400
burn but fat in the post exercise because you might increase your metabolic rate but can that

1512
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:38,680
override the fat burning from the exercise itself and second it's too hard you haven't exercised in

1513
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:45,000
a long time to start with and you get into these high intensity programs that they might not suit

1514
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:51,000
you or they might injure you and many people give up we see the rate of people giving up from gyms

1515
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:56,840
is about 50 percent or so within x amount of months they either give up or their adherence

1516
02:25:56,840 --> 02:26:04,440
decreases a lot so when i ask these people who get into this extreme either exercise or diets

1517
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:09,400
i always ask them and they're successful i ask them can you do this for the rest of your life

1518
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:14,680
and the question is hell no yeah if you can't do it for the rest of your life you have to come

1519
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:21,320
back to the why am i doing this using an extreme example to do hill repeats up alp du as can you do

1520
02:26:21,320 --> 02:26:26,120
that for the rest of your life no can you do it if your goal is to win the tour de france yes you're

1521
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:29,880
going to do it for five years you're going to train that hard for five years you're probably

1522
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:34,440
going to take a chunk of time off your life by the way but that's your job you have to be the best

1523
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:39,720
climber in the world exactly and to the point of the nutrition the nutrition is a must you need to

1524
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:44,600
do something with it or do a lot more exercise but i think it's the balance that we all i think need

1525
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:49,480
to understand better well that's for me why fasting has become so important now you were laughing at

1526
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:54,840
me earlier before we started recording about how crazy it is that i can do these long fasts but

1527
02:26:54,840 --> 02:27:00,680
in many ways it's a way to provide me balance it's like sprinting it's basically every month

1528
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:04,840
there's just a frequency with which every quarter i do one type of fast and every month a different

1529
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:09,720
type and every week a different kind it allows me to keep a balance and it allows me to say yes i

1530
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:12,920
could do this for the rest of my life whereas the reality of it is i couldn't do a ketogenic diet

1531
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:18,120
for the rest of my life as powerful as it was in me couldn't do it the rest of my life so a couple

1532
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:22,280
other questions i want to ask you about you've alluded to cancer twice now we've spent a lot

1533
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:28,280
of time talking about type 2 diabetes as a disease state in which the mitochondria are not

1534
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:35,240
functioning well and they provide this great contrast but you've touched briefly on cancer

1535
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:42,200
is there any evidence that a patient with cancer has a higher lactate level on account of the fact

1536
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:47,080
that they have mitochondria that aren't working as well the same way that the prismatitis diabetes

1537
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:54,200
so it is a fact in 1923 almost 100 years ago Otto Warburg from Germany discovered

1538
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:59,320
the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell at the metabolic level and the

1539
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:04,440
characteristic of cancer cells was that they use a lot of glucose for energy purposes now they use

1540
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:10,920
a lot of glucose back in the days there was no genetics or anything but what struck Warburg is

1541
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:16,440
the amount of lactate that they produced was that what struck him more than the fact that they use

1542
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:22,440
so much glucose even in the presence of sufficient cellular oxygen and insufficient ATP demand so it

1543
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:27,640
was more the lactate accumulation more the lactate accumulation and that's why he came to conclusion

1544
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:33,960
that cancer was a metabolic disease caused by an injury of the respiration system in the cell which

1545
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:39,160
is the mitochondria and that's what was the thought for many years because of the lactate

1546
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:45,320
even before glycolysis was invented Meyerhoff who discovered glycolysis sometimes it's called

1547
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:52,120
ending Meyerhoff pathway which is glycolysis Meyerhoff was a student of Warburg before they

1548
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:58,280
had even found out about glycolysis the way they measure glycolysis is by measuring lactate

1549
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:03,400
so they would measure how much lactate the cell produces and that's where they would say wow they

1550
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:08,440
are using a lot of glucose but what he saw in cancer cells that was an aberrant amount of

1551
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:14,280
lactate production and that was one of the things that struck Warburg the most and now what we see

1552
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:21,320
is that lactate is a typical feature of cancers cancers produce a large amount of lactate which

1553
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:26,600
is also responsible of the famous microenvironment that a lot of people are talking about nowadays

1554
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:32,840
the lactate microenvironment i mean the the microenvironment of cancer cells is more acidic

1555
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:38,120
than non-cancer cells and it's a niche for carcinogenesis they're responsible for that

1556
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:43,640
microenvironment is lactate and what we know is that yes just like that it's a fact that multiple

1557
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:49,240
studies showing that uh or every study showing that every study trying to find lactate in cancer

1558
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:56,200
they're going to find higher lactate levels so this would suggest three distinct but not necessarily

1559
02:29:56,200 --> 02:30:02,040
mutually exclusive explanations for the warburg effect the first being what warburg proposed

1560
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:08,200
which is in cancer there is an injury to the mitochondria as a result of that injury the cancer

1561
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:15,320
produces it takes an inefficient path to go then there's the 2009 explanation proposed by

1562
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:21,400
thompson cantley vanderheiden in that science paper that was sort of a very important landmark

1563
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:26,760
paper and said no no that's probably not it it's the glycolysis and the lactate production is a

1564
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:33,720
byproduct of metabolic demand for building blocks it's the cellular nucleotides that are necessary

1565
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:39,160
to build the cells so the mitochondria work okay what you're seeing is a deliberate and

1566
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:45,640
obligate choice to grow and the need to grow literally from a mass balance perspective

1567
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:50,040
requires taking this pathway versus that pathway and now you're saying well a possible third

1568
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:58,360
explanation is the cancer relies on lactate as a signaling molecule and again these could all be

1569
02:30:58,360 --> 02:31:03,320
true on some level we know that they're not all always true i mean at least we know that in the

1570
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:08,600
case of the warburg effect that's not universally true that the cancer damages the mitochondria

1571
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:13,560
what are the next steps in figuring this out and perhaps more importantly much more importantly

1572
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:19,320
how do we use this information therapeutically yeah so one of the things is that we have just

1573
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:24,120
finished the study it's under review now and we're going to replicate it now with more cancer cells

1574
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:29,240
but we have done a study with the mcf-7 cancer cells which are the most common type of breast

1575
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:35,160
cancer or one of the most common type of breast cancer cells and what we have seen is like we

1576
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:43,000
expose the cancer cells to glucose so we did experiment one exposing the cancer cells to

1577
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:47,880
a media that contains nothing no glucose no glutamine which is also highly expressing cancer

1578
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:54,120
and this can survive a couple of days in that state then another experiment we just expose them

1579
02:31:54,120 --> 02:32:00,280
to glucose that's it and in the other two other experiments we added to that glucose media we

1580
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:06,200
added 10 millimoles of lactate and 20 millimoles of lactate what we did then is like we extracted

1581
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:11,800
the dna by the way are those physiologically accurate doses do we believe the micro environment

1582
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:17,480
of cancer is that high it's about 10 yes it's 10 times the normal level there's been studies

1583
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:24,760
showing up to 40 but normally yeah 10 is a typical and what ph the ph is usually between 6

1584
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:30,600
and 7 i was about to say that has to be below 7 yes for sure in fact the more aggressive in general

1585
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:37,000
the more aggressive the cancer is the more glycolytic is and the more lactate is found and the more

1586
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:44,040
acidic the micro environment is so we published an idea to propose lactate being the explanation for

1587
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:52,040
the world war effect because what we looked into the medical research is that the genetics stops

1588
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:59,160
in how the first cancer cell happens and maybe proliferation in cell cycle genes but there's a

1589
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:04,840
lot more to that in cancer you need angiogenesis you need metastasis you need a mean escape and

1590
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:10,040
you need also the cell sufficient metabolism the cancer cell have it's immortal so that's where

1591
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:18,440
like what we saw is that lactate is necessary for each of these major steps in carcinogenesis

1592
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:22,200
but what we wanted to see is like could lactate also be a signaling molecule

1593
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:27,720
and that's where like what we observe is like looking at transcriptional activity looking at

1594
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:34,040
the RNA expressions of the key oncogenes transcription factors and cell cycle genes

1595
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:39,000
and proliferation genes in cancer lactate overexpress them between two and eight

1596
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:43,880
compared to control and what was the difference between the 10 millimolar and 20 millimolar

1597
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:48,600
lactate did you see a difference in transcription in 10 in 20 we didn't see much of a difference

1598
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:55,720
but we saw more than in zero what struck us and that's kind of hopefully we can show is that if

1599
02:33:55,720 --> 02:34:01,960
you cultivate the cancer cells in glucose alone i give this presentation and the understand but

1600
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:07,320
uh so we looked at the cancer cells and we looked at the major oncogenic i mean oncogenes

1601
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:14,200
transcription factor and cycle genes we had no glucose incubation no uh glutamate either

1602
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:20,840
just glucose and then we had a lactate 10 millimolars and 20 millimolar so we did RNA

1603
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:28,600
extraction and we looked at in the cancer cells where they're without any media that is no glucose

1604
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:35,320
no glutamine we didn't see RNA expression did the cells live of those oncogenes we killed it we didn't

1605
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:38,920
in other words there's a very finite period of time in which you're looking to just see

1606
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:45,560
yes we look in six hours and 48 hours so neither in six 48 hours was RNA expressions okay what about

1607
02:34:45,560 --> 02:34:51,880
glucose by itself so when you add glucose by itself we looked into the media and it was a

1608
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:57,400
very high lactate levels looks like on your graph it's almost 30 millimole yes it was almost 30

1609
02:34:57,400 --> 02:35:03,080
millimole in the six hours and because lactate is also used by the cells for energy purposes over

1610
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:08,600
time we expected also to see but we still see about 25 millimolar this is the waterborne effect

1611
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:13,720
this is what waterborne observed incubating in cells and say wow they use a lot of glucose but

1612
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:19,240
why in the world is this lactate it's amazing it's that high so what we saw then is like this lactate

1613
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:27,560
alone was enough to trigger the expression of all the major oncogenes transcription factors and even

1614
02:35:27,560 --> 02:35:34,680
depress the cell arrest genes so is there an experiment that could be done where you constantly

1615
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:40,200
change the media you have a flux of media that allows them to have a finite amount of glucose

1616
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:46,600
but you constantly strip away the lactate to see what the true baseline level of expression is

1617
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:51,160
absent the lactate as the signal yeah so this is now where we're going to be replicating this

1618
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:59,000
experiment with multiple cancer cell lines from liver to pancreas to lung to kidney to thyroid

1619
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:04,200
more glycolytic less glycolytic and then do all these kinds of experiments and include also

1620
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:09,160
metabolomics i mean this is a complicated media device because you basically have to expose them

1621
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:16,120
to a bath of constantly moving media that contains glucose but no lactate you see what i'm saying so

1622
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:21,560
you have a negative flux of lactate across the cell because what you really want to do is see

1623
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:28,360
how does this work with glucose but no accumulated lactate because that would answer the question is

1624
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:33,560
lactate specifically singling because you could still argue here glucose is playing a role yes

1625
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:37,480
but we believe this is through the lactate through the lactate but now how do we figure that's what

1626
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:43,240
we did in the second experiment the glucose media is the same we just added more lactate

1627
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:49,960
and we see a much amplified response how much is it amplified with so it was for example this is the

1628
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:55,880
no lactate versus the lactate we can see but it looks like about 2x yeah sometimes even 2x so

1629
02:36:55,880 --> 02:37:01,080
that's where we saw that the media is the same but the more when we added the lactate it really

1630
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:05,720
over expressed the transcriptional activity i was going to play devil's advocate you could say that

1631
02:37:05,720 --> 02:37:11,640
we know that the lactate could be serving a metabolic fuel so maybe it's conserving more

1632
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:16,920
glucose for more glucose to be signaling transcription well we know that lactate is

1633
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:23,400
being used by the mitochondria of our cancer cells everywhere is mitochondria there's lactate

1634
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:29,560
what we believe is that it's a signaling molecule to really over express the transcriptional activity

1635
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:35,560
of oncogenes transcription factors in cell cycle genes in a non-hierarchical way because the

1636
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:41,720
traditional view of cancer is that you have the oncogenes they tap on the transcription factors

1637
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:49,080
and they start an array of different downstream signaling that eventually transforms a normal

1638
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:54,760
sending to a cancer cell this is so interesting because it again at the meta level flies in the

1639
02:37:54,760 --> 02:38:01,720
face of all of the observational data of how much metformin lowers cancer unless it comes back to

1640
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:06,280
your explanation because if you just look at these data all things equal and by the way that

1641
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:12,920
would be another interesting experiment add metformin to the dish as well in theory it should

1642
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:20,280
amplify lactate by poisoning the mitochondria further and drive even greater upregulation of

1643
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:26,120
these signals unless to your point earlier it becomes so toxic to the mitochondria that the

1644
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:30,760
cell undergoes apoptosis yeah that's what's in my opinion and this is another thing that we want to

1645
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:36,360
do but it's possibly that yeah because you're totally right it can amplify the lactate as we

1646
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:43,480
know so i can amplify that that oncogenic or oncogenetic signaling for carcinogenesis or maybe

1647
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:50,520
it just doesn't matter because these amounts of lactate are so high that we're not seeing that

1648
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:55,800
from metformin maybe metformin isn't that inhibitory so much to the mitochondria and that

1649
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:59,960
becomes a red herring in the equation and the benefits of metformin exist totally elsewhere

1650
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:04,920
we don't know but it will be very interesting to see all this because it can have some application

1651
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:09,800
and there's some research group studying already why i feel like i need to quit my job and come

1652
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:14,200
and be a postdoc in your lab because there's just so much the more we talk about this stuff and i

1653
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:17,640
know it's going to get way worse tonight when we have dinner with rick because it's going to be

1654
02:39:18,040 --> 02:39:24,120
50 other ideas that i just want to with the fructose as well yeah that's a lot of things

1655
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:31,160
going on there let's talk for a few minutes about drugs in cycling many people argue that the era

1656
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:39,400
from about 91 to 2010 there's a 20 year period of time the 90s and first decade of the 2000s

1657
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:45,480
where the use of drugs was at its highest i don't think anybody can be a student of this sport and

1658
02:39:45,560 --> 02:39:50,840
ever say there's been an era when the top athletes weren't using some drug i mean even eddie mercs

1659
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:56,920
the greatest cyclist of them all on many occasions was found to be using an amphetamine or something

1660
02:39:56,920 --> 02:40:03,720
like that how much of an impact do you think the performance enhancing drugs of that era the 90s and

1661
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:08,040
2000s where again it's all out in the open now everybody understands how much blood doping and

1662
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:15,720
how much epo was being used yet you a moment ago gave a number of six to six point five watts per

1663
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:24,520
kilo as an ftp i recall reading at the time athletes hitting seven watts per kilo do you think

1664
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:30,360
that is about the distinction of with and without epo do you think that's about the magnitude of

1665
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:35,800
the improvement i could not know that number yeah i mean definitely we know the times and

1666
02:40:35,800 --> 02:40:39,880
back in the days we didn't have those power meters or cyclists they didn't use them so it's

1667
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:44,360
difficult to calculate but it is possible to calculate with the times i haven't done the

1668
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:50,840
numbers but what we know now is that the times going through molar albedoess or so are the same

1669
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:57,240
times that people were doing in the 80s or early 90s it's hard to see any of today's cyclists being

1670
02:40:57,240 --> 02:41:04,200
at the top 20 best times now as they did before so that's something that shows that yeah cycling i

1671
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:10,520
think goodness is a very clean sport right now the other thing is the fact that every cyclist now

1672
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:16,680
who wants to do well they go to altitude and that's one thing that before didn't happen

1673
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:21,880
and now it's just it's great to see people going to altitude because it's a physiological way

1674
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:28,440
to increase oxygen carrying capacity is the data on altitude still the following so when i last

1675
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:34,360
looked into this which is maybe a decade ago the answer seemed to be the performance enhancing

1676
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:41,960
way to use altitude is to live high train low meaning your baseline exposure should be at a

1677
02:41:41,960 --> 02:41:47,400
low oxygen environment your low intensity training should be at a low altitude environment but your

1678
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:52,520
high intensity training should be at sea level is that still believed to be the case that's an

1679
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:58,360
ideal scenario in my opinion yes and i mean here in colorado because we're colorado here by force

1680
02:41:58,360 --> 02:42:03,160
we need to know we must know about altitude because we get a lot of athletes every year

1681
02:42:03,160 --> 02:42:09,400
and we get to study them and yeah one thing that happens at altitude your glycolytic capacity it

1682
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:14,920
starts deteriorating their high exercise intensity it's like if you had a cap here at altitude and

1683
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:19,480
this is something that everybody tells you when they're here like i cannot keep my hundred percent

1684
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:25,240
here i cannot open up the same gas as i used to have and if you don't do that for three and a

1685
02:42:25,240 --> 02:42:29,880
half weeks or three weeks that your altitude yeah your glycolytic capacity is going to deteriorate

1686
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:34,920
which for a marathon runner they don't couldn't care less but for a cyclist for example it's

1687
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:40,520
important so that's more like the ideal scenario is to really try to find that balance but it's not

1688
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:47,240
easy to do at high altitude levels has anyone ever proposed using little portable oxygen

1689
02:42:47,240 --> 02:42:52,120
producing devices for peak peak peak efforts for those who live at altitude to maintain top

1690
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:57,400
end exactly and that's done it is done it is done yeah and that's something that we're building a

1691
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:03,240
university in one of our campuses in color springs sports medicine and performance center where we're

1692
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:10,440
going to have one room that is going to simulate sea level conditions so it's going to be hyper

1693
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:17,080
so it's going to simulate living at sea level because that is going to allow athletes to do

1694
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:21,880
very high intensity efforts without killing themselves because this is the problem that happens

1695
02:43:21,880 --> 02:43:27,000
here altitude these athletes who want to do very high intensity exercise which would they really

1696
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:33,000
need also to they get over trained we see a lot of people leaving altitude in very bad form

1697
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:39,000
and they're going to train or they live with a high oxygen carrying capacity but poor glycolytic

1698
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:45,320
capacity so that's more like yeah by doing this space it's going to allow athletes to come and they

1699
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:50,120
use these facilities while living at altitude because the problem that we have here you have

1700
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:55,640
two days driving to the ocean so you cannot train low and deep high but at least train low

1701
02:43:55,640 --> 02:44:01,880
high intensity you can simulate that while still living in high environment so interesting Miguel

1702
02:44:01,880 --> 02:44:08,120
Indran have you ever met him yes an unbelievable specimen yeah yeah and an incredible person too

1703
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:14,920
I've heard he is so he's got to be what now he's got to be 60 yeah 50s in the high 50s herself yeah

1704
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:20,520
still incredibly fit I remember reading a paper about him maybe 20 years after he retired he

1705
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:26,680
retired in 95 96 right I mean still unbelievable numbers I mean was he just a physical phenom to be

1706
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:32,360
yeah he was incredible when I was doing my internship I was doing with Indran's physiologist

1707
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:39,160
who was a very very good physiologist and I learned a lot and I remember once I was kind of

1708
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:44,680
helping there and the one thing that struck me also was his numbers were unbelievable and also

1709
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:50,840
the amount of sweat that he had I have never seen anybody sweating so much in my entire life he was

1710
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:56,360
a big guy right he was 80 kilos six foot one six foot two it was incredible because usually when you

1711
02:44:56,360 --> 02:45:01,720
do physiological tests you might have a few one tower or a couple of towers even with fans people

1712
02:45:01,720 --> 02:45:06,440
sweat a little bit and yeah and back in the days I was I was just wiping the floors that's kind of

1713
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:11,560
you're doing internships in these cases yeah if we didn't write you needed a mob and have you seen

1714
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:16,360
athletes since never so do you think that's just true true and unrelated or do you think that also

1715
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:20,200
spoke to his physiology like he had an unusual cooling system it was like out of this world I

1716
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:24,200
have never seen anybody like him and if you observed in the two of the friends everybody

1717
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:30,120
was with their shirts wide open right and Indran was always all seeped up always always always and

1718
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:35,880
with the hat on so he had an amazing capacity to dissipate heat which is a double-edged sword so

1719
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:40,760
obviously he drank a lot but I'm very sure and back in the days we didn't have the technology

1720
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:46,200
that we have nowadays to measure that what we do now sodium concentration in sweat we do sweat tests

1721
02:45:46,200 --> 02:45:51,640
we have sweat patches and we can measure the sodium concentration in the sweat patches and then tell

1722
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:57,560
someone whoa you're a heavy sweater in the first place and you also sweat a lot of

1723
02:45:57,560 --> 02:46:01,960
sodium but when someone and it's something that's very typical we see young people

1724
02:46:01,960 --> 02:46:07,000
or people who are not very well adapted to sweating you see like the white marks in this

1725
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:13,880
yes shorts or in their helmets that's salt literally sodium but the more mature physiologically

1726
02:46:13,880 --> 02:46:20,360
an athlete gets the more they sweat that is I have never realized that that is a metric yet another

1727
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:26,040
little trick of the trade to look at sort of metabolic flexibility is the ability to retain

1728
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:31,080
the sodium as just the water leak yes exactly makes total sense yeah it's an evolution and you

1729
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:35,800
sweat more back in the days I was just students just wiping the floors but now you'd bet that

1730
02:46:35,800 --> 02:46:41,400
there's low sodium in there you'd pull a William Osler and yeah he figured out that diabetes urine

1731
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:46,040
tasted like sugar you'd figure out that Indran sweat tastes like water I would have tested it

1732
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:51,400
for sure I couldn't tell you it was a man is no salt here Indran's interesting because he's right

1733
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:56,840
on that precipice where there is no question that the person who won the tour right after him

1734
02:46:56,840 --> 02:47:05,240
was using herculean doses of EPO so Bjorn Reis won in 96 nickname Mr. 60 right I mean

1735
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:14,040
hematocrit somewhere between 60 and 66 so you go from Bjorn Reis to Ulrich to Pantani to Armstrong

1736
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:20,040
that's the era and then before Indran is Greg Lamond who again I don't really know anything

1737
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:25,720
about what he was or wasn't taking but Indran has largely been left out of the discussion

1738
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:29,720
on blood doping and I've read articles that have just talked about how he's generally been left

1739
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:33,800
alone no one has come back to him because it's so I'm not going to ask you to speculate on that

1740
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:37,880
because I know that from a personal standpoint I don't want to put you on that spot but do you get

1741
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:43,000
the sense that he's just been left out of this discussion because of his place in cycling and

1742
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:47,000
it's almost like people don't want to go back and revisit that I mean why do you think that is

1743
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:53,000
I don't know I have no idea to be honest I could never give you an answer I know that he was a

1744
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:59,960
freak of nature because of his size in the same manner that before Indran was Greg Lamond was also

1745
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:05,240
a freak of nature a freak of nature as well and left out of all this I have no idea I've seen his

1746
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:10,920
physiological parameters and seen a lot of athletes we don't see those physiological parameters and

1747
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:17,400
also what I always say about Indran is his head and I work with a lot of athletes and in cycling

1748
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:23,080
for example I have never met any athlete well there's one athlete I will tell you in a few years

1749
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:27,480
meaning there's someone you work with now who maybe in a few years you'll tell us yeah I don't

1750
02:48:27,480 --> 02:48:33,080
want to be no you don't want to jinx him him too yes exactly but uh only one athlete with his head

1751
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:37,880
he was calm he was relaxed he was super intelligent he could read the game ahead of things

1752
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:42,840
he would never get nervous about anything and he would never doubt about anything which is

1753
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:48,520
rare in athletes I've seen athletes getting to the top of the game and falling apart and start

1754
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:54,840
crying there's the fear to lose but also the fear to win because when you win your life changes for

1755
02:48:54,840 --> 02:48:59,080
the good or for the bad and many athletes they were always nervous trying to find an answer or

1756
02:48:59,080 --> 02:49:03,720
trying to find a new diet or new training or something you know and that's where like

1757
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:09,480
or very fragile athletes at the high level very very very fragile if you're considered like an

1758
02:49:09,480 --> 02:49:14,680
expert or you're a coach or you're someone with a little bit of a name in cycling for example

1759
02:49:15,320 --> 02:49:21,320
and if you go to a race and you see a cyclist wow you look fat I think you can wait that cyclist

1760
02:49:21,320 --> 02:49:27,320
is done yeah yeah exactly done I mean cyclists are like models in that regard right every ounce

1761
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:31,880
matters exactly and that's how they are but Indran started the tour with two and a half kilos over

1762
02:49:31,880 --> 02:49:37,800
for example why the first week in the tour is flat no gravity his head is relaxed and calm like

1763
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:43,320
okay I can do this no problem and in that week he loses a kilo kilo and a half and then he's

1764
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:48,440
entered the second week with the mountains with half a kilo over okay no problem no big deal he

1765
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:53,400
loses it and then boom the last week is in perfect weight it takes a lot of thinking and confidence

1766
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:58,120
and confidence right and saying hey I got it and that's why I think that his head was also

1767
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:04,360
unbelievable lemon's head was also incredible I remember as a kid reading a lemon's book it really

1768
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:09,960
literally changed my way of looking at cycling I was 15 when he wanted to with the friends and

1769
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:13,640
that's where like I started to see his complete book of cycling I don't know if you've ever read

1770
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:20,920
it no it's the best cycling book I've ever read in my life and it's about how he trained and how

1771
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:26,680
he ate and how the way he approached cycling and back in the days I'm talking 86 he was super

1772
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:33,640
scientific yeah he was so far away everybody else everybody else yeah yeah we could go on for

1773
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:39,320
hours but I think on this note we'll bring it to a close only because we're already late for dinner

1774
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:44,040
and I don't want to keep uh rick waiting but I want to thank you so much for this this has been

1775
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:48,360
incredibly informative there is a million follow-up things to do including we're going to do this

1776
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:52,840
biopsy study so I'm willing to come back to to Colorado to do this again because I really

1777
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:58,360
am curious about this metformin question around zone two and I think that this is going to be one

1778
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:02,600
of those episodes where hopefully people are able to see the show notes because so much of what we've

1779
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:07,000
talked about I think benefits from this type of being able to visually see what this stuff we've

1780
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:11,720
talked about and and lastly I do think there's uh there's gonna be you know a shortage of medical

1781
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:16,440
students and undergraduate students who are looking for summer projects to come and help you get a lot

1782
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:21,160
of these really interesting posters published so thank you well thank you so much Peter for the

1783
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:25,400
impact you've had on me personally with respect to how I think about this problem

1784
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:29,000
and then hopefully by extension how others have as well well thank you so much it's truly
