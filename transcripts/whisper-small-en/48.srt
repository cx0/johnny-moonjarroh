00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,520
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,960
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,000
to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,040
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,280
make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,240
savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,080
find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,400
to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,080
to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,840
directly by signing up for a monthly subscription. Welcome back to the three-part series on sleep

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,920
with Professor Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,920
of California, Berkeley, and the founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science.

48
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,440
Matthew earned his undergraduate degree and PhD in neurophysiology in London and subsequently became

49
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,360
a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School before moving to Berkeley. His research

50
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,480
examines the impact of sleep on human brain function in healthy and diseased populations.

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,640
To date, he has published over a hundred scientific studies. He has received numerous

52
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,640
funding awards from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health,

53
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,640
and he's a fellow with the National Academy of Sciences. He's the author of the international

54
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,880
bestseller, Why We Sleep, which also happens to be the favorite book of my not yet two-year-old son.

55
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,680
He holds many patents covering various consumer-based sleep recordings, sleep tracking,

56
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,400
and sleep simulation. He's a sleep scientist at Google where he helps the scientific exploration

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,160
of sleep in health and disease. He is also an enormous fan of Formula One and My Hero,

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,240
Ira Tonsena. And in the third part of this installment, we actually spend quite a bit

59
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,120
of time discussing this. In the second part of this series, we discuss sleep and cardiovascular

60
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,040
disease, sleep and how it affects diet, sleep and reproductive function, the risk of deliberate

61
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,360
sleep deprivations, sleep and cancer, the lack of sleep within the medical profession, school start

62
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,120
times and sleep deprivation, sleep patterns and light, the biochemistry of sleep and naps,

63
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,640
the efficacy of various medications on sleep. As a reminder, at the end of this series,

64
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,640
we're going to take questions for a follow-up AMA with Matthew. Asking questions on the AMA forum

65
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,720
and listening to the AMA podcast with Matthew, along with all AMAs, will only be available to

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,240
subscribers. So if you haven't signed up yet, you can do so now at PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash

67
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,360
subscribe. So without further delay, here is part two of three, Professor Matthew Walker.

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,520
Okay, there's like literally a hundred more things I want to ask you about. So can you make the case

69
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,400
for why cardiovascular disease is worsened by or accelerated by sleep deprivation? And then same

70
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,760
question I'm going to ask you in a moment for cancer. Just pick the best, like, because again,

71
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,480
you could write a book on each of those topics. But let me just give you one example for

72
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,080
cardiovascular disease. There is a global experiment that is performed on 1.6 billion

73
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,600
people across 70 countries twice a year. And it's called daylight savings time. And what we've seen

74
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,680
is that in the spring, when we lose an hour of sleep, there is a subsequent 24% relative increased

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:56,280
risk for heart attacks that following day, 24%. In the fall, when we gain an hour of sleep

76
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,320
opportunity, there is a 21% reduction in heart attacks that following day.

77
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,560
How long has that been known? I mean, I remember the first time I saw that I was like, that can't

78
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,800
be right. And you know, when you see it bi-directionally like that, it's very different.

79
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,080
You know, that seems like a very robust manipulation that's been known for probably

80
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,880
about 10 years. What's also interesting, and I won't get away from cardiovascular disease,

81
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,800
don't worry, but just simply to mention that when you look at that same transition,

82
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,040
you see the same profile for car accidents, you see the same profile for suicidal attempts

83
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,240
and suicide completion as well. What's also interesting, by the way, is that you see it in

84
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,880
terms of federal judges handing out harsher sentences. They hand out harsher sentences

85
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,160
on the Monday after that time change in the spring, because they're more moody,

86
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,120
emotionally irrational, and less sort of, you know, empathetically sensitive because of that

87
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,480
one hour of lost sleep. And in the fall, more lenient sentences. So I can-

88
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,040
And does this effect last for two or three days?

89
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,040
So there is a blast radius to it that you can see it, that it's better, but still worse in the

90
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,720
spring, which is where you lose that hour of sleep. The effect is still worse on the second

91
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,320
day and it's almost recovered by the third day and finally comes back to what looks like a

92
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,920
baseline by about day four. So there's a blast radius. And this is, you know-

93
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,240
You know what I find this interesting by the way?

94
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Yeah. And here's the other thing I always found amazing about that statistic. In the

95
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,680
Northern hemisphere, you would predict the opposite if sleep were irrelevant, right?

96
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,920
Wouldn't you think that gaining that hour of sunlight in the day, in the spring,

97
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,080
just the overall anticipation, I mean, there's virtually no one in the Northern hemisphere

98
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,920
that isn't happier in April than they are in November, right? So it's almost like you have

99
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,560
all of that positive stuff working against you.

100
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,600
It gains the effect.

101
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,680
And you still see the signal you just described.

102
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
Yeah. So in the face-

103
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,920
It's like a kick in the face.

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,120
Yeah. So in the face of birds chirping, sunlight streaming, temperature warming,

105
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,520
that one hour of lost sleep will still put you back on your derriere rather quickly in terms of

106
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,800
all of these facets. So there's one example for cardiovascular disease. Another one, there was a

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,320
fascinating study where they took a group of otherwise healthy middle-aged adults who had no

108
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,480
sign of coronary artery disease, and then they tracked them for five years. And then they looked

109
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,240
at how much sleep that they were getting. So again, hands up, this is essentially an associational,

110
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,280
longitudinal prospect of study in it. You can't derive causality from it. But what you can

111
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,440
certainly say is when they started, they had no signs of calcification of coronary artery.

112
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,520
Those people in that study at the end of the five years who were getting five hours of sleep or less

113
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,600
had a two to 300% increased risk of calcification of the coronary artery,

114
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,920
which is the main corridor of life for your heart. If you have a massive coronary,

115
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,720
essentially, when you hear that colloquially, that's essentially what's happening there.

116
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,920
So that you could have that calcium buildup on the basis of being bookated into insufficient

117
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:20,920
sleep. That tells me that it's not that when you are insufficiently slept, you also are someone who

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,920
has calcified arteries. It is saying that if you are insufficiently sleeping, you are

119
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,320
increasing your risk for developing that condition. This is about the development of that.

120
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,360
Now, how hard is it to control that for some obvious things that would track with that? For

121
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,320
example, shift workers or people of lower socioeconomic status who are working three

122
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,880
jobs and all the other things that can work against you.

123
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,120
So there are exclusion, there's some great exclusion criteria in that study where they

124
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,240
prevent those participants from entering the study. They also then added in other factors

125
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,280
that you could imagine would lead to that. So they controlled for those things like exercise,

126
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,320
BMI, neck circumference, smoking, they even include history of snoring. So they tried to

127
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,720
take sleep apnea out of the equation and still that relative risk was significantly larger.

128
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,640
What do you think is the mechanism?

129
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,880
I think the mechanism is probably several fold. I think the first thing that we see when we

130
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,120
undersleep people is that they become much more sympathetically nervous system driven. Now that,

131
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,640
to some people may sound, oh, that sounds like a good thing. No, you have two branches of your

132
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,560
automatic nervous system. I swear for a moment, I thought you would say good knowing that the

133
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,400
listener would understand that there's sympathetic and parasympathetic, but thinking you were you were

134
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,440
going to make a comment about being more high strong is better because, but no, you actually

135
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,520
were making a joke. Yeah, I love it. I mean, I think you're so well tuned to this. I think

136
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:59,240
that's the beauty of my IQ is so low. I'm such a simpleton that I can always revert to the naive

137
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,760
state and I don't have to make assumptions. That's the beauty of my idiocy, but no sympathetic

138
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,880
nervous system being sort of cranked on your sympathetic nervous system is not a good thing.

139
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,120
Your sympathetic nervous system essentially is your fight or flight branch of the nervous system.

140
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,280
And what we find is that as soon as you start to undersleep an individual, that fight or flight

141
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:27,240
branch of the nervous system starts to ratchet up. When that increases, you start to see, or perhaps

142
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,480
the reason why it increases is that you get a greater amount of adrenaline release. You get

143
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:41,800
a high spiking in levels of cortisol. You get a blunting in growth hormone. And I think probably

144
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,520
just the cortisol and the growth hormone alone may set you on a path towards cardiovascular disease

145
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,960
because we know that those are two factors that lead into that sort of some of that atherosclerotic

146
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,680
and that brings it back to Alzheimer's disease, which is even if you just look at the

147
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:05,320
epidemiologic data, the signal is quite large on the benefits of IGF and growth hormone

148
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,240
more than any other disease in protection from neurodegeneration. So that may be even in addition

149
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,840
to everything you talked about with respect to clearance, you're simply taking away

150
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,520
neurotrophic factors that are essential. There's some data and I don't know how well replicated

151
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,040
it is. I just read it in one city where if you look at your APOE4, so this is in terms of your

152
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,520
genes, there are some genes that can predispose you to Alzheimer's disease on this podcast. There

153
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,680
are wonderful descriptions of going into all of the details of these, but APOE4 significantly

154
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,320
increases your risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease, it appears. But what's

155
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:49,160
interesting is that if you are APOE4, but you are norm intensive, you don't necessarily have an

156
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,040
increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. If you are APOE4, but you are hypertensive, then your

157
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,080
Alzheimer's disease risk is far higher. So in other words, there seems to be an interaction,

158
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:08,360
a gene by cardiovascular disease interaction that leads that genotype to predispose you to

159
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:16,440
Alzheimer's disease. And therefore, if you are under sleeping, you are putting yourself on a

160
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,240
path towards many new different factors that we are learning regarding cardiovascular disease.

161
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,400
Calcification of the arteries is one of them, but we also just see blood pressure spike. We can take

162
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:37,560
someone who is in a lovely state of norm intensive profile and has been, and after either one night

163
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,320
of total sleep deprivation or one night of short sleep, we can almost start to see it after about

164
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,920
reducing sleep by three hours, take someone down to five hours for just one night. You immediately

165
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,400
see this spike in the fight or flight nervous system. Blood pressure goes up. You start to see

166
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:02,040
cortisol increase. Heart rate starts to increase as well. You know, it's almost as though you've

167
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,800
just got a beautiful car engine. You've put it in neutral and you put your foot on the gas pedal

168
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,280
and you're just revving the living daylights out of that engine in a fight or flight state. Now,

169
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,320
if you do that chronically, which is what most people do with insufficient sleep, you know,

170
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,320
day after day, week after week, year after year, decade after decade, it's not surprising that,

171
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,200
you know, just revving the daylights out of that engine at some point, gaskets are going to start

172
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,520
blowing. It's not designed to operate in that high revving state or high revving occasionally,

173
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:43,720
just fine. And if you have a beautiful, let's say, you know, mezcuporsha engine, which loves to go

174
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,240
to nine grand and you and I going in the GT three, I had to geek out on cars for a little bit because

175
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm just so obsessed. I had to get it in there. But, but even then you just can't stay at that

176
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,240
RPM, that high RPM for very long. You just know it from listening to the engine. You just know that

177
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,200
mechanical badness is happening in neutral when you've got your foot on the gas pedal. Well,

178
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,960
that's the same way with chronic sleep deprivation, your nervous system. So I think many of the

179
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:16,680
cardiovascular effects, in fact, I think we're writing a paper right now. I think if there is

180
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:24,120
one central common pathway through which we can understand almost all aspects of the deleterious

181
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,880
impact of insufficient sleep, it is through the autonomic nervous system and specifically

182
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,000
an excessive leaning on the fight or flight branch of the nervous system, which is to say

183
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,800
that your sympathovagal balance is way off and you are far more in that fight or flight

184
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:49,000
sort of aversive state. So I think that to me is where that disease pathology starts and perhaps

185
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,840
progresses from that point. And I think only adding to that, which is probably what you described is

186
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,760
sufficient alone. But when you look at what I think are pretty well documented,

187
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,360
appetitive changes in people under sleep deprivation and more importantly, the

188
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,240
inferior fuel partitioning that follows. So the hyperinsulinemia, the impaired glucose disposal,

189
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,240
the tendency to probably eat more crap. I mean, I'm at my worst when I am sleep deprived.

190
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:27,160
It is, you know, I just it's so hard to avoid junk food, whereas probably the single greatest

191
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,280
tool in my arsenal to eat well is to sleep well. I mean, it doesn't sound like that's an obvious

192
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,800
thing, but it's amazing. When you read the data, I mean, it's striking. And, you know, we can get

193
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,080
into that, which is essentially what you've just described is the energy balance of an organism of

194
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:53,880
a human being and both the regulation of energy once you've taken it in and also the input of the

195
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,440
energy and the selection of the energy. How do you eat and how much do you eat? And then secondly,

196
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,280
once you've eaten, what does your body do with that food in terms of a basic kind of blood sugar

197
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,080
control? And then the fourth thing is where do you access it? So I'm sure I mean, I'm sure this has

198
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,800
been done. I just haven't seen it. But if you look at respiratory quotient of people, sleep deprived

199
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,320
versus not, I'm sure our Q must be going up, right? I'm sure they're absolutely going after the wrong

200
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,200
fuel partitioning. That's exactly what you see. I'll do what you do well. I always forget to do.

201
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,320
Let me explain why that matters. Respiratory quotient going up implies that under the same

202
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,200
level of exertion, you would preferentially go after glycogen for ATP as opposed to fat. And so

203
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,680
not only is that not what most people want because they prefer to burn their fat than burn their

204
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,720
glucose, it signals a metabolic inefficiency which lays at the heart of all of this stuff.

205
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:57,240
And a beautiful example of that is a great study that looked at the efficiency of dieting when you

206
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:04,120
are underslept. And effectively what they found is that your diet is all for nothing if you're not

207
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,640
sleeping well. Because what they found is that when you are underslept defined as sleeping six

208
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:17,960
hours or less, 70% of the weight that you lose will come from lean muscle mass and not fat.

209
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,480
In other words- Which is perfect when your cortisol is high. I mean, that's exactly what cortisol is.

210
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,680
So that's exactly what you'll see with cortisol. So in other words, your body becomes immensely

211
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,760
stingy at giving up its fat. Your body will ruthlessly hold onto its fat when you are

212
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,160
underslept and not give it away. And so when you are underslept and you're losing weight,

213
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,920
you're losing the thing that you want to keep, which is beautiful muscle definition.

214
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,800
And you're holding on to the one thing you're trying to get rid of, which is the blubbery fat.

215
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,280
And it's really everything. It's the cortisol is working against you, insulin will work against

216
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,440
you. You're going to have more hyperinsulinemia. You will have more catecholamines working against

217
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,880
you. Yeah. We see that with norepinephrine in particular. Oh, and testosterone will go down.

218
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,360
That's going to work against adiposity, getting rid of it. Yeah. I should note by the way that

219
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,360
men, and I think we'll come onto this later, but men who are sleeping just five to six hours a

220
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,920
night will have a level of testosterone, which is that of someone 10 years their senior.

221
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,400
So insufficient sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness and

222
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,680
virility. So if you want to sort of be very bravado about insufficient sleep, be careful.

223
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,400
I would also say that by the way, we found it simply associational, but men who are sleeping

224
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,880
just five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those men who are sleeping

225
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,080
seven hours or more. And I'm sure that in that you would see FSH and LH must be lower, right?

226
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,720
So we do. So I'm not trying to make necessarily funny, even though sometimes I'll start talks

227
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,800
that way just to sort of get the bravado folks out of the way. But you also firstly see that

228
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,240
you men who are sleeping six hours or less will have fewer sperm. Those sperm will have more

229
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,080
deformities, but this is not limited. Even genetic. So even aneuploidy in the sports. That's correct.

230
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,240
Yeah. And you can see that in rats too. If you do those studies and those studies have been done

231
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,920
with short sleeping rats, but it also transfers to women that you see that women who are sleeping

232
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,960
just five to six hours a night will have about a 20% reduction in FSH, which is called follicular

233
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:32,040
stimulating hormone, which essentially is a critical part of the reproductive pathway in terms

234
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:39,320
of getting pregnant. Women who are sleeping that little too typically have about a 30% higher rate

235
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,880
of abnormal menstrual cycles. So if you put together a couple that is trying to conceive,

236
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,880
and that couple is on six hours of sleep, you've got a man who's down on testosterone, down on

237
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,760
the amount of sperm that they're producing. The motility of those sperm are reduced. And then the

238
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,680
woman you're down on, you know, you've got erratic menstrual cycles. You've got FSH that's down to,

239
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,760
from a reproductive standpoint, this is devastation. And again, evolutionarily isn't that surprising.

240
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,480
It's basically mother nature saying, if the conditions are not optimized for you to sleep,

241
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,240
it's probably not optimal for us to propagate the species at this moment. And that is probably

242
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,760
something that rarely happens. What happens to FGF 21? Do we know? I was about to say we don't

243
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,840
know. I should say I don't know of any studies that have looked at that. FGF 21 has such an

244
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,920
interesting, it's one of the few places in the brain where you'll see a difference between men

245
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,680
and women under a fasted state. So under a fasted state, you don't appear to see the same hit in

246
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,400
reproductive fitness of a man, but you do see it in the woman. There's actually an anatomic reason

247
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,040
for this that I at this moment am forgetting, but it basically has to do with this rise of FGF 21.

248
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,240
And you'll see basically the inhibition of FSH in the women without it in the men,

249
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:08,120
which again is like, it's this question of if food is scarce, we really don't want a mother to try to

250
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,240
nurture another body. Yeah. Maybe that's the biological warning beacon that just says

251
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:21,720
timeout on reproductive capacity right now. I always get asked is a ketogenic diet in any way

252
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,360
good, bad, or indifferent towards fertility? And my answer is I actually have no clue,

253
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:33,240
but just on first principles, it would seem that a ketogenic diet could have one negative side

254
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,760
effect on the woman, which is exactly that because a ketogenic diet generally does put up FGF 21.

255
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,640
It could be offset by benefits. So if you took someone who's metabolically ill, who is fixed by

256
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,960
the ketogenic diet, it could offset it, but all things equal. Yeah. You know, I certainly wouldn't

257
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,640
recommend fasting for a woman who's trying to conceive, but you've had the luxury of spending

258
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,880
a lifetime thinking about this. I'm sort of playing catch up over the past couple of years.

259
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,040
By the way, it's one of the things that you do brilliantly, by the way, from what I've,

260
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,080
I listened to on every one of your podcasts, but, but what I would say in response to your question

261
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:13,720
though, about that evolutionary question, the reason I suspect it rarely occurs, however,

262
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,000
is the following human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for

263
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,120
no apparent reason. You almost never see other organisms undergo sleep deprivation. The only time

264
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:34,200
that you see another species seemingly restrict its sleep is in under two conditions. The first

265
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,680
is under certain, with certain mammals after they've given birth, they will deprive themselves of

266
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,040
sleep to care for their young. The most obvious example there is in killer whales where the mother

267
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,160
will break from what's called the pod, which is the main group. They will go away and they will

268
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,920
give birth and then they will bring that calf back to the main pod. And during that time,

269
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:03,240
they will short sleep. The second is under conditions of starvation, that when an animal

270
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,960
starts to become starved, they will, there is a wake promoting signal where you will actually

271
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,360
stay awake longer and it gives the animal the ability to forage in a larger perimeter because

272
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,040
presumably the current perimeter is not containing sufficient food. And I think that's

273
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,200
the reason why some people will say when I undergo, you know, either time restricted feeding,

274
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,720
or especially when I undergo fasting, the reason that I feel like I don't need to sleep as much

275
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,680
or, you know, and I feel more awake even though I'm sleeping less and it's great.

276
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,120
I actually would be very cautious about doing that for long periods of time and doing it sort

277
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,360
of repetitively for long periods of time is because there are still, you're still suffering

278
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,560
the decrements of insufficient sleep. But the reason that you feel awake is because there is

279
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,720
a biological mechanism in place that says, Oh my goodness, if you're not getting food, we need to

280
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,920
keep you awake for a little longer. We're going to sacrifice this thing called sleep for a little bit

281
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,240
so that you can go and find more food. So there's a wake promoting mechanism and we know how that

282
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,720
works. But the more important point here being made, I think for me is that because human beings

283
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,960
are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep and no other species has

284
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,320
really done that. It means that mother nature throughout the course of evolution has never

285
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,960
had to face the challenge of sleep deprivation. So in other words, mother nature has never come

286
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:36,040
up with any safety nets for any of our major biological systems, metabolic, reproductive,

287
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:44,200
cardiovascular, immune, mental health. None of these things have any safe holding. They don't

288
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,680
have any sort of crutches when sleep goes away. Why? Because mother nature has never been asked

289
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,680
to solve that question. Now I'll give you an example. I use the same argument, by the way,

290
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,560
for sitting in chairs, you know, or so many of these things, sedentary behaviors. Yeah. That we

291
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,920
just do that we, you could argue if our species could survive another hundred million years,

292
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:15,800
maybe sitting around doing nothing, drinking soda, we'd figure out a way to make that not so

293
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,680
harmful, you know, assuming it interfered with, you know, our capacity to reproduce. If it didn't,

294
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:27,240
then maybe evolution wouldn't take any interest in it. But I mean, I think it's the reason for me,

295
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:33,800
at least why an alternative example there in the pro would be, you know, an adipose cell,

296
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:40,440
that mother nature throughout the course of our life and most species experienced times when there

297
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:47,320
was feast and times when there was famine. And so mother nature faced with that challenge of famine

298
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,880
came up with a solution called the fat cell so that we could store caloric credit and then spend

299
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,400
it when we needed to, when we went into famine. Where is the adipose cell for sleep? Where is the

300
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,160
fat cell for sleep? You know, wouldn't it be lovely if we could store up sleep credit and then spend

301
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,320
it? And the answer is there is no such thing because there is never been the challenge in the

302
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,800
course of evolution to come up with that solution. Because hibernation is not an example, right?

303
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,520
No hibernation is the opposite. Hibernation basically says it's not giving you credit to

304
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,400
sleep less in the summer. It's just taking stock of the fact that there really is nothing for you

305
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,800
to eat in the winter. Correct. And that's really about energy expenditure and essentially energy

306
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:38,040
preservation and torpor and hibernation of different states to sleep itself. But that's

307
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,840
always, I think, been something I've thought a lot about that example of, you know, the fat cell

308
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,080
versus sleep. And it's the reason why people unfortunately think that sleep may be like the

309
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,040
bank, that you can accumulate a debt during the week and then you can just sleep it off during

310
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,000
the weekend. What's the name again for that phenomenon of the sort of Monday through Friday

311
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,640
short sleeper who binge sleeps on the weekend? What's the social jet lag? Social jet lag. Yeah.

312
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,240
Where you sort of essentially it's what I used to term very politically incorrectly as sleep

313
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,360
bulimia, which was where you would essentially, you know, purge during the week and then you just

314
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,560
binge during the week. It's this real binge purge kind of abstinence syndrome. The reason it's

315
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,720
problematic is not just because sleep doesn't work like that. And the studies show that that's very

316
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,960
deleterious to health is because it also is terrible torture on your circadian biology,

317
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,720
because what happens is that you start to wake up, you know, you'll be going to bed at one sort of

318
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:42,120
one or, you know, midnight rather than nine and then waking up at 10, 11, you know, on a Saturday

319
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,880
and a Sunday and then come Sunday night, you've got to drag your body clock back by three hours,

320
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,960
you know, to get into bed and you repeat it the next weekend. That's essentially like saying to

321
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,280
your biology and no different. I'm going to fly back and forth from San Francisco to New York

322
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:07,320
every weekend, three hour social jet like difference. That's a hazard ratio impact on

323
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,400
your circadian biology. And as I'm listening to you say this, I'm making this stronger and

324
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,080
stronger case for my move to Austin, which in part is driven by just shortening the trips

325
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,080
that I have to take, you know, to be able to only have to take a one hour time zone delta or, you

326
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,680
know, never basically having to take more than a two hour time zone delta is for your, for your

327
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,600
lifespan, health span, for the impact that you can have on this planet and this society during

328
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:46,120
the time that you're here and for the preservation of you in your children's life. I would strongly

329
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,440
recommend it. I'll share with you an interesting example of a patient of mine who has an example

330
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,680
of what happens when that system, you know, quote unquote breaks. So as gentlemen, I'll try to

331
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,760
be as vague as possible so I don't identify him, even if he's listening, not that he would care if

332
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,600
I told the story anonymously, basically worked in the finance sector, but at some point was living

333
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,960
on the west coast of the United States, but basically was exclusively involved in, you know,

334
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,400
Eastern European markets. So you can imagine what time he had to be waking up to deal with that

335
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,880
after several years. And he in part moved from the west coast to the east coast to try to make

336
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,840
that gap smaller, but he got to the point where he could never sleep past 3 a.m. It was

337
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,000
metaphysically impossible regardless of what time, if he went to bed early, if he went to bed late,

338
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,520
he was up at 3 a.m. And it turned out one of my colleagues, Vic Jane, who's a Stanford trained

339
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,400
sleep doc at Northwestern and also someone I just can't wait to interview because he's just so

340
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,280
insightful on sleep. You know, he basically did something that you and I had talked about earlier,

341
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,920
which was reverse use of melatonin and blue light to phase shift him into the correct time

342
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:04,920
zone. And what humbled me about the story was how long it took to move. And it just gives you that

343
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:12,600
sense of could you imagine forcing that on your system once a week? And I mean, it took months to

344
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,680
correctly correct the course correct. Admittedly, it had been in place for a couple of years by the

345
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,880
time, you know, I met him. So, you know, you have a little bit more to overcome. But nevertheless,

346
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:33,000
I was blown away at the lengths that Vic had to go to drag him forward by three hours for that

347
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,120
biology to have been tortured for that long. It's going to take a reset of, you know, non-trivial

348
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:47,480
magnitude and help from exogenous agents like melatonin, like blue light, regular exercise,

349
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,160
exposure to daylight, you know, even manipulations of body temperature it could take. So there are

350
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,560
a whole arsenal of tools in the sleep dock kind of box that we can use to sort of make these

351
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,240
manipulations either be it for people with insomnia, be it people with anxiety, be it people with

352
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,720
sort of jet lag or what's called circadian phase delay, which is essentially what he was suffering

353
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,960
from, which was you mentioned temperature. This was something I didn't know until I learned it

354
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,720
through this patient's case and through Vic's learning, which was about two hours before the

355
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,560
wake up, you see this drop in temperature. And like that drop in this guy is occurring at 1 a.m.

356
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:34,200
He's getting that drop up. And then and so what you basically were doing was dragging that thing

357
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:41,400
to, you know, 4 a.m. You had to drag the temperature drop to 4 a.m. And again, I think it just speaks to

358
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,360
the complexity of this situation. And and as a general rule, when you mess with really complex,

359
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,000
hardwired, evolutionarily sound things, you've got to be careful, you're going to pay the fiddler.

360
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,200
When you fight biology and sleep is one of the most conserved behaviors across all living organisms

361
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,400
that we've observed. When you fight that kind of innate, hard-grained biology, you normally lose.

362
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,160
And the way that you know that you've lost is disease and sickness, either acute or chronic.

363
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,440
You know, at some point, a lack of sleep will get you. It may be in your late stages of life.

364
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,920
You know, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan examples without Simons disease

365
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:29,240
could be from a heart attack prematurely when you're 56 years old. It could be a car crash at

366
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,240
any moment in time because of a microsleep. You will be popped out of the gene pool pretty quickly.

367
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,920
So let's talk about one more thing, which we could talk about cardiovascular disease for

368
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,360
much longer. But let's talk about cancer and let's talk about when I talk about these diseases with

369
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,080
patients. One of the things I try to do is say, let's reverse engineer what we think is happening

370
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,320
when this disease goes wrong and then back things out. So when it comes to cancer, I say, look,

371
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,160
cancer has a bunch of things that have to go wrong. First, you have to have a genetic insult

372
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,760
to it has to be missed by the immune system. Unfortunately, most of the time our T cells

373
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,200
can figure out that cancer is non-self, etc, etc. And you kind of walk through all of these things.

374
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,960
So let's talk about the immune system for a moment, because we know that if you're not,

375
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,040
well, I want to let you explain that. Yeah, I'll let you go from there. Because I was going to,

376
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,960
I was just about to go off on this topic. But tell me about how sleep impacts the immune system.

377
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,680
And not only how that might impact getting common colds, but how it could impact cancer.

378
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,440
So firstly, what we know is that there are now significant links epidemiologically between sleep

379
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,480
and cancer of a variety of forms. Currently that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer of the

380
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,760
prostate and cancer of the breast. And then we can step down. Which are basically three of the top

381
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,600
four. Exactly. Yeah, three of the heavy hitters. Next, you can sort of say, okay, what about the

382
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,720
causal evidence? Well, firstly, I would say before I describe the causal evidence, that causal evidence

383
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,720
is now so strong that recently the World Health Organization decided to classify any form of

384
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:07,560
nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen. Their words, not mine. And the proof of evidence

385
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,000
that is required by the World Health Organization to make such a statement usually has to be

386
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,680
astronomical. And that data is now, I think, very well put in place. I'll just mention one quick

387
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:27,800
causal manipulation study done by a colleague down at UCLA. They took a group of healthy adults and

388
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,960
they limited them to just four hours of sleep for one single night. And then they looked at a set of

389
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,640
cells called natural killer cells. And you can think of natural killer cells like the secret

390
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,840
service agents of the immune system in that they're pretty good at identifying dangerous foreign

391
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:51,240
elements. One of which are malignant cancerous cells. They'll inject some things into them and

392
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,400
try and destroy them essentially. So what you want is a pretty virile set of those immune assassins

393
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,720
circulating in your body. And what they found is that one night of four hours of sleep reduction

394
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:10,520
led to a 70% drop in natural killer cell activity. That's quite a surprising state of immune

395
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,480
deficiency that has happened within one night. So you can step and repeat that and imagine what

396
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,040
would be the state of your immune system, particularly for those critical anti-cancer

397
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,080
fighting immune cells after several weeks, if not months of insufficient sleep.

398
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,560
That's one aspect, which is what is your vulnerability to developing cancer? Because

399
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:41,080
many of us will have cancer cells emerging in our body every day. So we need those aspects

400
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,040
of our immune system to prevent those cells from becoming the disease that we call cancer.

401
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,640
I mean, that's such an important point and I'm probably biased because

402
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,000
I trained in an immunotherapy lab, but I don't think people necessarily appreciate that we pretty

403
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,680
much always have cancer and our immune system is pretty much always protecting us. It's actually

404
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,200
the exception when the cancer develops into something clinically. Correct. Yeah. And I've

405
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,040
debated, not debated is the wrong question. One of my favorites sort of sitting around

406
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:20,600
dinner discussions with cancer biologists is what is the greater driving force for the obvious

407
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:27,240
age association of cancer? In other words, why does cancer increase non-linearly as you age?

408
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:35,240
And I offer two hypotheses. Is it three actually, is it an increase in the rate of mutagenesis?

409
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,920
Do you experience on a per unit of time basis, a greater insult to the genome? Two,

410
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,280
if you assume that that's the same, is it that over time the accumulation and the expression,

411
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,000
the phenotype of that becomes more problematic? And or three, is it that our immune system,

412
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,280
specifically the adaptive immune system is weakening and the balance starts tipping in favor

413
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,200
of cancer? And, you know, I've asked this question of Nobel laureates and future Nobel laureates.

414
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,800
Every one of them has said, we don't know. They suspect it's all of the above, but they all agree

415
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:21,960
that the weakening of the adaptive immune system is almost assuredly playing a role in why we get

416
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,320
cancer more as we age, because we know many things are working against us when we do that. And so when

417
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,640
I hear you say NK cells, which, you know, the CD8 cell, the NK cell, the CD4 cell, these are,

418
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:40,280
these are your green berets and your Navy seals of the war against cancer. If you put a hit on

419
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,960
those guys, you, you know, you could be taking a 10 year step in the wrong direction. Right.

420
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,360
Just as you talked about the gonadal 10 year leap, right? Yeah. With testosterone. I mean,

421
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:58,440
I would love to add a three B hypothesis there, which is that one of the most dramatic changes

422
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,640
with age and the most sizable and robust physiological changes in with age that we see

423
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,920
is that your sleep gets worse. And sleep is probably one of the most powerful regulators

424
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,000
of your immune system. You know, if you want a full arsenal and you want every single weapon in

425
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,800
there to be sharp and ready to annihilate sleep is what you need. That data, I think is very clear

426
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,600
in terms of the decimation of your immune system with sleep. And that, you know, I just gave one

427
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,400
example that too. And the funny thing is like you give that example and it's not even that dramatic.

428
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,800
Like there's no person listening to this who hasn't had a four hour sleep night. That's part

429
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,840
and parcel for just being a human being in the civilized world, maybe even in the non civilized

430
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:52,280
world. Right. And yet to think about a lifetime of stacking those things and the compounding effect of

431
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,920
what does it mean to get eight hours a night versus six point two to five hours a night. Imagine

432
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,240
that I'm almost amazed it doesn't kill us quicker because to your point we have adapted a great

433
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,440
system to cope with excess nutrients. Right. We had a great system and it takes a long time for

434
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:19,080
that to break us down. I think in some ways we're probably so naive in our ability to measure the

435
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,600
short term consequences of sleep. I mean, not you, of course, because this is what you're thinking

436
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,680
about day and night. No, I think you're right. But I think as a medical community, we're really

437
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,360
shitty at knowing how to measure short term, like what's really happening in sleep deprivation.

438
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,720
Especially in, you know, in clinics and in, in healthcare systems.

439
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,560
Yeah. Like in schools, like we don't really understand how bad sleep deprivation is on a

440
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,720
learning child. We don't, we clearly don't understand what it's doing on the road. Like we,

441
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,800
we don't understand that this will kill you much faster than, you know, bad nutrition, right? Which

442
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,720
is clearly going to kill you. And it's an excellent, you know, if you look at all cause mortality and

443
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,760
short sleep, it's not even linear. It's exponential. You know, it really, it's sleep will bend that curve

444
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,160
of your lifespan in a downward direction with a dart into the ground when it starts to get short.

445
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,080
I think your argument is so great that it really comes down to the fact that

446
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,720
at least we had a system in place to train us for excess nutrients. Now,

447
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,680
look, we can argue we didn't have a system to train us to consume refined carbohydrates.

448
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,600
We didn't have a system that trained to consume massive amounts of polyunsaturated fats or high,

449
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:35,960
high amounts of sucrose. But we still knew how to consume some of these things. And there is a

450
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,760
dampening effect in nutrition that the, you know, ever present adipocyte can numb. And at least for

451
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,840
a while blunt that system. But you're right. If we didn't, if it wasn't really until what, probably

452
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,560
200 years ago that sleep deprivation could have become common. I mean, when do you really think

453
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,560
was the tipping point? I know that in the forties, we could compare the forties to today, but it would

454
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:03,720
almost seem like the light bulb was a pretty big step in the wrong direction. Not to blame Edison.

455
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,080
Yeah, but you could go back and you could argue that, you know, Edison with the light bulb and his

456
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:15,160
company may have been the starting point. I think it was probably happening even earlier on the

457
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,560
basis of social demands, you know, the industrial era, I think then we started to compound things.

458
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,160
Once we switch from an agrarian society to an industrial society, in my mind, that's when stuff

459
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,520
really started to go wrong. Which is, I mean, my history's horrible, but that's about 250 years ago.

460
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,440
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I think we've been, that curve has started to happen.

461
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
So it's an evolutionary millisecond.

462
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,440
Correct. Correct. Sounds like a long time, blink of an eye. The other aspect of, you know, cancer

463
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,760
is not just that you increase your risk for developing cancer because you weaken the immune

464
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:55,400
system components that are there to combat against all of those, you know, carcinogenic influences

465
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,560
cellularly that you've just described. But another study by a colleague at the University of Chicago,

466
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,720
David Gozal, he looks at the relationship between sleep loss and cancer in mice. And I'll just give

467
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,280
you one example of a study he did took a group of mice inoculated them with some cancer cells on

468
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,760
their back and then gave that cancer a one month period to grow. At the end of the month, he

469
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,760
resected the skin, measured the size of the tumor. Half of those mice were allowed to sleep normally.

470
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,000
The other half had their sleep restricted. So they just had their sleep kind of top and

471
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,080
tail, not total deprivation, just limiting their sleep in the morning and the evening a little bit.

472
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:37,000
What they found is that at the end of that one month, those underslept mice, when they looked

473
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,240
at them, the tumor was 200% larger. I mean, it was physically distorting the body. And if you were to

474
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,480
see these pictures, you know, you would just think, my goodness, you know, I can see a small tiny

475
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,640
little sort of dart that is the growth of the cancer in the well-slept mice. You know, the others,

476
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,880
it just looked like a hideous, you know, mass on these underslept mice. Secondly, what they found

477
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,960
was that that cancer in those underslept mice had actually metastasized, which is just, you know,

478
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,840
in some ways, a fancy way of saying that it had breached the original origin and started to invade

479
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,760
other organs, bone as well as brain. And when cancer becomes metastatic, you know, that's when

480
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,760
we know things can get really dark and grim in terms of life expectancy. There are many mechanisms

481
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,280
that you could generate or hypothesize could explain that. I'm curious as to how many there

482
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,920
were. So one would I think be exactly what we've described, which is this immune weakening. Yeah.

483
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,200
But you could also look at, so hypercordicillemia is going to drive hepatic glucose output. So they

484
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,920
actually, hyperinsilimia, did they, when you look at those, they adrenal-electomized the mice and

485
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,520
prior to that, prior to it. So they controlled, they controlled the metabolic response. Yeah.

486
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,600
And what they did find in terms of, they looked a little bit at the mechanism. They found

487
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:03,560
that macrophage M1 cells, those were actually down-regulated by a lack of sleep. And what was

488
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,760
up-regulated was a sort of a rogue version, which was called the M2 cells, which seemed to have a

489
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,000
tumor promotion component to them as well. Wow. So they really, the adrenal-electomy is brilliant.

490
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,960
What a clever design. So you have to take out the stress response and they limited that. Imagine if

491
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:26,200
you didn't. And that's the fear is how much worse would it be when it really happens in humans,

492
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:34,680
because you will have that plus this huge tsunami of a cortisol impact, hypercortisol impact,

493
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,840
which is only going to make sense for us. So bring this now back to the clinical tragedy

494
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,080
here, right? Which is again, the weakness of our profession. And I say ours meaning mine and not

495
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,800
yours. You take a patient who's got a diagnosis of cancer. Do you think anxiety is going to go up?

496
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,200
Hell yes. Right? Do you think their sleep is going to deteriorate on no basis other than the fact

497
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,840
that they have this diagnosis and they're often undergoing horrible treatment, right?

498
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,320
It's amazing to me that I can't imagine how many oncologists are thinking through this problem,

499
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,160
right? Which is as careful as we are about crafting what the chemotherapy regimen looks

500
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,200
like, what the exact, if you go to ASCO, right? If you go to the largest oncology meeting,

501
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,200
I don't know how many papers are being addressed on this topic. Do you?

502
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,480
No. And I think there are, they are few and far between with results.

503
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,920
If you think about some of the stuff we machinate over an oncology, like exactly who gets the

504
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,440
sentinel node biopsy versus this and well, what if this is in ER, PR positive breast cancer versus

505
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,560
in ER positive PR negative, like we could, we could noodle and, and machinate on the most

506
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,280
minute details, which, you know, maybe they matter, maybe they don't. And yet something like this

507
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,080
seems so obvious. And yet, you know, we just seem ill-equipped to deal with it. Like it,

508
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,080
it's almost like you say, it doesn't surprise me either, by the way, it's not your fault as a

509
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:58,280
medical profession, you know, and being part of that profession, you know, what I did was I looked

510
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,720
at a retrospective and I looked at medical curriculums across, you know, the top 20 first

511
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,680
world countries practicing medicine. And what you find is that on average, most doctors get about

512
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:17,960
one to two hours of education regarding sleep. So one to two hours regarding a third of the

513
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:26,760
patient's lives, that is so anemic in terms of meeting the needs. But the critical part is that

514
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:33,080
one third of their life spent sleeping also makes such a huge difference to their two thirds of

515
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:41,000
their life awake. That is just to me unacceptable. And there's a deeper problem, which is in training

516
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,880
to be a part of that profession, you enter a culture that is as difficult as the one you

517
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,720
described where, you know, heads of state are chest pounding about how little they sleep. I mean,

518
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:59,880
I'll just pause for a moment to share another sort of set of stories. So when I started my residency,

519
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,400
we were on call every third night. I mean, every third night, you know, I think my record, I think

520
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,600
the most sleep I ever got on call in five years was five hours. And that happened once. And it

521
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,200
wasn't, of course, straight five hours, but I had accumulated five hours of sleep on a call night. So

522
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,040
I think you would average probably two to two and a half hours of sleep every third night, but that's

523
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:26,200
average. So guess what? Lots of those times are 30 minutes or less. So you're on call every third

524
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,640
night. So it's my second month on the job. So the way it works is you're basically either on call,

525
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,120
post call or pre call. Those would be your designation. So I come in on a Monday. I am

526
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:43,400
pre call. So it's my day before my call day. So you know, you come in at five in the morning,

527
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,800
you would normally leave by about eight o'clock at night or seven o'clock at night. And as we're

528
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,760
finishing our rounds that evening, someone, a surgical resident had failed to show for the

529
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,480
ER shift. He got sick. So the chief resident said, you know, hey, we need somebody to stick around

530
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,440
tonight to cover the ER. So I volunteered because I want to show how tough I am. Like, of course,

531
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,320
I can do this. So I stick around. I do the ER shift that night. Of course, in the ER, you're

532
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:15,800
absolutely not, you don't get one minute of sleep, obviously. Now it's Tuesday. Now I'm on call. So

533
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:22,840
I'm awake, of course, all day, Tuesday and Tuesday night and Wednesday. And I probably slept an hour

534
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:29,160
Tuesday into Wednesday. Now it's Wednesday. I get to go home early, which means 6 p.m. on Wednesday.

535
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,520
So I've been up since Monday morning. So this is not like within the realm of the type of sleep

536
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,120
deprivation that's going to kill you. There are lots of people in the light. I'll come back to that.

537
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:44,360
Yeah, yeah, it almost did. Yeah, but yeah. Okay, so I'm driving home. My point in case. So I'm

538
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:50,200
driving home. So I have quite a long drive till I have to get to the freeway. It's about two miles,

539
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,120
but it's like stop signs and streetlights. And then I have to get to the freeway and then I've

540
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,560
got kind of a hike home at this point in time. I live kind of north of the hospital.

541
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,760
I notice something really odd. Every time I come to a stoplight or stop sign, I can't keep my foot

542
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:10,040
on the clutch because for some reason I just I have a habit of like keeping my foot on the clutch

543
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,880
and keeping it in first as opposed to just sitting in neutral, which whatever. So the point is I keep

544
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:20,840
stalling and I'm thinking, God, I've never done this in my life. Like why can't I even sit here

545
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:28,520
for 27 seconds and maintain my motor control over this thing? So I met about the last street,

546
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,320
maybe two streets away from before I have to get on the freeway for a 15-minute drive.

547
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:40,360
And in what I can only describe as one of the best, dumbest decisions of my life, I decide

548
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:48,120
I freaking cannot get on this freeway. I'm going to die. So I pull over to the side of this road,

549
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,080
Eastern Avenue, and there's this park called Patterson Park. I have no idea what Patterson

550
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,720
Park is like today, but at the time I knew nothing about it other than it was grassy.

551
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:05,800
It turned out at the time it was like an open air drug market. And this now speaks to the second

552
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,840
point. So I had really good judgment, which was don't get on the freeway. But then I exercised

553
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:19,800
comically bad judgment, which is I'm going to go take a nap in the park. So I get out of my car,

554
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,560
probably didn't even lock it, walked into the park, put my pager on my neck of my scrubs,

555
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:33,400
set the alarm for one hour. It's like 6 p.m. Wake up at 2 a.m. in the middle of the park

556
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:40,280
with rat bites on my arms. I mean, this is like the drug infested rat infested park.

557
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,920
And just think to myself, what in the hell just happened? I had about three of those in residency.

558
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:54,040
The other thing that happened once in residency, same situation, every third night call, but I had

559
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,600
to take an extra shift in there. And to be clear, I volunteered, right? It wasn't like no one put a

560
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,200
gun to my head and said, you have to do this. I volunteered for someone who couldn't take a

561
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:09,880
night of call. So I basically was on the same thing. But now I'm way further into my residency.

562
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,600
You know, this was in my like fifth year of training. And I think the accumulation of that

563
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:22,600
was devastating. And so now it's two in the morning on that third night. And we're operating

564
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:28,360
on a patient. And the way it works in residency is when you're a senior enough resident, you're

565
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:34,040
the operating surgeon, meaning you're the one doing the case. The attending surgeon is assisting you.

566
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:38,200
And this is a very trivial operation we were doing. The only reason, in fact, we did it in

567
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,280
the middle of the night is just to get the OR time. Like it wasn't even an emergent case. It

568
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,520
certainly could have waited a day. It was just removing the gallbladder laparoscopically.

569
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,840
So I'm holding the two devices in the trocars and I'm doing the case and the attending is just

570
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:59,480
retracting for me. And I don't know how it happened, but I fell asleep on the patient and

571
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:06,200
face planted directly onto the patient. And again, the only solace you could-

572
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:14,040
Can you imagine the amount of sleep pressure that was necessary to build up for you to, I mean-

573
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,560
And I remembered that I had had a number of head drops prior.

574
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,440
Exactly. Yeah, everyone's jamming to good music, but no, they're not. It's just like they're

575
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:29,240
falling asleep. Right, right. And after God knows how many of those, it just turned into bang,

576
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,920
full L position face first into the patient. Again, the only fortunate thing there is,

577
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,760
in the process, I didn't jerk my hand and tear the common bile duct or an artery that could kill a

578
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,520
patient. So what happened? Well, the attending surgeon said, dude, you're too tired. Let me do

579
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:52,440
the case. You come and hold this. It wasn't even like, it was just sort of like this happens and

580
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,320
you go stand over there now. Whereas you think about like if that had happened in an airplane

581
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:03,000
or in some other profession where you'd like, that's a four alarm fire. That's a, what's going

582
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,240
on here? How can this happen? It is. And the data there we've got is pretty strong. I've lobbied the

583
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,120
medical association on a number of times. And I just recently wrote a piece in a journal called

584
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:20,200
the Lancet, which was called a sleep prescription for medicine. And I lay out the case for why both

585
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:28,600
for patient and doctor sleep is, you know, utterly essential, but profoundly absent. And firstly,

586
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,080
what we know regarding, you know, your surgical experience and that, that story there, we know

587
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:42,040
that if an attending surgeon has slept only six hours in the previous 24, there is 170% higher

588
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:49,240
likelihood that they'll make a major surgical error, such as, you know, splicing some kind of

589
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:57,080
major vascular component of the patient. What's also interesting is that when, if a resident has

590
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:03,400
worked a 30 hour shift relative to when they've worked just a 16 hour shift, that resident after

591
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,880
30 hours of being awake, when they get back in their car and start to drive home, just as you did,

592
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:16,760
there is a 178% increased likelihood that they'll get into a car crash and back in the same emergency

593
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:23,000
room from which they just came. But now as a patient requiring ER treatment, because they got

594
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:29,400
into a car, the irony is lost to me there. The other point is that we know that one in five medical

595
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:36,280
residents will make a serious medical error during their residency caused by insufficient sleep. One

596
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:42,520
in 20 medical residents will kill a patient because of insufficient sleep. Now, when you realize that

597
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:49,400
there's well over 20,000 medical residents active right now, and you think about that statistic one

598
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,520
out of 20, and you were to then do the math and lay out the number of bodies in front of you

599
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:03,400
that were preventable deaths, preventable by way of this simple thing called insufficient sleep.

600
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:10,840
I think it is an absolute disgrace. You know, doctors working in the ER, if the residents,

601
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:18,360
if they've worked a 30 hour shift, 460%, I think it is more diagnostic errors, which just stuns me

602
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:25,400
in terms of a number. But what's also interesting is that when you lobby the medical organization,

603
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:31,560
and I've tried to do this a while back, and I lay out that compassionate case of medical errors,

604
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,920
impact on patients, impact on doctors themselves, there was incredible pushback and resistance,

605
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,120
which was my mind is made up, don't confuse me with the facts. And I want to just, you know,

606
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:49,080
have a mea culpa because there were few people that were more vocal, more vocally opposed in our

607
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:56,920
residency than me when this 80 hour work week came in. And my view was not that sleep was,

608
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,120
you know, good, and we needed more of it. I really didn't have a point of view on that.

609
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,480
I actually frankly hadn't reflected on that, because I obviously didn't know any of the data

610
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:11,240
you shared. My view was the conditions under which we work are horrible, and that's a selection

611
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:17,560
feature. You want people that are willing to opt into that who are willing to take that much pain

612
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,680
to do this. And I had this whole thesis, which I have no idea if it turned out to be true or not,

613
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:29,800
that if you lowered the bar, lowered the pain, you would bring in a broader demographic. Now,

614
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:36,280
regardless of whether that's true or not, it doesn't really matter in the face of those data.

615
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:42,680
In other words, if it is true that back in the day, you were just training better physicians

616
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,760
because you were attracting people that could persevere more or had whatever, you know,

617
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,160
makeup your thing, it still doesn't change the fact you've got to come up with a new screen for that.

618
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,040
Yeah, you've got to come up with a new filter. You can't get around that evidence of the

619
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:59,560
deleterious impact of even if you attract, even if it's just a selection bias that you're bringing in

620
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:05,880
these hard knuckle folks who can just jam through with wakefulness in ways that, you know,

621
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,680
really are just horrific for everyone involved. You still can't get around the fact that they're

622
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:19,320
not going to be performing medicine at its highest. And we know for a fact that you don't need to.

623
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:27,160
So I think the only piece of evidence that favors that type of, you know, 30 hour continuous residency

624
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:33,560
type of mentality, the only good argument I've heard is continuity of care, that once you go

625
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,440
down to a shorter amount of time, you lose continuity of care with the patient that you're

626
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:44,120
cycling doctors between patients. But I have to say, though, even that I don't believe because

627
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,800
when I looked at systematically at the other medical practices, there are places that train

628
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:56,440
wonderful physicians that have a maximum of somewhere between 12 to 16 hours, places like

629
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:04,200
New Zealand, Sweden and France. They all limit their junior doctors to training on nothing more

630
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,880
than those amount of hours. And if you then look at the ranking of the medical systems in terms of

631
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:17,880
how well they're doing, those guys are way up there at the top. So I find it difficult to see a case

632
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:26,360
for arguing for the ability to train doctors with insufficient sleep. I'll tell you what I think

633
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,640
is going on because I agree. I mean, I haven't I've been away from it for so long, but I've spoken

634
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,920
to a few people who have kept up with the sort of medical education literature. And it turns out

635
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:42,040
the 80 hour workweek has not solved the problems that they had wanted. I don't believe that medical

636
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:47,480
errors have necessarily gone down. You could argue, well, 80 is not low enough. But I also think a more

637
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,920
subtle part of it is in the countries that you mentioned, I suspect that it is the cultural norm

638
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,560
of not just the residents, but the people who train those residents because they were trained

639
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:04,840
in that sort of more humane way, that you bring a different way of thinking about handing off a

640
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:09,640
patient. It means something different because it's just so ingrained in that's how medicine is

641
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,360
practiced. And I think what happened in the United States, and again, this is wild speculation. I

642
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:20,120
don't follow this literature, but just based on what I've seen since, I suspect that when you

643
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:27,000
overnight created a new rule, which I think took place like July 1st, 2003, new rule overnight.

644
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,880
But none of the people that were leading that had trained under those conditions.

645
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:37,720
They didn't necessarily know how to teach under those conditions. They didn't understand, as we

646
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:44,200
said, like, what does it mean to hand off a patient after 16 hours? Because in our day, you are

647
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:50,920
responsible for everything. I mean, you wouldn't dream of doing something like that because you

648
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,800
just don't know how to communicate what needs to be done to the next person. I mean, so much of it

649
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,920
just comes out of that. So I suspect that's a big part of it. And of course, unfortunately, that

650
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:07,800
would suggest that this is going to take time, but it still has to change. Time, but I fear it,

651
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,520
that type of mentality is going to die one generation at a time. Because in part there

652
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,160
was, you know, it's a bit of an old boys network, I think some of it. But you mentioned those things

653
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,280
about how do we understand the informational transfer, the propagation from one doctor to

654
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:28,040
the next regarding continuity of the patient who remains. And I think that really is an important

655
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:33,720
point. Part of me, though, feels as though we've been able to put people on the moon.

656
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,520
And that was non-trivial, but we solved it. I think we can also probably solve continuity of

657
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:46,120
care and protect both patient and doctor alike in terms of their wellbeing and still do it. So I

658
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,560
think it's not, I don't mean to sort of trivialize the problem. And I think what I want to try and

659
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:58,040
do here is, you know, just raise my hands and say that, you know, I really appreciate how hard that

660
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,000
is. It's just like early school start times and the work that I'm doing there to try and lobby for

661
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,200
kids to start later. That's not a small thing either, because you've got to solve multiple

662
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,240
problems. You've got to solve bus unions, bus transportation. You've got parents who need to

663
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,440
be in work at a certain time point. And, you know, starting those times later is going to be

664
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:25,240
non-trivial. All of these things are hard problems. And it's not as though I'm either ignorant of

665
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:31,560
those. And I want to really recognize how hard they are. But what I would also love to do is to

666
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:40,280
try and just make sure that we don't lose sight of the end outcome here. The end outcome in terms

667
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:47,320
of education is our children and making sure that we are not essentially educating our children

668
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,320
amnesic by way of their insufficient sleep. And the same is true for our patients and our doctors.

669
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,720
Let's keep the target that we have in our crosshair at the end of this process in mind,

670
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:06,440
rather than get perhaps distracted by how difficult the problem is. It is difficult. And I'm so

671
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:14,040
sympathetic to that. I know it's hard, but there's so much on the line. There is too much on the line

672
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:20,280
for us to be swayed by the difficulty of the problem in terms of the importance of the solution

673
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,120
that we must reach. No, no, no. I don't disagree with anything you've said. I think what I'm trying

674
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:30,440
to do is provide an explanation for why, and it's not an excuse, more of an explanation for why I

675
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:38,520
think the experiment has failed here. And it probably speaks to the need for a greater buy-in

676
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:44,680
to the gravity of the problem. And therefore a greater emphasis on solving what I agree are quite

677
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,080
in the grand scheme of things, trivial problems. I mean, splitting the atom was hard, putting a man

678
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,360
on the moon, that was hard, eradicating slavery, that was hard. All of these things have been done.

679
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,160
But I think we will look back, you know, with shame, just like you were describing to your family

680
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:05,720
regarding sleep and insufficient sleep. As we look back now with smoking, you know, 50 years ago,

681
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:14,120
we will look back in probably 20 years with shame that we were having schools start at 730 in the

682
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:20,040
morning. By the way, for schools that start at 730 in the morning, buses will start leaving at

683
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:26,600
530 in the morning. That means some kids are having to wake up at 515, 5 o'clock or even earlier,

684
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:33,400
which in my mind is lunacy. And I think the shame will be present when we consider the impact and

685
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,840
the impact we already know from the studies there. When we delay school start times, what we see is

686
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:46,200
that academic grades improve. We see truancy rates decrease. We see behavioral problems and

687
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:53,480
psychiatric problems also decrease. You see the number of people who drop out of school and drop

688
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:59,960
out of certain classes also decrease. And then finally, shockingly, the life expectancy of

689
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:06,200
students increases. And the reason that it increases is because of car crashes. There's a grade study

690
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,640
in Teton County in Wyoming. They shifted their school start times from 735 in the morning to

691
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:17,720
855 in the morning. And then they looked to see in just this narrow age range of just 16 to 18 years

692
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:23,560
old, what was the change in car accidents? And what they found in that following year, not just

693
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:30,440
that the kids reported getting one hour of extra sleep, there was a 70% drop in car crashes that

694
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:36,920
following year. Now, the advent of ABS technology and cars, antilock brake systems that dropped

695
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,600
accident rates by 20 to 25%. And it was deemed a revolution by some people. Well, here's a

696
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:51,320
biological feature getting enough sleep that will drop accident rates by up to 70%. So when sleep is

697
01:06:51,320 --> 01:07:00,200
abundant, minds will flourish. And if our goal as educators truly is to educate and not risk

698
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:05,960
lives in the process, then I fear that we are failing our children in a quite spectacular

699
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,120
manner with this incessant model of early school start times. So say a little bit more on this.

700
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,200
You and I have talked about this in the past, which is, and I think I even posed the question

701
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,200
to you this way, which was, you know, all things equal, Matt, if you're trying to pick between

702
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:26,280
three schools for your kids, like would you weigh start time in the matrix of decision? And you,

703
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:32,920
your answer was emphatically yes. Why is this the case? Why is it that do kids just, is there

704
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,160
something in their brain as they're developing that it's just a question of they need more sleep

705
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,960
and therefore you'll pick it up in the morning, or is there something about they need to sleep to

706
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:49,400
a later time that won't be solved by putting them to bed earlier? All of the above. So firstly,

707
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:56,600
you know, kids, even when you're 16, 17, 18, you're still needing nine to 10 hours of sleep because

708
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:02,440
your brain doesn't finish developing until it's about 25. What percentage of 18 year olds in the

709
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:07,720
U S do we believe are getting that sleep? Or if it's easier to answer the question, what do we

710
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:13,560
believe is the median duration of sleep for an 18 year old? About 11%. 11% are achieving the required.

711
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:20,200
89% are not getting sufficient sleep. And do we have a sense of what that average is? I think the

712
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,200
numbers you quoted earlier, I assume were for adults or was that for all comers? No, that was

713
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:30,440
for adults for teenagers. It's pro it's down to about seven hours when it should be somewhere

714
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:39,080
between nine to 10 hours. So the relative deficit is bigger than it is in adults. What's also

715
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,960
striking by the way is if you look at parents and you ask them, do you think your teenager

716
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:50,600
is getting sufficient sleep? 72% of them will say, yes, I think my teenager is getting the sleep that

717
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:56,760
they need. Yet only 11% of them are getting the necessary sleep. So in other words, there is a

718
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:04,520
mismatch here between the parental and child sleep equation. And what that also leads to then,

719
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,640
because parents believe that their kids are getting enough sleep, there is a parent to child

720
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,200
transmission of sleep neglect. And what I mean by that is, you know, the pulling the covers off at

721
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:19,720
the weekend, when these kids are sleeping in for two reasons. Firstly, they're sleeping in because

722
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:26,600
naturally, their biological circadian rhythm moves forward in time. So they, they want to go to bed

723
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:32,760
later and wake up later. It's not their choice. They don't get a choice in that it's biological.

724
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:38,360
It's hardwired. So for a parent listening, what would you say to them if they're bristling with

725
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:46,280
their kids' sleep schedule? What do we think is the most natural time to bed, time to rise for a

726
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:53,240
16, 17, 18 year old? I think for, you know, 16, 17, you know, you're looking at a 10 hour period,

727
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:59,000
probably from, you know, somewhere between 10 to midnight, depending on their chronotype,

728
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:05,960
to then sleeping in until, you know, essentially somewhere between 8 30 to 10 30 the following

729
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:13,080
morning. Now, the reason that that is actually still too early though, is because that would be

730
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:18,200
what would naturally happen if you were to let them sleep like that every single night of the

731
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:24,280
seven days of the week. But we don't, because what we do is during the five days of the school week,

732
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:30,280
we are getting them up way too early. You can even put them to bed at, you know, nine or 10

733
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:37,000
and say sleep. They can't biologically. So they won't be sleeping as well during the week. So at

734
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:44,200
the weekend, they're trying to sleep off a chronic debt that we've saddled them with during the week

735
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,560
due to early school start time. So no wonder they've got such a sleep pressure that is forcing

736
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:56,120
them to try and sleep until like one or two in the afternoon. So then we chastise them for saying

737
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,200
you're lazy, get out of bed, you're wasting the day, but it's not their fault. Firstly, because

738
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:05,400
their biological rhythms, the circadian rhythm wants them to be asleep late and into the morning

739
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:11,640
and into the early afternoon. And secondly, they've got this huge debt of sleep that they're having a

740
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:17,400
rebound from in terms of sleeping, trying to sleep off that debt that the school systems have given

741
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:25,160
them as well. So to me, I think we just need to, you know, reformulate our notion of how important

742
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,480
sleep is in that context. And you've already alluded to this. That's a hard one to solve,

743
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:34,440
right? Because you're restructuring when a parent goes to work, etc. It is non-trivial. What would be

744
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:40,200
a middle ground that would be a great compromise? In other words, like if a school started at 9am,

745
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,160
I feel like when I was in high school, we started at 9am. Well, ironically, yeah, what's happened

746
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:52,200
is that back in the 60s, schools were starting around 9am. And then ever more, as we marched

747
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:57,800
on in terms of our quote unquote development in society in the US, that time has actually

748
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:04,280
gone back and back to earlier and earlier start times, I think, because it's been squeezed by the

749
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:11,080
sort of the vice grips of, you know, work schedules where parents are having to work longer hours,

750
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,640
they are ultimately commuting for longer. So they have to leave the house ever earlier. So they have

751
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:25,480
to put those kids in school ever earlier. And I think many of these kids are just sitting there

752
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:32,040
unabsorbent, like a waterlogged sponge, they're not going to be taking up information. And in fact,

753
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:39,320
if you look at the data regarding delayed school start times, and you ask, yes, overall, GPA,

754
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:44,840
SAT scores, all of them rocket up, they all improve when you delay school start times.

755
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:52,520
But which classes get the biggest benefit in terms of the grade improvement? It tends to be not the

756
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:57,560
classes in the afternoon, where they are finally awake because of the circadian rhythm. It's the

757
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:02,840
classes in the morning, where before those classes would be starting at, you know, eight o'clock,

758
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:09,720
but now are starting at 930. When you push them to 930, they're doing much better in those classes.

759
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:17,320
And it reaffirms the case that the hit that is going on in terms of the amnesic impact that

760
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:22,280
early school start times are having is really in those morning hours, when the brain is not

761
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:27,080
designed to be awake. And it's certainly not designed to be receiving an education. It's

762
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:34,280
designed to be asleep, preparing itself for its education, which should really start at maybe

763
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:38,600
9 or 10 o'clock in the morning. I mean, the United Kingdom right now, as we speak at the time of this

764
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:45,160
podcast, there is a bill that's going through that will lobby for a 10 a.m. start time, which I think

765
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:50,680
is probably the sweet spot. And the reality of it is because someone will say, well, great, what do

766
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:55,400
you want kids to stay in school till 6 p.m. and blah, blah, blah, blah. But my guess is you could

767
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,760
probably do less with more if you did it right. In other words, you wouldn't need to spend as

768
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:04,440
much time in school if you could cram track, you could efficient, you know, more efficiently learn

769
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:10,280
that information. We've done these studies. You absolutely do learn more efficiently when you have

770
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:15,960
had sufficient sleep. So it's a forcing function. Could you compress it? It's like zipping a file,

771
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,920
you know, the amount of information that can be stored is much greater. But what's also interesting,

772
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:26,200
let's say that that's not the case. And you say, look, to do all of the staggered system with the

773
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:32,120
bus unions and to make it work out with parents and work schedules, it's going to require more

774
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:38,680
money to figure this out. Well, it turns out that some of that can be cost savings at the back end

775
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:45,880
because kids get released later. There is a time during when kids get kicked out of school

776
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,680
if they start early, which is this kind of criminal bewitching hour, which is where the

777
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,560
kids are out of school, but the parents are not home yet from work. And when they get together,

778
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:01,480
sometimes for some kids, bad things happen. That's where you see a lot of juvenile crime happen,

779
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:07,720
which is in that sort of twilight hour between, you know, the three to four p.m. period when

780
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,680
they're out of school to the six to seven p.m. period where the parents are finally there and

781
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:19,880
they get home. If you look at the cost of that criminal impact of activity in those hours, and

782
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:26,920
then you say, if we were to start schools later, kids get out later, we limit the window of

783
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:33,800
criminal opportunity. The cost savings comes back around and pays for itself for delayed school

784
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,360
start times. So you just need to open up the aperture of your memory, think about the problem,

785
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:44,360
and ultimately you can solve these equations. My daughter hates when I say this, but I keep

786
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:48,520
saying to her that I think this whole summer vacation thing is ridiculous because, you know,

787
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,560
it's sort of an artifact of a world when you needed the kids to sort of work in the farm in

788
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:59,480
the summer. But it almost seems like having a shorter day, shorter time in school, more time,

789
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:03,960
in other words, uniform the situation, right? More time to do extracurricular things, more time to

790
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:10,120
sleep, but just go to school 12 months out of the year. Like go to school like we work, right? Yeah.

791
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:15,640
That seems to be also culturally a very difficult solution, but conceptually an easier way to

792
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:20,680
approach this as well. I mean, I love your idea and I do think that the data supports it empirically

793
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:26,440
right now, which is that you may not necessarily need to just simply take the school day and push

794
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:32,760
it forward in time. You may just need to take the start of school and push it forward in time and

795
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:39,240
hold constantly end of the day. But by way of that sufficient sleep, ultimately you may be able

796
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:45,720
to still gain the same amount of intellectual equity within the minds of those young individuals

797
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,920
by way of that sort of later school start time and greater sleep as a consequence.

798
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,960
And it also just seems like something that is so amenable to testing. I mean,

799
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,600
it's very easy to do a randomized control trial of something like-

800
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:01,000
And there's lots of that stuff that's going on right now. The data just keeps coming out

801
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,320
and it goes in no other direction. It's so consistent. It really is.

802
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:11,880
Is there anything that we as parents can do outside of the obvious, which is choosing,

803
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,560
if we have the luxury, right? A lot of times you don't have the luxury, but if you have the luxury

804
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:23,560
of choosing between schools that have, meaning if you can choose by where you live or if you're

805
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:29,240
putting your kids into private schools or something, the later time, let's assume you don't have that

806
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:35,320
luxury and you got this hand that's dealt to you, which is school starts at 810 and gets out at

807
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:43,800
whatever 340. What can we do to help the kids get as much sleep as possible, even if it means

808
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,880
bucking against what might be their innate circadian rhythm?

809
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:57,320
I think probably right now the best thing to do is to try and excise technology. And I'm very-

810
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:04,680
When you say that, can you just say that again? That is such a hot topic right now.

811
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,440
This is another discussion I had with my daughter, which is I worry that in 20 years,

812
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:18,280
we will look back at the idea of 10-year-olds with iPhones as, I worry we will look at it with even

813
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:24,360
a worse lens than the smoking mother. And there's two-fold, right? There's the technology piece,

814
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,400
which we'll talk about, and then that says nothing about the whole social piece of the influence of

815
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:34,920
social media and stuff like that. But so sticking to the first one, you take the technology away

816
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:40,360
completely, you limit light after sundown. So there's that component, which is I think just

817
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:46,200
the basic impact of light. And this is scales to not just children, it scales to adults too,

818
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:53,240
that we are a dark deprived society in this modern era. And we need darkness at night to allow the

819
01:18:53,240 --> 01:19:00,040
release of a hormone called melatonin. And that melatonin, as it rises, it will help time the onset

820
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:06,680
of your sleep. And there are great studies that have been done where if you use, let's say, an iPad

821
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:13,400
for an hour before bed, first thing you get about a 50% drop in the amount of melatonin that's

822
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:21,960
released. So you lose 50% of the signal of sleep timing. Worse still, that melatonin peak, even

823
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:30,440
though it's lower, it's 50% lower, it will arrive three hours later at night. So it's so mistimed

824
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:38,840
by the perverse impact of the screen. So that would be like you and I living here in California,

825
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:46,120
but our melatonin release is much closer to Hawaii in terms of timing. That's one hour of iPad reading.

826
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:50,280
Is that true also Matt for television? Does television emit the same?

827
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:56,680
No, it doesn't. So television less so, but television has another mental impact, especially

828
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:02,440
if you're watching it in bed, that's not a good idea because then your brain associates your

829
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:09,320
bedroom as the place of being awake and watching television, not the place of sleep. And that's a,

830
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,800
when you start to form those maladaptive associations, it can be a trigger of insomnia

831
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:18,680
and anxiety. And typically that's one of the recommendations that we have that you only use

832
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:24,760
the bed. If you're struggling with your sleep for sleep and intimacy, that's it. But to come back to

833
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:32,600
to kids, that's the first impact, which is that the light can disturb and disrupt their melatonin

834
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:37,400
significantly. We also found in those studies, by the way, that the one hour of iPad reading before

835
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:42,440
bed reduced the amount of REM sleep time. When people woke up the next day, you have them rate

836
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:47,880
how refreshed by your sleep. Do you feel significantly lower rates of feeling restored

837
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:52,200
and refreshed by their sleep? What was also interesting is that once you stop that iPad

838
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:58,120
reading, it again had this carryover effect. It had this blast radius where they kept sleeping

839
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:05,000
poorly for another two to three days after that iPad reading. The second component though,

840
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,920
is a mental component. I think it's the component that may be as if not stronger than the biological

841
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:17,880
component with melatonin, which is firstly that these devices that kids use can cause sleep

842
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:23,640
procrastination. What I mean by that is, and this is just for adults too, you can be there with your

843
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,680
phone or your iPad and you can be sleepy and you could fall asleep, no problem at all. But because

844
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,560
you got it there, you just think, oh, just check email one more time. Just check Facebook. All right,

845
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,280
let me send that tweet out. And I forgot the detergent. Let me go onto Amazon very quickly

846
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:43,720
and I'll just order that. And then you look up and it's 40 minutes later and now you're 40 minutes

847
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:49,800
short on your sleep. Sleep procrastination is a problem. But for kids, I think the two bigger

848
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,800
issues are waking up in the middle of the night. There was a survey done that demonstrated that

849
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:04,120
well over 80% of teenagers admit to waking up during the night to check their phones and check

850
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:11,960
social media. Sorry, say that again. 80%? 80% during the week will wake up at least once to check

851
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:20,440
their devices. So you've got this dependency that is causing this alertness spike to wake you up.

852
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:26,520
And that's a habit that once it builds, it's quite difficult to break. The final thing, I think, even

853
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:33,560
if you were to be diligent and put your phone in airplane mode, what those technologies do is cause

854
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:39,080
what's called anticipatory anxiety. So I think many people have had that experience of having it

855
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:44,440
like an early morning flight and you've got to wake up at 5.30 in the morning and you know it.

856
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:51,160
You set the alarm, but you wake up at 5.28 and you are awake like a bolt. Matt, I want to, I'm glad

857
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:57,240
you brought this up. I have noticed this for my entire life. I sometimes will play the game of

858
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:04,840
can you wake up at 5.28? I'm blown away at the ability to do that. Now you can't do it if you're

859
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,880
really sleep deprived. At least I can't. So I can't go to bed at 2 a.m. three nights in a row.

860
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,520
You'll oversleep it if you don't have the alarm. What is that telling us about? It's almost like

861
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:20,840
I've got a CPU with a clock in it. Correct. No, an actual clock. That's right. Because you can do it

862
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:28,200
to a wrong time. You can miss set the clock at the bed by 10 minutes and hit that time versus true

863
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:33,160
time. Right. It's crazy. And if there's a great experiment that I'll tell you about, but that

864
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:39,640
anticipatory anxiety, that airplane example, that's kind of like the extreme version, but a weaker

865
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:45,720
version, but a chronic, and I think a very maligned sort of version of it happens with our phones

866
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:51,800
because most people, the first thing that they do when they wake up in the morning is swipe and

867
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:58,920
they just unlock this world of anxiety that comes flooding in through their phone, emails, texts,

868
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:06,520
social media. You essentially are training your brain to anticipate that wave of anxiety every

869
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:13,960
morning. And what we've discovered is that when you embed that anticipatory expectation in the

870
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:21,240
morning, the amount of deep sleep that you get at night is less. You end up sleeping in a shallow

871
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:28,440
state and you don't get the same amount of deep sleep. And the greater the anxiety that there is

872
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:33,400
the next morning, the greater the reduction in deep sleep that you have the night before. That's

873
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:38,600
why you feel like you've had a pretty rough night of sleep when you're waking up for that early

874
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:44,440
morning flight, because you've just had a poor quality of sleep. But the timing thing, so I think

875
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:50,520
to come back to make the point here, so I don't forget, I think for kids, the best recommendation

876
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:56,120
right now is technology to try and limit it. And I know that's hard because the genie feels like

877
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:00,760
it's out the bottle and it's not going back in anytime soon. And I don't want to be puritanical.

878
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:08,760
I don't want to be puritanical about alcohol or caffeine, about CBD, THC. I don't want to be

879
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:14,120
puritanical about kids getting the sleep or timing of the sleep that they need or can't get.

880
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:22,280
But what I would say is that to try and maximize that sleep in the face of early school start times,

881
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:27,400
which is what we're currently facing right now, taking that technology out the bedroom is probably

882
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:33,720
the single best thing that you can try and do. The other thing that they recently found was

883
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:39,560
a correlation between the use of or having social media in the bedroom and fear of missing out.

884
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:45,480
Because for kids, so often I understand this, because we were both kids, you could remember that.

885
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,200
Folks were going out in the afternoon. You wanted to be there. You wanted to hang out.

886
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:57,320
It was fear of missing out. It was FOMO. Well, now FOMO plays out on social media and it plays out

887
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:02,360
when you disengage from the parents. It plays out, in other words, in those twilight hours.

888
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,240
And so there is good data now showing that fear of missing out is directly related to insufficient

889
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:15,000
sleep at night in teenagers. The way that you can try to help that is to try and limit the devices

890
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,320
that give you the ability to have FOMO in the first place. So, but in truth, I don't honestly

891
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:27,320
have a good set of solutions right now for this teenage sleep problem. I think it's going to have

892
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:32,520
to be letting them sleep when biologically they naturally want to sleep. Again, you fight that

893
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:39,160
biology. It's not going to go your way. It's just not. Well, Matt, that certainly will scare any

894
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:43,400
parent senseless with respect to electronics. One other question on that that my daughter

895
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:50,760
actually asked me all the time, if she's reading a book in bed with a nightlight, is that as

896
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:56,360
harmful? A, from the standpoint of light, which is actually the question she's asking, and now B

897
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:02,120
would be my question more broadly. We talked about not watching TV in bed because that's

898
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:09,400
creating kind of a different purpose. Is reading in bed a bad idea and or is the sort of natural

899
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:14,040
white light, not natural, but the white light you get from a bulb, where does that rank on the

900
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:21,000
melatonin suppressing scale? So if you're someone who is struggling with sleep, that you are someone

901
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:26,280
who has sort of insomnia such that you are finding it difficult to either fall asleep or you wake up

902
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:31,480
at night and you can't get back asleep. So the first is what we call sleep onset insomnia. The

903
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,560
other is called sleep maintenance insomnia. You can fall asleep fine, but you can't maintain your

904
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:41,400
sleep. The advice there is even reading should be something that you should forego, that you should

905
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:49,400
read in a different room, wait until you get really sleepy, and then go to bed. That's the advice, and

906
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:55,160
because otherwise, as I mentioned, the brain is this incredibly associative device, and if you lie

907
01:27:55,160 --> 01:28:01,400
in bed awake, your brain quickly learns that your bed is the place of wakefulness. I hear this from

908
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:06,600
patients a lot where they'll say, look, I'm sitting on the couch watching television and I'm falling

909
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:11,320
asleep and then I get into bed and I'm wide awake and I don't know why. And the answer is because

910
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,680
your brain has learned the connection of your bedroom being a trigger for wakefulness because

911
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:23,880
wakefulness is what you do there. So what you need to do is break that association and get up after

912
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:29,320
20 minutes, go to a different room in dim light, read a book elsewhere in dim light, and I'll come

913
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:34,600
back to what type of light in a second, and then only when you're sleepy and there's no time limit

914
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:40,200
for this should you return to bed. And the analogy would be this, you would never sit at a dinner

915
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:47,640
table waiting to get hungry. So why do we lie in bed waiting to get sleepy? And you shouldn't.

916
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:53,960
And we need to sort of, you know, bring that back. So that's if you're struggling. In terms of light,

917
01:28:53,960 --> 01:29:00,600
what I would say is be a bit mindful as to what kind of light it is. If it's an LED light, it's

918
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:08,280
usually enriched in the blue sort of low frequency of the visible light spectrum, and it's the blue

919
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:15,560
light that is most harmful to melatonin. So light in general, not great for melatonin, it will stamp

920
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:20,600
the brakes on melatonin, and it will stop releasing it. So your brain is fooled into thinking it's

921
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:27,320
still daytime, even though it's actually on the clock face nighttime. But of that light, if there

922
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:34,440
is a better form of light, it's the red and the yellow, the very warm kind of colors, the cold

923
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:41,800
blue light that comes from LED, that's the more deleterious light, that's the type of light that is

924
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:47,960
more detrimental. So I would say that, you know, you can get these smart light bulbs now that can

925
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:53,720
change the dynamic frequency range of that light in the visible spectrum, make it more kind of warm

926
01:29:53,720 --> 01:30:00,040
and yellow in the evening, definitely favor that and try to stay away from, you know, light that is

927
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:05,320
LED light, you know, even if it's just going back to a classic light bulb, which typically is warmer

928
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:11,720
in color and low in wattage, that's your best light for reading. Has the experiment been done

929
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:17,720
when this may not even be ethical today, where subjects are given no restriction on when to

930
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:23,960
sleep, how long to sleep, but they are put in a perpetually light environment? No, but the

931
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:32,520
opposite, well, I know of the opposite. Yeah, there's two. No, there's one experiment that has

932
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,480
kind of been done that is like that. And then there is the other opposite, which is so the one

933
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:43,320
experiment that's not dissimilar to that actually happened inadvertently, unfortunately, which is

934
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:49,800
with premature babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. What they used to do was they would

935
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:58,200
just leave these fluorescent, you know, light bulbs on in the the NICU all of the time. And

936
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:03,640
at that point, even though the circadian rhythm isn't especially, you know, robust in infants,

937
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:08,680
they're, you know, awake, they're asleep, they're awake, they're asleep, they still need that signal

938
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:15,960
of light and dark. And what they found is that when they regularized light in the neonatal intensive

939
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:21,000
care unit, in other words, when they gave back darkness at night, and gave strong light during

940
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:28,520
the day, firstly, the infant started to sleep better, you saw about a 50% improvement in oxygen

941
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:34,280
saturation in those infants, and they put more weight on within the time period because they

942
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:40,200
were sleeping more regularly. And then finally, they left the NICU somewhere between two to two

943
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:46,760
and a half weeks earlier. So that's the only example I know of where you take a condition

944
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:53,720
where you were put under artificial continuous light conditions. And then you do the experiment

945
01:31:53,720 --> 01:32:01,880
where you try to mimic more naturally what a 1212 hour cycle of light dark would be. And what you

946
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:08,840
see are just biological changes, all for the better. That's the only experiment that I know of

947
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:15,240
in the positive, which is what you're describing. The reverse experiment was done where they

948
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:19,080
essentially took a group of people, they said, you know, what time do you normally go to bed?

949
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:24,360
And they said, nobody goes to bed, I can't get sleepy until about 11pm. And I sleep usually

950
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:31,160
about six, six and a half hours. They took that group of people off, they went to the Sierras here

951
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:37,880
in America, this sort of beautiful mountain range, with no electricity whatsoever, no access to

952
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:45,080
artificial light. And firstly, what was dramatic was that these individuals started going to bed

953
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:49,800
around nine o'clock in the evening. And this wasn't necessarily just because they didn't have

954
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:56,440
anything to do, they actually rated themselves as feeling sleepier earlier. Why? Because they were

955
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:03,400
getting the signal of darkness at the natural time. Secondly, they went from being, you know,

956
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:08,120
ardent about the fact that they were only six and a half hour sleepers, and that's all that

957
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:15,640
they needed to then sleeping a little bit more than nine hours. Now, I think this point about

958
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:21,640
going to bed at 9pm is a really important one. Have you ever thought about what the term

959
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:29,800
midnight actually means? It means it means middle of the solar cycle means middle of the night.

960
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:36,360
Whereas now, with the perversity of the industrialized civilization, midnight,

961
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:42,200
and especially now in the digital revolution, means it's maybe the last time to, you know,

962
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:47,800
send a few emails. Whereas if you look at hunter gatherer tribes, whose way of life hasn't changed

963
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:53,080
for thousands of years, and you ask how do they sleep, as if they are a good indicator, and we

964
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:58,680
think that that's probably a good indicator of how hominids should sleep. They typically go to bed

965
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:04,600
about an hour and a half to two hours after sundown, so around sort of 8-30-9 o'clock. They

966
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:10,920
usually get about seven, seven and a half hours of sleep at night, and then they have a siesta-like

967
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:17,320
nap in the afternoon to make it up to around about a total of nine hours. So I think what has

968
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:22,360
happened with modernity is that we have changed both the amount of sleep that we're getting,

969
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:28,200
we've reduced it, we've changed the timing of sleep, so we're getting less sleep, and we're

970
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:34,680
getting it at a different time, quote-unquote, perhaps a wrong time of night. And finally,

971
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:41,160
the nature in which we obtain our sleep has been changed. It seems as though we are designed

972
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:47,720
perhaps to be sleeping biphasically, which is a long bout at night, and then a siesta-like nap

973
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:52,760
in the afternoon. A lot of people will ask me about this two phases of sleep thing, but in a

974
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:58,120
very different sense, which was you sleep about four hours, then you wake up, you kind of have a

975
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:03,160
social life, and then you go back to sleep for another four hours, and it's called the two sleeps

976
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:08,280
or first sleep and second sleep. And there's a great book written on this. Now, that definitely

977
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:13,160
happened some time in human civilization. It seemed to happen around the Dickensian era,

978
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:19,560
but there is nothing in our biology that suggests that we should be sleeping in that way. It seems

979
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:26,600
to have been a social feature, a social pressure. There was a meal that took place, a large meal

980
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:30,200
that took place between those two, sandwiched between the two four hour sleeps, right?

981
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:34,760
Correct. Yeah. Yeah. And people would, you know, they would have social activities planned,

982
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,960
they would write, they would play music, make love. People, you know, it was a real thing,

983
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,440
but it was not a biologically defined way of sleeping. It's amazing to me because-

984
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,120
It's not a natural way of sleeping.

985
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:49,240
You'd think you'd be, I mean, I guess you could condition yourself to do anything, but

986
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:54,360
to wake up after four hours of sleep under any circumstances, generally quite miserable.

987
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:59,720
It's rough. It's absolutely terrible. So that happened. But I think to come back to the point,

988
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:07,000
it's just that how we are sleeping in modern society is not just about sleeping less. It's

989
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,480
about sleeping less, the timing of our sleep and the structure of our sleep. So I think those are

990
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:17,560
the things that have changed. One of the questions I get asked a lot, and I don't know the answer,

991
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:23,160
so I'm hoping you do is one, you sort of touched on it, but the efficacy of naps

992
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:33,000
and two, the notion that you should or shouldn't nap if you're having sleep issues. So on the second

993
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,960
one, I have a slightly stronger point of view and I hope it's not incorrect, which is in that

994
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:44,040
situation, the nap is wrong. You want the adenosine accumulation and you want it to draw your bedtime

995
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:50,280
back earlier if you're struggling. I'd rather you push through not sleeping and then go to bed at

996
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:58,440
nine o'clock. But to the first question, more broadly speaking, I can't imagine that one cycles

997
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:04,600
through what you described at the outset of our discussion in a 20 minute or an hour long nap.

998
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,640
Do you have people nap in the lab as well? You must. What does that look like?

999
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:15,160
So we've done a lot of these studies where we ask what are the benefits of napping and we certainly

1000
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:21,320
do find them. We find benefits for learning in memory. We find benefits on immune function.

1001
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:26,360
We find benefits for things like cardiovascular health in terms of metrics of heart rate

1002
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:33,960
variability. We see benefits in terms of lowered systolic blood pressure. All of these things we

1003
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:40,760
found benefit by way of a nap. Now, when I say nap, you can ask what do you mean by a nap? And

1004
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:45,640
we've played around with that dose as it were. And we've done sort of, we've tried to do a little

1005
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:50,360
bit of a dose response curve with some of these things too. What we found is that you can go

1006
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:58,200
down as low as about 20 minutes of a nap and still see some mental benefits in terms of things like

1007
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:04,440
learning and memory. But typically we do a nap that is 90 minutes because that gives the ability

1008
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:09,800
of the brain to go through the full 90 minute cycle so that the brain can go through all of

1009
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:15,480
the stages of non-REM sleep, stages one through four, and it gets the shot to get to REM sleep.

1010
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:20,680
And then we can ask by testing people in brain scanners sort of before and after and with

1011
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:27,480
cognitive tests and then with peripheral body tests, we can ask, you know, what was the benefit

1012
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:34,840
of that nap relative to a group that does exactly the same thing. They lie in bed, but we don't let

1013
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:39,720
them fall asleep that they may just kind of passively watch a movie. So they're inert for

1014
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:44,920
the same amount of time. They're in bed. They get all of the wires on the head. We tried to do it as

1015
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,320
controlled as possible with the only difference between being sleep between those two groups.

1016
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:56,600
So you do find benefits to your first point. To your second point, you're absolutely right in

1017
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:02,680
terms of your sleep prescription for your patients. The current recommendation is this,

1018
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:07,080
if you are finding it difficult to sleep at night and sleep throughout the night,

1019
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:13,480
the recommendation is do not nap during the day. And this helps us when we try to think about the

1020
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:18,840
biological mechanisms of how wake and sleep actually work. And you mentioned a chemical

1021
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:25,240
called adenosine. So from the moment that you and I woke up this morning and everyone listening,

1022
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:28,920
the moment that you woke up this morning, a chemical has been building up in your brain

1023
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:35,160
called adenosine. The more of it that builds up, the sleepier that you will feel. So it's the

1024
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:42,600
sleepiness chemical. And after about 16 hours of accumulation, you should have enough weight of

1025
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:47,960
healthy sleepiness. You should have enough adenosine within the brain to have you fall

1026
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:55,720
asleep easily and then stay asleep soundly. And then when you're in sleep, the brain actually will

1027
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:02,920
clear away that adenosine, removing the sleepiness. And after about eight hours of sleep, you've

1028
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:09,640
removed 16 hours of accumulation of adenosine so that when you wake up in the morning, you feel

1029
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:15,240
alert, you feel more awake. And that's the reason that you don't feel as sleepy anymore throughout

1030
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:23,320
that following day. Now, the problem with naps is that if you nap in during the day, particularly

1031
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:29,080
if you nap in the late afternoon, essentially what you're doing there is acting like a pressure

1032
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:34,920
valve on a steam cooker that you're building up all of this great healthy sleepiness, this sleep

1033
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:41,880
pressure, and then you nap and you'll just release some of that sleepiness. So now when it comes to

1034
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:48,040
your normal bedtime, you don't feel as sleepy. Why? Because the nap removed some of that

1035
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:53,640
sleepiness pressure, it removed some of the adenosine and you are going to perhaps find it

1036
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:59,000
more difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Perhaps is the important point. There are some

1037
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,280
people who can nap. If you can nap regularly and or you don't have problems with sleep at night,

1038
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:09,720
then naps are just fine. But if you can't nap regularly, and especially if you're struggling

1039
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:16,440
with sleep at night, the advice is don't nap, stay awake, build that healthy sleepiness, build

1040
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:21,320
lots of adenosine. That gives you the best chance to stay asleep and then fall under the spell of

1041
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:26,200
sleep under that weight of sleepiness for as long as possible. You know, it might be oversimplifying,

1042
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:31,880
but the way I generally describe sleep to patients is sort of a balancing act between adenosine,

1043
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:37,160
cortisol, and melatonin. And you've got it like these three things have to make, they're like an

1044
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:43,400
orchestra. You have to have the crescendo of adenosine with the decrescendo of cortisol,

1045
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:47,800
and then you have to let the melatonin take the breaks off this whole thing. And, you know, even

1046
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:55,720
when I just think about myself personally, I am convinced that virtually all of my sleep woes

1047
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:01,080
are on the cortisol axis. And the reason I'm hypothesizing that is I can't measure adenosine.

1048
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:06,120
It's very complicated to measure. You need a very special type of mass spec to do that or MRS,

1049
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:10,920
but we can measure melatonin and urine. We can collect urine overnight and measure melatonin

1050
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:16,280
levels. So we have at least some sense of how much we're making, but because I measure glucose

1051
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:23,880
24 hours a day, and I'm pretty familiar with meal timing and response in many ways, nighttime

1052
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:30,920
glucose for me as a proxy for nighttime cortisol and the association between high nighttime glucose

1053
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:38,360
and poor sleep is overwhelming. And I suspect it's that I suspect it's through this cortisol axis.

1054
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:44,280
There is in some ways a manipulation that we'll speak about in just probably a little while of

1055
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:48,760
adenosine, even though you can't measure it, you can actually manipulate it with something called

1056
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:54,920
caffeine, and that can demonstrate to you. Matt, by the way, we're in America here. I think there's

1057
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:59,720
a human that doesn't know what caffeine is. You get everybody's ears perked up like you're going to

1058
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:06,600
mention like some new compound you just discovered in the lab yesterday. It's caffeine. Yeah.

1059
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:13,800
Yeah. Yeah. Somnus squared. No, no, it's called caffeine. But what's interesting regarding

1060
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:21,080
cortisol, which really supports your hypothesis right now, the leading underlying mechanism,

1061
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:27,480
the leading theory of insomnia essentially comes back to that fight or flight branch of the nervous

1062
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:34,600
system that you are in this profound parasympathetic state where that nervous system is cranked too far

1063
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:43,320
in sort of the high strength direction. And if you essentially have a cannula and you sample

1064
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:50,360
cortisol every 30 minutes across a 24 hour period, you see this, you know, this nice rise during the

1065
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:56,120
day where cortisol is helping you stay awake. It's keeping you alert. It's doing all of the things

1066
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:01,640
that it needs to do. And then as you start to come towards the nighttime period, cortisol should drop

1067
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:08,120
and needs to drop for you to be able to initiate sleep. And in fact, it usually hits it's sort of

1068
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:13,480
almost it's an idea at the point where most people will say, that's my typical bedtime.

1069
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:20,760
And it then goes through this awesome sort of downstroke in terms of concentration. And then

1070
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:26,120
a few hours before you wake up, cortisol will start to rise. In other words, it's a preparatory

1071
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:33,080
hormone that starts to get you ready for wakefulness. If you look at patients with insomnia,

1072
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:38,440
however, what you see is that the cortisol starts to come down nicely in the evening,

1073
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:43,960
sort of six or seven or eight. So, you know, they could feel just as sleepy as a regular person,

1074
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:49,720
but then right before bed, it goes back in the opposite direction. It spikes again,

1075
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:55,000
and then starts to come down. And then often in the middle of the night, you will see cortisol

1076
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,880
spike back again, when it should be lower still before it starts its rise. Those two cortisol

1077
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:09,800
spikes, I think are the natural biological bookmarks for what we call sleep onset insomnia

1078
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:15,560
and sleep maintenance insomnia. So your cortisol spikes just before bed, you can't fall asleep,

1079
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:20,680
sleep onset insomnia, cortisol spikes in the middle of the night, you wake up,

1080
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:26,360
Rolodex of anxiety and brain starts to happen. Cortisol spikes, you can't fall back asleep.

1081
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:31,320
That's what we call sleep maintenance insomnia. Those are the two principle types of insomnia.

1082
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:36,520
I think that's where you can see part of the biological basis. And my guess is that if we

1083
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:44,120
were to measure, you know, things like your heart rate variability, and we were to decompose them

1084
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:48,520
with some mathematical equations that you would know of things like a fast foray transform,

1085
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:53,960
you can look at the contribution of the sympathetic versus parasympathetic when you break down the

1086
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:59,720
heart rate variability. My guess is that you're going to see that sympathetic, that fight or

1087
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:05,880
flight branch of the nervous system getting jacked just before sleep onset. And then once again,

1088
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:11,320
spiking in the middle of the night, underlying the cortisol spike, which underlies the awakening,

1089
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:17,400
which underlies the syndrome of insomnia. Yeah. Who do you think in that equation? I mean,

1090
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:22,520
I don't want to give everyone a lecture on this topic because you've done a great job explaining

1091
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:27,640
what sympathetic is, right, which is autonomic, but it's sort of different from the glucocorticoid

1092
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:32,840
regulated pathway. Do you think that the sympathetic is driving the glucocorticoid

1093
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:39,080
or the other way around? And the only reason I ask is in a moment, I'm going to propose the only

1094
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:45,240
two things that I've ever really thought I have in the toolkit to treat that. But the answer to

1095
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:50,440
this question might impact that as well. I honestly don't think we have the evidence

1096
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:57,640
to argue which way around that chain of command unfolds. I just genuinely don't know of the

1097
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:03,320
evidence. I think both the tenable hypotheses, both could be independent, so they, I think they

1098
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:08,760
could be non mutually exclusive. So in truth, I don't think I know the evidence in favor,

1099
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:14,680
but what's nice is that the fact that we know that they both happen and can be causal contributors

1100
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:21,000
means that we've got at least two treatment targets that we can go after, which I think will

1101
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,240
then play into exactly what you're going to say, which... Well, I don't know that they're correct,

1102
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:31,880
but to me, when we see that pattern, because we do measure nighttime cortisol and we measure the

1103
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:36,360
metabolites of it and all of these other complicated assays, when we see that high

1104
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:40,760
nighttime cortisol, we basically, you know, I mean, we sort of, that's a very hard problem to

1105
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,160
treat from an endocrine. You know, because if you really think about it, we're just dealing

1106
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:48,600
with the endocrine system, right? You know, it's a heck of a lot easier to treat thyroid dysfunction

1107
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,840
and dysfunction of the sex hormones. And I'm not saying that those things are easy, but they are

1108
01:47:52,840 --> 01:48:00,600
easier than treating the upper end of the, like when you have low sympathetic function and low

1109
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,520
glucocorticoid function, that's actually easier to treat than the opposite. The hardest problem,

1110
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:09,640
I think in clinical medicine from an endocrine perspective is high sympathetic output, high

1111
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:15,240
glucocorticoid output. And really it's amenable to behavioral therapy, right? It really comes down

1112
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:20,840
to a change in mindset and a change in routine. We were talking about this earlier. It's like,

1113
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:26,840
the further I can separate bed from email, the better. Because for me, emails just, I hate

1114
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:30,680
emails so much. So anytime I'm looking at email- Everyone else's agenda for your-

1115
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just, I'm just, I have a low level of pissed off at this whenever I'm

1116
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,840
looking at email. So the further I can separate my pissed off at this from bed, the less my

1117
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:45,880
cortisol is. Can I get that tee-ship by the way? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then the second thing,

1118
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:51,080
which appears to work anecdotally is phosphatidylserine at a high enough dose,

1119
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:56,520
which generally requires about 400 to 600 milligrams. And again, for me, the only time

1120
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:00,920
I find that that's necessary, that's really necessary is under those jet legs circumstances,

1121
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:04,520
you know, when you're trying to put yourself in the time zone of London, when you're leaving

1122
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:10,360
San Francisco and you basically have to make yourself go to bed and it's only 2pm in your

1123
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:15,160
brain, but it's late enough there, you know, the, the, you know, slamming yourself with 600

1124
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:19,240
of phosphatidylserine really seems to move the needle, both in terms of your glucose response

1125
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:23,880
and your cortisol response. What else do you have up your sleeve on that particular problem?

1126
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:28,840
Because honestly, I can't think of a more difficult clinical problem than the one you've

1127
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:37,400
just described. I think the glucocorticoid issue is, I think is a really tough nut to crack.

1128
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:44,360
I think for the sympathetic drive, I do think you're correct that it's behavioral there. I would

1129
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:51,160
actually argue meditation. And I looked at this data when I was researching the book, gosh,

1130
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:57,080
this must have been about four years ago now, you know, and I'm, I think I'm a bit of a hard nose,

1131
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:01,880
died in the wall scientist. So some of the, when I was reading the studies on meditation and

1132
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:07,000
insomnia, I was wondering if it was a bit woo woo and know how to take it seriously.

1133
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:14,200
But the data was very compelling in terms of it really does decrease the amount of time it takes

1134
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:20,680
someone to fall asleep. The continuity of their sleep is improved. If you look at some of these

1135
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:25,880
apps that do it very well and you know, things like Headspace or Calm, my guess, although I

1136
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:30,920
don't know if they've ever released this data is that if you were to look at their usage statistics,

1137
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:38,360
you will already see that people are self medicating their insomnia by way of meditating

1138
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:43,240
right before bed. And I think, you know, both of those apps are starting to now launch,

1139
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:49,640
you know, aspects of sleep and sleep health in the portfolio of offerings, rightly so,

1140
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:56,120
because they've probably realized that sleep is a huge part of the issue for which people are

1141
01:50:56,120 --> 01:51:03,720
coming to them to solve. And the clinical data is very supportive of that. So I would say that for

1142
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:12,680
driving it, it's almost impossible to fall asleep if your autonomic nervous system is pushed in a

1143
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:20,440
sympathetic dominant state in a fight or flight state. And a good example of this is, you know,

1144
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:25,080
when you are jet lagged, you can be there, you could, you may not have slept on the plane.

1145
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:30,680
You can feel that you're tired, you're really tired, but for some reason, you know, your cortisol

1146
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:36,120
is now spiking because you're mismatched with your circadian rhythm. You can feel your heart rate

1147
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:43,960
and you can just know that your nervous system is cranked and you are tired as tired can be in your

1148
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:50,120
eyes and in your mind, but your nervous system, because it's on, on that sort of upward swing,

1149
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:57,400
will not let you fall asleep. But meditation, I think is a great way to drive a parasympathetic

1150
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:03,000
dominance of the nervous system, which is to take you out of the fight or flight branch and more

1151
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:10,840
into this quiet sort of more introspective state. I think that's probably the better thing. Now,

1152
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:17,880
I know it's not from a clinical medical perspective as desirable because it's not a pill that we can

1153
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:23,000
take. It's not a dosage. It's you just have to put in the work to sit there and meditate.

1154
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:28,360
But I think that's the nature of sleep. I mean, I think CBT has efficacy, but it requires work.

1155
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:32,600
It does. And changing the way you eat requires work. It's not a pill. I mean,

1156
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:36,600
and exercising, you know, same thing. And I've been asked, this is a totally unrelated topic,

1157
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:40,440
but people always say, oh my God, you know, please write me a prescription for metformin

1158
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:43,000
because it's going to help me lose weight and blah, blah, blah. And I said, look,

1159
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:49,080
let me be clear. I mean, I think metformin is a really powerful pill. I don't think it's nearly

1160
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:54,760
as powerful as an exceptional diet. In other words, metformin superimposed on the world's worst

1161
01:52:54,760 --> 01:53:01,160
nutrition versus no metformin on exceptional nutrition. I don't think it's any comparison.

1162
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:08,440
In the end, molecules that you take intermittently aren't really nearly as potent as

1163
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:14,520
molecular changes that occur over a time course, behaviorally. I mean, that's, I mean, I, I wish

1164
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:19,880
that weren't true, truthfully. Yeah, I really, I'm not anti-pharmacology by any means, you know,

1165
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:24,760
if we had a good sleeping pill, I would embrace it and I would recommend it. But right now,

1166
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:29,320
the sleeping pills on the markets, they firstly don't produce naturalistic sleep.

1167
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:35,160
Secondly, they've been associated with a significantly higher risk of death and also

1168
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:40,040
significantly higher risk of cancer. I'm glad you mentioned this because this is a great segue to

1169
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:44,120
this topic. And going back to my friend Kirk Parsley, and I remember another thing he said,

1170
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:52,840
because I, this is again, going back to 2011, 2012, my go-to travel drug was Ambien. You know,

1171
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:57,480
fortunately, I've never, I've never had insomnia, but I empathize greatly with those who do. I've

1172
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:03,080
seen enough people with it, but when I needed to sleep, I was going to take Ambien. And I remember

1173
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:09,000
getting hints that this wasn't a great drug when I would, when I worked at McKinsey, I used to have to

1174
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:15,560
go from San Francisco to Atlanta every single Monday for a day. And because I was ruthless in

1175
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:21,080
my pursuit of not wasting time, rather than like take a Sunday afternoon flight and come back

1176
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:28,760
Tuesday, I took a red eye from San Francisco to Atlanta every single Sunday. And as one of my

1177
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:33,320
friends put it, that's the pink eye and ain't the red eye. Like that's a four hour flight, right?

1178
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:38,200
You always get the tailwind. So you get about three and a half hours of sleep on a plane.

1179
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:44,920
I'd get to Atlanta at five, pick up a rental car, drive to the gym, do a two hour workout,

1180
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:53,800
shave, shower, get to the client, stay there all day, leave at 6 30, get to the airport by 8 30,

1181
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:59,480
get the flight back to San Francisco, you're back by whatever your home at minute. So it was a 26

1182
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:05,080
hour door to door every single time. And I was using Ambien to make sure I slept on that flight.

1183
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:11,240
I would come up with these grisly discoveries, which is I'd find emails I sent that I didn't

1184
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:18,200
know I'd sent. And thank God none of them were inappropriate, but you hear these stories of

1185
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:24,520
people doing really crazy stuff on Ambien. Which is never committed to memory. And you know,

1186
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:28,760
it's only when people make the phone call the next morning and they say, what were you,

1187
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:33,480
what were you going on about last night? Oh, I, one of the scariest things I ever saw was I remember

1188
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:38,280
looking at my phone and seeing outgoing calls to people that I didn't remember making.

1189
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:43,160
So my friend Kirk Parsley is saying, and by the way, that Ambien crap that you take,

1190
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:48,600
you know, a couple times a month, he said, you know, that's not sleep, right? And I said,

1191
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:53,240
what do you mean it's not sleep? I'm out. And he just, you know, again, you'll laugh at this

1192
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:58,760
because this is exactly the kind of story that you tell so eloquently. He said, you're confusing

1193
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:04,520
consciousness and sleep or lack of consciousness and sleep. If I took a baseball bat and hit you

1194
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:10,600
on the head, I could render you completely unconscious, laying on the floor for eight hours.

1195
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:16,760
Do you think in any way that mimics the restorative process of sleep? I mean, not even close, right? So,

1196
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:22,120
you know, think of Ambien more as a chemical baseball bat to the head than something that's

1197
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:26,200
actually promoting what you've just been speaking about for the last, you know, little while.

1198
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:31,240
It's such a critical point. Again, I'm not anti-pharmacology and I know some of the people in

1199
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:38,760
the drug industries, the scientists, and their goal, their passion is to create drugs that better

1200
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:46,760
humanity. And they are genuine and authentic about that. And I love that about them, but I also will

1201
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:53,640
not accept or speak in public about a drug that clearly doesn't seem to be beneficial for a certain

1202
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:59,640
process. And unfortunately, if you look at the evidence, firstly, you find absolutely that those

1203
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:05,800
drugs are a class of drugs that we call the things like Ambien, Lester, sort of, you know,

1204
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:08,920
all of these things that you've heard, there are a class of drugs that we call the sedative

1205
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:17,240
hypnotics and sedation is not sleep, but people mistake the former with the latter. And it's not,

1206
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:23,480
it's literally just knocking your cortex out. So I'm not going to argue when you take those drugs

1207
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:30,440
that you're awake, you're clearly not awake, but to say that you're in naturalistic sleep is an

1208
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:36,920
equal fallacy. Because if I look at the electrical signature of your sleep, when you are on or off

1209
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:43,400
Ambien, radically different for a start, you don't get into the same depth of deep sleep that you get.

1210
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:49,320
It's not the same electrical quality of deep sleep. The second thing that we found is that there does

1211
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:56,040
seem to be a higher association with mortality risk. Now we don't know if it's causal. And my

1212
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:01,160
guess is that on the strength of the evidence right now, IRB committees, ethics committees that sort

1213
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:06,680
of allow you to do certain scientific studies may not even allow you to try and do those studies,

1214
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:14,280
because the evidence is already so deleterious. The other finding was this strong association

1215
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:21,240
with risk of all forms of cancer, which perplexed me because you would think, well, if I'm taking

1216
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:27,080
this drug that helps me sleep more, and sleep is so good for the immune system, including things

1217
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:33,560
like natural killer cells and combatting sleep, then this drug induced sleep should actually make

1218
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:41,800
my cancer risk lower, not higher. And the fact that it is higher, I think tells you that the type of

1219
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:49,400
sleep that you're getting is not of this rich, complex, restorative, restful, biologically

1220
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:55,560
appropriate sleep. The other thing I would come on to, and these are very difficult studies to get

1221
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:01,000
funding for because, you know, obviously some of the companies, they may not necessarily want some

1222
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,040
of this information out there. It was the only chapter in the book, by the way, that my publisher

1223
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:11,320
brought in a legal team to kind of look at when I was kind of making all of these claims. But this

1224
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:15,960
is just, I'm just conveying the science. There's nothing controversial about the science. And they

1225
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:22,200
ended up feeling legally comfortable with what I wrote. There was this stunning study done by a good

1226
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:31,240
friend of mine called Marcus Frank at Penn. And he was looking at basically brain plasticity. How does

1227
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:39,000
the brain make connections and strengthen those connections? And those strengthening of connections

1228
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:45,160
is the underlying mechanism that we know leads to the long-term formation of memories. And it's

1229
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:50,600
a very well understood mechanism, this idea of brain plasticity. And there is a model where if

1230
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:56,440
you kind of patch the eye of an animal, and then you measure the visual cortex, what you see is

1231
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:01,800
that once you patch one eye, the brain says, well, we're not going to waste the real estate of that

1232
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:06,840
one eye that's no longer doing visual processing. We're going to shift a lot of that over to the

1233
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:14,040
other eye's territory and give it even more kind of rich, connective fidelity, as it were. So you've

1234
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:19,960
got this model of what's called monocular deprivation plasticity, which is a classic model of how the

1235
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:26,280
brain rewires itself for things like learning and memory. What he found is that he took a group of

1236
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:32,760
animals and he gave them naturalistic sleep and did this kind of monocular deprivation. And sleep,

1237
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:40,040
it turns out, basically doubles the strengthening of plasticity. Sleep is wonderful for shifting

1238
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:44,600
things and making new connections and really strengthening those neural connections.

1239
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:51,320
Sleep is essential for brain plasticity. And it's almost, it's sleep almost double the strength of

1240
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:57,240
the connections relative to if you just keep the animal awake. So sleep, it's not just time that

1241
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:02,360
helps the brain rewire itself. It's time with sleep that makes the difference. Then he dosed

1242
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:08,520
those animals with Ambien. Now, firstly, the animals slept longer because they were dosed

1243
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:14,600
with this sedative hypnotic. And you would think that surely that should improve the strengthening

1244
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:20,040
of rewiring in the brain. It did exactly the opposite. Yeah, I was going to say, or at worse.

1245
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:24,600
It would make no difference. Not change from the control. From the control. If it was quote unquote

1246
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:33,480
naturalistic sleep, what he found was actually a 50% unwiring of the connections that had been laid

1247
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:38,920
down before when the animal was awake. In other words, not only had sleep failed to strengthen

1248
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:45,880
the connections, the Ambien laced or the Ambien induced sleep was doing the opposite. It was

1249
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:52,520
weakening connections within the brains. Now, what makes me fearful about that is firstly,

1250
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:57,800
if you look at the number of people who are using these medications, you know, it took

1251
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:03,320
George Lucas, I often say, I think about 40 years with the Star Wars franchise to amass about 4

1252
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:10,200
billion in profit. It took Ambien less than 24 months to amass that in terms of profit. So you've

1253
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:18,040
got to imagine the number of prescriptions being written are high. Then the fact that the prescription

1254
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:25,160
age of these sleep aids is starting to decrease gradually as parents get more concerned

1255
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:30,760
about their kids who may have more anxiety, who are having sleep problems, they're turning to pills.

1256
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:39,480

1257
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:46,120

1258
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:52,920
connections, build and mature. It needs to learn. It needs to consolidate. And then you're providing

1259
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:58,520
a form of sleep through medication that may actually be unwiring that nervous system and

1260
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:02,840
unwiring those memories rather than strengthening them. That Frank.
