00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,480
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:48,680
Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of The Drive. My guest this week is Sid Mukherjee,

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,120
who is a remarkable writer, in fact, a Pulitzer Prize winning writer and a remarkable physician

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,720
and scientist. In fact, probably there's nobody I know that combines those three things

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,440
as efficaciously as Sid does. His biography reads like I'm making it up. He studied biology

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,840
at Stanford. He then became a Rhodes Scholar, went to Oxford, earned his PhD in immunology,

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,160
returned to the United States to earn his MD at Harvard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,120
Fast forward to today. He is an associate professor of medicine in the division of hematology

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,400
and oncology at Columbia University, which is where we met to do this interview. He has published

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,720
also and continues to publish consistently in both the New Yorker and the New York Times,

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,600
which in and of itself is quite a distinction as I would learn. Typically one is on either side of

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,840
those, but not both. And of course he's published in New England Journal of Medicine, Nature,

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,440
in addition to a whole host of other medical journals. I met Sid probably five years ago at

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,920
a dinner that was set up by Lou Cantley, someone I'll be interviewing very shortly, who will be a

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,120
guest obviously soon. And while I remember that dinner very well, I was surprised to learn that

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,120
it left such an impression on Sid and he described it as something to the effect of one of the most

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,600
interesting and perhaps important scientific collaborations in his life that stemmed from it.

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,720
As we kind of jotted out a napkin experiment that went on to become a paper that was published by

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,760
a group led by Lou and Sid. And that paper was published this past summer and we talk about that

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,440
in detail. That paper involved the use of ketogenic diets in combination with a class of

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,320
drugs called PI3 kinase inhibitors. We're going to go into great detail on that so I obviously don't

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,200
want to repeat any of that stuff here, but I think for those of you that are interested in cancer,

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
you're obviously going to find this episode very interesting. But the other thing with Sid is,

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
it doesn't matter if you have no interest in cancer. I think you'll find this discussion

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,040
interesting because Sid has a way of making everything interesting and that to me is part

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,760
of Sid's gift. When I got his book, The Gene, in the summer of 2016 when it came out, it's one of

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,120
probably only six books in my life that I was not able to stop reading from the moment I started. So

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,560
it's one of those things where everything else I was doing had to be put aside for a few days until

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,360
I could finish that book. That's just the way Sid writes and that's also the way he speaks. He is a

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,840
unique human being and I think that will come across in this interview. The other thing that

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,040
was a total pleasant surprise to me was in doing the research for this podcast was coming across

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,200
a book that I was ashamed to admit I didn't even know he'd written called The Laws of Medicine.

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,200
That's because it's called The Three Laws of Medicine and we talk about these three laws and

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,280
rather than even stating them now, I just think it's worth this podcast is worth the price of

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,640
admission just on the basis of understanding those three laws. So with that, I hope you will

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,400
welcome Sid to the show and I do want to just remind folks to please sign up for the email

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,280
list. I've been putting a lot of effort into those emails every Sunday morning they go out

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,040
and I hope that they're at least worth some value. I think they are and I like to be able to

45
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
kind of share things with folks that I'm reading or seeing along the way and they don't always

46
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,080
have to do with longevity. Keep in mind one of the things that I think takes up more actual time

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,800
than anything else with respect to this podcast is putting together the show notes. So Bob and

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,520
Travis work really hard on those and the feedback we've been getting is incredible. People keep

49
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,840
saying, my God, how do you make these things? And the short answer is I don't. I don't do any of it,

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
but Bob and Travis do, especially Travis. And I think that if you spend a few minutes looking at

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,640
that stuff, especially if you find some of the content challenging and when we get into technical

52
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,240
terms, which we do on some of the podcasts, you're pretty much going to find everything in the show

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
notes. Lastly, if you're enjoying this, it would be an honor if you would head on over to Apple

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,640
Podcast reviews and leave us a review, especially if it's a positive one, but we'll take a negative

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,200
one too, as long as you can be constructive in your feedback. So without further delay,

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:50,240
here is my guest today, Sid Mukherjee. Hey, Sid, thanks for making time. My pleasure. Thanks for

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,200
being here. Yeah, I don't get up to this part of the city very often. It's a bit of a hike.

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,840
Well, it's a massive medical school and it's hard to imagine it anywhere else except for

59
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,320
uptown in this way. You know, we go right all the way to the river. It's amazing. And the last time

60
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,840
I was up here was to see another one of your colleagues on the other side of the street,

61
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Rudy Weibel, who's a good friend. And I used to be up here a lot more often. So it was nice to come

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,160
back. Most of our podcasts go really, really long. This one, I don't think we have that luxury of

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,800
time. So I kind of want to get right into things. But before we do, I certainly think for the

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,560
listener who doesn't know you well, your background, which I'll allude to a lot in the

65
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,200
introductions. We don't spend too much time on it, but you grew up in India, came to the US.

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,960
Did you do college here? I went to college at Stanford. Yeah. Oh, that's right. You went to

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,720
undergrad at Stanford. Okay. Then medical school at Harvard. Actually, then in the middle, I was

68
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
away for three years. I did a... You did a Rhodes scholarship. Yeah. Are you a Rhodes scholar?

69
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,800
I was a Rhodes scholar and that's where I got my PhD and my PhD is in immunology,

70
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,400
which is a subject that I left behind. Went to medical school at Harvard Medical School,

71
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,840
then did my fellowship and my internship, my residency at Mass General Hospital, fellowship

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,040
at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and then started my own lab and clinical practice at

73
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,080
Columbia University and have come back to immunology in a strange, widening circle of a way.

74
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,760
Yeah. The first time we met was a dinner that Lou Cantley had planned for us. This is about three

75
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,880
or four years ago. And I remember at the time, the topic that Lou is passionate about, that I'm

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,120
passionate about was sort of metabolism of cancer. And at the time, it wasn't something that seemed

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,640
as interesting to you as it is today. And I know today I want to talk so much more about that,

78
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,400
because the work you guys have done in the last few years is in many ways what I think is the most

79
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,480
interesting stuff to talk about. It was also a tough dinner because you don't eat most things.

80
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,640
It's hard to have dinner with someone when half the menu is off the menu. So anyway,

81
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,640
we somehow managed and scraped by and it was a wonderful evening. And actually led to...

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,840
What was that? Five years ago? Yeah. Led to one of the most interesting and perhaps important

83
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,040
scientific collaborations in my life. With Lou. With Lou. But it was that dinner which kind of

84
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,360
hammered. It was in a Japanese restaurant on the Upper East Side in a tiny little place.

85
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
You remember? That's exactly, I know exactly where you were.

86
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,280
I know exactly where it was. Well, because we wrote on a... It was a little bit like one of

87
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,960
these napkin experiments where you write on a napkin an idea. And that idea takes five years

88
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,720
to come alive. This thing that was sketched on a napkin that evening and is now leading to actually

89
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,200
kind of a massive clinical trial across multiple sites, very energetic teams coming into all of

90
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,840
this out of that little napkin on a Japanese restaurant. Yeah, that was a really fun night.

91
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,920
Prior to that, I had read The Emperor of All Maladies. I don't think the gene was out yet.

92
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,280
The gene was not out yet. I want to spend just a couple minutes on The Emperor of All Maladies

93
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,480
because if there's anybody listening to this who hasn't read it, you won the Pulitzer Prize for

94
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,880
that book, I believe. I did, yes. Yeah. So it's a must read. Having myself studied in oncology,

95
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
there was so much that I learned. I trained at Hopkins, which is... So we're in the Hallstead

96
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,400
School of where the mastectomy was created, where many of these things were created. But to really

97
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,000
understand the history of Bernard Fisher's role in the mastectomy, it's just an unbelievable story.

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,880
My only criticism was at the time quite a depressing story. Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying

99
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,280
that to be critical. I understand that. It's less a criticism of you than the field. No, no. It was,

100
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,760
to me actually, interestingly, people often bring this up idea up. For me, it was actually... It's

101
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,360
far from a depressing story. It's just the opposite. In fact, if we don't contend with the

102
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,600
question of how... I mean, The Emperor of All Maladies, just for people who don't know,

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,520
is a history of cancer, starting from its first description in Egypt, right down to my own patients.

104
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,880
Thousands of years of a journey against a disease that seems to morph and change over time. Every

105
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,160
time we look at it, it has a new form. It reflects our own diversity to some extent, our own

106
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,320
wyliness, our own imagination as humans. So to me, not a depressing book, because it is a way to

107
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,840
look directly at the face of the enemy. And I don't find that depressing. I find that clarifying.

108
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,920
And there are many, many high points in this journey. There's the invention of the great

109
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,200
surgeries that save tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. The

110
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,200
dramatic advances against breast cancer and most importantly against some variants of leukemia,

111
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,840
where the mortality was 100% in 1950, and is five or 10% now. 95% change in mortality is a huge

112
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,280
difference in must rank as one of the great medical inventions of our time. So for me,

113
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,600
far from a depressing book, but to me, a clarifying book that tries to clarify why

114
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,480
we're here today, where we're going, what happens next, why we're not doing certain things, why we

115
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
are doing certain things. So that's my impression of what happened at the end of that book.

116
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,440
When did the idea to write, as it's really referred to the biography of cancer, when did

117
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
that idea come to you? Was it in your fellowship and your training at some point?

118
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
Yeah, I was training and it was a very simple moment. Actually, I remember a woman who I was

119
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,000
treating for cancer came to me and I was giving her yet another trial of targeted therapy, a new

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
kind of therapy. And she finally sat down one afternoon and she said, where are we going

121
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,040
with all of this? Why are we here? How do we get here? And she was of course asking me in a very

122
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,920
personal level, but you could take that question and make it a much, much larger question. Where

123
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,600
are we going in this battle against cancer? Why are we here today? What happens next? Why aren't

124
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,040
we elsewhere? How much of this is the wildness of this family of diseases? How much of this is the

125
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,400
capacity to use our, the greatest skills of our imagination against this illness? You know,

126
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,920
in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, when you asked a child what the outer limit of their scientific

127
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,880
imagination was, they would say, I want to be a rocket scientist and I want to send a rocket to

128
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,200
the moon. By the 1950s, 60s, 70s, if you ask that same child what the outer limits of their

129
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,080
scientific imagination would bring to the world, they would say, I want to cure cancer. It began

130
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,800
to define the limits of our scientific prowess, are the limits of our imagination, a world without

131
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,960
cancer. So there is a sense in which this is such an elemental illness. So much of our culture is now

132
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,560
defined through the lens of cancer. And what was shocking as a fellow, and I started encountering

133
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,320
cancer in the clinical sense, was shocking was that there was no such history, that it was all

134
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,160
ad hoc. And we knew little bits and pieces of it was like looking at the enemy through a

135
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,000
patchwork quilt with little holes in it. And the attempt here was to say, well, what is the full

136
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,560
story? What does the story look like? When did this start? Why did we end up here? What happens

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,240
tomorrow? What happens way into the future 100 years? What will cancer look like? And a lot of

138
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,600
thought experiments go into the book. So that's sort of the genesis of the book. And that's how

139
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,160
it came about. The research is also remarkable for a book like that. Anyone who's read it will

140
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,800
appreciate. And again, I think what's nice is this is one of those books where you can be an oncologist

141
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,160
and read it and find it staggering. And you can be someone who has lost a loved one to cancer,

142
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
but wouldn't know the difference between a sarcoma and a lyo myo sarcoma. Doesn't matter.

143
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,280
The book resonates, which obviously speaks to your ability to tell a story. And that's sort of,

144
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,360
to me, what's mind boggling about that book is the way and it's the same in the gene, by the way,

145
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
is that you weave in and out of a personal story, and then something that's very dense

146
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,640
scientifically. And on a personal level, this is challenging, because I'm in the process,

147
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,240
as you know, of writing a book and doing a pretty lousy job of it, I think. But it's

148
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,760
this challenge of you want to be able to do the science justice, but you need to be able to tell

149
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,560
a story. So how does the scientist, Sid Mukherjee, get along with the writer, Sid Mukherjee?

150
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
Well, I don't think there are two separate people. I think they're integrated into one person.

151
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,640
And that's very important. There are many people in my world. They wrote as a process of thinking.

152
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Stephen Jay Gould comes to mind not to draw a ludicrous comparison. Charles Darwin wrote to

153
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,480
think. Oliver Sacks wrote to think. I would suspect that Atul Gawande writes to think. I

154
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,840
know Atul so. So the two people are fundamentally not different people in my brain in order to

155
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,440
do the scientific work that I do. I need to think it through, often through the essays that I work

156
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,400
on. And they inspire in a kind of yin-yang or roundabout way, circular way, ways to find new

157
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,760
ways of thinking about the world, the cancer world. So there isn't a conflict. I don't feel a conflict.

158
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,640
The process is probably of interest. I mean, the process is that when I started writing Emperor,

159
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,560
I sort of made a personal vow or a strategy in writing that this was my first book. I'd never

160
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,400
written a book before. I wrote down some principles or tenets that I would follow. And I've kept them

161
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,480
in every book since. The first one was that there will be no scientific abstraction,

162
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,800
at no place or point shall you go through five pages or three pages without there being a human

163
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,400
being in the middle of this. I'm a translational researcher. I'm a human scientist. And that meant

164
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,600
that I've made a personal promise that you wouldn't go through five pages without understanding what

165
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,440
the payoff of these pages that you've really worked your way through, often as a reader,

166
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,960
what the payoff is. So if you look carefully through that book, every five to seven pages,

167
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,560
the story comes alive in a human story, in a scientific story, and in a scientist story.

168
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,440
They all intersect. And sometimes through my stories, there are times that are tough.

169
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,800
And I'm writing about the description, the first cancer-causing genes, oncogenes,

170
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,280
and their mutations. It's tough to say, well, what's the human being? This is a laboratory

171
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,360
experiment in which you sprinkle tens of thousands of bits of genetic material onto cells and ask

172
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,320
the question, which cells become turned from normal to cancerous? And that's the way you trap

173
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,520
one of these cancer-causing oncogenes. What's the human story behind it? Well, there are two stories.

174
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,040
One story is quite lovely. It's the story of Bob Weinberg, the scientist who you know, walking

175
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,560
through Boston in a snowstorm and suddenly realizing, not in a one-to-one manner, but this

176
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,240
idea of sprinkling tens of thousands of genes onto pieces of genetic material onto cells,

177
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,640
like a snowstorm of genes. There's a kind of congruence to that story. It's not like Bob

178
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,720
Weinberg woke up one morning and saw a snowstorm and said, that's the experiment I should do. But

179
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,080
there's a kind of emotional congruence to the backstory of a scientist. But then the second

180
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,360
story that illustrates this point is to walk through a patient telescoping down, or rather

181
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,160
microscoping downwards from their outer cancer, a tumor, a lump, a mass that is about to kill them,

182
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,920
a real patient of mine, a man with lung cancer. And slowly in that same story of this man's illness,

183
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,560
begin to microscope down to the fact that he actually has in his cells this mutant gene

184
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,640
that Bob Weinberg once caught in this snowstorm of sprinkling genes on cells. And all of a sudden,

185
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,760
this man's cancer is sitting in a room in Boston surrounded by his family dying of metastatic lung

186
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,680
cancer. But at the heart, at the root of that lung cancer, is that very same gene, that very same

187
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:19,120
oncogene that was discovered, described 10, 20 years before in a paper, in a kind of dry, abstract,

188
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,200
scientific paper. And all of a sudden, that gene, the genetic material that can drive the growth of

189
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,040
a normal cell and make it malignant, make it metastatic, so metastatic, so malignant, that our

190
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,560
best medicine, our best minds can't stop the growth of this aberrant cell, all being driven in part by

191
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,800
that very same gene that was trapped 20 years ago in a laboratory experiment on rat cells. So all of

192
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,720
a sudden, this thing comes alive to you in a way that becomes consequential. If you didn't know the

193
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,800
identity of the gene, you would not understand why on earth this 70-year-old man in perfectly

194
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:04,960
good health is all of a sudden decimated by one or two or four or eight mutant genes in his cells

195
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,360
that suddenly take over and drive the growth of these cells. Anyway, that's one example that comes

196
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,520
up over and over again. That was the first tenet. That was the first tenet. So what was the second one?

197
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,560
There are many, so I'm not going to go through all the tenets. But the second one was that this book,

198
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,280
all these books, should be fundamentally readable by everyone. You talked about this already.

199
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,040
It should be like a kaleidoscope, that if you turn the book leftwards and you see it as an

200
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,160
oncologist, it's still interesting. The pattern changes. If you turn the book rightwards and say

201
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,040
you're an anthropologist, it still is interesting. If you turn the kaleidoscope upside down and shake

202
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,400
it and there's a new pattern that's formed, it's because you're reading the book now as a clinical

203
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,040
scientist. Or you're reading the book because your daughter has leukemia and you're the father

204
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,400
of a patient with leukemia. Or you're reading it because you yourself have been diagnosed with

205
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,640
breast cancer or your mother has and all of a sudden the kaleidoscope changes. But the point is

206
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,520
that the object remains the same. It's the same book, but you can read the book in various different

207
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,960
ways. You can come into it different ways. Often when I'm in, this sounds like a strange statement,

208
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,800
often when I come back from the words I reread my own writing to figure out what was I thinking

209
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,640
then in 2008 when I wrote those sentences and how does that change now? It's been 10 years.

210
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,840
So I should tell you that there will be a 10-year update to the emperor. There will be three

211
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,480
additional chapters. I assume one of them will be immunotherapy as an update. That's right. So

212
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,600
they're very broadly three sections that are updated and I've thought about it for a long time.

213
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,560
So there'll be an updated section on prevention. There'll be an updated section on early detection

214
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,280
and an updated section on treatment. So that's the very broad three big broad chapters. But in

215
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,400
every chapter there will be deeper dives into what's happened now since the last 10 years and

216
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,560
within the treatment section and potentially within the prevention section there'll be a huge

217
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,600
role of the immune system which was not fully appreciated in 2010. I thought that was the

218
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,560
biggest distinction between the book when I read it and then the PBS special, the Ken Burns special

219
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,200
which of course again we'll link to all of these things in the show notes here. But one, you got

220
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,640
to read the book. But two, I can't recommend enough the Ken Burns special. They did an unbelievable

221
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,240
job I think sharing your voice and that was the biggest. I remember watching it thinking, oh wow

222
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
there's a big difference here because there was a three installments or five I can't recall.

223
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,360
Yeah the third installment felt like it was half immunotherapy. It was half immunotherapy. Well

224
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,240
because part of the reason was that again this brings me to the next tenet in the book or writing

225
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,440
the book. The next tenet was that there's so much cancer research in laboratories going on everywhere

226
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,680
and the tenet or the principle was that unless that research has manifest itself in a human drug,

227
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,040
in a human medicine, in a in a reconception of how we think about preventing treating or

228
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:07,120
detecting cancer in a fundamental reconception of those ideas, it won't get into the book.

229
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,240
So tumor immunology of course had been around for a very long time, coleus toxins famously and

230
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,200
other such efforts very very early on. But in 2010 we were at the edge of that moment in which we

231
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,960
began to use tumor immunology in human beings as powerful medicines to change the course of the

232
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,000
disease. It was just the first trials that come out and in fact the book was complete in 2009

233
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,920
and the first trials had not even come out then. This is a little funny trivia story that I'd

234
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,160
almost forgotten about this until somebody mentioned it to me a year ago. I think the

235
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:47,120
first real paper that I wrote as a fellow was on CTLA-4. It was looking back at the series at NCI

236
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,080
of patients who had been given CTLA-4 and responded and this paper basically identified

237
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,880
the strong association between autoimmunity and their response to it. Right. Of course this will

238
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,120
be interesting later in our discussion because I want to of course talk about James Allison.

239
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,240
So we'll come back to that but you're right that was sort of when it went from you had interleukin

240
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,560
too that worked in maybe 10 percent 15 percent of patients but you couldn't predict why. That was

241
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,240
the bigger question. You didn't know why were some responding and why were they only responding with

242
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,320
certain cancers to where we are today where it's really been a transformation in the last 15 years.

243
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,440
Absolutely and so when we started the film version of Emperor with Ken Burns which I

244
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,080
obviously was very close I worked very closely with Ken. I should say that the gene is also being

245
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,200
made into film by Ken Burns. Oh my god it's like Christmas all over again. It's almost completely

246
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,080
shot we're sort of moving towards editing phases and so forth. When can people expect that? It's

247
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,760
already been scheduled I think it's winter or fall 2019 so it's on this it's about a year from now.

248
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
Yeah about a year from now yeah and we're working through footage and historical footage and archival

249
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,760
footage and so forth but to wind backwards the crucial piece that had been added since the book

250
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,080
was of course immunological therapy so much of what the last episode was around this new burgeoning

251
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,960
field I mean in the first meeting that we had around the transformation of the book into the

252
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,920
documentary film the first thing that was raised is what's changed and the answer was very obvious

253
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,680
what's changed is immunological therapy. It might have been emphasized as much in the book and I

254
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,600
may have just missed it or it's possible you also observed this as a change but I believe it will

255
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,480
factor into the 10th edition which I can't wait to get my hands on is the role of obesity in cancer

256
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,400
as if I recall in the documentary you said look this is now becoming basically the second leading

257
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,440
preventable cause of cancer after smoking which was again I was aware of that at that point in

258
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,560
time because of the work that I'd been doing and sort of my little echo chamber but I thought this

259
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,440
is a PBS special this is not something that I think most people would appreciate this is becoming a

260
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
first for many people to hear. That's right and the one thing that we should make clear is that

261
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:03,440
every word in that PBS document was vetted by some of the most important and thoughtful

262
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,760
scientists and cancer biologists and physicians and physician scientists and cancer advocates

263
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,440
across the world there's a backstory in other words the script was vetted over and over again

264
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,400
so that we wouldn't say things that were misinforming the public or because this is

265
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,040
this is documentaries for all time Ken Burns's work is evergreen hopefully my work is evergreen

266
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,320
so it was very very carefully vetted and it was quite clear by the time the documentary came out

267
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,480
that the signals that we were picking up around obesity and cancer were becoming extraordinarily

268
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,000
clear for some cancers obviously not for other cancers and the provocative statement that sits

269
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,520
behind all of this is that really since the last 20 odd years and maybe even 30 odd years we have

270
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,400
been struggling struggling to find preventable human chemical carcinogens of substantial impact

271
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,160
every word in that sentence is important we have certainly found chemical new chemical carcinogens

272
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,600
in humans but often in that affects small pockets of people who are exposed to those carcinogens

273
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,000
we have found lots and lots of chemical carcinogens which have moderate to very small impact if you

274
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,400
look at populations overall the bar might be smoking so smoking is a good bar this is a

275
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,240
smoking or tobacco smoke is a chemical carcinogen which is removable or preventable and it has

276
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,680
substantial human impact across populations changing smoking behavior can change fundamentally

277
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,120
the epidemiology of cancers across nations if that bar is smoking we have struggled for the

278
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,040
last 20 odd years to find things of that magnitude and effect the direct impact of that is when

279
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:49,120
people come to me and they say well what do you do to prevent cancer in yourself and your family

280
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,400
i have to sort of casually or not so casually admit that not very obviously i don't smoke

281
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,880
but it's not like i'm eating goji berries or or avoiding some fundamental thing that everyone

282
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,200
else is not in the know about because there aren't any i mean you know i'm obviously not

283
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,040
exposing myself to these rare unusual occupational cancer carcinogenic agents but i'm not doing

284
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,000
something fundamentally changed that's different from you or anyone else to prevent cancer

285
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,560
the exception to this rule of the 20 odd years of the hunt for chemical carcinogens is obesity now

286
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,280
you and i can have a debate is obesity a chemical carcinogen no not in the traditional sense is it

287
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,080
even preventable maybe but we have to think twice or three times about it there's a role of genetics

288
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,680
environment in all of this and even do we think it's obesity per se or hyperinsulinemia for instance

289
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,000
exactly first of all is it an endocrine problem is an inflammatory problem or is it a metabolic

290
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,840
problem there at least three yeah obesity is such a a such a crude phenotype that's right there at

291
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,920
least your point has at least three if not six underlying phenotypes that each of which

292
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,160
mechanistically would make a lot of sense for accelerating cancer is an immunological

293
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,640
phenomenon that is the cytokines the inflammatory all of these going back to your general point that

294
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,400
obesity was becoming identified more and more clearly as one of the potential causes of cancer

295
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,920
or i should say strongly correlated with the development of cancer so strongly that we think

296
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,440
that there's a causal link based on all everything that we know about epidemiology some cancers that

297
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,360
we began to take this seriously and we're still taking it seriously but as you're pointing out

298
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,160
there are several horns underneath that blanket of obesity that we understand very crudely and we

299
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,800
have to figure out which of these is driving the cancer risk i would like to spend the next six

300
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,760
hours discussing with you the tenets of writing for selfish reasons but instead i'll punt that to a

301
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,520
we'll do we'll have dinner in a couple weeks and we'll finish that discussion i want to talk about

302
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,120
another book you wrote that doesn't get as much attention which is the laws of medicine you wrote

303
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,080
that after emperor before the gene correct that's right so laws of medicine has a very different

304
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,040
mandate as it were and that's because the book came out in association with ted they had

305
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,280
commissioned 10 books by 10 thinkers around the world and they asked me to write a book on that

306
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,200
and i it's necessarily a small book it's really a you know the mandate was to write basically a 75

307
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,640
page book expanding on a single very very incisive idea so that's the laws of medicine yes if i if i

308
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,200
got them correctly the three laws are a strong intuition is much more powerful than a weak test

309
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,720
uh-huh how did you think of that and what is the most important application of that law to the way

310
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,680
you think about medicine or specifically oncology today this to me is one of the great neglected

311
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,640
ideas in medicine perhaps one of the great neglected ideas in the world this idea initially

312
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,360
comes from thomas bayes this is a bayesian idea thomas bayes was a cleric but by evening he was a

313
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,880
mathematician and an economist and he let his work leads to one of the most seminal and funny

314
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,960
thought experiments that i've ever encountered which is the following and i i sometimes quiz my

315
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,920
my daughters with it which is the following this is not thomas bayes's own example but it arises

316
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,800
out of thomas bayes's work and he one might imagine going to a street fair and encountering a man

317
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,960
who's tossing coins and he tosses coins and your job is to predict whether the next flip coin flip

318
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,440
is going to be heads or tails and so he tosses the coin 20 times and all 20 times its tails

319
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,760
so then he turns to the crowd and he says what's the next coin flip going to be heads or tails

320
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,320
now the mathematician in the crowd who's the professor of mathematics says 50 percent says

321
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,800
50 percent and you know everyone says absolutely right but the child in the crowd says no no you

322
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,240
don't understand this is a stupid problem it's the coins rigged the coin has only it has two heads

323
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,360
or two tails as case may be and the child's right and what's important about that insight

324
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,640
is that the mathematician imagines the world this in this case this is not a stab at mathematicians

325
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,080
in general but the professor of mathematics thinks of the world as having no history has

326
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,440
having no a prioris it's a world that's created de novo every time the coin is flipped and its

327
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,600
heads and tails equal every time but the child knows and i all humans know that in fact the

328
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,200
world doesn't behave like that everything has priors and you need to understand those priors

329
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,000
before you can understand the posteris there's wisdom in that idea and it took someone like

330
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,680
thomas bayes to figure that out that most of our lives we aren't living our lives like the crazy

331
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,160
mathematician professor we are living our lives like the child we're thinking to ourselves what

332
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,080
was the prior antecedent imagine this is true for any corner of your life the first question you

333
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,320
ask yourself when you're trying to solve a problem trying to understand the cosmos trying

334
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,080
to understand something you ask yourself what was the prior like did the sun set in the west last

335
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,360
night and how about the night before and maybe i don't need to create a formula to figure out

336
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,520
whether the sun is going to set on the west or the east tomorrow it's because it's set on the west

337
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,760
every time there are obviously loopholes and gaps to this kind of thinking there are surprises that

338
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,640
you can miss so bayes's fundamental idea was that you can only interpret a test in the light of what

339
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,280
that test is predicted in the past it's an extraordinarily important idea in the way we

340
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,400
think about about the universe that the past performance of a test tells you something not

341
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,040
everything but tells you something about the future performance of a test and you can apply

342
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,840
it to many many things in the world you can apply it to any kind of thinking economic economic

343
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,600
thinking climate change oriented thinking that the past is a guide to the future not only in a

344
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,720
kind of loose way but you're really using a rheostat weighted strongly by the past and this of course

345
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,280
applies to medicine and it's a forgotten rule in medicine although it does seem like one of the

346
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:47,920
things that i've always felt physicians innately do well without realizing it which is the opposite

347
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,520
of where i want to be not to take the pot shots but i think where we do very poorly is an

348
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,120
understanding asymmetric risk so naseem talab has written a lot about asymmetric risk and i think

349
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,560
he's absolutely right to be critical of not just physicians but basically most people so my argument

350
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,120
is we are innately wired to be bayesian we are absolutely not innately wired to appreciate risk

351
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,240
and both of these are important that's right so one of them we have to hone so much more because

352
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,480
i think it just doesn't come naturally i played a funny experiment which you'll appreciate i'll send

353
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,320
you the list and you'll have a field day with it it's 20 questions and each one is a quantitative

354
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,720
question with an answer but they're not obvious you would never it's not like how many you know

355
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,360
presidents were there or something where you might know the answer you ask the group we're

356
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,840
going to give you these 20 questions i want you to answer each question not with a number but with a

357
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,720
95 confidence interval you know the game no i don't know the game okay so interesting game so at

358
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
the end of 20 questions if you've done it correctly you should have 19 out of 20 of those

359
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,520
ranges correct i've never met a person who can come close you almost without exception get like seven

360
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:04,160
of the 20 right you can't even contemplate what that variability is so the second law was that

361
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,920
normals teach us rules outliers teach us laws so this of course these were very carefully i mean i

362
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,680
thought i spent a lot of time thinking about them of course this is the anti-vasian law this is the

363
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,080
exactly what you're talking about this is the idea that simultaneously in the medical brain

364
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,760
has to live the idea that the basian idea that when you hear hooves think horses not zebras

365
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,880
famous medical tenet hooves beats outside your window are likely to be horses they're very

366
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,160
unlikely to be zebras the second law is once in a while they are zebras and you need tools you

367
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,560
need special ideas special tools to figure out what these outliers look like who they are how

368
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,040
to find them and how to quickly find them so that you can identify them and triage them differently

369
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,680
so in some ways these two laws are yin yang they polarize against each other and what's interesting

370
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,160
about them is that they both in medicine can both can be simultaneously true in the same way as

371
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,200
our assumption of a symmetric risk is simultaneously true with the idea that our understanding of the

372
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,320
base of a world in the basian way is helpful and important so the second law is about how do you

373
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:18,480
identify outliers how outliers tell us about the nature of normalcy how they tell us about how

374
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,440
complex interactions can produce occasional far outsiders and how those outsiders really

375
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,600
challenge us to define what these interactions look like in real life i mean the simple example

376
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,720
is it's very very hard to figure out the genetics of any disease without finding the rare

377
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,040
people who have the disease as a consequence of a mutation the classic example of course is that

378
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:50,160
we would not have an idea how to regulate our body or to prevent heart attacks if we hadn't paid

379
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,640
extraordinarily close attention to a small family small groups of families that had a mutation in

380
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,920
the gene that controls cholesterol metabolism most people don't have this mutation because those

381
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,560
families are quickly extinguished we think because they die of heart attacks they have all sorts of

382
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,680
problems they die of heart attacks but by paying extreme attention to this one family that has a

383
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,320
mutation they're rare scientists all of a sudden uncovered a whole cosmos in which we understand

384
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,040
now cholesterol metabolism and because of that cholesterol metabolism other scientists eventually

385
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,320
develop the first statins so all of this you know the fact that hundreds of thousands of people in

386
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,640
the world are taking this medicine to prevent heart attacks tracks back to a rare family where

387
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,440
because of a genetic mutation they had a very very high risk of cardiac disease and of course

388
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,440
now we know there's a whole family of those people there's at least two thousand of those mutations

389
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,400
that produce that phenotype and these natural experiments are actually a remarkable thing and

390
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,640
of course bringing it back to the gene to now have a tool a probe to be able to explore that is

391
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:01,040
is amazing the third law for every perfect or exceptional medical experiment there is there's

392
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,280
a human bias that goes along with it again these are unique to medicine and what's interesting

393
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,920
about them is that they are unique to me at least what's interesting is that they're unique to the

394
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,000
day-to-day practice of medicine but they apply for every i think they apply to every corner of life

395
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,440
you don't have to be a doctor to realize that for every every time we think of something if you're

396
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,240
really skeptical thinkers we have to think about the bias that comes intrinsically with that thought

397
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,000
in other words every single declarative claim about the universe that we're making

398
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,160
must have necessarily a declarative bias that comes with it they're matched if you want to be

399
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,320
a scientist we want to be a skeptic your real job aside from being creative and designing experiments

400
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,520
is defined for every single declarative claim that you're making the bias that's drives sitting

401
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,200
like a little devil buried inside that declarative claim because i promise you everyone has one each

402
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,600
one of these claims has one and richard fineman who listeners of this podcast know is one of my

403
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,400
heroes one of my kids is named after him is he named fineman or richard his middle name is fineman

404
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,120
yeah and my wife at first was like why would we do that but then once she had read surely you're

405
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,200
joking mr fineman a couple of times because she'd read it once before she realized why but fineman

406
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,400
said eloquently right the job in science is not to fool yourself and you're the easiest person to

407
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,520
fool that's right so to your point the only thing i would disagree with what you've said

408
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,960
cid is i don't think these are unique to medicine i think these are laws of science right and maybe

409
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,200
laws of life on some yeah so the mandate here really was to use this book as a kind of springboard

410
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,160
to challenge the way we think about virtually all aspects of of how we live you're going to read an

411
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,160
article in the new york times tomorrow that will make some claims about some politician somewhere

412
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,680
in oklahoma or you're going to read about an economic paper that is now being presented to

413
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,600
the feds and your job is to be adequately skeptical about it and understand what are the

414
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,240
priors how do we explain this particular fact based on the priors are the priors do the priors

415
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:11,680
matter to use a very topical example does someone's past behavior in college or in school high school

416
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
tell us about how he or she's going to be a judicial candidate or does their behavior under

417
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,840
scrutiny in any way predict their behavior when no one's looking that's right that's another

418
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,880
question the second question that you might ask here is again it's an outlier question right

419
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,920
scrutiny versus not scrutiny are they do they become outliers to themselves if they're scrutinized

420
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,080
if they're versus when they're not scrutinized and the third question is when i read this story what

421
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,520
are my biases am i reading it because i'm a man am i reading it because i have a particular

422
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,960
experience of my in my own lifetime myself my sister my my daughter my friend my colleague

423
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,600
is that coloring the way that i read this particular story so absolutely and you know

424
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,480
this thinking goes on over and over again this these are circular processes do those biases

425
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,760
have priors do the priors have biases and so forth so you can use these i mean i i certainly

426
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,600
use these tools in clinical clinical practice yeah it's a beautiful as you said it's a very

427
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,320
short book but again we'll we'll certainly make sure people have this link to it because i i think

428
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,280
it's a great way of teaching people how to think and that's again i just don't think we're innately

429
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,120
wired for every facet of thinking now going back to your background in immunology very recently we

430
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,640
had a very exciting for those of us in this space very exciting nobel prize awarded i mean it was

431
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,800
as we were discussing before we started recording it wasn't so much around immunotherapy but a very

432
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,080
specific element of it which are the development of checkpoint inhibitors two of them in particular

433
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:46,000
were basically acknowledged here ctla4 which i mentioned earlier npd1 tell me why these are so

434
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,840
exciting they're exciting for many reasons they are exciting for again some history and some

435
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,160
background as the story as it were is exciting because if you ask the question in the 1990s

436
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,920
what's the relationship between cancer and the immune system you get a kind of diffuse answer

437
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
you get an answer which could be very unclear because there were all sorts of

438
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,360
complicated lines of evidence one line of evidence was that in patients with a complete collapse of

439
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,680
the immune system such as patients with hiv or complete collapse of at least of one wing of the

440
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,360
immune system they would get these cancers you nobody else could get but what's interesting

441
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,880
about them and this is where the thought experiment this is where the brain cells start

442
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,320
sort of ticking and wondering they would typically get viral cancers viruses that would

443
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,440
now get unleashed we now know many of them viruses like human papilloma virus they would

444
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,240
get cervical cancers they would get anal cancers so a lot of viral cancers but patients with HIV

445
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,080
did not generally get lung cancer i never even thought of that so we have enough data to know

446
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,600
that they either at no greater prevalence or even at a lower prevalence when when you start to talk

447
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,040
about you know for example lung cancer or gbm or pancreatic cancer i never thought of that yeah

448
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,240
it's very important so the data are mixed because of course in the 1980s they weren't living long

449
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,680
enough so all that we know is that the first groups of cancers that cropped up in these men and women

450
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,480
were not lung cancers that were not pancreatic cancer so at the first pass with that cut short

451
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,760
data set you might begin to imagine then if that's the case the immune system completely collapses

452
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,000
you only get a certain kind of cancer then what is the possible role of the immune system in in

453
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,440
cancer control and you might if you were a nailist you might have given up in the 1990s and said well

454
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,320
you know take the whole immune system away and nothing really happens even with this cut short

455
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,200
data set so maybe there isn't such a complex interaction well it turns out that people like

456
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,400
jim alison and his japanese colleague did not put the immune system away they put that data aside

457
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,960
this goes back to the laws of medicine they said sure it tells you a little bit but i didn't tell

458
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,520
you the full story the full story turns out there's one layer deeper the full story turns out that in

459
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,000
people who don't have a collapse of the immune system whose immune system is otherwise intact

460
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,000
cancer cells not not all cancers but some cancers make specific factors in fact they evolve that

461
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,160
the word make is the wrong word here they evolve so that they put up specific factors put up specific

462
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,720
signals that inactivate the immune system or that make the immune system no longer able to kill or

463
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,280
recognize the cancer cell and the identification of these specific pathways these specific factors

464
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,800
was what led to the nobel prize because in further work jim alison and again his colleagues this is a

465
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:50,320
big wide field showed that if you inactivate these specific factors if you drive nails through them

466
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,160
using a variety of methods then all of a sudden the cancers become

467
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,520
re-visible to the immune system and the immune system can attack and kill the cancer cells

468
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,280
now why is it exciting it's exciting for many reasons first of all it's important to realize

469
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,920
that not all cancers respond we don't know why some do and some don't melanoma is highly responsive

470
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,440
it's an immunologically engaged tumor is it because the melanoma has so many antigens that

471
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,920
it will suddenly be more recognizable is it because the skin is such a lymphoid organ is

472
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,720
the right environment we don't know all of these questions the other thing to realize is that people

473
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,320
have responses and some people continue to respond some other people sadly will relapse and they'll

474
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,160
go you know the cancers will start growing back in the context of their re-educated immune system

475
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,680
and that leads to the second question which is what happens then is there a second pathway and

476
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,840
this is an important idea i think that goes back to your first question which is about whether this

477
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:50,160
is depressing or not the important thing is once you drive a single stake through cancer's heart

478
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,040
it's like placing the first crampon on a climb you see if there's no crampon that's placed on the

479
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,480
climb you can't climb a mountain it seems like a wall it's a blank wall and you don't know where

480
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,160
to go left or whether to go right or what to do once you plant that first crampon and it sticks

481
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,360
and it sticks you all of a sudden the whole face of the mountain becomes it's a different mountain

482
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,200
it's a different mountain now because now you can ask the question because the first crampon was

483
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,080
planted in that particular place and it's stuck and it's stuck i have a new vantage point exactly

484
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,800
perspective has changed that's right and so this is the important piece to realize about cancer

485
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,520
research and perhaps about all research is that the first crampon or the first stake through

486
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,000
cancer's heart is an incredibly important stake because then you can ask what i call linear

487
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,560
questions before that first one is placed the questions are non-linear you don't know where to

488
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,960
place it the whole map is open once you drive a stake through the first question the world

489
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,040
becomes more linear you can now ask the question what's the mechanism of resistance to that

490
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,840
and when you do when you find that what's the mechanism of resistance to that and so all of a

491
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,320
sudden the perspective is different because you're we've climbed through that first and that's

492
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,680
usually where the Nobel prizes are given your Nobel prizes are given often for planting the first

493
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,080
stake through the heart of a disease through the heart of a problem and that's why this Nobel prize

494
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,240
is important it's not of course as you're saying this does not encapsulate the field of tumor

495
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,960
immunology in general there's it's a wide field our own lab does a whole bunch of work in tumor

496
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,520
immunology but we're put on the shoulders of those prior giants as it were and so that's the

497
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,040
recognition that's been given here you said something that i think is so important and worth

498
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,240
reiterating there's also something about immunology and immunotherapy that's quite interesting as far

499
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,560
as planting that stake which is the durability of response it is often the case that when you have

500
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,880
an immunologic remission it is a durable remission it is not always the case but it is

501
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,120
much more likely the case than when you say for example see a chemotherapeutic remission

502
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:51,040
or even a surgical remission on a personal level i have a very close friend who was diagnosed with

503
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:57,760
colon cancer 10 years ago at a very young age you know he might have been 40 and that was unusual

504
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,440
in and of itself i remember talking i went to the hospital when he had his colectomy spoke with the

505
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,920
surgeon after it sounded like a horrible case huge tumor the mesentery was full of nodes which i

506
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,000
assumed would be positive every 26 nodes sampled all came back negative my friend was adopted we

507
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,440
later realized he had lynch syndrome eight years later he goes on to develop pancreatic adenocarcinoma

508
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,560
unresectable so it's encased the mesenteric vessels he cannot have a whipple procedure

509
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,000
and as you know and unfortunately many people listening to this will know that is a death

510
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,080
sentence yeah it's a non-negotiable you will not be alive in nine months and he was put on an

511
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,640
anti-pd1 therapy because he happened to have as you would know these patients with lynch are going

512
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,240
to be much more likely to be susceptible to checkpoint inhibitors two years later he's

513
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,080
disease-free just unbelievable stories yeah and i think your point is an elegant one that i'd never

514
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,560
really thought of before which is focus less on the fact that we haven't solved the problem and

515
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,960
more on the fact that we have made a finite and real step towards establishing a new place a new

516
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,080
location for which to view this disease that's right so i describe this as taking a non-linear

517
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:13,040
problem into a linear problem now of course the answers are often not linear per se but it gives

518
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,160
you a route i mean we'll come back to the metabolism study that we did with luke cantley

519
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,800
that is a great example of taking a non-linear problem and converting into a linear problem now

520
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,440
i'll tell you about that in a second but any time this was the place with gleevec too let's

521
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,920
tell people what gleevec is yeah so gleevec is a good example of a drug where we learned to target

522
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,240
a mutant cancer gene and it's actually the gene product so in that case the cancer it's a blood

523
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,960
cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia was also a death sentence and also gi stromal tumors

524
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,520
and gi stromal tumors yeah chronic myelogenous leukemia was a death sentence people had to

525
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,680
go through transplants i've watched probably a dozen in the pre-gleevec era a dozen patients

526
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,920
die of chronic myelogenous leukemia or the complications of transplant i trained briefly

527
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,440
as a transplanter and then all of a sudden through the work of many people including brian druecker

528
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,680
a drug was discovered so before that scientists figured out based on very careful genetic analysis

529
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,480
that the tumor was being driven by really the work of one gene and the gene was called bcr able

530
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,920
it's an oncogene it's not found in normal cells but found in these cancer cells and the product

531
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,240
of that gene became like a like an engine like a manic engine that was driving these blood cells to

532
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,280
go crazy and make more blood cells and proliferate and proliferate and proliferate and it was this

533
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,400
engine gone wild inside a cell and every time the cell asked the question should i divide

534
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,600
rather than looking at its normal state or nutrients metabolic state etc the only answer

535
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,880
we'd ever get was from this engine saying yes go ahead make another cell divide etc etc etc so

536
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,280
this was identified that the exact the gene product was identified the protein product of

537
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,240
the gene was identified and then through an elaborate series of experiments and circumstances

538
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,320
chemists found a way to actually jam the engine one molecule human beings may we stitch this

539
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,720
molecule together it's a remarkable achievement and once the engine is jammed which suddenly

540
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,120
turns out that the disease goes into remission this was one of the first examples there are others

541
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,520
of so-called targeted therapy where you take you synthesize a chemical to jam

542
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,560
cancer's engines in a cancer specific way it doesn't affect normal cells but what's interesting

543
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:31,680
about that is that some people develop resistance because the engine cancer cells evolve and they

544
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,120
find a way of resisting but that resistance it becomes a linear problem you figure out the

545
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,680
mechanism the resistance is and you drive a second stake through cancer's heart and when it becomes

546
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,760
resistant to that you drive a third stake and so forth so all of a sudden the problem which seemed

547
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,880
like a big blank rock became a linear problem so that that goes back to another example of how

548
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,600
that first stake or the first crampon really helps with the problem and and now for immunotherapy

549
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,920
immunological therapy the roadmap is much clearer why do some tumors respond and why some don't

550
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,280
respond is it a question of the environment that the tumor is sitting in is it blood vessels is

551
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,440
that tumor cells is it immune cells these are answerable questions these are so-called linear

552
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,800
questions but the first big step here was to define the problem this is really a nice step off to

553
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,480
exactly where i know we want to go which is we've got surgical oncologists medical oncologists

554
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,840
radiation oncologists in many ways a subset now of medical oncology is immunobased oncology

555
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,040
the work that you lu and many others are now doing is potentially a another branch of oncology

556
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,520
called metabolic oncology so you're beyond gracious in your suggesting i have even something

557
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,240
to do with helping that evening turn into a what sounds like a very productive collaboration between

558
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,520
you and lu and i'll be talking with lu as well in the next month i'm sure but let's talk a little

559
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,680
bit about what came out of that collaboration and certainly bring it back to ben hopkin's paper

560
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,080
that was in nature i believe was in nature yeah two weeks three weeks ago yeah so let's talk a

561
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,720
little bit about the question what were you trying to understand so the question is there's

562
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:13,440
a very wide question and then there's a very narrow question the wide question is how does the body's

563
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:20,160
metabolic state affect cancer it's a very big question because cancers like all cells are eating

564
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:25,360
nutrients as well to in order to grow and the question therefore is the cancer eating a different

565
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:31,200
set of nutrients than normal cells this work goes back to famous work by otto warburg done in the

566
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,760
early 1900s yeah 1920s is that right yeah where otto warburg was one of the first people to make

567
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,240
the hypothesis that there's something fundamentally different about i mean we won't go into great

568
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,560
details but it's fundamentally different in which the cancer cells metabolize compared to normal

569
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:52,160
cells they use fundamentally different pathways to metabolize and if you could find a way to target

570
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,720
these metabolic alterations in cancer cells you'd find an anti-cancer drug so but that question has

571
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,600
been hanging around our field for a long time and as our understanding of normal metabolism has

572
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:10,720
changed we've begun to identify not just one but dozens of nutrient pathways that cancers use that

573
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,720
may or may not be different from normal cells maybe slightly different from normal cells maybe

574
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,720
a lot different from normal cells so that's one big question the second question which is a slightly

575
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,120
narrower question is that when you give a drug whatever drug it might be your favorite chemotherapy

576
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,520
or favorite drug any drug does it change the metabolism of the cancer cell and does it change

577
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,800
the metabolism of the body and could this be a mechanism by which cancer cells become sensitive

578
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,680
or resistance to chemotherapy so these are two related questions again to reiterate one question

579
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,760
is how is the cancer cells metabolism different from the normal cell in normal circumstances

580
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,480
and the second question is how is the cancer cells metabolism differ from a normal cell in

581
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,200
the context of giving a drug yeah in other words can a nutritional state be exploited and or a drug

582
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,440
sensitivity be exploited through a nutritional care I'm sure those are the two questions so we focused

583
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,320
in this particular study we actually are interested in both I'm interested in both but we focused on

584
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,080
the second question and the second question in this particular case was that there was a very

585
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:18,160
promising group of medicines that was being used in clinic in fact I had used them as a trialist

586
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,600
they had come really out of Lou Cantley's path defining work he had defined the pathway or the

587
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,520
signals that these medicines attack and there was an enormous amount of optimism because this was

588
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,920
considered a fundamental pathway this is the beauty by the way of being in a place like New York or

589
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,200
Boston it's you can talk about someone doing this I mean Lou is in Boston when much of this work is

590
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,520
done he's now here in New York and you don't have to collaborate with a guy across the world you

591
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,360
collaborate with the guys on the Upper East Side instead of Chelsea that's right so Lou's work over

592
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,480
the last decades had been to define this pathway and ultimately led to the formation of the creation

593
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,680
of these new medicines they're called PI3 kinase inhibitors and they go by fancy names like duvelosib

594
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:06,480
and things like that but anyway when they came to clinic surprisingly there were some responses

595
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,800
but there was a lot of resistance in patients that tumors were resistant to the drugs and didn't

596
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,960
respond and that was a puzzle that Lou had come up with in his own work and then separately seven

597
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,440
miles uptown I was scratching my head about the same puzzle because I'd been using these same drugs

598
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,960
in cancer patients and finding that patients became resistant or were resistant to start

599
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:36,880
and so what was chalked out that on a napkin that evening was we had thought of lots of ways that

600
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,960
these patients had could become resistant we had thought oh maybe the tumor had a mutation

601
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,120
well and there's one other point I guess to add just that we remember but maybe it's worth

602
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,560
reiterating is a lot of the patients that were on these began to develop phenotype like they

603
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,760
looked like they were diabetic yeah so that's the point that I was coming to in a second we didn't

604
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,200
know if that meant that that was the source of the resistance that's right was it true true and

605
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,880
unrelated yeah the question was was it true true and unrelated I mean you can think of many other

606
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,520
mechanisms of resistance you can say the tumors became it got a mutation you could say the host

607
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,920
had some problem you could write down on the piece of paper thousand ways those were the traditional

608
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,600
ways that one would explain resistance the traditional ways of thinking about tumor resistance

609
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,880
mutation the host eats up the drug the non-traditional way and this is what the

610
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,560
innovation in the study was that what if there's diabetes that we were observing the high levels

611
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,800
of sugar and the high levels of insulin insulin being the most important piece of this what if

612
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,880
the drug was causing diabetes separately from the tumor given to normal people that the drug would

613
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,240
cause diabetes in some people worse than others and that diabetic phenotype that diabetic state

614
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,800
the hyperinsulinemic state was being used or exploited by the tumor to essentially become

615
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,080
resistant to the drug it's a little bit like in the analogy that I drew I remember on the napkin

616
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,120
it's funny I still remember the table we said I remember the table yeah exactly right the drawing

617
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,720
so Lou and I were batting this idea back and forth while you you were eating nothing

618
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,080
and the idea was that to me reminded me of the famous story of the woodcutter who's sitting on

619
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:14,000
a tree limb and chops off his own limb and falls down and I drew this picture I remember of the

620
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,080
woodcutter on a tree limb because what happens is that the body mounts an insulinemic response

621
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:25,840
to the drug that insulinemic response goes to the cancer and starts feeding the cancer

622
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,760
and then the cancer becomes resistant so you essentially undo all the good that you've done

623
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,520
with the drug by cutting off your own limb because of this intrinsic circuit and the long and short of

624
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,000
it is that that's basically an animal models that happens to be true so we showed it using

625
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,720
formal systems and formal methods that this insulinemia is a consequence of the drug has

626
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,240
nothing to do with the tumor has nothing to do with anything else if you give the drug the drug

627
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,680
goes into the liver and the pancreas and causes a sort of a pre-diabetic state that's often worsened

628
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,520
that if you're already in a pre-diabetic state this hyperinsulinemia is used then by the tumor

629
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,480
to become resistant even while the drug is present it becomes a pathway by which the tumor

630
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,480
becomes resistant and most interestingly that you can paralyze this resistance by putting

631
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,640
animals on a ketogenic diet so basically there's never any sugar source to drive the insulin you

632
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,160
blunt the insulin response so acutely that you can no longer get the insulin high again this is not

633
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,200
to be confused with with the idea that this is a sugar feeding tumor idea this is not a sugar

634
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:33,840
feeding tumor paradigm because to be clear on a ketogenic diet your glucose levels might go down

635
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:39,440
from normal but it's not an enormous reduction even in a complete fast you'll still maintain at

636
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,480
least three millimolar of glucose it's the insulin that becomes virtually unmeasurable that's right so

637
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,440
this is an insulin feeding the tumor question and so i think there are three points that need to be

638
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,400
made about the study to be very clear first of all it's an animal study we're now launching a human

639
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,760
study that will launch in november with patients with lymphomas endometrial cancer and breast cancer

640
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,600
particularly triple negative breast cancer i'm very keen on studying because this is a cancer

641
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,840
that has so few options that's right there are very very few options so that's the human study

642
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:12,160
the second point that is worthwhile making is that it's sort of like folks don't try this at home

643
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,800
this is a very particular study with a very particular drug on cancers combined with a diet

644
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:24,240
the study only worked when the drug and the diet were combined it does not mean that the ketogenic

645
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,920
diet is going to prevent cancer we don't know this it's an open question we're actually studying that

646
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,840
separately yeah and i want to talk just a little bit about that paper because that's boy i sure

647
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:36,000
want everyone to make sure they hear that loud and clear because few things upset me more than

648
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,160
when i spend a little too much time on twitter and i come across people who seem to want to claim

649
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,560
that if you're on a ketogenic diet you can't get cancer or if you have cancer just go on a ketogenic

650
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,480
diet you're going to be fine that's not in fact to be very clear well the study in fact demonstrated

651
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,400
that that was not the case not only that the study also demonstrates that some cancer models

652
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:59,040
including leukemia is accelerated on the keto diet in fact we have a big follow-up study to try to

653
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,440
figure out why some cancers are accelerated by keto alone but when you combine it with the drug

654
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,880
they actually go back down into deep remission the third point to make is that it seems to be

655
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:15,360
mutation agnostic and that by that i mean this is a very important idea which is that 12 tumor models

656
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:21,920
responded 12 i was not aware that it was that high yeah 12 and actually all 12 that we tested

657
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,040
responded every one of them responded and it didn't matter what oncogenes you had or what

658
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,240
tumor suppressor genes were mutated they all responded to different levels leukemia has

659
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,440
respond they become then they relapse at least in the models endometrial cancers we can't get them

660
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,080
to grow pancreatic cancers respond extremely strongly so it's another example where you're

661
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:47,280
not targeting it seems a mutation this is not like gliwek in which you're driving a

662
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,720
stake into the engine of the cancer or that engine this is a much more global yeah it seems yeah it's

663
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,880
a much more global assault in fact in some ways it's parallel akin to this immunotherapy in the

664
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,040
sense that it the immune system doesn't care if you have rass or doesn't seem to care at the first

665
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,320
approximation whether you have a mutation in one gene or another gene rass or not rass it will kill

666
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,520
the tumor cells based on its characteristics of what it sees in the tumor similarly here the

667
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,040
the metabolism seems to be tumor-wide but not single kinds of cancer specific we don't know this

668
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,240
to be the case the 13th model that we try will maybe this was the one that won't work but this

669
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,480
has generated a lot of excitement for this reason you know i have a friend who has definitely her

670
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,440
two new positive maybe er positive pr negative but has stage four breast cancer is in a pf3k

671
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,480
inhibitor trial out of dana farber has been on the trial for probably five years she's the only

672
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,120
survivor here's the interesting thing she's been on a ketogenic low carbohydrate diet the entire

673
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,240
time while she was taking inhibitor yes okay she's still on the inhibitor and so what's interesting

674
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:55,280
is i've told lou about her case because she's fastidious in this and she's able to get her

675
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,640
hemoglobin a1c now under six which for many of those patients is very difficult very technically

676
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,840
when you me and sid had lunch once about two years ago this is the very first time you ever

677
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,680
showed me the data yeah that's right we brought a computer we were at that indian place or the

678
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,720
chinese place on second avenue that's right yeah and when you showed me those data i just immediately

679
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,280
thought of her so it's actually been on my list to introduce lou because she doesn't live in new

680
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,960
york but i would love to meet her i want to bring her out and i want you guys to meet her because

681
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,880
the combination of this p i 3k inhibitor and this dietary choice she's made going back to your second

682
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,600
rule right she's the outlier that is that is giving you something to probe yeah we hopefully

683
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,600
will have many such patients i don't know you know this is why we're running the study sid as you can

684
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,920
probably imagine i could spend another 12 hours speaking with you but i want to be respectful of

685
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,840
your time i know we're a little late in the day we got a later start than we wanted and you've got

686
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,880
a long trip home and i want you to get to see your family the last question i want to ask you really

687
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,720
is one that i need you to be a little bit immodest with which is how do you do what you do i don't

688
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:03,280
meet a lot of people that i look at and realize that on every level of their life they are better

689
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,640
than me you know usually i meet people and it's like yeah they're better at me at those three

690
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,400
things but i can do this one thing better and and i'm sure i could think of something i do better

691
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,760
than you but it's many things do you know my sense of balance i can probably shoot a bow and

692
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:22,320
arrow better than you but when i think about how you balance the devotion you have to your patients

693
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:28,560
to your family to your research to your writing it humbles me i don't know have you put any thought

694
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,960
into that the fact that you created these tenets around writing is very interesting to me it says

695
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,760
that you you weren't just a natural gifted guy that fell out of the sky who figured out how to

696
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,160
write you know you had to work at your craft yeah so how do you work at this craft of just

697
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,600
excellence in general the simple rules that i have is i'm a very question and project driven person

698
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:53,440
if i set projects i'll usually fulfill them again it's the same sort of crampon in the mountain

699
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,720
rule which is that in order to write a book you have to write the first line of the book

700
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,920
and inevitably that's not going to be the first line that survives in order to do research you

701
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,600
have to do one experiment and inevitably that experiment is going to not work out you're going

702
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:12,720
to do 10 15 iterations of it etc to me the fundamental rule that that works for me is just

703
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,440
to throw something at the world the first line the first experiment the first idea and then

704
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,280
keep at it i keep at it over and over again i come back to it i come back to it over and over again

705
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,720
and i keep asking questions and then at some point of time and that's another moment of

706
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,680
sensitivity is to figure out when the work speaks back to you the experiment starts talking back to

707
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,560
you have to be really open your ears have to be really open and that's really the skill

708
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:44,320
of a scientist i think the scientist i think has or even a writer they have really two skills and

709
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,000
that they mix together the first one is the creative step putting out the first line thinking

710
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,040
of the idea you know i'm going to write a biography of cancer i'm going to write the history of

711
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,800
genetics etc but the second one is to be open enough to realize when the work starts speaking

712
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:05,440
back to you and let that happen let the experiment start talking back to you be skeptical of it have

713
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,760
a conversation with it those i think are the two skills that i sort of bring to my puzzle the rest

714
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,280
