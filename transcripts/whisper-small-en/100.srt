Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,360
today's episode. Welcome back to another special episode of the Drive podcast where we're really

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,920
focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. My guest today is my good friend, Sam Harris. Sam's been

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,800
on the podcast in the past, as you may know, and we spend quite a bit of time on this episode

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,960
talking about really two things. One is really talking about lessons learned. I offer some

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,480
thoughts in response to Sam's questions around what I think is happening, what I think is going to

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,400
happen. And at the time of this recording, which was Monday morning, as you'll tell, I was not

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:27,200
especially optimistic, especially in New York. And again, this is less of me interviewing Sam as it

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,560
is a discussion. And then of course, we turn to talk about something that I think is equally

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,040
important, which is how do we, as people sitting here watching this slow motion or fast motion

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,320
train wreck in different parts of the world and different parts of the country, how do we manage

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,000
ourselves, manage our own emotions, our thoughts, and our responses to it? And some of you may have

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,120
noticed I put something up on social media last week where I just had a really, really bad day

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,160
and did a bunch of stuff that I was pretty ashamed of as a dad. And that sort of prompted part of

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,400
that discussion. So without further delay, let's get to this episode. And I think you'll enjoy the

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:14,800
discussion today with Sam. I am here with my friend, Peter Attia. Peter, you're a top flight

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,120
physician and you have a background in finance. I can't imagine you had much to think about in the

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,560
last few weeks. Yeah, very little. This has been, I'm sure everyone feels this way. This has been a

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,960
period of time unlike any other in our lifetimes. There's really no analogy. Early on, I said 9-11

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,440
was an analogy, but in truth, this is really nothing like 9-11. Yeah, I actually had the same

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,520
thought, which was, I remembered where I was during 9-11. It's obviously everybody who's old

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,440
enough can remember exactly where they were on that moment. And then of course in the hours,

30
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,720
days, and weeks that followed. But yeah, it is actually kind of different. And this has sort of

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,960
an expanding array of confusion, at least for me. And also somewhere in the back of your mind,

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:11,720
you have to realize now that between SARS-1 and MERS and now SARS-CoV-2, it's not like

33
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:21,720
coronaviruses are going away. Right. Yeah. And the idea that we are so fundamentally surprised by

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:29,560
this and caught back footed is frankly scary. Bill Gates pointed this out some weeks ago that this

35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,560
was perhaps the most predictable disaster. We knew this was coming. I think he even gave a TED talk

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,760
in 2015 on this topic. And everyone has been sounding this alarm in infectious disease for

37
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:51,960
years. And yet I'm not even sure that after this, we will allocate the appropriate resources to

38
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,960
have a network of virus detection or clamp down on the crazy bad eating practices in

39
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,280
China. I mean, I just, I feel like once this is over and we rebound and we, in the best case,

40
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,120
we have a successful antiviral treatment and a vaccine and the economy is booming again.

41
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,280
I just feel like we're ready to go to sleep on this again. It just, we appear so masochistically

42
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,200
short-sighted in the way we focus on risk. I just, I'm to say nothing of our inability to think about

43
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,640
something like climate change in light of what's going on here. I mean, just the idea that a slow

44
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,200
moving emergency is something we could orient to when we can't even get our head together,

45
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,240
when we have Italians Skyping us and giving TV interviews where they're bursting into tears,

46
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,240
telling us about what's coming. And we're still debating whether we can keep Disney world open.

47
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,720
Yeah. It is sort of sad when you put it that way, because it's sort of like the marshmallow

48
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,200
problem. Everybody knows, which is most of us really aren't wired to make short-term concessions

49
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:10,600
in exchange for long-term payoffs. And this one is not that hard because it's only a few years in

50
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,680
the future. In other words, it's within our lifetime. It would be hard to make the case that

51
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,480
within our lifetime we won't experience this again. Whereas presumably one can say, well,

52
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,920
climate change is still from a disaster standpoint, 50 years away. The analogy to climate change is

53
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,640
interesting to me because it is still abstract. The promise of disaster is still something that

54
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,560
seems debatable to many people, even most people. It is hypothetical. It's based on models.

55
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,480
We can see it sort of arriving, but even there we can't attribute any one storm or any one heat

56
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:55,640
wave to climate change in any rigorous sense. But in this case, we see the wave of contagion

57
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,120
crashing on the hospitals in the countries of Europe. We're literally getting... We see the

58
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,640
faces of doctors who in their all too infrequent downtime are telling us what's happening. And

59
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,640
I just... I see this through the lens of my personal relationships a lot now because I

60
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:23,080
have a range of people in my life who have different enough information diets and

61
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:32,200
political convictions and economic biases and incentives that lead the confirmation bias knobs

62
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,880
to be tuned differently. And so I've spent a lot of time having to convince people one to one

63
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,000
to take this seriously. And it's been an amazing experience because these are by and large very

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,440
smart people and you can show them the article that just got under your skin and it doesn't work

65
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,520
and or at least doesn't work as I think it should. And so it's just been very interesting to see the

66
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,040
layers of denial and obfuscation present themselves and to have to punch through them.

67
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,080
Even in oneself, I just noticed it's been disorienting to look back over the course of a week

68
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,720
where a week now seems like it's about a year long and see what was at the beginning of the week

69
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:31,480
felt to be kind of an extreme measure or a pessimistic hot take now seem like, oh, okay,

70
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,640
that was... I'm glad I was on the threshold of being rational then. I seem a little late

71
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,160
in retrospect. It's just psychologically it's very interesting to watch. Yeah, you're right. I was

72
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,880
saying to my wife recently that each day seems to take... They just go by so quickly but...

73
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,120
Because it seems like I'm doing the same thing every day. There's no difference between Sunday,

74
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,520
Monday, Tuesday, Saturday. Right. It's all Wednesday. It's just all the same day, every day. And it

75
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:06,920
goes by at alarming pace. But week to week when I think about last Monday or two Mondays ago,

76
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,720
we were on our second day of quarantine. That seems like months ago to your point.

77
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,600
You know, I want to go back to something you said a second ago because it's something I've been

78
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,920
struggling with, which is another challenge that is unique to the human condition. So if we

79
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,480
struggle with appropriate discounting, I think we also struggle with understanding

80
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,280
how to put uncertainty bounds on estimates. You've probably played this game before. It's a fun game

81
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,640
to play where you take 20 questions for which there are known answers and you ask a person

82
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:48,920
each question and you say, look, give me a range that has a 95% confidence that it contains the

83
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,400
answer to this question. And after 20 of these questions, they should have correctly captured

84
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,520
the answer within their range 19 out of 20 times. I've never seen anybody who can get close to it,

85
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,480
by the way. Because they're really hard facts like, what is the distance from the sun to Mars?

86
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,760
Most people wouldn't know that off the top of their head. And you sort of say, well, it's between

87
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,680
this many miles and that many miles. And so it sort of speaks to, I think, one of the challenges

88
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:25,240
of communicating things like climate change and pandemics to people, because error bars aren't a

89
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,880
sexy part of scientific communication to the lay person. But there's sort of nothing that you can

90
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,440
talk about as a projection, let alone a measurement in science where it's backwards looking that

91
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:46,360
doesn't have an error bar on it. And yet, so much of what we talk about is binary. It's on this date,

92
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,440
New York hospitals will be overrun. We're going to see this many cases with this percentage of them

93
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,480
being fatal. But if we sort of force ourselves, and I'm just as guilty of this, by the way, as anybody,

94
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,360
because it's just good shorthand to be able to rattle off numbers. But if you really had to start

95
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,960
putting error bars on those things, like, well, we're 90 or 95% confident that it's this to this,

96
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,600
I think that would be a better way to communicate this stuff. And I think it would be a little less

97
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:21,400
alienating to people who are more naturally skeptical. Yeah, and there might be a role for

98
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,680
something like betting markets and prediction markets. And just when you put things in terms

99
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:34,040
of bets for people, it, it sharpens up their, their sense of probability. I've actually found myself

100
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,840
consciously anchored to some clearly unscientific ways of thinking that have strangely seemed

101
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,640
useful. One of the reasons why I feel like I've been a few memes here, which have, which I think

102
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,000
have been frankly confusing for people. And one is the flu is worse than coronavirus. It's either

103
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,400
just like the flu or the flu is worse. The flu kills 50,000 people a year in the US rather often.

104
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,880
And if we were tracking that on an hourly basis, we would be, we would never leave our houses.

105
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,960
And the flu kills kids too, rather often. So we've now been enrolled in this vast

106
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,920
social panic delusion, and we're just not seeing it. And so the analogy to the flu,

107
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,880
among those who use it, it seems to be totally clarifying. And yet it has always struck me as

108
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:39,880
just flat wrong. And it has by a sheer accident, which has just primed in me, it was just a starkly

109
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,960
unscientific way of thinking about this, which is I just happened to know one person who caught the

110
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,600
virus fairly early. One of the guys who got it in Italy and came back to Los Angeles among a group

111
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,120
of, I think it was 13 skiers. I knew a guy who was in a group of five of them. And he and at least

112
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,120
one of his friends quickly got sick enough to be hospitalized and then put on ventilators and in

113
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,600
induced comas. So I knew like a group of five where 40% of fairly young, I mean, 50 year old fit

114
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:22,360
guys without any comorbidities, non-smokers, 40% wound up in the ICU fighting for their lives.

115
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:30,120
This is not a statistical sample. And yet it has seemed anchored to that fact. I have just heard

116
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,480
every comparison with flu sounding delusional. And I don't even know how to characterize the

117
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,920
reasoning bias or error I'm making there, but it's actually seemed somewhat analogous to someone

118
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:54,920
saying, I've got 10,000 marbles in this urn and either 1% of them or 50% of them are black,

119
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,200
reach in and pull out a few. If you reach in and you pull out two of five being black, you feel

120
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,000
like, okay, well, I'm not quite sure what's going on in the rest of that urn, but somehow I think

121
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,600
betting on 50% sounds more reasonable. So I don't know what you think about that, but that's been

122
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:19,240
just an accident in my own view of this from now going back a few weeks. And it's changed the way

123
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,520
in which I've dealt with some of these memes that we've all been processing. I've sort of thought

124
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,360
of it a little in a slightly different way, which is there's the beast you know versus the beast you

125
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:38,680
don't. And the beast you know is pretty bad. I mean, nobody is discounting the severity of influenza,

126
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,000
but there are a couple of things to understand, which is influenza comes in a very predictable

127
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,160
wave and it has a seasonal variation to it, but that mortality that you describe, let's even just

128
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:01,160
look at the global mortality, it's spread out across a year and it's fairly uniform. So the rate

129
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:10,280
at which it is changing is not enormous. We are still in a period of nonlinear geometric slash

130
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:17,240
exponential growth, at least of new cases and by extension, therefore hospitalizations, critical

131
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,800
care hospitalizations and death. So there's no evidence yet that we are on the back side of that

132
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:33,560
curve where that has stabilized. So we don't yet know what the absolute potential for mortality is

133
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,520
from this virus because it's in its infancy. So it's sort of like there's a person who

134
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:47,960
works on a job where they make $100,000 a year plus or minus 10,000 depending on their performance

135
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,040
bonus. And then there's someone working at a startup who's making $10,000 a year but has a whole bunch

136
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,240
of equity in the company. Well, who's worth more? Well, it depends on what that equity is worth,

137
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,800
right? That could very easily dwarf the value of that $100,000 a year. And so I mean, again, maybe

138
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,720
not a great analogy, but I think you get the point, right? There is this geometric component

139
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:19,960
to this disease that is not present in influenza. And so as of today, if you could freeze the world

140
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,880
and not one more person is going to get this disease, yeah, we may look back and say this

141
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,400
was dwarfed by influenza even within a calendar year, but we can't say that. So to me, the real

142
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:43,400
point is how can we take as many steps as possible to freeze this thing selectively? And that's really

143
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,080
to me the challenge, right? As we sit here recording this today, the stock market's got to be down 30%

144
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,320
on the year, if not more. No one's going to look at this and say the cost of trying to arrest this

145
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,400
was not enormous. And there are lots of really smart people out there saying the cost was too great.

146
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,080
I really think that that's a pretty good argument. So the question is not just for this

147
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:14,600
opportunity, but for the next one, not if, but when, what is a smarter way to go about

148
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,360
locally addressing these problems without global economic calamity? Right. Yeah. And barring

149
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:30,920
a great system of monitoring and a great system of producing antivirals and vaccines, I'm not sure what

150
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,760
the fix is that protects the economy. I actually want to say a few things about this notion that

151
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,880
the cure might be worse than the disease because that's cropping up a lot now. I mean, we've been,

152
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,240
you know, you and I have been locked down for two weeks or so, but most people it's at least a week

153
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,040
less than that. And we're already hearing of this, you know, quarantine essentially beginning to fray.

154
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,840
And people are saying this is crazy. We need to find some other way of doing this. The economy is

155
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:11,880
imploding and definitely share the concern that the economic damage could be as bad or worse than

156
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,680
anything the virus can do. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm certainly worried about that. I'm worried that

157
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,160
we might tip into a depression. I'm worried about the, the loss of social cohesion that could follow

158
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,600
upon that. You know, none of that's trivial. And I think it's, we have to guard against that. And

159
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,280
hopefully the government will ram through a stimulus package that is appropriately targeted

160
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,080
and takes away the immediate pain and shores up businesses of various sizes. But it's interesting

161
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,560
to say, so when you hear the arguments of people, again, it comes back to the, often to the flu

162
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:52,120
analogy, listen, we're, we're all hiding in our houses and only a few thousand people have died

163
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,760
in the United States at this point. I mean, this is crazy. The flu has already killed 22,000 people

164
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:05,400
this year. What the hell are we doing? And there's kind of just this, this global faith that our

165
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,120
healthcare system won't be overwhelmed. We'll be able to handle it. The virus is just going to

166
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:18,360
peter out on its own by some dynamic that is just running against its apparent exponential growth.

167
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,720
It's just the, I've talked to smart people who just think there's this natural life cycle of a,

168
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,520
of a Corona virus or, you know, any cold virus that it just kind of peters out and you don't have to do

169
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,840
much of anything about it. Again, these people are not doctors or much less epidemiologists,

170
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,560
but they're smart business people who are, want to get the economy started again.

171
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,800
And one thing I would point out is that no one to my knowledge is running the opposite

172
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:56,360
program of happy talk, which is to say no one is saying as we're in our homes watching the

173
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,920
economy fall off a cliff, that there's nothing to worry about economically. I mean, listen,

174
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,240
this is businesses fail all the time. We have our chapter 11 and chapter seven laws for a reason.

175
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,000
There isn't actually any wealth destruction going on because even if the Dow goes to zero,

176
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,040
we have our buildings and our roads and our factories and our laboratories. Are you noticing

177
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,240
any of these things disappear? No, they're all there. People, it's just that there is no real

178
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,600
wealth destruction here. This is just, this is all a fantasy, right? I mean, you could say

179
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,720
something in that vein that would be analogous to the kinds of things that are being said about

180
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,960
the Corona virus so as to mollify or to attempt to mollify economic fears. But I think most people

181
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,520
would recognize that it was delusional and I haven't heard anyone say it. I mean, everyone

182
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,880
is worried about what could happen to the economy and rightly so. But is there something in your

183
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,480
cognitive toolkit around thinking about the health side of this that can help, they can

184
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,960
actually arm people who are arguing that we should just let everyone get sick, essentially. I mean,

185
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,400
keep the 80-year-olds and the 70-year-olds maybe in their houses, but let's just go out there and

186
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,840
get herd immunity. I mean, the UK was briefly on this path. I'm not sure what they're doing today,

187
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,000
but they did a 180 and maybe they're going to do a 180 back. But I just feel like the shelter in

188
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,240
place mode that most of humanity is in at the moment or at least attempting to be in is

189
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,400
beginning to unwind even only after about a week. And the idea that we're going to maintain this

190
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,920
for months, if needed, seems fairly far-fetched. So I'm wondering what you're thinking about that.

191
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,840
I'll come to that in a second, but I throw out one more analogy on why the influenza comparison

192
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,120
is not great. And unfortunately, it's got its own political ramifications to it. So it's not a great

193
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,800
analogy, but none of them are. You could almost think of influenza like the number of people who

194
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,440
die in traffic accidents every year, which is frankly a lot higher than most people realize.

195
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,960
Until you really scrutinize those data, you'd be surprised at how devastating it is,

196
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:15,080
what the odds are of a person dying in a car accident. And when 9-11 happened, a lot of people

197
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,480
said, look, why are we getting all bent? I mean, no one said this in the immediate after fact,

198
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,880
but for understandable reasons, there became a lot of political fatigue around the war on terror.

199
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,720
And a lot of people said, wait a minute, why are we doing all of this? 3,000 people died on 9-11,

200
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:36,440
and that's tragic. But do you know how many more people die in traffic accidents? And that's true,

201
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,160
but it again misses the nonlinearity of terrorism. Now, again, I'm not even here to try to broach this

202
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,040
discussion of whether our approach to a post 9-11 world was the right approach or what could have

203
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,680
been done different. But if you're, you know, a reasonable student of history, you could at least

204
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:01,960
conclude that 9-11 had to be countered with a much more severe response than just the number of lives

205
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,960
lost as tragic as that was. It's the potential for what could happen if this situation is not

206
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,240
rectified. And again, I think that's the issue here, which is not to discount how tragic influenza is,

207
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,720
because it is, but to realize how much of an unknown we're dealing with right now. And then

208
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,160
how do you balance that with there's a way to immediately put this thing to rest if you could

209
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,360
wave a magic wand, which is you shut the world down. And then of course, what's the right way

210
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,840
to thread that needle? And now to your question. Well, actually, could we linger on that one point

211
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:44,520
first? I mean, why haven't we been able to communicate that solution better than we have?

212
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:52,840
Because we know we're sort of stumbling into some mode of shutdown that risks cratering the economy.

213
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:01,560
Why hasn't anyone articulated the total lockdown that only lasts a few weeks? I mean, that just

214
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,680
seems like, let's just talk about the biology of that for a second. I mean, that barring some

215
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:15,320
crazy property of this virus that I think, I mean, I haven't heard anyone allege. If we all sheltered

216
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,240
in place for what, three weeks, this would burn itself out. I mean, you'd have the sick people

217
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:28,520
still in hospitals getting treated and recovering or not, but everyone who's got this thing,

218
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,600
if you denied them contact with anyone else, this thing would evaporate. Yeah. Maybe call it four

219
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,560
weeks to include the 95th percentile. It's a non-normal distribution, but yeah, you'd say four

220
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,000
weeks of total lockdown. You could burn this thing out. And by the way, that's effectively what

221
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,720
happened in the second wave in China. That's the best estimate of what really happened there.

222
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,800
But you see, that's a political solution, not a scientific solution. The steps that China took

223
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,360
to be able to make that happen, I just don't see how you could do in a free society like the United

224
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:13,000
States. I mean, Governor Newsom, how many days ago basically said, you got to shut this down,

225
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,360
people. Don't leave your house unless it's absolutely essential. And I mean, I just saw

226
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,640
the newspaper today. It's like people are running around the beach and playing patty cakes and doing

227
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,720
this, that and the other thing. And I'm sensitive to it. I get it. I mean, they're saying, hey,

228
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,480
I'm not going to be defeated by this thing or whatever the logic might be. It's not the approach

229
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,240
I would take. But the point is they're not even listening to the closest thing we have to a

230
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,160
directive shy of enacting the police. So I just don't think we can do it. And that gets back to

231
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,880
my point about the 95% confidence interval. I'm really starting to think that what we should have

232
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,360
been doing all along was not thinking of the United States as one homogeneous entity, but rather

233
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,760
thinking of each city as its own country. Because even within Italy, you know, I talked about this

234
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,480
on social media recently, even within Italy, it looks totally different, right? Milan to Sicily,

235
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:15,880
to Rome have not one thing in common, not one. So Milan, you had almost 2200 deaths out of 10

236
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:23,480
million people. That's a 2% mortality, not case fatality, total fatality to the population,

237
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,920
0.02%. I mean, that's staggering, right? And in Rome, 31 deaths on 6 million,

238
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:37,000
Sicily, three deaths in 5 million. So the mortality on a per population basis was 40 times higher in

239
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,720
Milan than Rome and 300 times higher in Milan than Sicily. So even within Italy, it doesn't make

240
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,640
sense to think of it as Italy is horrible. No, it's like, basically, which part of Italy got a

241
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,280
head start on this? There's all these analogies. The one I like to use is they're all cars driving

242
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,520
towards the edge of a cliff. Some of them are going faster, some of them have more people on

243
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,440
and they're heavier, some of them have worse tires, and some of them are on lousier surfaces.

244
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,920
And they apply the brakes at a different point in time. They're not all going off the cliff at the

245
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,440
same time. And some of them aren't going to go off a cliff. And so in retrospect, I wish I was smart

246
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,240
enough to think of that a month ago. I wish our policymakers had thought of that a month ago.

247
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,360
And maybe we would have had a better shot at containing this if we'd been more directed

248
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,520
towards where is there going to be grotesque mismatches between supply and demand. And

249
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,560
obviously, New York is now that is unambiguously the case in New York as of right now.

250
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:42,520
Right. So we're recording this on Monday the 23rd. And yeah, I think we're all expecting to learn a

251
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,520
lot from the experience in New York over the course of the next week. What's your sense of

252
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,480
the likelihood that we're going to discover that New York at least is much more like Italy than

253
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,160
it is like South Korea?

254
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,680
Well, and again, I would say Milan more than anything else in Italy. So we've built a couple

255
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,720
of models on this. And then we've even had we've been really fortunate that some really great

256
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,120
inbound people have just come to us and shared their models and then let us put our assumption

257
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,320
there and theirs and vice versa. What kind of comes down to the following? How many people

258
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:25,320
in New York do we know are positive? And as of this morning, the most conservative estimate I

259
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,920
can find is about just under 11,000. And that's probably what we're where we were last night.

260
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,640
So it's probably closer to 12,000 based on something Cuomo said this morning.

261
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,000
Okay, so that's how many people we know have the infection. So then the first question is,

262
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,920
what is the population that is infected for whom yet we don't have confirmation? So in other words,

263
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,400
what's the known to unknown positives? This is where lots of models are spitting out unbelievable

264
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,080
numbers. And they're based on several different things. They're based on looking at historical

265
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,840
data within New York. And looking at what is the number of people in the hospital tell you as a

266
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,800
leading indicator for the lag on infection. They're also based on the Wuhan data. So we have a very

267
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:21,240
clear case of the up and down cycle of infections in China. And so we are basically modeling

268
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:30,920
approximations based on at any point in time, when you go t minus 1234567 days, what did you see in

269
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,160
the past that helps you understand the future? Now the problem with this before I go any further,

270
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,760
Sam, as you know, is you can't just use straight up linear regression to solve this problem,

271
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:47,960
because if you do, you need a new model for every day, because there's just no linear extrapolation

272
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,280
from across the span of say, five days, it just doesn't work that way. It's changing way too

273
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,280
quickly. You use these things called vintage models. And then you start to have to look at

274
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,760
first and second derivatives of change and things like that. So then we pivot to another question.

275
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,960
So that whole series of questioning tries to get at the situation of what is going to be the number

276
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,320
of infected people. And by the way, I've thrown in some really conservative estimates, which is

277
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:18,920
take our not to zero. In other words, pretend for a moment that you have enacted draconian enough

278
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,320
measures that not one more person in New York, who's infected will infect another person. Now,

279
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,440
is that true? Based on what my friends in New York who are looking out their windows are telling me,

280
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,040
not a chance. But I like to sometimes play the what you have to believe game, which is let's make

281
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:43,560
it as good as it gets. Before we go down that path, what do we think makes New York such a

282
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,480
hotspot here? Is it the fact that this is just urban density and a very active subway system?

283
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,840
And what would you attribute the problem to in New York? I think it's everything, including that

284
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,880
and bad luck. I don't think there's anything about Milan that makes it any better or worse than Rome.

285
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,920
So I reject the idea that the climate in Milan is more suitable for this than Rome. I think that's

286
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:11,480
just noise. I think the issue is bad luck. So it's this is a stochastic problem. People were

287
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,120
going to distribute from the epicenter of infection to different places. And they got there at different

288
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:23,400
periods of time. And again, the growth is so nonlinear that if one city got a 10 day head start

289
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,840
over another, it's a totally different world. Because remember, the other cities get to see

290
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,960
that response and enact measures to slow it down. In other words, everybody's generally applying the

291
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,720
brakes at the same time. But imagine if one person had a one minute head start of pushing

292
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,760
on the accelerator towards the cliff. We need a different analogy for what goes down in Florida

293
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,200
when they get to preview everyone's horror, then declare their world open for spring break.

294
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,480
Yeah, well, no, but that's the person who watches everybody apply the brakes and says,

295
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,400
somehow I'm immune because I have a parachute on my car. Yeah, maybe I can fly. So I think New York

296
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,360
just had a bad head start. And then it's the perfect storm of population density,

297
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,720
subways and proximity. And truthfully, I mean, based on what I'm hearing from everybody I know

298
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,520
in New York, there's a little bit of a cultural difference as well. Right? A little bit of a, hey,

299
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,160
we're New York, right? Like we've got this thing, we survived 9-11. This thing is not going to be

300
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:29,640
that bad. So sort of a whatever all of these things sort of combine, I think to just have

301
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,280
enough kindling and oxygen and fuel to make this thing have burned from a little bit of a,

302
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,880
you know, a dull ember into kind of a big fire. So that's the supply side of the equation.

303
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,000
So you're giving me an R naught of zero. Yes, I'm giving you an R naught of zero. And I'm saying,

304
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,960
what's the most conservative estimate for how many people are infected relative in total relative

305
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,120
to the ones that we know. And I've never seen an estimate that's more conservative than 5X. So for

306
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,440
every person who we know is infected, only 5X more are actually infected. So that would place

307
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,200
your New York infections at 50,000 people by the most conservative estimate. By the way,

308
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,720
the estimates that I've seen range from 5 to 40X. So let's just take the lower bound, the 5X.

309
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:24,120
R naught is zero. That's 50,000 people are infected. Now we ask the question, how many of

310
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,200
those people require an ICU? And I think that's the more important question than how many of those

311
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,480
people require a hospital bed, because we can makeshift hospital beds pretty well. ICUs are

312
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,440
a little harder to makeshift. So let's start on the availability. So the stock number of ICU beds

313
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,840
in New York City, which basically is going to service not just New York City, but the Hamptons

314
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,440
going to service the surrounding area, you've got at baseline about a thousand ICU beds. Now we've

315
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,400
estimated from discussions, we basically know people at almost every hospital, directly and

316
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:02,120
indirectly. We think they can repurpose 2000 beds. So you could take all the surgical ICUs and say,

317
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,080
we're not doing elective surgery. So let's repurpose those and get those ready for medical

318
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,400
and pulmonary ICU. You're still going to probably occupy 25% of your beds for non-COVID patients.

319
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,040
Remember, people still have heart attacks and strokes and the things that require ICU care.

320
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:25,880
So let's say you've got 1500 ICU beds, and maybe you can stretch this up to 2000

321
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,160
from a capacity standpoint, because you can start to double ventilate patients that are of the same

322
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:37,400
size that have the same ventilator requirement. So now you then ask the question, how many of those

323
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,040
at a minimum 50,000 patients who were infected, not growing at all, how many require an ICU?

324
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:51,800
Well, if you look at everything in Italy, it's about 4.8, 4.9%. And if you look at the numbers

325
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,720
in New York today, they're almost 5%. So let's just be really conservative and say it's 4%.

326
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,440
Well, if 4% of those patients are going to require ICU care, I mean, you're already talking about

327
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,640
over 2000 beds. Yeah, you're full up already. So that when you play the what you have to believe

328
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,440
for New York not to get overwhelmed game, you really have to come up with some conservative

329
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,520
estimates. And I, we're losing faith in that game. And therefore, we think that there needs to be a

330
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:31,960
really important strategy of mitigation in New York. And that every other city, like Miami,

331
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,520
like San Francisco, like Los Angeles, and like Seattle, who are next in the crosshairs,

332
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,440
needs to be pushing the brakes a little harder. And also thinking about how you would bolster

333
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,280
capacity should the unknown to known infections be higher than we're estimating.

334
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,120
Do you think we're going to get a good sense of the mortality associated with all of the other

335
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:02,920
non-COVID conditions that got shoved aside or otherwise handled badly in the wake of this?

336
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,880
So you have people who are electing to delay cancer surgeries, say, or, or as you say,

337
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,040
they have routine or more routine emergencies like strokes and heart attacks. And either they

338
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:22,040
are reluctant to go to the hospital, or they go and the beds aren't there. I mean, is that,

339
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:29,080
is that all being modeled? We have not been looking at that internally. I trust that it will be looked

340
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,160
at. And I mean, I've seen it indirectly just through our patients, right? I'll give you the

341
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,760
silliest example, which is not life threatening, but we haven't drawn labs on a patient in two

342
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,320
weeks. And I don't know when the next time is that we will draw labs on a patient. Okay. That's a

343
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,480
trivial example, but you start to think about what can and can't be done. We've got two patients

344
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,200
that are in need of a dental procedure right now. One of them chipped his tooth and needs a root

345
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,280
canal. We're kind of on the fence about whether or not he should go and do that right now.

346
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,080
Yeah. Yeah. No, I've been thinking about that just personally when I see what,

347
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,520
just how we live and how other people live and what we let our kids do. I mean, I just,

348
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,720
basically viewing everything that runs any risk of physical injury as we're sort of out in the

349
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,960
wilderness right now, not close to a hospital. And because, you know, we don't want to go to a

350
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,120
hospital unless absolutely necessary. So I want to do those things or not do those things that

351
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,360
I wouldn't want to do if I were a thousand miles away from medical attention. Yeah. I'm just

352
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:37,720
thinking about like, we just got a puppy, God, like maybe four or five weeks ago. And I mean,

353
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,240
she's as cute as all hell, but she didn't finish her vaccinations. I'm just worried like, Oh God,

354
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,440
I hope nothing goes wrong with her because I sure as hell don't want to have to go and take her out

355
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,760
to the vet. And secondly, I have two young kids. Two of my three kids are in that age group where

356
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,840
they can do really stupid things and get bit by dogs. If you're not watching them, they can yank

357
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,680
a dog's tail or do something dumb. And so, I mean, that's constantly in the back of my mind, which is

358
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,560
watching those kids like a hawk when they're with her. Because if one of them gets bit by her,

359
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,280
yeah, we're going to the urgent care. I'd rather do a root canal on myself right now than have to

360
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,960
take one of my kids into urgent care to get some IV antibiotics for a significant dog bite.

361
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,560
Yeah. Yeah. No, and it's amazing to see people who are not, or apparently not making any of those

362
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,960
accommodations. You know, I've seen people, because you can obviously get out of your house and we're

363
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,040
not locked down in that sense. It's not crazy to be out hiking or as long as you can stay away from

364
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:45,720
people. But seeing people mountain bike and just picturing all the people who take a fall on a

365
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,160
mountain bike or one of these scooters, then having to deal with the aftermath. And you just,

366
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,840
you know, why add that to the risk profile at the moment?

367
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,080
I mean, yeah, I'm embarrassed to admit the number of times a day I do that calculation with

368
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,360
everything I'm doing of don't let this be the moment you break something and have to go in and

369
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:13,000
get taken care of. So I want to pivot to something else, Sam, because by the way, you and I could have

370
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,760
this discussion an hour every day and it never gets old to me. But there's something I want to

371
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,720
pivot to where just on a personal level could use your help. And I know a lot of other people can as

372
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,640
well, which is our minds are running amok at the moment. And there are a few people who I think

373
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:40,200
have been able to articulate the nature of the mind and how we are not our thoughts. And yet

374
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,520
right now, so many of my thoughts are unpleasant. They've permeated my dreams. I've never had more

375
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,360
sort of disturbing dreams than I've had in the last two weeks, I think. And they're not always

376
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,360
related to this, but they're just disturbing dreams in general. And I know that part of that

377
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:06,040
is my mind playing out anxiety as I sleep. How have you dealt with that? As you know, based on

378
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:15,240
having spent many years practicing meditation and seeing the mind through that lens, I have

379
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:24,680
some tools which I now default to, which are incredibly helpful. So if you understand

380
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,480
the mechanics of your own mental suffering, if you understand how anxiety arises from the first

381
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:38,760
person side, I mean, not understanding it as a matter of neurophysiology, but just actually

382
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:45,560
able to witness it as a matter of experience moment to moment, that allows you to get off the

383
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:53,160
ride whenever you can remember to. Now the devil's in the details of just how infrequently you managed

384
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,960
to do that, depending on how much this skill has been ingrained in you. But, and there really is,

385
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,680
for most of us, there's no alternative but to practice it. First you have to learn it,

386
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,040
and then you have to practice it. And then it becomes somewhat like any physical skill. If

387
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,720
someone who is completely untrained and unfit, and you put them in the gym, and they have a fair

388
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,440
amount of work to do to get even anything that's sort of acceptable in terms of fitness and

389
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,280
preparation for real physical stress. And then you have people who, they're Olympic athletes, or

390
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,360
they're jujitsu world champions, or they're people who have taken some domain of physical training to

391
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:42,840
a point where their default setting physically under stress is amazingly different than people

392
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:49,880
tend to be. And there is a mental component to that. It's possible to be really resilient.

393
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,520
Obviously, I don't count myself among the super athletes here, but I've done enough practice so

394
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:04,040
that when my wheels begin to spin and I'm suffering unnecessarily, whether it's from anxiety

395
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:10,760
or some other negative emotion, I can let it go. If it's pointed out to me by someone else, or I

396
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,360
just happen to notice it, I can drop the problem. That doesn't mean I don't pick it up again. I mean,

397
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:22,200
then the thoughts come back and you don't notice them, and it just feels like you worrying about

398
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,080
getting sick in the middle of the night or whatever it is. But the question is, how long

399
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:35,800
does it take to puncture that with a clear scene of the nature of mind? And for me, progress really

400
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,200
is a matter of, it's not a matter of banishing any particular emotion or pattern of thought

401
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,880
from your experience for all time. I mean, that's an unrealistic goal. It's a matter of getting

402
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:56,280
more and more agile in the face of these arising thoughts and emotions so that their time course

403
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,240
is drastically shortened, or at least the time it takes you to puncture them by, in this case,

404
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:11,240
the state of mind would be called mindfulness. But mindfulness really is just clear attention

405
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:17,640
to what experience is like in the present. It's not some mystical piece of software that you

406
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:24,200
have to get downloaded into you that you don't have. It actually is just a non-distracted,

407
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:30,840
non-reactive, clear scene of, let's say, the physiology of anxiety, I mean, just feeling the

408
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:37,160
energy in your body of anxiety. The moment you can merely feel it without judgment, without

409
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:43,880
reaction, without contraction, without thinking about all the reasons why it's intolerable or

410
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,240
thinking more about the reasons why it's justified, if you just become willing to feel it in the

411
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:56,040
moment, it loses its psychological content. For the moment you can merely feel it, it has no more

412
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:03,720
psychological content than any other analogous feeling in the body does, indigestion or pain in

413
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,760
your back or itching on the surface of your skin. I mean, all of these things can be unpleasant,

414
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:16,200
but they don't mean anything really, or at least it's a further action of thought to link them up

415
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,560
with some future state of the body or the world which cashes out their meaning. So anyway, I was

416
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,560
going to talk more about what mindfulness actually is and how to practice it, but that's how I view

417
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:33,560
this ongoing experience. I keep puncturing it with just clear attention and it really does help,

418
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,120
no question. You said something on one of your podcasts, I think it was last week, you said it,

419
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,720
I'm paraphrasing, but look, it's not about getting rid of fear, but rather kind of letting an emotion

420
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,520
like fear go when it no longer serves its purpose. Yeah, I mean, you want to feel fear when it's

421
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:58,200
appropriate and useful to feel it and you want to be able to release it the moment there's no point

422
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:07,640
to it. And the punchline here though is that 95%, 99%, I mean, the vast majority of moments in which

423
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:17,880
we feel fear or anxiety or shame or regret or any classically negative emotion, most of those

424
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,440
moments are wasted. I mean, most of those moments, in most of those moments, the negative emotion is

425
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:31,160
driving us to no good purpose. In fact, it's actually undermining our ability to recognize

426
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:37,640
the happiness we're capable of in this moment because in fact, nothing is wrong in this moment.

427
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:45,480
So it's great to feel anxious when it's goading you to do something useful, but as a goad,

428
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,880
its utility is delivered in those first few moments very often. I mean, is it the boundary of

429
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,800
sort of the known and the unknown where you're trying to figure out what to do? I mean, around

430
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,720
this COVID pandemic, I'm feeling anxiety when I don't know what I should be doing. How do we get

431
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,360
groceries into the house? What should I be doing there? I mean, do we eat salad anymore or is this a

432
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:16,200
vector for disease? How do I wipe down a box or do I wipe down a box that was just delivered?

433
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,440
How long does the virus live on cardboard? How long does it live inside a box that I open?

434
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,880
Now I'm taking something that's packaged in plastic out of that box.

435
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:33,320
Am I a lunatic for thinking any of these thoughts? All of that uncertainty is the basis for a

436
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,480
durable state of anxiety, but once I figure out what I think is true and what I should be doing,

437
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,400
well, then there is no utility to the anxiety. Then just do the thing you think you should be doing

438
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,320
and the moment uncertainty re-imposes itself, the moment I read an article which says, oh,

439
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:58,120
actually, you know, coronavirus can get in in this other way that you hadn't been accounting for.

440
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:04,680
Well, then, okay, then I'll get anxious over that, but only for as long as it takes me to decide

441
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,600
what my new policy is. And you can either do something about it or not. If you can do something

442
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:16,760
about it, the anxiety is pointless. I mean, it should have a very short half-life. And the truth

443
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,120
is if you can't do something about it, the anxiety is pointless and should have a short half-life.

444
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,400
So in either case, you want this punctate experience of what's essentially an orienting

445
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,640
response to danger and that the dangers are real. This is not a cartoon we're in. We're making

446
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,000
potentially life and death decisions for ourselves and other people, but you don't have to remain in

447
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,280
this state of anxiety, even if these decisions are actually very significant. Yeah, there aren't

448
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:55,000
many examples I can point to in the last two or three years, which is about the period of time

449
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,920
that I've been familiar with mindfulness-based meditation, where it's been more true to realize

450
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:10,760
that what's happening in the moment is rarely that bad. But what's going on in my mind is often

451
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,800
much worse. And in the case of what's happening now, it's usually more forward-looking than

452
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,720
backwards-looking. Obviously, there are periods in our lives when we can suffer more based on the

453
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,800
backwards-looking emotions that tend to be more depressive and dysthemic. But here, it's really

454
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,560
this forward-looking anxiety that can be devastating. And yet, I put something up on Twitter the other

455
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:39,160
day and I was like, you know, it sort of occurred to me that I had just reached my new record in 12

456
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,520
years, longest period of time not traveling. And it's sort of funny because you're not going to

457
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,040
meet someone who hates traveling more than me, Sam. I hate it. I hate airplanes. I hate airports.

458
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:55,800
I hate being away from my home. And for someone who hates it so much, I do it an awful lot. And so

459
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,480
for all the uncertainty and everything that's going on right now, it's been a long time and it might

460
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,160
be a long time before I travel again. There's huge value in that. And certainly, if I appreciate it

461
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:14,680
in the moment that I'm in, and yet so often I'm hijacked by my fear of uncertainty.

462
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,960
Yeah. Well, I mean, one thing you're pointing to there are the many silver linings that

463
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:26,840
many of us have found in this circumstance. And people are reporting this on social media,

464
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:35,000
just listing the things that are surprisingly nice about quarantine, essentially. And the general

465
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,480
circumstance, the reason why we're all doing this isn't nice. But yeah, many people are discovering

466
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:48,760
that there's a kind of a hard reset of their value system. And they're spending more time with family.

467
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,680
And then there's quality time of a sort that they haven't touched before or haven't touched in a long

468
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:01,560
time. I totally share the less travel epiphany. I mean, it's just, I sort of had that even before

469
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,760
this and decided to just cancel a lot of travel and just in general, I like it about as much as

470
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:14,920
you do. But yeah, there's especially for those of us who are so fortunate to more or less be able to

471
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:23,160
do what we were doing before from home in isolation. I mean, obviously there are people for whom

472
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,800
their careers were completely zeroed out the moment they were told to stay home.

473
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,320
And there's a ton of financial anxiety that comes with that. And everyone's feeling the

474
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,240
financial anxiety to some degree. But some of us, I count myself among the luckiest here,

475
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,560
were in a position to just either where everything was already distributed or we were in a position

476
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:53,720
to make it distributed without really missing a step. And that's just sheer luck in many cases,

477
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,320
certain things you just can't build from home and certain things you need never even think about

478
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,440
going into an office to accomplish. So yeah, I mean, there's a lot that many of us are discovering

479
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:13,080
about just how out of balance our lives became when everything was normal. And I think it's worth,

480
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:19,720
insofar as any of those lessons seem like things we want to hold on to, it's worth taking stock of them.

481
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,960
Have your kids voiced any sort of concern about this and how have you talked with them about it?

482
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:33,000
Well, my oldest is 11 and she's definitely old enough to worry about it and to understand

483
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:41,800
how non-normal this situation is. My six-year-old is pretty oblivious to it. I mean, she has a

484
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,640
general sense of what we're up to, but I don't get the sense that it's making her anxious at all.

485
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:54,440
I mean, as you know, the core ethic in my life and this translates into the family

486
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:02,680
is honesty. My daughters know that we will never lie to them and we never find ourselves having

487
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,960
to lie to them, but that doesn't mean we tell them everything. And my oldest daughter will ask a

488
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:13,240
question to which I know she really doesn't want the answer. It's just going to make her anxious.

489
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:21,080
And so I'll basically just acknowledge in that moment that there's a door that's locked, that

490
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:26,040
she's trying to open, but there's no point in opening it. I'll tell her what she needs to know

491
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:31,800
there. And that's not the same thing as saying, oh, there's nothing to worry about or giving her some

492
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,520
dishonest answer that totally assuages her anxiety, but it's a stronger foundation

493
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,920
for a relationship. I mean, she knows, because the thing is she knows now that when I say

494
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:50,520
something is not worth worrying about, it's not a risk or she's fine. She knows I'm not

495
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,960
bullshitting her. And in other moments where I can't say that, honestly, I don't say it

496
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:02,920
dishonestly. I just give her more of the attempt to give her more of the adult grade tools of

497
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,920
dealing with probability and risk and whether it's working or not, I mean, I don't have the

498
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,680
counterfactual to go on, but at the very least she knows we don't lie to her. And that's, to my eye,

499
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:22,360
that's a nice place to be. Have you struggled yourself with just irritability or you're one

500
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,160
of the least irritable humans I've ever met. So that's a pretty high bar for you to...

501
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,040
Tell that to my wife.

502
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,920
Well, exactly.

503
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,440
You'll get a big laugh out of her.

504
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,920
Well, that's the litmus test, right? So what would your wife say has been the impact of

505
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:41,080
the uncertainty, the fear, all of the things we've just discussed, how has that impacted

506
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:47,640
someone like you who for most of us, we would aspire to have sort of the degree of separation

507
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,880
from thought and reaction that you have through, again, years of practice?

508
00:52:52,600 --> 00:53:00,440
Yeah. Well, again, it's not that I don't get angry or anxious or uptight or have a

509
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:07,480
negative reaction to things. I do. And by tendency, I tend to be that sort of person. I mean, I'm sort

510
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:15,640
of on the anger, annoyed, pessimist channel more than, certainly more than the opposite, right?

511
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:23,000
I mean, no one has ever accused me of being too joyful or Pollyannish. So yeah, I mean,

512
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,680
I can definitely be a buzzkill and can be in a bad mood and can be irritable. The difference is that

513
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:37,320
if she calls me on it, I can actually pull the brakes or get off the ride or just whatever

514
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:44,680
metaphor you want for like the actual stoppage of the problem emotionally. And this is not a matter

515
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:52,520
of bearing down on yourself or repressing it or doing some maneuver, which just bottles up the

516
00:53:52,520 --> 00:54:00,280
rage or something. It's not that. I can actually just let it go. That's just garden variety

517
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:07,800
mindfulness taken to a certain level. In my case, it's, if you know anything about how I view

518
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:14,840
meditation practice and the nature of mind and the illusoryness of the self and free will and all

519
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:19,960
of these other nested topics. There's a pretty good app that I would recommend for people to help

520
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,200
understand how you think about some of those things. What's it called again? This conversation

521
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:30,200
is brought to you by the Waking Up app. Though we eschew sponsors on this podcast. Yeah. So,

522
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,400
so I mean, I taught, there's a lot to say about that, but the net result is it's possible to

523
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:45,320
cut through the illusion there in a way that allows you to truly stand free of whatever

524
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,360
emotional reaction you're having at that moment, whether it's anger or sadness or, or anything. And

525
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,040
you recognize that consciousness is just this open space in which everything is appearing

526
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:03,960
on its own. And there is no durable self riding around in the middle of it. There's just,

527
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:10,520
just consciousness in its contents and everything is in its own place. And, and consciousness

528
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:18,120
actually isn't even harmed by that awful mind state that you were anchored to a second ago.

529
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:24,360
There's just the energy of what used to be anger, essentially passing through and your,

530
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:31,400
your freedom from a problem in the next moment, isn't actually even predicated on that energy

531
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,280
leaving yet. It's just in fact true that when you're no longer identified with the stream of

532
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,720
angry thoughts, the peripheral physiology of anger dissipates very, very quickly. I mean,

533
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:49,320
over the course of seconds, 15 seconds at the most, whereas, and the thoughts disappear more or less

534
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:55,560
instantly. If you, if you break the spell, all of this, the time course of all of this falling off is

535
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:02,520
pretty quick. But the truth is the moment you break the spell, even while the, the body is still

536
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:09,720
incandescent with the, the physiology of anger or anxiety or whatever, you're free even in that

537
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,920
first moment. And that can take some doing to recognize that. And that's why, that's the reason

538
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,640
why one would practice meditation. But having brought your practice to that point where you

539
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:26,440
can actually do that. Yeah. I mean, the thing Annika would say about me is that I can actually,

540
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:35,320
when push comes to shove, I can stop being an asshole and I can stop on a dime whether or not,

541
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:43,080
and whether or not I do it in that moment, it can be influenced by some other factors. And so

542
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:50,520
personally, the most stressful stuff that happens for us in this situation is if we're not on the

543
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:55,480
same page with respect to something we're trying to decide. Again, I mean, we're talking about the,

544
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,960
the boundary of between the, the known and the unknown and trying to decide what we should do

545
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:08,760
about the unknown, right? So if we can't agree about whether or not, whatever, to have someone

546
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:14,520
over to the house, say under these conditions, right? Going to decide to, to have her mom over,

547
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,320
but how's her mom living? Is her mom actually locked down? Is her mom, wasn't your mom just

548
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,960
at the supermarket and told you that such and such happened? Whatever it is, I mean, this is kind of

549
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:31,560
hypothetical, but in that situation, if she is, if I'm trying to convince her to be more risk averse

550
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:39,880
than she in fact is or vice versa, that's where I'm going to tend just to get caught in my own

551
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,640
sense of urgency. Then my stress will be just largely what I'm communicating, right? And I'll

552
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:52,280
be uptight and she'll be annoyed at just how I'm having the conversation. And even in that moment,

553
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:58,760
she could, if she actually said, okay, listen, this is, we can talk about this, but I don't like who

554
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,640
you are right now. I don't like the way you're talking about this. That is something that as long

555
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:12,200
as we can keep working to solve the problem at the level of the problem, I could drop the emotional

556
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:18,200
contagion in that moment, which is an immense help. But the place where I get, what really is my

557
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:25,800
kryptonite is when the door gets closed to actually solving the problem. When I want to keep talking

558
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,840
about something or keep trying to figure, I feel like there's something to figure out. And she or

559
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:37,000
someone in the world is shutting me down there. It's very easy for me to just feel like, okay,

560
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,760
the emergency signals are still appropriate here. It would be inappropriate to be no longer anxious

561
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,400
because the house is on fire and we're fighting about whether to use the fire extinguisher.

562
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,480
But that's the exception, right? I mean, that's...

563
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:55,480
Yeah, I'm very rarely in that situation, but that's where my gears truly grind. And again,

564
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:02,440
you still want to be the person who can find the gear that allows for grace under pressure.

565
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:12,840
You do want to be the smooth Navy SEAL operator rather than the panicked grunt who's just firing

566
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:19,320
his weapon in all directions. And so there's always an argument for unhooking from the heightened

567
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,680
emotion in a situation once you're orienting to the problem.

568
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,560
You touched on something there that I think is so helpful and doesn't get enough, I think,

569
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:34,200
appreciation, which is the importance of having a spouse that understands the exercise and knows

570
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:39,320
how to help you. In my case, I mean, that's something I feel really grateful for. I posted

571
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:45,880
something on social media a week ago. It was really sad. It was actually my birthday of all days.

572
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:53,320
And the night before I had just absolutely berated my daughter for leaving the lights on.

573
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,680
She left every single light on in the hallway. It's just a dumb pet peeve of mine that normally

574
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:03,640
I just turn them off or just make some smart alec remark like, hey, Olivia, the light fairy's

575
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:09,320
not working today. Maybe you could turn the lights off. But on this day, I just went nuts. And then

576
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:15,560
the next morning, which again is my birthday, I'm on a conference call basically from six o'clock

577
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:21,080
in the morning till 10 o'clock in the morning, one call after another. And my five year old just

578
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,800
cannot understand for the life of him why I'm working on my birthday. He thinks your birthday

579
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:32,520
is the day you get to play. And he keeps trying to come in the office and play. And finally,

580
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:39,080
after like the fourth time, I just explode on him. Well, two things, right? One is not a lot

581
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:45,480
of mindfulness in that experience to you then, at least for me, you cycle into a horrible place of

582
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,720
shame, where now you are doing that backwards looking thing that we just talked about. It's

583
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,200
again, I said most of it is anxiety, but then the shame is very backwards looking equally

584
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,240
unproductive. And you sort of spoil the rest of the day, but through a different mechanism,

585
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:05,080
not by lashing out, but by detaching. And that's actually for me, my kryptonite is when I get in

586
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:12,680
that place, I just I pull back so far, and it's equally troublesome. But then fast forward to two

587
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,600
three days. And I've reflected a lot on that experience. And like, how did you get there,

588
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:26,440
man? How is it in the span of 14 hours you lose it on two kids? So yesterday, my same five year

589
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,000
old who's obsessed with Lego, and there are these train Legos that are very elaborate, they take a

590
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,480
long time to put together. And I've told him like 400 times, you got to be careful with this thing.

591
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:41,880
Well, sure enough, he drops it, it smashes into 50 pieces. And the next morning, which is Sunday

592
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,920
morning, I wake up to put it together. And I don't know if you've ever done this with Lego,

593
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,360
if you remember when you were a kid, sometimes it's just easier to take the whole thing apart,

594
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,680
all 500 pieces and start from scratch, then try to take the 50 that came off and figure out where

595
01:01:54,680 --> 01:02:01,000
they go. But lead us to say this is a ton of work. And at one point, actually pull out a video to

596
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,640
check something. And by now he's awake. And he starts yipping at me like the video is too loud,

597
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:12,360
that I'm trying to watch to fix his Lego. Admittedly, he's being totally obnoxious.

598
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,880
And I'm just about to explode on him and basically say, what do you think I've been doing here for

599
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,600
the past hour, buddy? And my wife looks at me and she goes, take a breath. And it was perfect,

600
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,000
right? I just stood up, I went over to him and I said, Reese, I don't like the way you're talking

601
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,520
right now, you're being really rude. And dad's been up for an hour before you even got up trying

602
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,800
to fix the toy you broke. So I'd appreciate it if you'd talk a little nicer. And afterwards,

603
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,640
my wife was like, look, you did it, man. Like you weren't the biggest jerk on earth. But my point is

604
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,920
she was the one who helped me there. Like, yeah, the practice that I had helps,

605
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,920
but I'm still at the point where I need that cue sometimes from somebody else

606
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:02,120
to just give me one more pause before I lose my mind. Yeah, no, that's great. That is the virtue

607
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:08,440
of certainly one of the virtues of good company and having someone who shares your values.

608
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:15,240
One thing I would add is that even when you totally screw up, you've blown up at your kids or

609
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:24,920
someone else and you're now feeling ashamed by what you did, your lack of compassion or resilience

610
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:31,800
or mindfulness or however you're judging yourself for the previous misstep, and you just feel

611
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:39,240
bad about it and bad about yourself. Again, that is no less an opportunity to cut through the

612
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:46,360
illusion of self than any other moment. It's like in this video game, that's just the next screen,

613
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:52,920
right? This is the next boss fight. Now you're fighting the boss of shame and it's no more

614
01:03:53,880 --> 01:04:02,280
real ultimately, and yet it's an appropriate... Again, like anxiety, as a signal, it can be an

615
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:08,600
appropriate guide to action. So for me, if that happens to me, if I do something that I'm

616
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:16,040
subsequently ashamed of or embarrassed by, the signal for me there is how I want to use

617
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:21,720
that information is I want to repair the relationship if I feel like I've done any

618
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:30,120
kind of damage. And therefore it becomes a goad to very likely an apology. And it's not...

619
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,520
And again, given my view of free will, I mean, it's interesting to just understand the psychology

620
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:39,240
of this because as you know, I think free will is an illusion. I think there's just makes absolutely

621
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,560
no sense to think that one could have done or should have done otherwise previous moment,

622
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:52,200
or at least thinking that isn't really thinking honestly about the past. What it is, is it's kind

623
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:58,600
of an aspirational thinking, which is in fact directed at the future. It's like, given what

624
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:06,760
just happened, I recognize that I'm not the person I want to be. I'm the person who lost his mind when,

625
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,920
you know, in this case, my kid came into the room and interrupted me during a conference call.

626
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:18,280
I'm not satisfied being that person. This person is now in my past. This person is very likely to

627
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:24,680
show up again in the future. What I want to do now is make that less likely. And also I want to

628
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:31,480
repair any damage I've done. In this case, an apology can really be healing. I don't know if

629
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:39,800
you have an experience of apologizing for these kinds of missteps and feeling that actually the

630
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:48,040
net result is in fact even better than zero. It's not just a matter of getting back to zero, but

631
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:55,480
you can actually get past zero to your, in this case, your child understands that you can get

632
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:03,160
angry and it's okay and it's okay to express it and grown-ups can apologize and the kid can be

633
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,800
empowered with their own judgment of when you were in the wrong. I mean, so like whenever I've

634
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:14,760
found myself apologizing to, this is more true of my older daughter than my younger, because again,

635
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:21,320
she's a barbarian, she's completely clueless, but my older, you know, it's like if she thinks

636
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:28,360
I'm in the wrong and she's right, that's a message I want her to be able to internalize, right? So

637
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:34,760
like if I say or do something inappropriate, it makes her feel bad and I recognize that and then

638
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:44,040
I subsequently apologize, I want her to actually take the win of having been right and having

639
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:50,520
understood the situation. Her emotions were an appropriate guide to those previous moments.

640
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:57,320
What I want to communicate in making my apology is that I was absolutely wrong and my commitment

641
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:03,000
to her is to not be that way again and if I'm that way again and she calls me on it, I'm going

642
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,160
to see that again, that I'm going to see she was right. It just seems like it's a healthy dialogue

643
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:17,160
and again, the real toxicity in all of this is in the duration over which we're caught. If this is

644
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:24,520
all happening quickly, it's fine. If it's taking hours and days and weeks and months to sort out

645
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,720
these problems, well then you have a very unhappy life. Again, it's not a matter of never feeling

646
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,080
shame again. It's just how long are you going to be stuck there? And for me, really the only tool

647
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,600
is mindfulness on that front. Yeah, which really comes back to the idea of

648
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,120
anxiety, fear can be constructive, but for most of us, they overstay their welcome.

649
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:54,360
Yeah, I would put shame in precisely that bucket because it's a very toxic emotion,

650
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:02,120
but arguably the most toxic emotion, but it's not that it's never appropriate. I don't think

651
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:07,480
you would want to mind that was incapable of shame. Incapable of shame. I mean, that is a,

652
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,840
the door to sociopathy has definitely left a jar there. I mean, even if you're,

653
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:21,720
there's some meditation masters and gurus whose talents as meditators, I really, I can't doubt,

654
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:30,760
but whose careers have completely spiraled out of control and essentially self-immolated

655
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:37,000
for precisely this reason. I mean, there's a kind of enlightened sociopathy certain people have

656
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,360
acquired and shamelessness really is, is the master variable. So far as I can tell, it's like,

657
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:50,840
there are people who have immense charisma and an immense sense of personal wellbeing

658
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:59,080
based on how much contemplative practice they've done. And they very easily attract students and

659
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:06,920
set up organizations and begin teaching. And the crucial piece is probably a doctrine that's easily

660
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:13,480
found within Buddhism and other Eastern traditions that enshrines a kind of theocratic hierarchy,

661
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:21,960
which justifies misuses of power rather often. But the shamelessness component of all of this,

662
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:28,760
it seems to me to be very, very risky if nothing else. I mean, it is the, it is the thing that is

663
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:34,360
causing the downfall or has caused the downfall of many otherwise fairly impressive people.

664
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:40,840
Yeah, there's no doubt about that. Sam, what are you most optimistic about right now? I mean,

665
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:46,120
I feel like you and I have been on the phone almost every other day for the past two weeks.

666
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:51,640
I think we were both, I think independently, frankly, came to very similar conclusions

667
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:58,760
probably three weeks ago that at the time seemed probably reactionary. A lot of the time when we

668
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:05,880
are talking, we're sort of shaking our head in a little bit of frustration over a lack of perceived

669
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:10,440
response. Is there something that you are more optimistic about today than you were

670
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:17,960
three or four days ago? Optimism bias is not a bias I have in much quantity, but I have to think

671
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:25,880
that there are certain errors of judgment that will become less common here. I mean, just what

672
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:34,760
had become very common in this prior age of the earth that existed as recently as three weeks to

673
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:41,800
a month ago is a fairly systematic denigration of expertise. The experts don't know anything.

674
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:50,200
What we need are reality TV shows, stars running the world. Actually, frankly, it's not just on the

675
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,440
right, it's on the left. I mean, when you look at the anti-vax movement, I mean, just, I don't know

676
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:00,280
how the anti-vax movement will find new adherence in the coming months and years. I mean, perhaps

677
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:08,120
I'm selling delusion short and it will, but it just, it should be just thrillingly obvious to

678
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:14,680
everyone right now, no matter what their commitment to the anti-vax movement, that what everyone wants

679
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:22,520
at this moment is a vaccine for coronavirus. I mean, this is just, there's no, how anyone could

680
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:29,080
demur on that point, I just don't know. And you're not hearing a lot from those people. I feel like

681
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:38,440
there's a certain style of imagining that we can do without science and real data and real knowledge.

682
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:44,120
And everyone with their humanities degrees can just criticize everything all the time.

683
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:50,680
And there's no difference between the people who are just making stuff up and the people who can

684
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:57,560
actually get things done in some conformity with the principles of physics, chemistry and biology,

685
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:05,160
and reality as it is at large. I feel like that has to unravel to some degree. And I'm hoping we

686
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:12,520
can secure those gains when this all blows over. But again, whether that's, whether I'm truly

687
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:17,720
optimistic about that or not, I don't know. Well, actually, I think that is actually,

688
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:22,680
that's a pretty optimistic thought, actually. I also, like you don't know how, what the half-life

689
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:31,960
is on this pain and the realization that science is important. And there are a lot of unsexy things

690
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:37,720
that we need a government to be able to do that are really convenient to forget about until you

691
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:44,440
need them. And yeah, that's the other species of myth that I think has been knocked down a peg or

692
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:51,640
two or entirely. There's just this libertarian idea in several ways. I consider myself a quasi

693
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,360
libertarian. I mean, just insofar as I think we should cede to the private sector everything that

694
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:04,280
can be best accomplished there. But it's just now painfully obvious that we need government to do

695
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:11,160
certain crucial things. And minimal government cannot be a sacred principle anymore. I mean,

696
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,320
we just, we need to figure out what we need government for, and then we should shore it up

697
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:21,480
as much as we need to on all of those fronts. And pandemics are not something that we want

698
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:28,280
a merely private piecemeal response to. Yeah, this is the perfect example of how a public-private

699
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:33,400
partnership is going to be essential. There are absolutely parts of this that are going to be best

700
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:39,320
addressed for future pandemics in the private sphere, but there are things that just the natural

701
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:44,040
owner to the risk is the government. And by the way, it's not just federal, it's local. I mean,

702
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:48,920
I think that's the other thing we're seeing is this is as much a local issue as it is a national

703
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,960
issue. It's actually probably, I think, more a local issue, frankly. And therefore, like I said,

704
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,680
it's really at the outset of the discussion. It's more relevant to me how New York handles New York

705
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:04,280
right now than what Washington tells New York. And in the future, I think that's one area where

706
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:11,640
I think we will learn that lesson. I think that I'm optimistic that in the future, cities will take

707
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:18,760
on some more of that risk stratification and planning, such that when we're waiting for the

708
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:24,600
CDC to develop a test, guess what? We're not going to wait for the CDC to develop a test because we

709
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:29,960
saw that that test was already developed in China two months earlier. We're going to procure the

710
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:35,560
test directly. I mean, little things like that. So it's sort of the, it is more of a federalist view.

711
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,040
It's like, let's kind of empower these, let's decentralize some of these things as well.

712
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:46,840
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, clearly we need to be more flexible, certainly under duress like this.

713
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:53,400
That's one thing I'm not optimistic about, but I just, it's more aspirational and has the form of a

714
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:59,160
prayer at this moment. I just think we have to capture all the lessons we're learning as we go

715
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:07,720
here. I mean, there's just so much that has gone wrong. And in most cases, it seems so unnecessary

716
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,840
to have screwed up in precisely the ways we have. And so I just feel like, I think I said this

717
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:19,320
somewhere, there should just be a Google doc for this entire crisis that people are adding to. And

718
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:28,440
because it's, yeah, it's, it's been amazing to witness. I mean, just the, the apparent thinness

719
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:36,040
of our institutions and just as you keep punching through layers of ineptitude, what is going to

720
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:41,880
actually stop the problem? It's been fascinating and unnerving to watch. And also there's a layer

721
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:49,160
of political controversy, perpetual political controversy that has interacted so unhelpfully

722
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:55,080
with this that we have an emergency and it's a healthcare emergency and now an economic

723
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:03,000
emergency, but there has been a political emergency running on top of this now for three years and

724
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:11,720
it's distorting everything. And people just have to learn to think apparently incompatible thoughts

725
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:18,680
simultaneously because they're only seeming incompatible when you're a political dogmatist.

726
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:25,720
Right? So I'll give you one example that keeps coming up. Trump is showing a, an aptitude for

727
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:32,440
weaponizing this phrase, the Chinese virus. This is a bright shiny object that he's, he's dangling

728
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:39,080
in front of Democrats so that they can seize on it and castigate him as a xenophobe or a racist

729
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:46,520
and thereby ignore all the other things he's done wrong, which are far more deplorable and

730
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:52,120
therefore politically actionable and worth campaigning on. He's dangled this truly innocuous

731
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:58,840
thing, whether he's a xenophobe or a racist or not. The reality is, is that this virus did originate

732
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:07,400
in China and it was born of absolutely bizarre and unacceptable cultural practices of eating

733
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:13,080
bats and other wild species and housing them together still living so that they can

734
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:21,480
brew up their various xenovirus cocktails. And these are based on just patently insane beliefs

735
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:29,400
about animal spirits and energies and traditional cures for whatever it is, insomnia, erectile

736
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:35,080
dysfunction or anything else that people are trying to treat with tiger bones and rhino horn and bats.

737
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:43,160
And I mean, it's all colossal and colossally dangerous bullshit and castigating the Chinese

738
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:51,480
for it is not a sign of racism or colonialism or anything else. It's self-preservation. And so

739
01:17:51,480 --> 01:18:00,600
China has to be held responsible for these shitty traditions that it hasn't managed to purge. And

740
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:06,280
undoubtedly it's not only China, but it's certainly mainly China. And on top of that,

741
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:13,480
they have an authoritarian government that tried to conceal the gravity of this outbreak and did

742
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:20,200
effectively conceal it to some degree, at least for some time and failed to give the world adequate

743
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:27,240
warning in a collaborative way that we have to figure out how to achieve globally. So Trump,

744
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:33,160
whatever he means by the Chinese virus, he would be right to mean those two things. And the world

745
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:39,240
has to get its head straight vis-a-vis China on those two points. So for the Democrats to just

746
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:46,440
cry racism and xenophobia when he uses this phrase is to utterly miss the point and to be

747
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:52,920
successfully gamed politically. But of course, what the Democrats are actually worried about

748
01:18:53,560 --> 01:19:01,400
is also obviously true and worth worrying about. It's completely insane to absorb the facts I just

749
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:09,240
put forward about China and on that basis be a xenophobe because first of all, the virus is now

750
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:15,080
global. It emerged in China, but now it's just as much the Italian virus or the New York virus.

751
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:21,320
So it's everywhere all at once. And also most Chinese people have zero responsibility for any

752
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,640
of this because they're not running their authoritarian government and they're not eating

753
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:32,920
bats. And presumably most Chinese people are as horrified by bat eating as I am. So racial

754
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:39,960
animus makes absolutely no ethical sense here. Democrats are right to worry about that. So

755
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:48,200
you can hold these truths in buffer simultaneously and not be deranged by it. But we don't have a

756
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:54,680
politics or even a journalistic community, frankly, that is showing much aptitude for that. So it's

757
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:00,200
the many needles like that that we increasingly have to thread. And whether I'm hopeful we're

758
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,920
going to do that or not, I don't know, but it's just the imperative to do it is coming to us

759
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:11,560
hourly. I am less hopeful on that one, Sam. I'm more hopeful on the, hopefully the scientific

760
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:17,080
community now has some of the ammunition it needs to make sure that we have the right type

761
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:22,840
of vaccine program in the future. Again, coronaviruses are a family of viruses. They can be

762
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:29,240
targeted with vaccines that can target both common and uncommon components to them. In other words,

763
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:34,680
there are going to be pieces that are retained throughout them. So you can have sort of antiviral

764
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:39,880
therapies that might have efficacy against a family of them. And then of course, secondarily,

765
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:44,440
there are even vaccines that look like they might have efficacy against some of those common chains

766
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:48,520
of the virus. So if I'm going to be optimistic about anything, I just have to believe we're not

767
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:55,000
going to emerge from this with our head in the sand about an approach to the next round of this,

768
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,160
which again, not what people want to hear about today, because that doesn't really address the

769
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,720
situation at hand. If I'm going to close with one thing I'm optimistic about,

770
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,480
definitely. Before you give me any happy talk, let me drive you further into the darkness.

771
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:21,080
What are the prospects in your view that a vaccine isn't really in the cards in the way that it hasn't

772
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:27,880
been for AIDS or some other viruses? I mean, it's just hard to create a vaccine for certain viruses

773
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:34,280
and maybe even immunity, herd immunity among born of those who have caught it and not been

774
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:40,840
too harmed by it. Maybe that isn't even in the cards in the way that it doesn't appear to be for

775
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:46,680
flu because it mutates so often. I mean, obviously we have a flu vaccine, but we need a new one every

776
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,720
year. What if we get, what's the prospect that we're going to get doubly unlucky here and it's just,

777
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:57,320
it's going to be very hard to come up with a vaccine. And even if we had one, we'd have to

778
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:02,520
have a new one every year. So I do think it will be harder to vaccinate against this than it is

779
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:09,400
something like polio or measles or smallpox. But part of that's also technical. It's the nature of

780
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:17,000
the coronaviruses. They sort of behave a bit more like RSV viruses, which to create enough immunity,

781
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:24,600
you have to create a larger exposure basically. And the risk of the vaccine is higher. So anytime you

782
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,960
vaccinate somebody, there's a risk that they get sick from the vaccine. And the perfect vaccine

783
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:35,560
would be the vaccine for which you have no risk from the vaccine and you get perfect immunity.

784
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,280
Obviously nothing is there. So we now look at gradations of how close we get to that.

785
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:47,400
And my discussions with a couple of virologists and people in this space say we have to sort of

786
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:54,760
caveat our optimism around how long it will take to make a vaccine for this and how safe it will be.

787
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:03,800
And this gets into the question of would you take a vaccine that had a 0.1% mortality? It would be

788
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:08,280
very difficult to make that case unless you're over, I don't know what age. You wouldn't even

789
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:13,000
necessarily just say over 70 if you believed because even though the mortality over 70 once

790
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,120
you have it is high, you have to be multiplying that by the probability that you would contract it.

791
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:23,560
So it's going to really come down to the technical challenges of making this vaccine safely.

792
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:28,520
And again, for a bunch of technical reasons that I don't actually understand completely,

793
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:33,880
this mirrors the type of virus for which vaccines have historically not been a great

794
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,760
alternative because of the risk reward trade off. So ironically, everything I just said about the

795
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,600
anti-vax movement is going to go completely out the window because there will be legitimate

796
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:48,200
concerns that this vaccine perhaps could be more dangerous than your usual vaccine that is.

797
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,120
Well, I think it's a different argument. So I think the anti-vax argument is the fear of

798
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:58,840
unknowns like vaccines cause autism and things like that. Here, large clinical trials will give

799
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:05,160
you very clear safety profiles. It's like, look, and I'm making up 0.1% like for effect, right?

800
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:11,320
I can't imagine it could be that high, but 0.1% of people get really, really sick for two weeks and

801
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:18,600
0.001% of people require hospitalization and 0.0001% of people die. I mean, if you knew that,

802
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:24,120
well, then that's a very legitimate discussion, whether you're pro vaccine or anti-vaccine.

803
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:28,680
I mean, that is the type of discussion we need to have around vaccines. The discussion we don't

804
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:34,840
need to have around vaccines is let's go back to one stupid paper written by some guy who completely

805
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:40,760
falsified data. The paper was retracted. The guy has been disbarred from ever writing another paper

806
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:46,440
in the history of his life, but a couple of knuckleheads, celebrity idiots pick up on it

807
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,920
and turn it into an entire message that is completely false. I mean, those are different

808
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:57,800
statements. I consider myself who is in favor of vaccine, but also thoughtful about they absolutely

809
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:03,880
pose risk. There's nothing that doesn't pose a risk. So anyway, that's a whole other topic.

810
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:09,240
Actually, but just to illuminate that, I mean, that's another example of being able to thread

811
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:17,080
the needle on a very difficult to discuss, but important topic and very few people can do it.

812
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:24,280
So if you are worried about the social consequences, the consequences to public health of the

813
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:29,080
anti-vax movement, you're someone who's very likely going to be uncomfortable hearing

814
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:37,080
a doctor say anything about the legitimate risk of vaccines as a medical intervention.

815
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:43,640
But of course, almost anything we do to our bodies poses some risk. I mean, taking ibuprofen

816
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:49,800
poses some risk of actual death. So we have to be able to acknowledge these things. I mean,

817
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:56,040
people know when we're lying to them. So as you point out, we need a more sophisticated

818
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,920
conversation about risk and what is acceptable there, you know, just kind of the micro-mortality

819
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,000
points we are willing to accrue given the benefits, proffered benefits of doing anything,

820
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,200
whether it's skiing or getting on an airplane or getting vaccinated. And we owe it to ourselves to

821
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:21,640
be able to have the sophisticated version of that conversation in public, as opposed to

822
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:28,520
just hammering one side of the ideology space and denigrating the other. There are often right

823
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,440
answers, even when there's probabilistic uncertainty in any individual case. There are

824
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:39,720
prudent things to do and there are idiotic things to do. And we can make those judgments, even when

825
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:45,720
some percentage of people have a very bad experience doing whatever it is, skiing,

826
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:51,560
getting vaccinated, or anything else that has a non-zero risk of bad outcome.

827
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:55,720
That's absolutely right. There is a reincarnation, which I don't believe in. But if there is,

828
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:00,920
and I get to come back for another ride, I want to dedicate my life to teaching risk management

829
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:08,680
to people. Like, I would love to sort of make a career out of coming up with ways and tools to

830
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:14,040
help people think through what we're talking about now, because I think it is such an essential

831
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:21,720
way to go through life and appreciate the nuance and uncertainty that is much more present than we

832
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:27,960
are led to believe. Yeah. We also just have to acknowledge that the answers on paper, I mean,

833
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:38,760
the probability of death or injury in one circumstance may not actually seem better or worse

834
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:46,120
or rationally what we know it to be because of some superficial differences in the situation that

835
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:52,760
we can't emotionally correct for. I mean, some things just seem sketchier than other things,

836
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:58,840
even if on paper they're not. And some aspects of human psychology here that we have to figure out

837
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:06,680
how to navigate around. And I think we have to do that at the level of public policy. I mean,

838
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:14,200
the public policy really does have to be driven by statistics and what is known for large groups

839
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:20,920
of people to bear out in terms of risk of injury and death. And yeah, and then people are still

840
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,040
afraid to get on an airplane just because they're afraid to fly and they're never afraid to drive.

841
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:31,640
Let the people who are doing policy acknowledge how much more dangerous our roads are than our

842
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:37,080
skies are. But there are some ways in which we have to triangulate around human psychology to

843
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:43,960
get right answers made actionable. Yeah. Sam, I love that I get to call you up and bug you

844
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:48,600
every day. Yeah, likewise. Likewise. I'm glad we were able to have a conversation today that we

845
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:54,520
can share with everybody. I hope it's helpful. I know at this point, information overload is

846
01:28:55,080 --> 01:29:00,200
a problem. And I think what I appreciated about this question we had today, it was really less

847
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:05,960
about information and new information, and frankly, maybe more about how one can process it, think about

848
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:11,480
it, and hopefully not overreact to it, but react enough to it. Yeah. And I suspect we'll have

849
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,760
something different to say a week from now and maybe we might have to hop back on a call and

850
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:20,120
revisit anything we've learned. Yeah, let's just pledge to do that. I mean, we get to a point where

851
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:26,520
several other shoes have dropped and the story has changed in some material way. Let's do a

852
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,880
round two and not so much for what I have to bring to it. I have a feeling my

853
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,760
story isn't going to change very much, but yours, I think, will on the medical front. So I'd love

854
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:41,000
to hear it. Yeah. Well, thank you for making time, Sam, and I wish you luck the rest of today.

855
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,200
Likewise. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in

these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything

863
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:28,520

864
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,920
typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the

865
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:37,640
best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great

866
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:42,680
way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:48,680
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,
