00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia Drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,480
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:45,880
In this episode, I interview my friend Tom Billieu.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,200
Tom is the co-founder of Quest Nutrition.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
Many of you have undoubtedly heard of this.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,800
They make obviously Quest bars and a number of other products, but I think Quest bars are

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,120
sort of what put them on the map and keeps them on the map.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,280
Tom is one of three co-founders, and I know two of the three quite well, including Tom.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,440
He's also the host of something called Impact Theory, which we actually spend quite a bit

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
of time talking about.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,360
I knew a lot less about Impact Theory and his work there than I knew about Quest.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,160
Now, his mission in creating this was to create this sort of idea of what he calls an empowering

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,320
media-based platform for accelerating mission-based businesses.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,960
Tom is incredibly driven, and I think that comes across in this discussion.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,200
I've sometimes been accused of being a little too hyper, but when I'm around Tom, I actually

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,000
sort of feel like I'm on Quaaludes or something, given how much he's just sort of salivating

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,160
and just so passionately jumping out of his seat to basically tell you about something

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,840
that is generally really interesting and really, really helpful.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,560
He's just a completely driven mission guy, and I learned a lot about Tom on this episode

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
that I didn't know.

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,200
I've known Tom for probably five years, maybe six years, but one thing I didn't know was

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
that in the history of Quest, he basically interviewed virtually every person that was

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
hired.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,160
This is a behemoth company, and I'm not just saying that he was interviewing people who

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,920
were applying for jobs in the C-suite.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,760
If you were applying for a job on the production line, Tom wanted to interview you, and he

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,640
would always ask people the same sorts of questions.

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,920
There was one question in particular that he asked everybody.

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,360
I was actually kind of surprised by the answer.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,640
In this sense, his time at Quest became a little bit of a laboratory for what he ended

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,360
up doing later on and really what he's doing today and where I think he's going.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,640
In this episode, we're going to talk a lot about Tom's history with dieting and how he

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,220
changed his views on fat and fasting.

43
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,960
He had quite a radical transformation there.

44
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,840
His quest for immortality, which if you've ever heard me talk on this subject, I'm not

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,720
convinced that that's desirable or plausible, but I certainly love hearing about others

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,800
talk about it.

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,760
His background and what led to the co-founding of Quest, probably one of my favorite stories

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,560
because it really speaks to following your bliss versus following the dollars, which

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,480
I think many great entrepreneurs will tell you is their secret.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
What he describes as a growth versus fixed mindset, I think this is a really important

51
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,600
concept and I think it is worth paying attention to that.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,240
Why he would interview everyone he talked to or hired at Quest, and again, I was surprised

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
by that.

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,360
That was a completely new fact.

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,000
We talk about why he started Impact Theory and we talk about what fulfillment means to

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Tom.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,080
You'll be able to find a lot more information about Tom and some of the things that we talk

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,680
about on the show inside the show notes, which will be at PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash podcast.

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,480
Without further delay, here is my discussion with my friend, Tom Billiou.

60
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Tom.

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Yes.

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,280
Thank you so much for inviting me to your lovely place.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,440
My pleasure, man.

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
I have wanted to get you on my show forever, so I am excited.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
I know.

66
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,600
I feel like a real jerk because you've been asking me for so long and I've been saying,

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,680
yep, yep, yep, and then I pulled the bait and switch and got you on mine.

68
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
It's good.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,040
I promise you, if you still want me, I'm yours.

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh, dude, in a heartbeat.

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,960
It would be amazing.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,520
Well, just before we started, I met your wife for the very first time.

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Which I'm shocked by.

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,080
I still can't believe we've known each other this long and you've never met my wife.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,360
That's what prompted me to remember that it was about five years ago that Dom, D'Agostino

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,720
and I came up to meet with, I think at the time, just you and Ron.

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
Well, the first meeting I think was even with just Ron.

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
I remember coming back and he was like, oh, we're into fat now.

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,680
I was like, that just seems crazy.

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,600
Because at the point I was truly, truly rabbit starvation and had had massive success with

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
it.

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,920
I did that because I was legitimately fat phobic.

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,960
I was one of those dumb asses that was like, well, it's fat, dude.

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
Obviously, it makes you fat.

85
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
But that was me.

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,160
I already had a nutrition company at that point.

87
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,400
That's the crazy part.

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,200
So when I came back and I remember where I was and he was like, oh yeah, we met with

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,400
this guy, Peter Attia, Dom D'Agostino and they really made me believe in fat.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,160
And I just thought, whoa, like what a strange new world I've walked into.

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,480
And then it ended up changing my life.

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,320
It's interesting because I've heard Ron say that many times.

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,720
I've never heard you say what you just said, but I've seen video clips of Ron talking about

94
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
this.

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,240
And I can't believe that the meeting that Dom and I had with you guys could have had

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,720
such an impact on a company that was already on quite a trajectory.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah.

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,440
When you seek out disconfirming evidence, like when you actually want to know how you're

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,800
wrong and you meet somebody that is really a smart and be just so well educated on a

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,640
particular topic, it's like a fireworks moment.

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,840
You long for those things.

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,080
Cause it's like, look, my suboptimal life has gotten me this far.

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,320
Like I've already achieved all of this living like a fool in some way that I'm as of yet

104
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,600
unaware of.

105
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,400
If I can become aware of that thing and then make different choices, then can my life be

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
different?

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,640
So the reason that it had such a big effect is because that's how we look at the world.

108
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,920
It's like, I want to know how I'm wrong.

109
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,600
I want to know in what ways I'm suboptimal.

110
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,020
And so you guys coming in and making such a compelling case for fat, I ended up trying

111
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,700
it really soon after you guys came because the thing for me, and I'm actually super curious

112
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,700
to get your beat on where this is still.

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,780
But at the time you guys are saying, look, there might be some anti-cancer properties.

114
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,140
And so I am obsessed dude.

115
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,300
I don't know if we've ever talked about this.

116
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,820
I'm obsessed legitimately with living forever.

117
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,860
And what's the Woody on quote?

118
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,660
I want to live forever by not dying and not by having my works that go on.

119
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,900
So I really truly want to live forever.

120
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,820
That's something that's captured my imagination since I was a little kid.

121
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,000
So when you guys were talking about anti-cancer properties, I said, all right, I got to give

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
this a shot.

123
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,120
And I did it and I hated it in ways you can't imagine.

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I was doing a four to one.

125
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,760
I was in therapeutic range.

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,320
So my what ketone bodies were north of three and my glucose levels were like low sixties

127
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,160
if I remember right.

128
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,120
And I felt so sick, like it was crazy.

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
And I was warned, Hey, there's this thing called the keto flu.

130
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,260
So when it was happening, I was like, well, he, Hey, found it.

131
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,440
And I just thought, I just need to get through, you know, I forget how long I was staying

132
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
therapeutic, but like, let's call it five days.

133
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm going to stay in the therapeutic range for five days.

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,640
It's total misery, but like I can gut it out.

135
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,400
And I made it through and I was like, I'm never doing that again.

136
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
It was so miserable.

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,280
But in that time I went from chronic wrist pain.

138
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,840
I'd been icing my wrist up to two times a day, every day for 15 years.

139
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,960
And I had like these little burn patches on my wrist from where the ice touch, because

140
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,320
I was just icing so frequently.

141
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
It was crazy.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,640
And that was like to just get to the day, but I had lost all this weight, dude.

143
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,840
So I was 230 pounds.

144
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I go on a rabbit starvation diet, which I'll define as ultra high protein, probably north

145
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,680
of 80% of my calories were protein.

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,240
And then just as little fat and as little carbohydrate as I could possibly intake.

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,480
So I was doing basically a lot of steamed chicken breast with nothing but salt on it.

148
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
And that was it.

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,080
And I would eat basically, I don't know.

150
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,960
I was probably, I would oscillate between 1200 and 1500 calories a day.

151
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,220
And I did this for roughly two years.

152
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:04,340
And I went from 230 to about 170 and lost 60 pounds and it was pure insanity.

153
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,500
And I looked so good, dude, I was shredded best optical shape of my life.

154
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
And I just wanted to stare at my abs all day.

155
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
It was amazing.

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,080
So I'm walking into this whole fat thing with that, right?

157
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,380
Like 50 cent said, I came into the game humble.

158
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,860
Can't nobody tell me shit now.

159
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,260
It's like when I got lean, I was like, I've got this figured out.

160
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,300
Like there's nothing left.

161
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,820
And I just, I thought I had it dialed in, knew what to do and never once did it occur

162
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,500
to me that that was making my wrist 10 times worse.

163
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,980
And so when you guys came and said, Hey, there's anti-cancer properties, I do it.

164
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
I hate it.

165
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,740
But in the middle of all that, I realized my wrists don't feel better.

166
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,220
They feel perfect.

167
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,500
And I remember coming into work going, this is the worst experience of my life.

168
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,740
It is so unpleasurable to be in therapeutic range ketosis, not knowing how to supplement,

169
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,620
but guys, it is like a drug like effect on my wrist.

170
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,140
I've never, this is crazy.

171
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,860
And it's just eating.

172
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,820
So I said, I'm never taking fat out of my diet again.

173
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,380
I was like, there clearly was something to sell membranes, anti-inflammatory.

174
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,440
Like there were all kinds of things about the importance of fat that I just wasn't appreciating.

175
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,580
And now I'm experiencing it.

176
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,980
So from that moment, whatever that was back in 2013, I've been now some variation of high

177
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,500
fat, low carb or true ketogenic.

178
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,980
And when you were at 230, that was a relatively fit 230.

179
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,700
I was working out hard.

180
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,420
I was strong as an ox.

181
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,980
I would have had no stamina.

182
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,740
I wasn't doing any cardio.

183
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,980
It was purely about strength.

184
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,620
So like it wouldn't be something that would impress me today.

185
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,700
And when I see pictures of myself back then, I'm like a little grossed out because it's

186
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,180
like I got so myopically focused on getting bigger that I didn't realize how much of it

187
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,500
was fat and really went through a bit of bigorexia during that phase where it was literally if

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
I saw food, I ate it.

189
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,380
I just, I never wanted to miss out on like anything conceivably anabolic.

190
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,980
I was all about it.

191
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,460
And then I'd put a similar amount of obsession to losing the fat.

192
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,060
And so then I lost a ton of muscle and so wasn't nearly as strong anymore, but I looked

193
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
awesome.

194
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,480
So I went from thinking only about strength to thinking only about aesthetics.

195
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,580
And now I think about performance and it's just changed everything.

196
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,460
So you said something a second ago, which is pretty interesting and I'll pose to you

197
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,620
a thought experiment.

198
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,180
So you said you want to live forever.

199
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:23,940
Now what if I said to you, Tom, it is your lucky day because once in my life I get to

200
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,500
bestow on one individual immortality and I offered it to you here right now.

201
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Would you take it?

202
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Yes, without question.

203
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
All right.

204
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Now you have kids?

205
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
No.

206
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
But you're married.

207
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I am the lovely wife.

208
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Yep.

209
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
You have wonderful friends.

210
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Definitely.

211
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
And they're all going to die.

212
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
That's right.

213
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,380
Would you still want to live forever knowing that everyone you know is going to die?

214
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Definitely.

215
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,580
And that to me is such a psychological trap that you of all people, you have kids.

216
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,820
So if I granted you your children, not your spouse, just your kids, would you want to

217
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
do it?

218
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,260
It's a very interesting question because so the short answer is I don't know the answer.

219
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,860
I'm not convinced it's achievable.

220
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
So I don't put a lot of time in thinking about something that I don't think is achievable,

221
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,180
though maybe you'll talk me into thinking it is achievable.

222
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,060
I take a little bit of a jobs in approach on this, which is there is something reasonable

223
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,980
about death in that it's just closing the loop on the carbon cycle and it forces a little

224
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,460
bit of urgency.

225
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,620
There's a sense of you have to get something done.

226
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,580
Now that said, I hate the thought of saying goodbye to life.

227
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,380
I mean, I hate the thought of so I'm 45.

228
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,620
Let's assume I've got 50 more years left on this planet.

229
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,540
I know how fast the last 30 went by.

230
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,620
Like I remember being 15.

231
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,420
Like it was yesterday.

232
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,820
And I know that the next 30 and the next 40 will feel quicker because they will occupy

233
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,020
a smaller percentage of my relative timeline.

234
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,900
So I realized that very soon I will die.

235
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,140
So when I think of it that way, I think, God, I just want one more year, one more year,

236
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
one more year.

237
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,500
But do I really want it to be a mortality?

238
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,620
Would I ever want to bury my children when they were old?

239
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,700
No, you won't want to bury your children.

240
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,780
So that and this is the legacy fallacy trap for me.

241
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,900
So people talk a lot about legacy.

242
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,540
So I've decided not to have kids.

243
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,300
So people are like, Oh my God.

244
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,740
But what about when you're older and on your deathbed, you're going to work so much.

245
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,980
Won't you think I wish I had spent my time differently?

246
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:25,860
And the answer is of course, of course, every time you change your phase in life, your point

247
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,140
of reference is now that phase.

248
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,180
And so on your deathbed, you will instinctively see your life completely differently.

249
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,780
But my thing is, why'd you live your life the way that you did?

250
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,820
Because in that phase of your life, that was the only way to live that made sense.

251
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,700
So even if you're acting out of fear, you're in the middle of the fear.

252
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
So the fear makes sense.

253
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,660
So everything that you're doing has a logical movement to it.

254
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,460
And so to live your life out of sync with where you're at in that moment, to try to

255
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,020
hit a target, which is to feel good on your deathbed to me is crazy.

256
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,820
Because what that presupposes is that all along your experience of life was awesome

257
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,480
because you were living for that moment on your deathbed.

258
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,900
My thing is optimized for the moment you're in now.

259
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,420
I'll optimize for my deathbed when I'm on my deathbed and I will try to do all the things

260
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,340
that make being on a deathbed as acceptable as possible, or maybe even as beautiful as

261
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,180
possible to suddenly recognize the imminent death that is upon me.

262
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,180
And the transience becomes the beautiful thing that I railed against for so long.

263
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,940
But I know that I will have the frame of mind to find the beauty in it.

264
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,420
I won't spend a lot of time lashing myself for all, oh God, I wish I'd done that differently.

265
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,940
Or now with this frame of mind, I can see things so clearly I should have had kids.

266
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,300
But right now in this moment, I fucking love my life.

267
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,220
And so this morning, after two hours of sleep, I couldn't fall back asleep because I'm so

268
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,580
fucking excited to get up and keep working on a project.

269
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,300
Now I forced myself to go to bed because I knew that after two hours, midday, I'm just

270
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,660
going to crash.

271
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,780
But that's the level of excitement I have for the things that I'm doing that I call

272
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,860
work.

273
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,100
So if you can build that into your life, then you're going to be okay.

274
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,580
And here's how I think of kids.

275
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
I want kids, dude.

276
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,700
I really want kids.

277
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Would you take one of mine?

278
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
If they're amazing.

279
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
Absolutely.

280
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,100
And somebody tells me you've raised them well.

281
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,820
So you've gotten past a lot of the hard stuff.

282
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I would.

283
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,980
The only thing I want more than I want kids is to not have kids.

284
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,940
So it isn't one is undesirable and the other desirable.

285
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,020
It is that they are two very desirable things and by a slim margin, one wins up.

286
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,100
So what I think people need to focus on is construct your life around things that give

287
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,540
you energy and fill you with joy, like a deep sense of fulfillment.

288
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,700
That's why I think a lot of people actually made the right decision to have kids.

289
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,880
Kids to me from the outside seem like pretty instant biological fulfillment.

290
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,400
You have a kid and there's a feeling that you get about having that child.

291
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,060
You just can't manufacture any other way.

292
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,620
And that's beautiful.

293
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,740
And for people that either just want that kind of fulfillment or don't find fulfillment

294
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,620
in anything else, kids seem like a really good plan.

295
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,780
But for me, I just found that I could build fulfillment into doing other things.

296
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,900
And it was incredibly gratifying.

297
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,580
And I had big brother for a long time and that informed a lot of my decisions about

298
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,920
the realities of the day to day of having a kid.

299
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,700
It's amazing, but it's such a time consuming endeavor.

300
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,620
Yeah, sometimes I realize I don't remember what it was like not to have kids.

301
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,940
I think it's great when people like you can articulate that, hey, like not everybody has

302
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,780
to do this thing.

303
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,020
It's interesting that it's almost something people have to opt out of instead of opt into.

304
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,060
It's sort of like become a default thing.

305
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,180
If you don't have kids, like people are looking at you like, why don't you have kids?

306
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,980
But I think I understand what you're saying for sure.

307
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,300
Now going back to the other question about immortality.

308
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,940
So you obviously have a great sense of urgency and purpose about what you do.

309
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,420
And again, I don't want to spend too much time on theoretical fun questions, but do

310
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,380
you worry that if you knew you could live forever, some of that urgency would go away?

311
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,040
Not even a little bit.

312
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,900
So there's a book I read, dude, read this book.

313
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,420
It's called Einstein's dreams.

314
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,400
And in that book, it's a bunch of short stories that explore the nature of time.

315
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,380
And one of the explorations is a planet where everyone lives forever and the world just

316
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,660
breaks into two camps.

317
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,700
Naturally, you've got people that do nothing because there was always time to do it tomorrow.

318
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,300
There's no sense of urgency whatsoever.

319
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,540
And then you have this other camp of people that do everything because they know I can

320
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,060
actually stack all of these passions on each other.

321
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,740
And that's sequentially one by one.

322
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,140
I can get extraordinary at everything I've ever wanted to be extraordinary about.

323
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,900
And when I read this as like a 12 year old, I was like, oh my God, that is so me.

324
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:46,260
Like I knew to the visceral core of my being that that's how I would be given that opportunity.

325
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,460
And then I was given that opportunity, at least in the financial sphere of, you know,

326
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,100
hey, what would I do if I never had to work again?

327
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,820
And what would my life look like?

328
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,780
Would I be one of those people that just buys an island, retires to my ties, or would I

329
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,740
really go hard?

330
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,940
And to me, the answer was so evident.

331
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,320
Like when I finally had the money, the resources to do whatever I wanted, knowing I would never

332
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:13,380
have to work again ever, even if I lived for 200 years, I started moving faster because

333
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,660
now I could do more of the things that I wanted to.

334
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
I could delegate more.

335
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,180
I could solve some problems just by throwing money at it.

336
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,380
And so did I earn that state of being, which I like to think I earn all of the things about

337
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,700
myself that I value, but maybe I didn't earn it.

338
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,180
And maybe that's why at 12 it resonated so hard with me was just, I'm not one of those

339
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,660
guys that's like, Oh man, I don't know what I want from life.

340
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,180
And there's nothing I'm passionate about.

341
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,220
Like there's so many things I'm passionate about, let alone just really interested in,

342
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,820
let alone fascinated by.

343
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:49,140
So for me, the battle is eternally, I don't have enough time and encountering things that

344
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,860
you really love doing that really, really truly, you're just excited and it doesn't

345
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
matter.

346
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
Like I'll give you an example.

347
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,900
So Impact Theory, my new company, we're a narrative company.

348
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,780
We tell stories.

349
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,580
And one of the stories that we're about to put out, it's a comic book.

350
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:10,220
I'm so into writing this book and to telling this story and the World Cup is on and the

351
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,060
team that I support because America didn't qualify is England.

352
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,740
They were playing today and the games going, everybody here is having a great time.

353
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,540
And I stepped out to go work on the comic.

354
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,900
And so I'm choosing between these two things, both which filled me with joy and passion

355
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,380
and was so much fun.

356
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,180
And I thought this is a good sign when the thing that's technically work, that is moving

357
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:35,140
me towards a business objective is so much fun that I actually find myself like pulling

358
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,540
away from this truly just a celebration in a game to go work on that thing.

359
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,860
So structuring my life around things like that make it very easy for me to say definitively,

360
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,700
if I could live forever, I would live forever.

361
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,420
Now it wasn't always rosy, right?

362
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,140
I mean, I think I've heard a little bit about how Quest got started and what you guys were

363
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,300
doing before and how you guys all knew each other.

364
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,860
But what were you doing before Quest and what brought you, Ron and Mike together?

365
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,940
Yeah, it depends on how far back you go.

366
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,660
So I went to USC film school, was studying film.

367
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,620
That was going to be my shtick.

368
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,220
And I had cheated all the way through high school.

369
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,020
I believed I was smart, but I didn't really have anything to back that up.

370
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,660
My own mother, when I left for college, she finally admitted this years later when I left

371
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,100
for college, she just quietly assumed I was going to fail.

372
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,260
Because I didn't show any signs of being the guy.

373
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,060
I promised myself when I went to college, I would never cheat again.

374
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,100
Because I thought this I'm studying now what I actually care about.

375
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,020
I'm taking on tens of thousands of dollars of debt.

376
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,980
It just doesn't make sense to cheat.

377
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,020
So literally as an incoming freshman, I said, A.R.F., sink or swim.

378
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm going to do all my own work and it's just going to be what it's going to be because I need to

379
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,860
actually learn this.

380
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,100
And so go there.

381
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,380
My SATs are 990.

382
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,180
I took it twice.

383
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,140
So like you can imagine, I'm like barely getting into school.

384
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,020
The film school wanted a 1300.

385
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,660
I didn't have it.

386
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,780
I go to the admissions committee.

387
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,180
I'm like, what do I need to do to get in?

388
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,380
They say, look, SAT just tells us how you're supposed to do in school.

389
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,700
So if you apply as an incoming junior, we're just going to look at your transcripts and we don't care about your SAT.

390
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,460
So I thought, OK, cool.

391
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,140
For the next two years, I have to get good grades.

392
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,020
So I didn't date.

393
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,660
I didn't drink.

394
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,860
I didn't party.

395
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,580
Nothing, man.

396
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,260
Dude, all I did was work and I got extraordinary grades.

397
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,420
And I think probably about the time that I applied for film school again, I had a 4.0.

398
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,700
I mean, it's just absolutely murdering it.

399
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Remember, no cheating, nothing.

400
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,740
Just all me fucking hard ass work.

401
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,980
And I get into film school and I start crushing it.

402
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,940
And I'm doing great.

403
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,740
And I'm like, oh my god, I'm the man.

404
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,860
I am so talented.

405
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,260
This is crazy.

406
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,340
And my dad's telling me I'm talented.

407
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,260
And I get to film school and I'm just proving it.

408
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,860
Everyone's like, you're never going to get into film school.

409
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,980
I got in.

410
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,060
And only four people in your entire class get to direct a senior thesis film.

411
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,100
And I was chosen.

412
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,980
And I was like, dude, this is my life.

413
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,820
I'm going to graduate with a three picture deal.

414
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,140
I'm going to be the next Spielberg.

415
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,940
This is insane.

416
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,900
It's all working exactly as I planned.

417
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,260
And then my senior thesis film, I fucked up so badly that I stole the master

418
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,340
because it was that embarrassing.

419
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,900
And people were cutting clips of my film together into like these joke reels

420
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,620
to make fun of it, to make fun of me.

421
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,460
And it was emotionally devastating because I realized the truth.

422
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,620
And I'm not saying this to be humble.

423
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,340
The truth was I didn't have talent.

424
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,300
And that film made it abundantly clear.

425
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,380
I didn't know what I was doing.

426
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,460
I was in way over my head.

427
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,420
And finally, this film was just elaborate enough to expose that I actually

428
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,660
didn't know how to tell a story.

429
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,820
And that was crushing because I had a fixed mindset.

430
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,500
So I believe that you're either naturally talented or you're not.

431
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,940
To me, filmmaking was like singing.

432
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,060
Either you can sing or you can't.

433
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,660
And all the training in the world is only going to refine whatever

434
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,940
talent you already have.

435
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,820
So I was like, wow, well, I guess this is it.

436
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,580
I'm not talented.

437
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,540
I crashed and burned.

438
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,140
I am now flirting with depression.

439
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,220
I've graduated.

440
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,820
My parents aren't helping me financially.

441
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,700
I'm taking remedial jobs.

442
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,780
And it was just like, and it was the period of my life I called

443
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,500
the king of remedial jobs period where I would only interview for jobs

444
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,340
that I thought I would be smarter than the person interviewing me.

445
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,100
Cause I needed to feel smart.

446
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,580
And I just believe my talent intelligence were fixed traits and life

447
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,580
was about making the most of them.

448
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,740
So I never wanted to be in a situation that made me feel badly about myself.

449
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,620
And so that puts you in stupid places.

450
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,500
So I'm a college graduate selling video games, retail.

451
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,740
That was my life.

452
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,340
And then I got a phone call and somebody was like, Hey, you should come teach

453
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,380
filmmaking. We need some people to help.

454
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,740
And I went and taught and through teaching and I'm truncating

455
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,220
the story a bit.

456
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,260
There was a lot of suffering in this part that I'm skipping over, but I ended up

457
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,540
teaching filmmaking and realize, whoa, I'm actually able to help make their films

458
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,500
better. And if I can help them make their films better, why can't I learn and make

459
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
my own films better?

460
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,340
And so that became the seeds that would ultimately grow into a growth mindset.

461
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,020
But at the time I didn't have those words, I had some Tony Robbins.

462
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,660
I was clinging to that for dear life.

463
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,620
And the thing that really changed my life was, I don't know if you remember this.

464
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,140
This would have been back in like 99 people really debating brain plasticity.

465
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,940
And one side was like, it's total bullshit.

466
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,340
Your brain done capped out 12 or 13, somewhere around there.

467
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,900
It starts a pruning process after that.

468
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,980
You're not going to learn anything major new.

469
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,620
I was like, Oh God, that would be dire.

470
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,260
And then the other side was like, no, no, no, new science is coming out.

471
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,700
Guys, I'm telling you the brain is plastic.

472
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,140
You can learn anything at any age.

473
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,460
And I said, all right, I'm going to make a decision.

474
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,060
I choose to believe that the camp that's saying that you can change is right.

475
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,020
And so I started reading and reading and reading about the brain voraciously to

476
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,660
try to understand how it could change what I needed to do, what the process of

477
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,300
getting better at something with the neurological process of that was like,

478
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,540
what are synaptic connections?

479
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,540
How does the myelination process work?

480
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,820
So I, and all of that stuff filled me with so much excitement that I could change.

481
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,980
So, okay, I suck today.

482
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,180
I don't have to suck tomorrow.

483
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,700
I can just pour myself into this and get better and push and work.

484
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,060
And so that's what I started doing right about that time.

485
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,500
I encountered these two bodybuilder meathead guys and of course immediately write them

486
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,180
off as like a bodybuilders are dumb.

487
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,900
And then they opened their mouths and I was like, Jesus, these guys are smart, man.

488
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,460
And they were like, look, we're starting a new technology company and we need a

489
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,260
copywriter. And I was like, well, you know, hey, that sounds amazing.

490
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,460
Because their pitch to me was, dude, look, you're coming to the film industry with your

491
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,620
hand out. You need to get rich, control the resources, and then you can make films the

492
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,660
way you want to make. And I'm, you know, whatever 23, 24.

493
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,540
And so I'm like, that sounds amazing.

494
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,180
Let's do that. And so they thought it would take about 18 months.

495
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,580
I was going to go help them build this technology company.

496
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,660
They were going to sell it.

497
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
And then I would have the money I needed to make films.

498
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,980
And of course it doesn't play out that way.

499
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,260
And I go into first an amazing period where I'm learning to be an entrepreneur in a

500
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,820
startup environment in an ultra grueling like, hey, don't be a fucking idiot.

501
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,380
Get it done.

502
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,580
Kind of move faster like that kind of doggy dog environment.

503
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,140
But I ended up thriving in that and really getting strong, which is I needed to

504
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,780
toughen up. I'm just going to be really honest.

505
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,420
And it was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time.

506
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,940
I believed I could change and grow.

507
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,460
And I met guys that held me to a high standard and pushed themselves and wanted to grow

508
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,420
and get better. And they knew a lot about business.

509
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,300
And so they just brought me into this pressure cooker environment and made a very

510
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,740
similar offer to dozens of people.

511
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,500
And they said, look, this is a startup.

512
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,060
You can have any job in the company you want.

513
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,900
You just have to become the right person for the job.

514
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Now, for me, it was all about fighting to become a filmmaker.

515
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,900
I just needed that money.

516
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,300
So I went hard, hard and just fought and clawed my way up and and ultimately was the

517
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,460
only ones left standing.

518
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,180
And what did that company do specifically?

519
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,020
Awareness Technologies made data loss prevention software.

520
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,460
So if you had a company and this is all timing, right?

521
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,740
So this is the early 2000s.

522
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,780
So it was like you have a company and you're worried your employees are taking HIPAA

523
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,140
data out because your health care or you're worried that they're taking customer data

524
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,340
out because the credit cards are still sort of the wild, wild west at this point.

525
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,340
And people could just pop in a USB and take it out or they could email it out.

526
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,780
So we made software that would allow you to say, OK, if it has, you know, this type of

527
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,500
information, credit card data, whatever, flag it and don't let the attachment leave.

528
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,380
Not via USB port, not via email or whatever.

529
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,900
And I assume you're talking about Ron and Mike.

530
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,860
This is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

531
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,420
So you guys exit this company when?

532
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,100
So that we started wrapping up around 2009.

533
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,260
So in 2010, we launched Quest 2009.

534
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,260
We bring on a new CEO who bought the company and it was sort of a staggered exit.

535
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,180
So he and I, the new CEO and I didn't see eye to eye.

536
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,180
He didn't think I was very good at marketing and I thought he just didn't understand

537
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,900
marketing. So I said, look, I'm going to go start our next company, which we actually

538
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,980
offered him a percentage in because we didn't want him to sweat us working on it in the

539
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,820
background. And he turned it down.

540
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,260
Whoops. And so he goes on this firing binge, fires a bunch of people.

541
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,580
And I said, you know, I think there's one more person we need to fire.

542
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,980
And he's like, who's that? And I said me and he was like, OK, why?

543
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,620
And I said, I don't we don't see eye to eye.

544
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,820
You think marketing and spreadsheets, I think it's storytelling.

545
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,180
So we've got this new company that we told you about.

546
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,460
And I want to go be the first full time employee.

547
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,660
And so I was respectful and phased myself out and made sure that they were standing.

548
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,700
But he agreed to let me go and let me out of my contract.

549
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,020
Mike and Ron stayed behind on contract for again, it was staggered.

550
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,300
But for a year, I was operationally on my own building the company up.

551
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,740
And that's how I exited that.

552
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,100
And then they finally exited.

553
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,140
It was like a year later for I think Ron came first and then another six months and

554
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,020
Mike was there. What was impetus for starting Quest?

555
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,340
What itch were you guys scratching?

556
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,540
So I can only speak for myself on this one.

557
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,900
And I'll say that when we were building awareness technologies in the beginning,

558
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,300
it was learning so much about being an entrepreneur.

559
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,940
It was insanely empowering.

560
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,900
And it was just giving to me, giving to me, giving to me.

561
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,780
And then I sort of was hating what I was doing so much that whatever knowledge I was

562
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,780
gaining, I was still being eroded.

563
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,060
And I used to tell my wife, it's chipping away at me.

564
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,540
Like I'm just not having fun.

565
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,860
Like this is so miserable.

566
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,340
And so it was taking more energy than it was giving.

567
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,500
So it's getting drained every day.

568
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,460
I never wanted to talk to my wife about what I did.

569
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,140
So I'd come home and she'd be like, what are we up to today?

570
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,620
And I'm like, I don't want to talk about it.

571
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,820
Like I just didn't want to think about it anymore.

572
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,260
It was just soul sucking because I didn't care about the product.

573
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,980
There was no us in the product.

574
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,140
Like we were just trying to make something.

575
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,780
We used to joke.

576
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,660
It was a company that was born to be sold into slavery.

577
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,020
Like we just wanted to get rid of it.

578
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,980
Like from the jump, it was never something that we believed in.

579
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,740
We actually did VC pitches where we said, don't worry.

580
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,900
You guys can get rid of us.

581
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,460
We don't care.

582
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,780
We don't have an ego about this.

583
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,620
Like this.

584
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,780
And I quote, this company was meant to be sold into slavery.

585
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,260
We actually said those words multiple times, not realizing to a VC, that makes

586
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,460
you sound like an asshole who just wants to get out of the company.

587
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,100
I'm not going to trust you with my money wisely.

588
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,860
So, so just couldn't get it for a long time.

589
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,940
Couldn't get any money raised.

590
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,580
So anyway, it's robbing for me.

591
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,460
And I'm by this point, they've given me 10% ownership in the company.

592
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,260
The company is worth like 22 million at its height.

593
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,580
So I'm like, I'm a multimillionaire on paper.

594
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,380
And I'm just like, I am so unhappy.

595
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,260
I'm living the cliche of money can't buy happiness.

596
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,460
So I go to my wife and I said, look, I know I promised that I would make you rich

597
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,940
and I'm going to, but I'm going to need to go backwards for a minute so we can go

598
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,260
forward. And I said, I need to do something that makes me feel alive.

599
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,500
Like I just can't keep doing this.

600
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
It's so miserable.

601
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,340
And so she was like, yeah, I haven't seen you this unhappy in a long time.

602
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,300
Like do whatever you need to do.

603
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,860
So I went in and quit.

604
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,620
And now in the story, it sounds kind of cool because of how it ends up working

605
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,620
out, but at the time I was ashamed because I was like, I just can't do this

606
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,020
anymore. I'm so unhappy.

607
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,540
And I had told them anything within my code of ethics I will do to build this

608
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,260
company, period.

609
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,940
And I realized it's just not true.

610
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,900
Like when it's stealing my life from me, it wasn't worth it anymore.

611
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,780
So I went in, I said, guys, here's your equity back.

612
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,940
I'm not going to cross the finish line.

613
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
I don't want to get anything for this.

614
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,500
You could sell the company tomorrow for a billion dollars.

615
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,180
You will never hear from me of sound mind and body.

616
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,540
I am walking away from this and I'm leaving you in the lurch.

617
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,860
And that's exactly how it feels to me.

618
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,900
And so they were stunned and taken aback and I drove home and I'm literally

619
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,820
pulling into the driveway.

620
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,820
I'm on the phone with my wife.

621
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
I did it the hard part.

622
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,940
The two guys who I love, they are my brothers.

623
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,180
And I just said, I'm leaving and the phone rings and it's them.

624
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,300
And I'm like, uh, hold on one second.

625
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,020
Let me take this.

626
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,780
And I click over and they're like, come out to dinner with us.

627
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,300
I go out to dinner and they're like, look, you caught us by surprise.

628
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,220
The reality is we could do this without you, but we don't want to.

629
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,980
And that let me connect to something other than the money up until that point.

630
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,500
It had just been like, we're doing this for the money, for the money, for the

631
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,340
money, I'm going to make money.

632
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,940
I'm going to get rich.

633
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,820
I'm going to go make movies.

634
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,780
And then it was the thing I really care about in this.

635
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,780
I care about the brotherhood.

636
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,940
I care about the camaraderie.

637
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,860
I want to build something of value.

638
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,540
I want to build something I'm passionate about.

639
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,180
And so I'd already done the hard part.

640
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,940
I'd already quit.

641
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,660
So I was like, if you guys want to work with me, then it would have to be

642
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,740
fundamentally different.

643
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,900
It had to be a different company.

644
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,500
We'd have to be building something we care about, something we're passionate

645
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,260
about, something that the mother Teresa quarter, at least it's attributed to her.

646
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,020
No one will act for the many, but people will act for the one.

647
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,820
So I was like, I can show up every day thinking about my mom and my sister

648
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,620
who are morbidly obese and they're going to die far too soon.

649
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,900
If we can't solve this problem.

650
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,580
Cause Ron was like a nutritional freak at this point and he was just into it.

651
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,180
And he'd help me transform my physique.

652
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,260
This is like in the middle of me losing all the weight.

653
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,340
And I think I got it figured out.

654
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,260
And I thought, whoa, with what he knows about human metabolism and nutrition

655
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,380
and my passion for marketing.

656
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,620
And I've got this whole new vision.

657
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,980
That's going to leverage this thing that's is now called social media,

658
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,220
but wasn't called that back then.

659
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,900
And I just saw this vision fucking your boy, Tim Ferriss, who I read his book

660
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,460
and he introduced me to Kevin Kelly's notion of a thousand true fans.

661
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,820
So I became obsessed with this notion of a thousand true fans.

662
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,300
I'm going to find a thousand true fans and I stopped reading email.

663
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,420
Thank you again, Timothy Ferriss for that one.

664
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,700
I haven't read email in any meaningful way since that book.

665
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,740
And so I was like, I'm going to go off.

666
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,460
I'm going to market this way.

667
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,100
I pulled Mike and Ron into a conference room.

668
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,060
I gave him this whole pitch.

669
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,140
It's easier just to explain the way I'd say it.

670
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,260
Now, this, these weren't the words I was using back then

671
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,780
because we didn't have these words, but guys, look, social media

672
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,180
is going to change everything.

673
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,140
It's going to allow people to build community.

674
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,860
All it is is a megaphone.

675
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,580
If you give people a reason to say something good, they'll say something good.

676
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,540
And if you give them a reason to say something bad, they will say something bad.

677
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,780
But if we can build a company around value creation about building

678
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,700
community, not trying to Hawk product, actually bring these people together,

679
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,180
help them, because most of them want to lose weight, help them lose weight,

680
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,580
make the mission of our company to end metabolic disease.

681
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,140
Like all of a sudden we can really do something.

682
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,700
People will know who we are as people.

683
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,180
I was obsessed with that.

684
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,300
It was like, I want to be me today.

685
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,820
I would say I wanted to be authentic back then.

686
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,020
I was just like, I want our personalities to shine through.

687
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,220
I want people to know who we are.

688
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,540
Companies shouldn't be nameless, faceless organizations.

689
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,420
It should be real people.

690
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,220
And you should really feel them in the copy on the website, in the

691
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,180
content that they put out.

692
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,340
And I know how to tell stories.

693
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,540
Let us tell stories to these guys.

694
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,380
So we started building just a totally different infrastructure

695
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,740
than any company out there.

696
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,500
We just made our own content studio.

697
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,020
We were creating all of our own content.

698
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,660
We were essentially telling stories.

699
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,540
What does the brand mean?

700
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,500
What should it mean to you?

701
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,980
And that ended up because we were so early in the, the game of social media.

702
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,860
We just exploded.

703
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,580
Yeah, it's kind of amazing.

704
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,540
And I remember the first time we met, which I guess would have been 2013.

705
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,500
So you guys were, certainly you would see a quest bar here and there in a store,

706
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,580
but nothing like you do today, of course.

707
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,180
But I really remember you explaining this at the time and me sort of not getting

708
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,220
it, which was, and I don't even remember back then, like what were your main

709
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,420
social media channels?

710
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,620
Was it mostly Facebook?

711
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Was Instagram around?

712
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,020
I don't even remember.

713
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,980
Didn't even exist.

714
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,340
I remember when that came out.

715
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:04,660
Wow.

716
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,300
So this was all through Facebook.

717
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,340
All through Facebook, a little bit of Twitter, and then probably year two,

718
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,060
Instagram started to be a thing.

719
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,780
And then we started putting more and more resources and then Instagram exploded.

720
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,700
And Instagram really carried a lot of weight in the fitness community

721
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,740
because it's so visual.

722
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,020
So that was a huge win for us.

723
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,700
When did you realize that this thing could work?

724
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
This thing being quest?

725
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,660
Well, I knew it could work from the jump for what I wanted, which was I wanted to

726
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,980
love what I was doing every day.

727
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,620
I wanted to feel like I was sort of going to battle a righteous battle with my two

728
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,620
brothers who I cared deeply about and thought they had just amazing skills.

729
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,140
That would just be incredibly valuable in what we were doing.

730
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,380
And I felt ready as a marketer.

731
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,540
I felt like I understood something that nobody else understood.

732
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,100
I felt that we could move fast and I felt that we could serve our customer well.

733
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,660
And that was it.

734
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,700
And I believe, cause we always talked, we were a food company.

735
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,140
We didn't look at it as a supplement company or a bar company.

736
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,420
We were a food company and we were going to end metabolic disease.

737
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,500
We wanted to make meaningful contributions to the world of how food is made,

738
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,460
sourced, processed, understood, eaten, like all of it.

739
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,980
And even just looking at the kinds of imagery we were putting out there, we went

740
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,940
so against veins and chains, right?

741
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,660
So the bodybuilding industry up until that point was literally guys with massive

742
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,940
muscles, huge veins, wearing chains.

743
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,580
And that was everywhere, everywhere had that image.

744
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,420
And we thought, oh man, we're going to focus on food.

745
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,820
I became obsessed with this certain color blue, which I thought was appealed

746
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,900
to men, appealed to women.

747
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,340
It was like this beautiful, optimistic, creative color.

748
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,300
I did all this research on what blue means to people and how it hits the retina.

749
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,260
And literally it became like an actual stress point because it was hard

750
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,020
to get the right color, but then it becomes this iconic color.

751
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,340
The whole industry starts copying it.

752
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,300
It was bananas, but like going contract, like I heard, I don't remember where I

753
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,100
heard this, but they said, if you really want to be successful, you have to be a

754
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,980
contrarian and you have to be right.

755
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,060
And we were a contrarian and we were right.

756
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,060
And so because of that, it just, everything went nuts.

757
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,060
And so looking at everything differently and building a company that we were

758
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,620
excited about in a new way, taking care of customers, it was just, yeah, it was crazy.

759
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,220
And you've been now doing impact theory for two years.

760
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,860
Just under.

761
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,260
Yeah.

762
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,580
So talk to me about that transition and tell me a little bit about what impact

763
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,100
theory is.

764
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,700
I mean, I think I have some idea, but my guess is I'm probably

765
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,980
missing a few of the details and also the understanding of when you decided,

766
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,220
Hey, it's time to go do this other thing full time.

767
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,780
Cause this was obviously a passion for you always.

768
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,260
Yeah.

769
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,940
So to understand impact theory, you have to understand Rashawn Jackson.

770
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,220
And when I was in college and desperately trying to get good grades, I had a teacher

771
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,020
offer extra credit to go tutor inner city kids.

772
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,340
And so I said, yes.

773
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,420
And they of course give you the most problematic kids you can imagine.

774
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:55,380
So they gave me this young, probably drug and alcohol impacted hyperactive kid who

775
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,020
was hyperactive on a level I'd never seen the kid was bouncing off the walls all

776
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
over the place was crazy.

777
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,140
And my job was to get him to do his homework.

778
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,900
And so for the first hour, he would cry and scream and freak out and like run

779
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,140
around and get in fights and just go nuts.

780
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,140
And then when I would say, all right, hours up, I got to go.

781
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,260
Then he would become so sweet and soppy and he would cry and just

782
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,900
beg me to stay and help him.

783
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,140
And so like a sucker, I would stay.

784
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,620
So he'd get me for two hours.

785
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,700
And so around like week four, week five, I realized this kid's trolling me.

786
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,460
Like he knows he gets an extra hour if he ignores me for the first hour and then

787
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,820
his sweet and sweetness and light the second hour.

788
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,140
So S starts getting really annoying for me because I've got so much work to do.

789
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,300
And on week six, you're supposed to tell him, hey, I'm only coming for two more

790
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,620
weeks because it's an eight week program.

791
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,060
So week six, I tell this kid, I'm only coming for two more weeks just so you

792
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,940
know, and he flipped out.

793
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,820
He wanted to see nuclear is eight at this point and just just goes bananas.

794
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,140
And he was, he was really small because he was on Ritalin or something.

795
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,180
And so it's done and just gross.

796
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,620
It was just tiny, tiny for his age.

797
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,820
And he went up and just slugged this kid who was like, no joke, three times the size.

798
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,900
I just never seen like pent up rage like that.

799
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,540
And I was like, wow.

800
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,940
I finally get him under control.

801
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,260
I get him back and I'm like, is this because I said I was only coming for two

802
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,780
more weeks?

803
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,620
And he says through sobbing, hysterical tears.

804
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,100
Yes.

805
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,940
So I said, look, cause now I'm fed up with the whole just like drama routine.

806
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:25,740
And I said, if, and only if you do your homework, the moment I get here, as long

807
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,340
as I live in Los Angeles, I will keep coming and helping you with your homework.

808
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,140
And so he agreed and that turned into an eight and a half year relationship.

809
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,580
And I ended up becoming far more than just a tutor and he becomes an integral

810
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,780
part of my life and I his, and I didn't know it at the time, but he was being

811
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,940
abused at home and he ends up getting taken away by the police and he makes me

812
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,940
the guardian of the court and I have to help him through the court system and

813
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,900
into foster care.

814
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,340
I mean, like that's how intertwined our lives became.

815
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,820
And then I'm young and poor at this point and they move him farther and farther away.

816
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,020
And I never really felt like I was able to help him because I was so young and

817
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,620
stupid. And the only thing I really knew how to do was to show him that there's a

818
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,660
life he never sees.

819
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,460
So I would take him to see movies in Beverly Hills because I was like, movies

820
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,500
cost the same, but I can at least take him to a beautiful neighborhood that left a

821
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,580
really lasting mark on me and my personality.

822
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,580
And it planted a seed and then flash forward 10, 15 years later, I'm at Quest.

823
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,580
I now 1400 employees and about a thousand of them grew up hard, just like this kid

824
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:29,380
Rashawn. And I realize I have an opportunity to help make their lives better.

825
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,860
But how? And so we start thinking of the same called Quest University and it was

826
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,180
meant to be making protein bars as your tuition, but really learn the things you

827
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,660
need to learn to go and have a better life.

828
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,060
And so I write the 25 bullet points, which are the 25 things I had to do to my mind

829
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,740
to go from laying on my unfurnished apartment floor, flirting with depression,

830
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,420
not knowing how I was going to do anything with my life, feeling totally out of

831
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,620
control, hopeless and lost to building a billion dollar brand.

832
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,380
I knew exactly what I had to do.

833
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,420
The changes in beliefs, the thought patterns, everything that I had to do.

834
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,700
And so I started giving that to people and trying to help them.

835
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,380
And people would come to me and like, these are thugs, dude, like tattoos up the

836
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,220
neck, teardrop tattoos, grown men coming to me in tears.

837
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,580
You care more about my success and my own mother.

838
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,500
I have hope in my future for the first time ever, like people moving up.

839
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
One guy comes off the line and ends up working in our tech department because I

840
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,660
showed him how to like learn tech on the side.

841
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,620
Like, I mean, just crazy.

842
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,380
Like so many stories like that.

843
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,340
Absolutely extraordinary.

844
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,660
And I was like, when I'm at my most honest, I love helping with the body.

845
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,700
But when I'm at my most honest, helping with the mind is what I'm meant to do.

846
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,900
And so I thought we're doing all of this for the employees.

847
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,020
Let's create a show.

848
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,260
We'll call it inside quest and I'll interview because what I feared, and I

849
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,540
remember when I did it, I said, my big fear in writing these 25 things down and

850
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,500
they hung on the wall.

851
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,220
It was like a whole thing.

852
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,820
My fear in writing them down is that you'll memorize them, but

853
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,820
you won't live by them.

854
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,980
And so I wanted to bring other successful people in that I knew just because they're

855
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,460
universal laws of success, I knew would say roughly the same thing over and over

856
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:05,660
and over.

857
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,620
And these guys would see, okay, it's not just dad.

858
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,060
It's all these people that are saying the same thing.

859
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,100
And so that became really important.

860
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,100
And so I'm pouring myself into making that great in an effort to really do

861
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,820
something amazing for the employees.

862
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,900
And then at this time we ended up having just the incredible financial windfall

863
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,540
at a personal level that, you know, we'd all fantasized about since the

864
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,580
day we got into business.

865
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,300
And I realized all of a sudden, you know, we're in a very fortunate position where

866
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,540
the three of us have the financial wherewithal.

867
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,380
We don't always have to agree on everything.

868
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
We don't always have to move in the same direction.

869
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,740
The company would be very stable now without me.

870
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,900
They didn't necessarily, they being run a mic didn't necessarily have my level of

871
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,100
excitement for doing the mind.

872
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,340
And our consumer base was asking why the hell's the protein bar guy talking about

873
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,900
mindset?

874
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,780
So it was a total brand disconnect.

875
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,740
And I looked at it and thought, given enough years, I can get people to change

876
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,380
the way that they think about this brand, but are my partners going to want to share

877
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,460
in that horrific cost as I shift the brand to fit what I want to do?

878
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,780
I mean, it didn't seem like a fair thing to drag them through.

879
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,540
So, you know, I said, look, this is something that is important enough to me

880
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,940
that I have to do it in my life.

881
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,820
So we agreed to part ways at that point and build things the way that we see fit.

882
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,980
And so I took the studio that we had built inside of Quest and spun it out into a

883
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,020
standalone company that's now Impact Theory.

884
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,020
We create both what I call nonfiction content, stuff like this, interview shows

885
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,340
and then fiction content.

886
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,820
So we've got our first comic book coming out that we hope to turn into film or TV.

887
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,980
So how much of what you learned in film school figures into what you do today?

888
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,380
A lot, a lot.

889
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,460
So film school is psychology with, and put the camera here for best results.

890
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,100
Once you understand that, that your job is really to take the audience on an

891
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:51,540
emotional and ideological ride that at the end they're entertained, but at least

892
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,380
from my perspective, also enriched.

893
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,020
And look, most films don't worry about the second part.

894
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,900
That's an obsession of mine.

895
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,380
But when I think about the things that really shaped my life, it's the stories

896
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,020
I tell myself about myself and it's the stories that I identify with and make

897
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,460
the dominant metaphors in my life.

898
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,740
Joseph Campbell said, if you want to change the world, change the metaphor.

899
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,540
So I have lofty visions of what can be impacted through art.

900
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,580
I heard a quote the other day though, that is very sobering and definitely keeps me

901
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,260
thinking about ways to really impact people.

902
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,900
And he said, if you know what, 300 years of Shakespeare hasn't stopped genocide,

903
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,940
then what hope does art really have?

904
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,380
And I think that's a fair point, but I think that we're living through a time

905
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,900
today where you can marry the nonfiction, the direct, the explanatory with the

906
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,860
metaphorical, because I think the big problem is that the belief in the

907
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,940
metaphor has dropped out.

908
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,380
And Joseph Campbell again talks about this and says, part of the reason that you get

909
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,980
these stunted adolescents is because there's no ritual driven by belief that

910
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,620
the ritual has deep meaning.

911
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,380
So people aren't different from, you know, childhood to adulthood without

912
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,420
those transitional rituals and same with divorce.

913
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,700
And he said, you know, I think a big part of the divorce rate is that people don't

914
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,060
have these transitional rituals.

915
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,860
And so I took that really seriously.

916
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,780
And when I got married, I went through ritualistic scarification because I wanted

917
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,300
to be a different man the day before my wedding than the day after.

918
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,780
And I can't tell you how many times that's really like reminded me going through

919
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:18,940
something painful that was difficult made me think of myself as different and begin

920
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,380
telling myself a different story that I'm married now.

921
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,460
So say more about that.

922
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,660
What did you do exactly?

923
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,660
When I put it into normal terms, it won't sound as cool, but I got a tattoo.

924
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,220
Now for me, tattoos were not something I wanted.

925
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,060
I don't like tattoos.

926
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,060
Don't have a thing for tattoos.

927
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,100
I have exactly one.

928
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,660
And that was the one that I got as a ritualistic scarification.

929
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,340
I was deathly afraid of needles at the time, deathly afraid.

930
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,380
So for me, it was facing my biggest fear, doing something that was painful with

931
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,020
this thing that held some sort of mythical like element of terror in my life.

932
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,260
To give you an idea.

933
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,220
I was one of those guys that when I had injections in my wrist at one point, I

934
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,660
almost fainted and I wasn't even looking because the thought of a needle penetrating

935
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,980
my skin freaked me out that much.

936
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,420
So that's where I was when I got the tattoo.

937
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,500
It was just, it was the scariest thing I could think of within the realm of reality.

938
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:06,660
Right.

939
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,460
I didn't go swimming with great white sharks.

940
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:08,700
Okay.

941
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:13,580
That obviously would be far more terrifying, but within the, like the plausible realm

942
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,220
of this isn't potentially actually dangerous.

943
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,660
It was the worst thing I could think of.

944
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,500
And so doing that, having to face that fear, having to do that ended up being

945
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,860
really important for me transitioning out of being single to being married.

946
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,660
I've heard you talk before about money.

947
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,420
And it's something that I've certainly asked a number of my patients.

948
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,300
One of the privileges of medicine, I think there are several, but, but one of them

949
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,540
I think is that you form relationships with people where you can ask very

950
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,900
intimate questions and sometimes they're not just about their health.

951
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,820
It's about their happiness.

952
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:49,300
And even though my patient population is quite small, given the affluence of some

953
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,740
of my patients, I've had interesting discussions with people about how wealth

954
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,380
does and doesn't impact their lives.

955
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,340
So I guess even though you're not my patient, I'll ask you basically the same

956
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,380
sort of question, which is, did you feel different the day after your liquidity

957
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:03,740
event?

958
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,180
No.

959
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,140
And that's the weirdest part.

960
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,780
Here's exactly what it was for me.

961
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,300
And I think this is near universal.

962
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:16,220
When I looked, when I was poor and all through my childhood, I looked at people

963
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,740
that had money and I had.

964
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,380
Adoration for them.

965
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,300
It just seemed so cool.

966
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,180
And I thought that in some way they were better than me or certainly in a better

967
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,020
place than me and that that made them in some ways better, certainly more

968
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,900
desirable to be like that.

969
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,500
And so looking at them, you meet them with a bit of reverence.

970
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,940
And so in the back of your mind somewhere is this notion that when I get money, I

971
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,980
will have that adoration for myself and I will have that sense of reverence for

972
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,660
myself.

973
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,140
And you think that somehow like all the insecurities that you have will be washed

974
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,500
out by that reverence and adoration and it's not.

975
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,860
And you realize that you feel exactly the same the next day.

976
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,740
And the easiest way I can explain it is to say that it's like losing your virginity.

977
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:06,180
Before I lost mine, I legitimately thought like colors would be brighter.

978
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,780
I would just be somehow a fundamentally different person.

979
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,140
And then I had sex and was like, oh, that was rad.

980
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,660
I loved it, but I'm not a different person.

981
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,820
And that was exactly how I felt with the money.

982
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,620
It was rad, dude.

983
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,460
Money is better than people think.

984
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,860
It's more powerful than people think to be certain.

985
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,900
But it's not at all what people have been told.

986
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,180
It's not going to impact how you feel about yourself.

987
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,460
It is merely going to extend your capabilities.

988
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,940
You will suddenly be able to facilitate things you wouldn't be able to facilitate.

989
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,540
Money is essentially inert, right?

990
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,300
There's a bit of heat energy to a dollar bill that you could release by burning it.

991
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,420
But short of that, the money in and of itself is inert, but it can facilitate things.

992
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,700
Now, if you have a clear vision of what you want to facilitate and it's a problem

993
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,620
that can be addressed with money, suddenly money becomes insanely powerful.

994
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,180
And if you really want to think about how powerful money is, think about how much

995
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,860
of your own life is determined by what you get paid to do.

996
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,420
Now imagine controlling that money and you realize that you're able to aim

997
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,900
incredibly intelligent, capable people at problems you want solved.

998
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,940
It's not even necessarily the problem they want solved.

999
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,700
So that gets really, really interesting.

1000
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,300
And then if you can help them fall in love with what they're doing, if you can

1001
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,780
give them a supportive environment, if you can make sure they know that we're all

1002
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,340
equals here, we have different roles, but we're all equally important that their

1003
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,020
voice is desired, that they're there because you want to hear from them.

1004
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,420
Then it's like, holy hell.

1005
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,900
I know I only get their attention because I'm willing to pay them, but now that I

1006
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,340
have their attention and can create this ecosystem, this environment for them to

1007
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,340
thrive in, we can do some pretty extraordinary things.

1008
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,460
It seems like one's motivation around money can change because certainly I'm

1009
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,380
guessing when you were young or when you were, let's say right out of college,

1010
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,860
right, you, you're sort of at a low point.

1011
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,820
It sounds like we didn't go too much into it, although that's the kind of stuff

1012
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,860
I enjoy talking about.

1013
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,020
It's the pain in the humiliation of that experience.

1014
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,540
And at that moment, my guess is you would have thought, give me a bunch of

1015
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,180
money and my problems go away.

1016
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,940
And maybe I'm wrong, but I don't get the sense that at that moment you would have

1017
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,180
realized that that wasn't true.

1018
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,300
And at best that money would have given you the opportunity to go back and do what

1019
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,900
you loved.

1020
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,220
That is one of those are different things, right?

1021
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,620
Very.

1022
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:11,140
Yeah.

1023
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,300
Yeah.

1024
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,340
Unfortunately back then I, I was chasing money all out because I thought it would

1025
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,340
solve all of my problems and I thought it would make me cool as hell.

1026
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,740
I just thought it would be so cool, dude.

1027
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,060
I thought I'm going to be the man.

1028
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,060
I want a fast car.

1029
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,060
I want a Lamborghini.

1030
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,060
Like I want the every blingy like thing that you can imagine.

1031
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,300
I wanted it all and I fantasized about it.

1032
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,460
And whenever I thought about money, the only thing I thought about was what

1033
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,260
it could buy me.

1034
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,180
That was it.

1035
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,500
And how cool people were going to think I was how cool I would think myself.

1036
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,180
Yeah.

1037
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,780
That was the nature of money to me.

1038
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,700
Who do you consider a role model in people who have taken great wealth and put it to

1039
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,260
maximum impact?

1040
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,020
Elon Musk.

1041
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,700
No question.

1042
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,500
He's probably, I really want to think about this.

1043
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,020
He's probably one of the few people that legitimately makes me feel badly about myself

1044
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,540
and like makes me sweat when I think about like, Oh, could I really do that?

1045
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,500
Like, I like to think I can do anything, Peter, but whoof, spinning that many

1046
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,700
plates at one time.

1047
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,660
Yikes.

1048
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,060
I don't know that I process raw data fast enough.

1049
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,380
That's the God's honest truth.

1050
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,940
And so let's consider one of those things, which is space X.

1051
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,140
I used to be an engineer, so I'm pretty impressed by the kilo to dollar ratio of

1052
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,740
payload.

1053
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,340
Sometimes I still can't believe it's happened.

1054
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,220
I mean what they've done.

1055
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,340
Have you ever been to see a launch?

1056
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:30,980
No.

1057
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,460
Have you?

1058
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:32,580
I have not.

1059
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,940
I have a couple of friends who have.

1060
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,660
I'd love to.

1061
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,100
Yeah.

1062
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,460
It's, I mean, there's some really cool videos out there.

1063
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:37,620
Yeah.

1064
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,380
I've seen the videos.

1065
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,380
The videos are amazing.

1066
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,220
Have you taken off and landing and you've seen the videos where like you have to

1067
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,380
wear the correct headphones to be able to actually know.

1068
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:45,860
Oh yeah.

1069
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,860
There's a guy on YouTube.

1070
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,820
Maybe we can find it for the show notes, but there's a really cool video where you

1071
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,180
can actually hear.

1072
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,820
You just get an amazing auditory experience basically.

1073
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,020
Yeah.

1074
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,180
Yeah.

1075
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:57,980
It's it's it's.

1076
00:49:59,500 --> 00:49:59,660
Yeah.

1077
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,860
It's actually not that recent.

1078
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,700
I feel like it was in the last three or four months.

1079
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:03,460
Yeah.

1080
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,300
Pretty impressive.

1081
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,220
Yeah.

1082
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:09,580
I've heard people talk about how space X could be a trillion dollar company,

1083
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,660
which is, is pretty interesting.

1084
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,660
I don't know that, you know, it's funny when I went to college, I wanted to be an

1085
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:19,220
aerospace engineer, so I'm obviously pretty interested in that stuff, but, and

1086
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,140
this is going to sound like a complete sort of poo poo on the whole thing, but

1087
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,820
I'm so much more interested in like what's happening on earth and what's

1088
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:30,420
happening in space, and I don't know when that transition took place, but as

1089
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,220
interesting as I think that stuff is intellectually, I just think emotionally,

1090
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:39,220
I feel much more curious about what's happening right in front of me.

1091
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,900
And I'm also equally amazed at things that we don't know that are so close.

1092
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,860
Like, you know, because I used to spend so much time swimming, I'm kind of amazed

1093
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,300
by the ocean, which is like, you know, if you think about it at its deepest point,

1094
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,740
it might be what, 12, 14 kilometers deep.

1095
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,700
Like that's a trivial distance.

1096
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,940
You could walk that in an afternoon, but when going straight down, that's a

1097
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,340
depths of unknowns, like we can't even fathom new types of organisms that don't

1098
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,300
even require sunlight, that kind of stuff.

1099
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,220
So by selecting Elon as your example, it's sort of like saying, look, there are

1100
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,900
lots of incredibly wealthy people, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, many of these

1101
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,060
folks who have, you know, and people who are less well known, like John Arnold,

1102
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,060
who through philanthropy have done remarkable things, but Elon has done it

1103
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,420
through building companies that are kind of paradigm shifting.

1104
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,140
I mean, that's an overused term, but I think it's safe to say that for his stuff.

1105
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,260
So what is the paradigm you want to change?

1106
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,460
I want to make sure that no human being on the planet fails to

1107
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,020
encounter an empowering mindset.

1108
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,900
That's what I'm all about.

1109
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,780
And so meeting kids in the inner cities, and I'll tell you a story.

1110
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,100
So I used to interview everybody.

1111
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,180
If you got a job at Quest, I interviewed you, whether you were the EVP of global

1112
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,020
sales or you were the janitor you interviewed with me.

1113
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,860
And so that meant that I went through a phase where all I was interviewing was

1114
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,060
people working for the production line, which naturally draws people from lower

1115
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,020
income brackets.

1116
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,220
And I started asking just because I wanted to really understand like what

1117
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:16,900
motivates you because my thing was I never wanted to hire somebody into a

1118
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,460
parasitic relationship where I was going to get their time and essentially

1119
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,020
give them very little money when you really think about it in exchange for

1120
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,780
that time.

1121
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,020
And so I thought, wow, they're going to spend 50% of their waking hours with me

1122
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,340
and I'm going to give them not enough money.

1123
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,420
And I didn't feel good about that relationship.

1124
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,620
Now you can't build a business just by throwing money at everybody.

1125
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,860
So what else could I do to add value to people's lives?

1126
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:41,460
So it's like one thing I can hire people who there's a secondary thing that they

1127
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,580
can learn from us and then they can go on and do that thing so they can build

1128
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,260
their skillset up.

1129
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,380
The example I gave earlier of the kid who wanted to learn technology.

1130
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:48,940
Awesome.

1131
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,820
Came in busted ass, made a lot of protein bars, but also we helped him get a job

1132
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,020
in tech within our own company.

1133
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,220
He then goes on to start his own tech company.

1134
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,500
It was crazy.

1135
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,540
So I was looking for people like that.

1136
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,740
I wanted to know what's that next thing.

1137
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,340
I know that you don't want to spend the rest of your life working a protein bar

1138
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:05,620
line.

1139
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,620
So what's the next thing that you want?

1140
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,580
And if I, if I really believe that I can help you get there, then our selfish

1141
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,700
desires are aligned.

1142
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,820
We can work together to make something amazing happen.

1143
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,380
And I would rather have you for three or four years and you believe that I'm

1144
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,220
making your life better every day than to have you for 20 years.

1145
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,260
And you hate every bit of it.

1146
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,780
The way that those two people will work is so dramatically different.

1147
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,060
Just to be clear, part of your motivation is also selfish, right?

1148
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,140
It's like, I'm going to get way more out of you in four years on a per unit

1149
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,620
basis or productivity basis than 20 years where you're, you know, you're going

1150
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,340
to stay here forever, but you're not happy.

1151
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,660
And then part of it is sort of altruistic.

1152
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,300
Yeah, I'll even say it's all selfish.

1153
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,060
So I don't think selfish is necessarily a bad thing.

1154
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,220
I just think that we all live life from our perspective.

1155
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,340
We're motivated by certain things.

1156
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,500
I like to see other people win.

1157
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,260
I'm wired for it.

1158
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,780
So I remember when I was like six or seven in an Easter egg hunt, I pretended

1159
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,940
not to see some Easter eggs because I knew winning meant a lot more to my sister

1160
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,580
than it did to me.

1161
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,940
So I pretended not to see them.

1162
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,820
She found them and she won.

1163
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,540
And she was very happy.

1164
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,780
So that's just me.

1165
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,420
I just like to see people that I care about happy and having a good time.

1166
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,460
So that's part of it.

1167
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,060
I'm wired for that.

1168
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,660
So I know that I'm going to be stoked if I see that they're having a good time.

1169
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,940
And then I want to build a big company, make a whole lot of money.

1170
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,740
And the only way I can do that is by convincing extraordinary people to come

1171
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,580
work for me and then make it a great environment where they don't want to

1172
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:21,820
leave.

1173
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,020
So yeah, I don't mind people saying that it's entirely selfish.

1174
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,380
Fine.

1175
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,100
If it's good for people, I'm okay with that.

1176
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,500
This became your lab.

1177
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,500
I mean, I didn't realize this.

1178
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,780
You interviewed every person you hired.

1179
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,860
I've interviewed north of 1500 people, which doesn't sound like a lot when you

1180
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,540
think of all the things you do 1500 times until you go to interview 1500

1181
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,660
people and you realize Jesus, this is a lot of people.

1182
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,020
So yeah, years of my life were spent interviewing that we were going back.

1183
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,260
What did you learn from that process that surprised you the most?

1184
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:49,500
Yeah.

1185
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,740
And this is a punchline to the question that you actually asked in wanting to

1186
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,500
find out what is your real desire.

1187
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,260
I started doing this magic genie question.

1188
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,580
So you can ask for anything that you want, anything at all.

1189
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,620
Got to be something selfish.

1190
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,020
So it can't be to cure cancer or bring somebody back from the dead and

1191
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,980
you can't ask for more wishes.

1192
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,180
So what do you wish for?

1193
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,700
And I wanted to just get like that truest thing that they really want.

1194
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:15,020
And Peter to a person, remember I interviewed hundreds of people to a

1195
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,580
person.

1196
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,660
They all said the exact same thing.

1197
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,700
What are the odds that like, let's just say that that particular question

1198
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:28,060
I asked 300 people, what are the odds that every single one of them without

1199
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,740
exception would give you the same answer?

1200
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,660
Well, if you're not leading them or asking the question to each of them at a

1201
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,540
point in the discussion that was equivalent, so you're priming them, I

1202
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,380
would say the answer is the probability is incredibly low.

1203
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,780
Okay.

1204
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:47,260
So I'm leading them just enough that we narrowed the world down for sure.

1205
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,460
Otherwise this really would be like a magic trick because almost to a person,

1206
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,220
this was less universal, but almost to a person.

1207
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,660
The first answer was I want a job, which I know is bullshit.

1208
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,300
They're saying that because they are there for an interview.

1209
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,420
So I would say, okay, I get that.

1210
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,420
A lot of people give that to me as their first answer.

1211
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,820
So this is now me leading them.

1212
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,980
And I say, why do you want the job?

1213
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,900
And they would say for money.

1214
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,500
Okay, rad.

1215
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,660
So is it fair to say you would ask the magic genie for money?

1216
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,420
Yes.

1217
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,940
So none of this is weird to me.

1218
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:18,340
The weird part is when I say, give me a number and every single one of them,

1219
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,420
every single one, I never once got a variation, gave me the same number.

1220
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,780
And the number was a million dollars.

1221
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,660
A million dollars.

1222
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,100
Peter, what the fuck are you going to do with a million dollars?

1223
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,300
You can't buy a house in LA for a million dollars, let alone be set up for a life.

1224
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,860
It's a magic genie.

1225
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,620
Now I've thought about the magic genie question a lot.

1226
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,140
And if you're asking for money, you've already wasted your ask, but fair enough.

1227
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,740
Like I spent a lot of time thinking about the magic genie, but the fact that they

1228
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,820
all asked for a million dollars was crazy to me.

1229
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,980
And the first time I heard it, I thought, well, that's weird.

1230
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,220
The fifth time I thought, man, how is it possible?

1231
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,580
Five people have said the same thing around number 10.

1232
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,500
I actually thought my team was fucking with me and that they had started telling

1233
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,260
them ahead of time to do it just to like mess with me.

1234
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:04,460
By the time we got to 25, I realized something about humanity that you only

1235
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,540
dream as big as you think, and you only think as big as what you see.

1236
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,260
So if what you see around you is that everyone's wishing and thinking about a

1237
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,460
million dollars, because that seems like an impossibly large amount of money, you

1238
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,940
never go, my dream in life is the terraformed Mars.

1239
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:18,500
Okay.

1240
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,380
You never think that big.

1241
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,980
You're stuck at a million dollars.

1242
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,420
It would never occur to you that you can terraform Mars because you're thinking

1243
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,820
is so limited by what you've seen.

1244
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:34,500
And I thought, whoa, if I could just give them my mindset overnight, because I'm,

1245
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:38,660
I'm interviewing people that are smarter than me and I'll define smart as the

1246
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,700
ability to process raw data quickly.

1247
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,700
Okay.

1248
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,420
Does that seem like a reasonable definition?

1249
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,940
It seems like one component, but I don't know the definition of smart.

1250
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,420
I would certainly include that in it, but, but let's grant that that's the

1251
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,620
definition we'll use for the moment.

1252
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,140
So I would come across people that blew me away.

1253
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,780
They could just think faster than me.

1254
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,500
They could see all the different permutations of a given problem and come

1255
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,980
up with a solution that was well thought out more intricate than I could.

1256
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,100
And so I thought, okay, well, my success isn't predicated on intelligence.

1257
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,380
Uh, it's definitely partly hard work, but I work hard because I have a certain

1258
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,580
belief in a mindset that I can, that my efforts will be rewarded.

1259
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,940
So I started thinking, okay, humans lead with belief.

1260
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,540
It's because I believe that I can get better at something that I'll pour myself

1261
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,620
into it, but they don't believe that they're going to get that result.

1262
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,300
So they don't, they don't believe that they could ever get a hundred million

1263
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,260
dollars, a billion dollars, a hundred billion, a trillion.

1264
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,860
That's just not real to them.

1265
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,820
So even though we're talking to a magic genie, they don't think that big.

1266
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:32,780
So it was crazy.

1267
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,460
And if you push them and really write them, they they'll work their way up to 10

1268
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,900
million, but nobody ever goes a billion, a trillion.

1269
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:44,700
There's no, so I was like, wow, I became obsessed with how do I codified my

1270
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,540
mindset, what I've done over the last, at that point, like 12 years of just.

1271
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,180
Training myself to think a certain way.

1272
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,900
How do I impart that to people?

1273
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,020
And that is still my obsession.

1274
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,260
So that's what I'm hoping can be done through story.

1275
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,940
And when you read homo dais and sapiens, it just really understanding how

1276
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,860
narrative is so massively influential and that the dominant narratives that we

1277
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,940
use are all religious.

1278
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,620
And then you look at how I think the bottom is falling out in terms of belief

1279
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,860
in a lot of the religions for a lot of people.

1280
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:20,100
And you just go, okay, well, what's the ultimate punchline when people no longer

1281
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,620
have a metaphor that they put any weight in, they have no belief in, then it really

1282
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,140
becomes a documentary and my life is what my life is.

1283
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,220
I know it because I see it.

1284
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:32,060
And that scared me because now if you can only envision what you're living, you

1285
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,500
can't even turn to the Bible to see extraordinary acts.

1286
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:41,380
You can't the Quran, the whatever to a movie, something to have some vision of

1287
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,020
something that's bigger than what you've done.

1288
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,460
And I thought, could we use storytelling to give people a way to think in the way

1289
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,740
that the matrix gave me a way to think.

1290
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,380
And so that became the obsession.

1291
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:52,700
It's funny.

1292
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,420
I was thinking about it.

1293
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,340
While you were explaining, what would I ask for in the genie question?

1294
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:01,420
And it's so interesting that I wouldn't think to ask for money, which is not to

1295
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,340
say that I wouldn't love to have more money because of the reasons we described.

1296
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:09,340
It would be amazing to be able to amplify the things I want to do.

1297
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,260
The first thing that jumps to my mind is like the type of laboratory I'd want to

1298
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,180
have and how I hate the fact that all of the best scientists that I interview for

1299
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,660
my book and, you know, for the podcast and just folks from my friends, I mean,

1300
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,340
they spend 50% of their time fundraising.

1301
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:28,220
And I imagine a world where like you could create like a true Institute where

1302
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:33,780
you're going after high risk translational problems with infinite resources.

1303
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,340
So let me tell you, if the genie would give me the dollars, I'd be happy to take

1304
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,700
them, but I actually think the first thing that comes to my mind would be some form

1305
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,020
of fulfillment, because at least money, you sort of know it can be got.

1306
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,580
But fulfillment strikes me as one of the hardest things to find.

1307
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:56,660
Again, maybe I'm biased by what I see clinically, which is people who have more

1308
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,860
money than they could ever spend.

1309
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,580
I've actually had one patient say to me.

1310
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,780
It's almost impossible to spend more than six hundred million dollars in your

1311
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,260
lifetime. That was the number that was.

1312
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,340
I remember that was like, you know, anything over six hundred million is just a

1313
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,740
waste like you can't possibly spend it.

1314
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,340
That is a failure of imagination.

1315
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,780
I assure you.

1316
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,740
I mean, look at Elon Musk.

1317
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:18,820
Come on. Like even just to pour six hundred extra million into each one of his

1318
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,540
three companies.

1319
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,220
He could do well.

1320
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,180
I think this person was saying through like expenditure on, you know, like

1321
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,220
willy nilly stuff.

1322
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,180
But interestingly, fulfillment seems to be something that's missing.

1323
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,380
I certainly don't think I know fully what it means.

1324
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,460
I think I've had moments where I've experienced it.

1325
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,100
But it's interesting if it's a real magic genie.

1326
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,780
Can you imagine what that would feel like?

1327
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,740
Yes. Can I give you my secret formula to fulfillment?

1328
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,100
I would love to hear it.

1329
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,100
So one fulfillment is a neurochemical state.

1330
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,860
So there's no possibility of a flat line.

1331
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,260
There's no way you're just going to have it forever.

1332
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:57,340
I think that it ebbs and flows with the movements of a day.

1333
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,340
But having said that,

1334
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,860
I think that fulfillment comes from becoming someone that you're proud of,

1335
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:08,260
building a skill set that was incredibly hard to build that serves not only

1336
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:13,100
yourself, but other people. So you're doing the hard things.

1337
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:17,020
You're not doing things that would be deeply pleasurable.

1338
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:20,700
And in building your identity around not doing things that are pleasurable in

1339
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,140
order to become extraordinary in order to serve other people,

1340
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,380
I think that's the name of fulfillment.

1341
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,300
When I think about the times where I feel just fucking awesome,

1342
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,740
it is because I did something really hard while other people were playing.

1343
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,140
It made me more powerful in the way that I define it,

1344
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,140
which I can't believe power has become a dirty word.

1345
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,300
Power to me is close your eyes, imagine a world, a better world,

1346
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,820
the world you want to create,

1347
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,340
open your eyes and have the ability to manifest that that's power.

1348
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,900
So mother trees had power. She was able to do things.

1349
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,380
That is what leads to fulfillment. It's what the Greeks called technique.

1350
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,860
It's not enough to go ladle soup at a kitchen, right? That should,

1351
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,500
that's pleasurable. It feels good,

1352
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:04,260
but it isn't fulfillment because you didn't earn any special ability to do that.

1353
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:07,300
Now fulfillment is the guy that worked at Toyota.

1354
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,340
They came into the soup kitchen and said,

1355
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,300
I'm going to improve their efficiency. So more people get fed.

1356
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,020
And he increased their output by like 40 or 400%.

1357
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,140
I don't remember how to foreign it, but it was like massive.

1358
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,900
And I thought that's fulfillment. He worked his ass off.

1359
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,060
I'm sure there were a ton of days at Toyota where he was like,

1360
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,020
what am I doing? Why am I doing this?

1361
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,860
But he gained this set of skills.

1362
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,140
It was insanely powerful and he put them to use in soup kitchen.

1363
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,860
Now that feels good. That's fulfillment.

1364
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,380
So getting people to a place where they can

1365
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:40,220
learn that the cool stories are the stories that while you're in it suck.

1366
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,300
Like when I heard your story, a swimming around Catalina Island,

1367
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,420
that sounded like actual madness to me.

1368
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,220
When I heard that you swam from Catalina back to the mainland,

1369
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,700
that sounded crazy. And the same thing with doing the one in Hawaii,

1370
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,460
I was like, this is great. These are my greatest fears.

1371
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:01,300
Open water is my greatest fear. And I thought,

1372
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,460
but that's why he gets to feel good about himself because he did those things.

1373
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,500
It's in the hard stuff. It's not the easy stuff.

1374
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,420
That is interesting.

1375
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,500
I certainly agree that it's very hard to be fulfilled.

1376
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,900
If you are not in the service of someone else,

1377
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,020
at some point, you know, in other words,

1378
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,500
I think obviously you have to be in service of many things and others being

1379
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,060
only one of them in service. You know, for many people,

1380
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:25,300
I think that might be part of the relational joy that they experience in having

1381
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,340
kids is for a great period of time, you are in service of those kids.

1382
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,500
In fact,

1383
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,500
sometimes it seems like you're in service of them too much and you don't get a

1384
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,220
break from that,

1385
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,060
but you don't have to have kids to obviously be in service of another person.

1386
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,980
Yeah. I don't know.

1387
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:43,820
I really find this question of fulfillment and true relational joy

1388
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,500
to be interesting. And you know, we're in sort of a weird time, right?

1389
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,540
Because I was talking to a friend of mine who's a psychiatrist.

1390
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,700
I actually hope to have him on the podcast at some point,

1391
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,220
because this is a discussion that it's probably going to be a controversial

1392
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,100
discussion, but I think it's an important one, which is,

1393
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:01,540
is there any evolutionary basis for suicide? So that's question one.

1394
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,900
And the question two is,

1395
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:08,460
do we believe that we are seeing on an age adjusted mortality adjusted basis?

1396
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,580
Are we seeing suicide at a greater extent today than we were before?

1397
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,820
Or is it just that we are paying more attention to it now or it's less?

1398
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,300
But I do wonder is,

1399
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,940
is there any part of civilization that contributes to society?

1400
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,060
And my intuition says, yes,

1401
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,140
that's about the extent to which my knowledge would go on this topic.

1402
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,060
But I want to talk about this with somebody who really thinks broadly about

1403
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:33,020
this because something that is so against our DNA,

1404
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:37,220
like our DNA is pretty geared towards survival. If you think about it,

1405
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,980
maybe at the risk of oversimplifying,

1406
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,300
what pain could be so great that it could override arguably the single most

1407
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,780
primitive drive that our species would have?

1408
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:52,780
And so I think the prevalence of suicide is such that virtually no person I

1409
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,940
knows life hasn't been touched by it, which tells you how ubiquitous it is.

1410
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,380
And it's sort of, you know, you alluded to depression. I mean,

1411
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,060
I just think when people really are honest with themselves,

1412
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,580
like if they haven't thought of killing themselves,

1413
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,180
they've certainly thought life isn't that much fun. And that's,

1414
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,540
that's kind of a sobering thought.

1415
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,620
I've become obsessed with this topic.

1416
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,900
I'm unfortunately not the person you're looking for that has like the real deep

1417
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,900
knowledge, but I will, I will say this.

1418
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,420
I'm not the right person to take any advice from on this topic,

1419
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,420
but follow my logic.

1420
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,500
I think that there's something terrifying happening with the microbiome.

1421
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:34,900
And I think that the potential effects of the microbiome being

1422
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:39,220
one of the massive contributory factors in what feels like,

1423
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:42,300
and again, I don't know, is it just, we're paying attention to it more maybe,

1424
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:46,140
but man, it feels epidemic right now. It's crazy.

1425
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,660
You had Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade killed themselves in the same week.

1426
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,620
I mean, it's like, we can just accept money doesn't solve the problem.

1427
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:55,220
Fame doesn't solve the problem. And so I just started thinking, okay,

1428
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,620
well what are we going through right now?

1429
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,020
Now I am particularly obsessed with the microbiome because of what happened to my

1430
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,780
wife, which I can't remember how much you and I have talked about this.

1431
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,980
No, no, I don't think I know.

1432
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,980
All right. So three years ago, we are on our way to Vegas packed the bags,

1433
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:14,820
baby. I'm on my way. And my wife goes, I'm not feeling well.

1434
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:18,060
I feel funny. And I was like, what does that mean? She's like, I don't know.

1435
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:22,140
I just don't feel right. And then an hour later, she's like, gosh,

1436
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:25,900
I'm feeling kind of nauseous. I think I need to go home. I was like, whoa.

1437
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,580
So she leaves and then she calls me from the parking lot crying. And she's like,

1438
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,740
I just projectile vomited everywhere. I was like, Oh baby, like, wow.

1439
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,940
This crazy, like I can't remember the last time that she threw up. So I was like,

1440
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:40,900
all right, well go home. I'll come down. I'll deal with that. Don't worry.

1441
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:45,580
Just go. She goes home and I think, okay, stomach bug, bad timing, bummer,

1442
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,860
but it didn't go away. And it became,

1443
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,260
she wasn't vomiting anymore, but she couldn't hold on to food. And I was like,

1444
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,620
Ooh, this is getting a little scary.

1445
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:58,060
And it's one of those where like how many people does diarrhea kill? You know,

1446
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:02,340
so I was like really getting paranoid and just nonstop, nonstop, nonstop,

1447
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,820
everything she ate, nothing like would stay. And I was like, whoa,

1448
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:09,340
this is getting really scary. And so we have her microbiome tested and they're

1449
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,860
like, you basically don't have a microbiome. They're like,

1450
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:16,940
it's been so decimated by overuse of antibiotics.

1451
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,340
Cause my wife used to get chronic chest infections.

1452
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:23,860
And so she took antibiotics just in the time that I knew her probably,

1453
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:28,700
I don't know, 12 times. So, and who knows how many before that?

1454
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:31,820
So I mean, she just absolutely murdered it. And then of course,

1455
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,660
the sensor into, if she wasn't clinically depressed,

1456
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:38,820
she was getting real close and just really, really struggling,

1457
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,500
emotionally struggling, physically unable to like maintain a physique.

1458
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,700
Like just, it was crazy.

1459
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:48,140
And so in building it back up and seeing how complicated it is,

1460
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,900
seeing how much it affects the neurochemistry,

1461
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,940
knowing that what 95% of serotonin is stored in the gut. I mean, it's crazy.

1462
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,380
So it just started being this whole thing of like, whoa,

1463
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,900
I think this is wildly underappreciated.

1464
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,500
We started doing a lot of microbiome testing at quest and it was just like, man,

1465
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,700
people's microbiomes, the diversity is just absolutely atrocious.

1466
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:13,020
It's pretty crazy. So whenever I hear something that has to do with neurochemistry,

1467
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,980
I immediately go to, this is a microbiome problem.

1468
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:20,620
So what's changing it then? So in her case, antibiotics might have played a role,

1469
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:25,540
massively restricted eating. So we both had really restrictive diets.

1470
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,540
So remember the whole rabbit starvation, she was doing the same thing.

1471
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:32,220
So just over restriction, over sanitizing hands,

1472
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,860
over washing hands, like never getting anything that's dirty. Yeah.

1473
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:41,220
I mean, just making literally every mistake that you can make with your

1474
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:41,780
microbiome.

1475
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,780
That would suggest because again,

1476
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:48,340
the microbiome in that situation would be a facilitator of an environmental

1477
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:52,180
issue, right? The environmental changes being nutrition,

1478
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,860
overuse of antibiotics, sanitation, things like that.

1479
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:01,420
I also wonder if there are sort of psychological, emotional cues in the

1480
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,620
environment that exacerbate this problem. What do you mean by stress? I mean,

1481
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,140
I hate that word because it's such a sort of loaded term,

1482
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,140
but I wonder if people feel more alone today than they felt a couple hundred

1483
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,620
years ago. You know,

1484
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,340
one of the things you talked about earlier that you were very passionate about

1485
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:22,180
was even though you didn't use the word was kind of your tribe. You know,

1486
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,340
it's funny. People ask me if I'm ever talking about my,

1487
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,700
you know, my training in medicine, they're like, you know,

1488
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:32,700
residency sounded really horrible because you worked about 110 to 115 hours a

1489
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,100
week. You probably slept about, I remember,

1490
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,980
I slept about 28 hours a week, so it was pretty miserable.

1491
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,540
And it's really funny.

1492
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:45,540
I look back at it as one of the fondest five year periods of my life.

1493
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:49,180
And it's despite all of those things, of course, not because of all those things,

1494
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:52,100
but part of it was just the camaraderie. I mean,

1495
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:57,380
just brotherhood and some sisterhood, right? I mean,

1496
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:02,380
there was just amazing male and female residents that you were in the trenches

1497
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:07,700
with. And it was a shared sense of purpose, a shared sense of mastery,

1498
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,420
a shared sense of suffering.

1499
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:15,460
But I wonder if outside of places like the military and residency and start-up

1500
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,300
companies, which are places where you see a lot of that camaraderie,

1501
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,180
are we losing that more broadly?

1502
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,580
And was that something we were wired to experience?

1503
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,700
That's really interesting.

1504
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,180
And another thing that really interests me is the way that culture stacks.

1505
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:35,140
So if you had X amount of expectation on your shoulder to succeed,

1506
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:37,260
then you give that to your kids plus some,

1507
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,940
and then they give that to their kids plus some.

1508
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,580
And when I think like how much my parents drug me around and that seemed crazy,

1509
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,740
but then I see how much parents drag their kids around now,

1510
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,620
that's one of the reasons I don't have kids. I was like,

1511
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,420
if that's the expectation, I'm not prepared to be a chauffeur.

1512
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:54,340
So it just gets crazy. The amount, like the, the level of sort of,

1513
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,100
and look, I'm a freak for efficiency,

1514
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,100
but the level of like clinical efficiency that people work into their lives,

1515
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,700
where there is no more play.

1516
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:04,340
Like one thing I will tell you that my wife and I are really good about with

1517
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:08,220
each other is reminding ourselves not to lose playfulness. Because look,

1518
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:11,500
when I came into business, I needed to toughen up. I needed to get harder.

1519
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,380
That's just true. My personality.

1520
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:17,940
And so as I did that and became more powerful, more self-assured,

1521
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,180
like it was amazing, but I started to harden.

1522
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,020
Like everything about me was just harder.

1523
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,620
Like my wife would be telling a story and I'd be like, get to the punch line,

1524
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,700
which is a terrible thing to do in your marriage, by the way.

1525
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:31,500
And she was like, you just gotten harder. Like you need to be playful.

1526
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,580
Like loosen up used to be goofy. And so yeah, it's interesting.

1527
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,660
Like how much of that stuff is,

1528
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:41,620
as we shape each other and we shape the society and we talk about things like

1529
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,820
terraforming Mars, but then all of a sudden, like, fuck,

1530
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,380
you've got to give your life over to terraform Mars.

1531
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:50,860
Like if you want to be the next Elon Musk, he set the bar so high that it's like,

1532
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,660
where, where is that breaking point where there's,

1533
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,020
there's no more natural off switch. You've got your phone all the time.

1534
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,980
There's no natural break where it's like, well, there's no electricity.

1535
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:04,740
So when I'm in the cave, like there's nothing left to do or it's the weekend.

1536
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,740
There are no phones, there is no email. So everybody's gone home.

1537
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,020
So there's no work to be done.

1538
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:13,380
So there were all these natural sort of kill points that I don't really exist

1539
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,340
anymore. And look, I'm the biggest violator of all.

1540
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,220
I love to work.

1541
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:21,900
My problem is people apply this stuff when they don't even love it that much.

1542
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,420
And so now they're just working around the clock.

1543
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:26,100
It's something that drains them. That gets scary fast.

1544
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:31,140
What routines or rituals do you have around protecting yourself to,

1545
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,020
you know, maintain a creative environment? I mean,

1546
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:39,020
do you have forced downtime or forced time away from work?

1547
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,220
I'm guessing exercise is still very important to you. I mean,

1548
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:47,220
what sort of routines do you enact to make sure you can function at your best

1549
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,660
longitudinally?

1550
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,340
Well to make sure that I function at my best, I optimize cognitively.

1551
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:55,580
So my diet is like thing number one, I don't fuck around with my diet.

1552
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:00,580
My diet is on point and I work out five days a week and that is hugely

1553
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,740
important. I hate it. Absolutely hate the gym,

1554
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,380
but it's critically important to strength, longevity,

1555
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,700
and cognitive optimization. Why do you hate the gym?

1556
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,900
It hurts is the honest answer. That's part one.

1557
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,420
Part two is dude,

1558
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,180
remember the whole thing I want to live forever because there's so many things

1559
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,740
I want to do that I love that every minute I'm in the gym is a minute.

1560
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:23,420
I'm not doing something that I would really intrinsically love like in and of

1561
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:27,060
itself. The moment is fun in the gym. I love the result.

1562
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:31,820
I love being able to say I do hard things, but in the moment it's just pain.

1563
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:34,740
It's lactic acid building up. It's heavy weights.

1564
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,500
It's the disappointment of not being able to lift a weight that you've been

1565
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,380
trying to get. It's like everything about it is meeting my limitations.

1566
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:45,700
Even if it's just the limitation of I can only do so many reps in a given set

1567
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,460
for a given weight. And it's like, I literally failed to do this thing.

1568
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:54,660
So the act of being in the gym for me is anathema to the things that I love.

1569
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:01,060
It's ugly. It's not even beautiful. So it's like iron and weights. Oh God.

1570
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,300
Like I'm always surprised that I have to explain that to people.

1571
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:07,260
Do you enjoy the gym? Me? Yeah, I do. Yeah. My wife loves the gym.

1572
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,620
You're both crazy to me. Like whatever endorphin rush you're getting,

1573
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:15,900
you're not getting like it is everything about it in the moment is unpleasurable.

1574
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,900
It's interesting. I wonder why I enjoy it.

1575
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:21,620
I guess we all get the things that are easy for us. And for me, fortunately,

1576
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:25,980
exercise comes easily in terms of it really requires no discipline.

1577
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,300
Now, sometimes it's a bit of a challenge as far as time management.

1578
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,900
And sometimes I don't feel like exercising,

1579
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,060
but it's always for the reason you just described,

1580
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:38,500
which is I've really got this other thing to do and it's really pressing.

1581
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:41,460
But let's be fair. If you said to me, Peter,

1582
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:45,260
I'd like you to go swim the Catalina channel next year that I have no desire to

1583
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,820
do again. I have no desire to spend, you know,

1584
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,340
what probably amounted to 20,

1585
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:55,460
24 hours a week in the ocean swimming as part of the training. I mean,

1586
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,660
that, that I don't have a desire to do, but,

1587
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,300
but I really do enjoy deadlifting,

1588
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,740
which is not to say it's not unpleasant.

1589
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:06,460
And it's not to say that it also makes me upset when I can't do it.

1590
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,780
So I, I certainly understand all of those things. I mean,

1591
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,340
so I have this thing where part of my shtick and longevity is rule.

1592
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:16,380
Number one is don't get hurt, right? So it's like exercise matters,

1593
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:20,980
but like don't be an idiot. And so, you know,

1594
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:24,380
one of the things I've been fortunate to develop over the years with the help of

1595
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:28,940
a lot of great physical therapists, trainers and such is a really good sense of

1596
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:31,780
the cues that tell you something's not right that day.

1597
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:35,500
So I'm getting pretty good at knowing when my glutes are not firing.

1598
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:41,020
And when I'm dumping the weight into my sacroiliac joint or into my lumbar

1599
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,220
spine. And so even to this day,

1600
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:50,740
about one out of every five times I go to deadlift I abort.

1601
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,820
Really? Yup. That's smart. So I'll go, you know, I warm up bar,

1602
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,140
135, 185, 225, 275,

1603
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:02,780
315 is always the warmup. And if on the way up that ladder,

1604
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:07,140
I don't feel perfect, like perfect.

1605
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:12,140
All glute, basically doing the work, nothing loading into my lower back.

1606
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:17,420
If I don't feel that we're done. And honestly, I think at least out of,

1607
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:21,380
yeah, probably one every five sessions we just abort.

1608
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,340
And that pisses me off. I mean,

1609
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,140
truthfully I get really pissed for like another couple hours. I'm like,

1610
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,340
I can't believe I didn't get the deadlift.

1611
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,660
I got to wait a whole week to try this again, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1612
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,180
And I have the same rule with squatting.

1613
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:35,540
You got a candidate if you can't do it, but now go back to nutrition.

1614
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:37,500
Tell me about what is dialed in for you mean?

1615
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:42,260
So I'm on just whole foods whenever humanly possible.

1616
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:45,020
So I try to vary my sources.

1617
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,620
So I'll have a wide variety of vegetables,

1618
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:52,060
constituting a very diverse color array.

1619
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,220
I eat a lot of eggs.

1620
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,620
I have a lot of fat in my diet,

1621
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:59,780
primarily from olives and olive oil.

1622
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,700
Those are the big fat.

1623
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:04,100
And then I do eat a fair amount of red meat. That would be,

1624
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,300
I guess philosophically,

1625
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,380
some people believe it's to be a higher carcinogenic meat.

1626
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,980
I'll say this, I'm not the right person to take advice on it,

1627
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,940
but I have no fears about that.

1628
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:18,820
I get a lot of my fat from that as well. And then yeah, that's it.

1629
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:22,700
Like whole food cycle between beef,

1630
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:26,540
chicken, some lamb, a little bit of pork,

1631
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:30,180
and just try to keep it quote unquote clean, high fat, low carb.

1632
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:34,460
And I never cheat. Not never, but wow, it's rare twice a year, maybe.

1633
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,820
And then it's not like some debaucherous day. It's like a meal.

1634
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,340
What do you do as far as meal timing, fasting, things like that?

1635
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,420
Yeah. So I also do a lot of fasting.

1636
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,940
So I do a lot of intermittent fasting,

1637
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:49,980
but then also at least once a year I'll do a five day fast and that's water

1638
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:54,820
only. It's not like a Ramadan style water only fast, fast, fast for five days.

1639
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,020
That's been big.

1640
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:59,740
What do you feel when you do the five day water only fast anger,

1641
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:04,220
a lot of hatred? No, the big thing I to be fair,

1642
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,060
what I love about fasting is that it's hard as hell.

1643
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,500
And I know that I'm going to stick with it.

1644
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,660
So there's like so much just like juice that comes from that.

1645
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:16,460
But the reality is the first two days are easy by day three.

1646
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,260
The problem is mostly boredom.

1647
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:22,340
And what I've realized is I get a lot of dopamine hits from no,

1648
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,620
Oh, I'm going to eat like here comes this meal. I love this meal.

1649
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,700
It's going to be awesome. And there's none of that.

1650
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,660
So your day doesn't have those like excitement markers in it.

1651
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:33,100
So for me, the big problem is, and then also by day four,

1652
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,940
I do start slowing down, even though I'm fully keto adapted,

1653
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,300
I'm posting awesome numbers.

1654
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,780
I'll get into the threes when I'm doing a five day fast.

1655
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,940
So it's like my machinery is there.

1656
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,340
I usually do a cycle of keto leading up to a fast.

1657
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:49,300
So I'm already primed to burn fat. So it's not that it's just,

1658
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:54,460
I do feel less energetic. So, and I don't know if I just am not a great

1659
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:58,540
fat burner or if I'm able to, I don't use the ketones as official.

1660
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,980
I don't know. But by day four, I'm like, yeah, I'm 20% off my normal.

1661
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:07,020
Like I go, go, go. Now it's not like anybody around me notices.

1662
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,940
I just know that it takes, I have to push my energy out more.

1663
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,500
It's not just naturally there for me.

1664
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,900
How does your body composition change in that five days?

1665
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,540
I'll lose fat for sure. How much weight do you lose in the sky?

1666
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,020
I'd probably, I've never weighed myself.

1667
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:22,500
I know better cause I can get super myopically focused on the scale.

1668
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:27,420
I'm going to guess call it like three to four pounds probably.

1669
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,180
That's it. Yeah. That's interesting.

1670
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:33,020
I lose more than that just doing a five day FMD. Really?

1671
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,820
So that's like the, you know, 750 calories a day,

1672
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,420
it's a thousand the first day and then 750 for four days. Yeah. I can lose.

1673
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:42,980
Now that said, it depends on the nutritional state I enter.

1674
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,820
So if I come in relatively carb fed, yeah,

1675
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:50,740
I'll lose 10 pounds in five days. But of course, much of that is water.

1676
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:55,660
So each gram of glycogen is carrying around four grams of water.

1677
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,860
So as you, if you take your glycogen stores down to 50% of baseline,

1678
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:03,060
you think about how much glycogen that is plus how much water it is plus the

1679
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,260
plasma reduction. It's interesting. I mean,

1680
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:09,060
I think it probably speaks to the fact that you're entering at a pretty lean

1681
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,780
state. If you're only losing three or four pounds in a five day fast.

1682
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:15,980
Yeah. And I don't do, I never carb load ever unless it's like Christmas and you

1683
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:18,660
know, I have a snack or dessert or something there, but.

1684
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,540
You know, it's so interesting.

1685
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:23,380
People assume because of all the time I've spent in ketosis and all of the stuff

1686
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,860
I've written about it that I don't like carbs, but it's like,

1687
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,580
it'd be hard to find a person who likes carbs more than me.

1688
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:31,700
Like I've never really met a carb I didn't like.

1689
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:36,700
I just freaking love them. Like I can eat plain white rice.

1690
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:41,260
Like I could eat a bathtub full of plain white rice. I just freaking love it.

1691
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,780
I was going to challenge you because I love me some carbs, but yeah, not,

1692
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,700
I'm not going to eat plain white rice. You got me beat.

1693
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,540
I hand the crown willingly over.

1694
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,780
And then when you do, I F how often are you doing that?

1695
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:57,060
If I'm in a ketogenic cycle, I do I F the entire time.

1696
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,260
So let's say I do one week protein, one week keto.

1697
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,380
That's pretty typical for me. So,

1698
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,980
and I just bounced back and forth because I find if I do too many consecutive

1699
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,780
weeks where I'm actually posting ketones in my blood,

1700
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,660
that I do start to notice the softening of my muscles.

1701
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,900
And so I just don't feel as hard.

1702
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,740
So I tend not to stay ketogenic for long, but I'll bounce back and forth.

1703
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,180
So you're saying you'll go a week of ketosis,

1704
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:22,420
which is obviously restrictive in carbohydrate and protein. Correct.

1705
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:23,860
And then on your protein week,

1706
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:27,220
do you mean you're adding both carbon protein back in or mostly just protein?

1707
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,700
Just protein. And so on your own protein week,

1708
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,900
how many grams a day of protein are you getting? Ooh,

1709
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:35,420
it's been a while since I counted. Now I just steer by my blood and how I feel.

1710
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,500
I probably throw in,

1711
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,500
I'll add from what I'm normally doing. I'll add 40 grams of protein.

1712
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,980
It's about right. That's really interesting. Cause that's not that much.

1713
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:48,940
So let's say in ketosis, you're walking around at a hundred grams,

1714
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:52,980
you'd go up to 140, correct, which would be enough to knock you out.

1715
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:55,620
And do you reduce your fat intake during the off week?

1716
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:59,140
Sort of unintentionally. Yeah. When I, yeah, when I'm high protein,

1717
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:02,340
it'll come down just cause the calories are being replaced with protein.

1718
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:06,820
And okay. So yeah, what I'd asked you was, where does your IF fit into that?

1719
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:11,060
Are you IFing during the ketone week, but not the non-ketone? Correct. Correct.

1720
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:15,820
Because I find it so easy to intermittent fast when I'm ketogenic and I find it a

1721
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,260
little more distracting. I always do.

1722
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,780
Like I never eat in less than a 12 hour window. So,

1723
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,420
but I don't consider that intermittent fasting.

1724
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,260
I only consider it intermittent fasting if I go all the way to 16 hours without

1725
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,980
food. My average day, even when I don't consider it, I F I eat my last meal at

1726
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:36,180
six and then I eat my first meal at eight. That's typical for me.

1727
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:40,060
So what's that 14 hours? So my typical day is a 14 hour gap.

1728
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,100
And then, how deliberate are you about your sleep?

1729
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:47,340
Very, I'm a psycho about sleep. So I'm in bed by 9 PM every night.

1730
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,940
Like it's a religion Monday through Friday on Saturday, I'm a little looser,

1731
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:54,220
but yeah, I get to bed. I don't use an alarm. I sleep as much as I need.

1732
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,220
I wake up when I wake up. It is what it is.

1733
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:00,940
And I have been doing that now for like 16 years. So that's critical.

1734
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,700
I do being tired is a unique form of misery.

1735
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,580
You are worse at everything you do.

1736
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,540
And so for somebody who's trying to optimize cognitively,

1737
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,620
like I'm trying to get as much done as humanly possible.

1738
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:13,780
If I don't get sleep, then I'm just slower. So I'm like,

1739
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:18,020
I was better off spending the time sleeping and then just being more efficient

1740
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,180
with the time that I was awake.

1741
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,780
That's a hard thing to explain to some people because you know,

1742
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:25,100
certainly theoretically what you describe makes sense.

1743
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,580
But I think a lot of people say, look, at the end of the day,

1744
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:33,020
if you're going to give me four more hours to work and I'll sleep four hours

1745
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,020
instead of eight, how can that be worse?

1746
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,220
There was a study that was done at the University of Chicago a couple of years

1747
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,980
ago. It's a pretty good study, very small study,

1748
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,180
but it was very well controlled study.

1749
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:45,540
They took a group of healthy volunteers and did euglycemic insulin clamps on them,

1750
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,780
which is of course the gold standard for measuring glucose disposal.

1751
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:52,380
So they did the study there. They did the euglycemic clamp,

1752
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,300
and then they restricted their sleep to four hours a night for 14 consecutive

1753
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,300
days. So basically they did for two weeks,

1754
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,220
what we did in residency for five years.

1755
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,020
And then they controlled what they were eating during that experiment.

1756
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:08,940
So the result I'm about to describe was not simply the result of that they

1757
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,180
ate more during that time.

1758
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,660
But when they repeated the euglycemic clamps,

1759
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:16,220
their glucose disposal had fallen by 50%.

1760
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:21,220
So they became about twice as insulin resistant with getting four hours

1761
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,980
of sleep a night for just two weeks. Whoa.

1762
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,660
This is but one study.

1763
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,460
There are other studies that have looked at other elements of this.

1764
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:33,340
And I sort of assumed that the extra fatness I got in

1765
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:36,740
residency was just due to my dietary deterioration.

1766
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:41,940
But I now believe that it was also in large part due to the lack of sleep.

1767
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:47,100
The other thing is it's very difficult to consolidate memory with sleep

1768
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,220
deprivation. The hippocampus is very sensitive to this.

1769
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,700
And of course that's where we consolidate memory.

1770
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:57,700
So I'm kind of amazed at the gaps I have in my memory from that period of my life.

1771
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,780
Yeah. When you said that,

1772
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:01,820
that you look back on it as one of the best periods of your life,

1773
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,780
how do you remember it? Like when I get that fatigued and the funny thing is I'm

1774
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:09,740
the same with film school. It's the same thing. You just know sleep, dude.

1775
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,700
It's ridiculous.

1776
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:17,020
And at the end of that, like the bonding is intense because you're all going

1777
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,460
through this hard thing. You're having to help each other.

1778
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,900
You're all exhausted, but you find a way through. It's amazing.

1779
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,980
And then in the end, I was like, Jesus,

1780
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:26,180
there are just patches where I'm like, I don't remember, man.

1781
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,580
Cause you're so tired. It's crazy.

1782
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,780
So do you meditate? Do you have a practice around spirituality?

1783
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,700
Ooh, it's interesting. You think of meditation as spiritual.

1784
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:38,220
So I meditate like a fiend. It totally changed my life.

1785
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,660
And I don't know where I would have been in my more stressful years without it.

1786
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:46,660
I'm so grateful. And for a long time, because I'm a fool,

1787
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:50,940
I didn't meditate and didn't want to, didn't want to hear about it.

1788
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:54,580
Sounded so feminine. Like I was a guy really needed to toughen up,

1789
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:58,780
which is weird. This come up like three times in this. And so, yeah,

1790
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,740
I just resisted it. And then I met a Navy SEAL and they marked divine on a

1791
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,180
few of her of them amazing dude.

1792
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,700
And he was like, stop being a jackass meditate.

1793
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:09,060
And so I went and watched his videos and I thought, all right, if it's, you know,

1794
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,540
a Navy SEAL, tough guy, uh, let me give this a shot. And I was like, whoa,

1795
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:17,780
once I understood it's taking me out of the sympathetic nervous system into the

1796
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:21,540
parasympathetic and that diaphragm breathing actually causes that trigger to

1797
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:26,140
happen, that it's mechanistic. I was like, okay, all of a sudden I get this.

1798
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,300
So isn't woo woo.

1799
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:32,180
This is like some hard biology and allowed me to really begin to train

1800
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,460
down because I am incredibly anxious by nature.

1801
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,420
And when I was in business and constantly out of my element and learning,

1802
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,540
and I was always behind, I developed just massive anxiety.

1803
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:46,140
And so I had to find a way to like figure that shit out.

1804
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,020
And so meditation has been just inhumanly helpful.

1805
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,980
So now if I'm like about to go on stage or something guaranteed,

1806
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,500
if they're like doing the announcement, I am meditating.

1807
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,820
Diaphragm breathing, getting into a nice calm state.

1808
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:03,980
Like it is crazy to me how well it works. And now like I'm an evangelical for

1809
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:06,100
this. I want to bite the microphone. So people will listen.

1810
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,420
If they haven't tried meditation, like it is such a game changer,

1811
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,860
such a game changer. Cause it gets rid of what I call the background radiation,

1812
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,020
like all that just sort of residual stress.

1813
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:18,900
You're not even sure what you're stressed about. You just feel uneasy, something,

1814
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:23,900
something's looming. And so meditating, even on my worst day,

1815
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:28,860
I can get to absolute zero where I am totally stress and anxiety free just from

1816
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:32,100
breathing. It's crazy. Do you have a mindfulness component to that? In other

1817
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,860
words, are you doing a breath meditation where while you are breathing,

1818
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:41,060
you are focusing on a component of the breath or is it more a concentration

1819
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:43,580
thing where you have like, you know, sort of a mantra in the back?

1820
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,340
All breath, all breath, 100%.

1821
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,220
I don't remember who said this. It might've been Sam Harris,

1822
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,660
but it might've been somebody else.

1823
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,380
And I reflected on it and realized it's,

1824
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,540
it's very interesting and it's quite true that if you ever consider a negatively

1825
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,620
valence to motion.

1826
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:01,740
So the reason I throw in the word valence is because some people get all bent

1827
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:05,060
out of shape when you say an emotion is positive versus negative.

1828
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,300
So just so no one gets bent out of shape,

1829
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,740
I'll just say negative versus positively valenced.

1830
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:15,220
None of them are really rooted in the present. So depression, sadness, anxiety,

1831
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:18,940
fear. When you think of all of the negatively valence to motions,

1832
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:23,940
they are virtually all rooted in the past or in anticipation of the future.

1833
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,260
And I think it was the realization of that and the desire to sort of drown out

1834
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:36,060
some of those things that got me very interested in mindfulness meditation,

1835
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:39,900
which was this notion of being as present as possible.

1836
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:43,780
And I even took it to really interesting depths of,

1837
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:47,660
I don't think Sam made this point, but somebody made this point, which was,

1838
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,980
even pain,

1839
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:55,060
physical pain that we endure is actually more about the anticipation of worsening

1840
01:29:56,060 --> 01:30:01,060
pain or progression of that pain or non cessation of that pain than it is the

1841
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:04,900
actual moment. And I was like, that can't be right.

1842
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:09,820
So Josh is my body worker. So one day Josh is working on me and there's this one

1843
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:13,660
move he does on me that is quite literally upsetting.

1844
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:19,100
It's when he gets into my serratus and my subscapularis and it's unbearable on

1845
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,660
many levels.

1846
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:23,780
Definitely there's some nerve impingement going on when he's getting in there.

1847
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,940
He's probably like yanking on some of the hairs on my armpit or something.

1848
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:30,220
It's just the whole thing is unbearable. And one day when he was doing it,

1849
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,940
I was like, all right, try the exercise,

1850
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:38,660
focus on your breath and focus on the pain at exactly that moment,

1851
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:41,780
but don't think about how much it's going to hurt in two more minutes.

1852
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,660
Just think about it in that moment.

1853
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:48,540
And I was totally amazed by that experience and it was like a very interesting

1854
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:53,540
tool that I have since continued to experiment with any time I find myself in

1855
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:55,060
extreme pain,

1856
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:59,100
especially pain that sort of lasts for a long period of time.

1857
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:03,020
And it definitely makes me understand that there are probably people out there

1858
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:07,020
who can have total mind control over pain. Speaking of mind control,

1859
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:10,620
I remember the first time you came over for dinner,

1860
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,220
you guys came all the way down from LA down to San Diego. We all had dinner.

1861
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:17,980
And I remember you talking about mind control. You were like,

1862
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:21,660
I want you to come and work for quest because I just have mind control over you

1863
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,420
and some shit like that. Do you remember that?

1864
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,740
So how do you think about that? Have you refined your thinking around mind

1865
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,580
control?

1866
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:33,620
Yeah, I think that really comes down to energy output.

1867
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:35,340
I think that you really can.

1868
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:40,340
It's almost distressing how much you can move people in a

1869
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:43,580
direction you want them moved. If you're willing to put in the time and the

1870
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:48,580
energy, but you really have to play a super long game and oftentimes not worry

1871
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:53,220
about what's their best interest. And that just does not suit my personality.

1872
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,460
So I found that far better to think about like,

1873
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:00,340
who are the people that are resonant with what I'm doing, right?

1874
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,020
Here's what I'm doing. Put it out there, tell people, get them excited,

1875
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:05,380
show them my excitement, let them understand my vision,

1876
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:09,180
where I'm trying to go and then go, okay, of these, you know,

1877
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:12,420
20 people that I would love to do something with who's the one that steps

1878
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,260
forward and says, I want to do that with you.

1879
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,420
That to me is far more interesting.

1880
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:21,100
So I used to say, and this is what you're thinking about on a long enough timeline,

1881
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,300
I can get anyone to do anything.

1882
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,140
And I just don't even think about it like that anymore.

1883
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:29,140
Even if that's true. And maybe it is like, if you give me a hundred years,

1884
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:32,500
like maybe nobody can resist, you know, my wily charms,

1885
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,860
but it just stops being interesting. It's like,

1886
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:38,140
I want to do stuff with people that want to do it.

1887
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:41,100
I want to do it with people that are excited about it. And so, yeah,

1888
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,300
I take a really different approach now.

1889
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,420
And my thing now is about sharing the vision.

1890
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:49,100
Here's what I'm trying to do. Embody the excitement.

1891
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,500
Cause I know how infectious it is neurologically.

1892
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,980
I know that it, we really do share energies.

1893
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:55,860
And if you're around somebody and you're amped up,

1894
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,180
like they're going to pick up on that.

1895
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:58,900
They're going to get more energetic.

1896
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:02,260
And I just know that people like to be around people that make them feel more

1897
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,260
alive, that make them feel better about themselves, that feel energized.

1898
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,300
So finding people like that.

1899
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:12,340
And then I am just really not a fan of having to be a raw, raw leader.

1900
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:16,860
Like I want to play my part in the creation of whatever we're creating as well.

1901
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:20,340
So I would much rather do that, like create the environment,

1902
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:23,740
create the enthusiasm, show people, we're trying to do this and it matters.

1903
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,900
And you're going to be able to get that fulfillment that we talked about.

1904
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:28,100
It's going to be hard as hell, but we're going to be able to do it.

1905
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,500
Like I want to create that environment and then go and fight too.

1906
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:34,220
So that's far more interesting than having to like, you know,

1907
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:38,020
Jedi mind tricks and shit and like trying to really understand what you want

1908
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,100
and make sure I'm setting things up so that you're getting that.

1909
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,580
And I'm always just thinking about you, man, far better to say,

1910
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,060
this is the environment. This is what we're doing. Who wants in?

1911
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,860
But I'm sad that you never came to work for quest.

1912
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:52,540
I did really want that badly. Dude. Yeah. Like,

1913
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,340
I know people are listening to this podcast right now because they believe in

1914
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:58,140
you, but I'm just saying that belief is well placed.

1915
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:01,500
You are one of the most intriguing human beings I have ever met the way your

1916
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,180
mind works. I almost stopped you earlier.

1917
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,860
So you were saying something that's so fucking interesting that I was like,

1918
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:09,900
just the way you think through a problem captures my imagination.

1919
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:14,620
So they're just some people, dude, I have a total man crush on your brain.

1920
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:15,940
It's amazing.

1921
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,220
Well, I appreciate that very much, Tom.

1922
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,900
And I can't thank you enough for making the time today. And I,

1923
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:27,980
I really want to apologize for the fact that you're doing this before I'm doing

1924
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:31,620
your show. And I'm, I promise you, I will, uh,

1925
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,420
if you still want me to be on, I'd be honored.

1926
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,260
I'd be honored to be on and I can't wait to,

1927
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,020
I don't know how I'm going to top this.

1928
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:40,220
I don't know what you'll ask me about. That's interesting, but

1929
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:43,180
Oh, that, that will be fun. Trust me. We will crush that.

1930
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,860
I would have you on in a second. So whenever we can make that happen,

1931
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:46,740
we'll, we'll make it happen.

1932
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:50,660
And anybody listening to this that likes themselves and Peter Attia,

1933
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,780
you will want to hear that interview because I promise I will take this guy to

1934
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,260
some very interesting places.

1935
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:59,300
So where can people learn more about you if they're listening to this and they're

1936
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:03,580
new to you at Tom bill you. So my last name is spelled B as in Bravo,

1937
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:07,620
I L Y E U it's across all socials.

1938
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:12,820
My primary two are going to be Instagram and YouTube. So, yeah,

1939
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:15,420
you have a pretty prominent YouTube channel, don't you? Dude,

1940
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:19,020
I'm proud of that damn thing. So YouTube is hard to win at.

1941
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,980
It is hard to build a meaningful audience and we've done a really great job and

1942
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,860
it's just growing crazy. By the time people hear this,

1943
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:27,820
I'm sure we'll have crossed 400,000. Wow. Yeah.

1944
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:30,700
I didn't realize it was that big. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really,

1945
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:35,060
really been special and we just pour our heart and souls into making an awesome

1946
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,540
show and getting people like you on the show. No BS. Like I'm just really,

1947
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:41,780
really proud of what we've done there. And one of my favorite stories.

1948
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:46,820
So I'm walking in a Vegas casino and a 51 year old

1949
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:51,500
black man jumps out in front of me crying. And he was like, dude,

1950
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,540
you changed my life. And I thought this is the world we live in now.

1951
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:58,140
Like you can make content, like here's the thing.

1952
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:02,180
And I think it goes without saying I'm not paid to be on the show.

1953
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:05,660
I'm on this show because I believe in you and I believe in what you're going to

1954
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,540
bring to people.

1955
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:10,340
And I think this is going to be special and I'm so glad that you did it because

1956
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:15,180
meeting you once randomly changed my life.

1957
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:19,940
The fact that you're going to make yourself available through the show to the

1958
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,660
millions of people that I hope find this, it's incredible.

1959
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:27,260
Like what an insane time that we live where extraordinary people can be

1960
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:29,860
rewarded for sharing that kind of stuff. Jesus, dude,

1961
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:34,020
I know how much you charge to be a concierge client. So like it is crazy.

1962
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:38,140
Like it's so amazing. So yeah, I love it. I love what we've done with YouTube.

1963
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,660
I love them. Proud of the show, just called impact theory.

1964
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:44,900
Just the people that have come on and shared their wisdom is bananas.

1965
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,100
Thank you, Tom.
