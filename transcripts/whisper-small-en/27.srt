00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,400

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Hi everyone, welcome to this week's edition of the Peter Attia drive.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,980
I'm Peter Attia.

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,680
This week, my guest is Professor David Sinclair.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,520
He's a professor in the department of genetics at Harvard Medical School, and he is the co-director

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,640
of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
David Hale's from Australia.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,340
That'll take you about 10 seconds into our interview to figure out.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,340
He did his PhD in molecular genetics at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,400
And it was at that time that he met the man that would go on to become his mentor.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
We talk a lot about him, and this is a guy, Lenny, who's actually come up on other podcasts,

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,020
so I won't get into him now.

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,320
But nevertheless, David met Lenny and decided he wanted to come to MIT to study with him,

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,200
which is what he did.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,260
And David has gone on to become one of the pioneers in a particular field of aging that

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,200
focuses on a class of molecules known as sirtuins.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sure many of you have heard of sirtuins, but you might not entirely be clear on what

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,460
sirtuins are.

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,880
I won't obviously make any attempt to do that here in the intro because we spend so much

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,200
time talking about that during this episode.

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,320
The other thing that David is really quite famous for is his role in the discovery of

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,280
a molecule or class of molecules that stimulates sirtuins.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,580
And by the time you get through this episode, you will understand why that may be a desirable

33
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,740
thing to do.

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,300
And among these, the most famous is one called resveratrol.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,440
Of course, resveratrol came to fame probably a little over a decade ago when it was noted

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,040
at least in one study, in one type of animal model, to promote a longevity phenotype.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
And of course, what really made it interesting, at least for the lay press, was that resveratrol

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,480
is found in very low concentrations in the skin of grapes.

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,920
And therefore the logic went, hey, grapes make wine, wine contains resveratrol, wine

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
makes you live longer.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
Hallelujah, the French paradox has been resolved.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
Slight spoiler alert, that's not true, but we get into the whys that might be the case.

43
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,120
This episode, we only had, when I say only, meaning we had less than two hours, but like

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,600
has happened in other podcasts, including the one with Rhonda Patrick.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,320
After we closed the podcast, because I wanted to be respectful of David's time, he had to

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,560
catch a flight to New York right after we spoke.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
This interview took place in Boston.

48
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,280
We ended up talking for another 15 minutes.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,360
And unfortunately, that 15 minutes was some of the most intense, detailed, nuanced discussions

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
of it.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,960
And I left thinking, gosh, I wish we had more time to talk.

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
So I suspect David and I will speak again.

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,360
David has a book coming out next year, and I think that'll provide another great opportunity

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
to sit back down with him.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
In this episode, we talk a lot about his postdoc at MIT.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,200
He came out of a powerhouse lab that has produced other notable folks that, including folks

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,980
we've already interviewed, like Matt Kaberlin and folks we've talked about, like Brian Kennedy.

58
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,640
We talk about his contribution to the understanding of Sertuins, which was something that was

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,040
coming out of Lenny's lab.

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,300
And David really picked that up and ran with it.

61
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
What are these things?

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
What do they do?

63
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,820
What are the roles in aging, DNA repair, gene silencing?

64
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
We go over all this stuff in detail.

65
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,620
We talk a lot about NAD and its precursors, specifically something called NMN.

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,420
So if you are listening to this and you are in the camp of trying to understand how to

67
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,100
make heads or tails of NAD, NR, NMN, I think this episode will be helpful.

68
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,420
Tragically, it was not until 24 hours after we did this episode that I ran into George

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,820
Vlesic on an airplane who mentioned to me a paper by Josh Rabinowitz in Cell Metabolism

70
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,400
that came out about a month before we did this interview that we will link to that I

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,820
think makes a very compelling case for the futility of orally administered versions of

72
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,820
these precursors.

73
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,900
And that would have been a really interesting discussion to have with David because of his

74
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
expertise in this.

75
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,660
So at some point, I'll probably want to interview Josh and we'll go into that in really detail.

76
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,260
Because again, unless you've been up in the Himalayas hunting Yeti, you're probably aware

77
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,880
that these are kind of the hottest supplements out there.

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,580
We talk a lot about NAD levels.

79
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,620
What do these things mean?

80
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,620
Where does it go?

81
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
Where is it produced?

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,740
We again, as I alluded to above, talk about resveratrol and its potential in life extension.

83
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,380
We talk about the connection then between sirtuins and NAD.

84
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,800
We talk about his rationale for what he does.

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,660
So David is actually very open about kind of the stuff that he does personally, including

86
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,680
the fact that he takes resveratrol and metformin and NMN himself.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,400
We also go into the differences between some of these molecules and again, a little bit

88
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
to his book.

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
There's a lot of stuff in here.

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,680
Again, sometimes it gets technical.

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Sometimes it doesn't.

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,640
The show notes as always will provide a lot of help.

93
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,960
So if you have any questions about papers we reference, the likelihood that they're

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
in the show notes is actually quite high.

95
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,800
Also, if you haven't signed up for our weekly email list and you wouldn't mind getting an

96
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,440
email from me once a week, I suggest you head on over to the website, peterteamd.com and

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
sign up.

98
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
All I promise to you is to make it as non-lame as possible.

99
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,840
And finally, if you are enjoying these podcasts, please head on over to iTunes and write a

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
review there.

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,400
And again, I would hope that you like the podcast and leave a positive review, but I

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,760
guess in the spirit of getting as much feedback as possible, if you don't like it and you

103
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,320
have something to say that we can do to make it better, that's probably not an unreasonable

104
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,780
place to leave that kind of feedback.

105
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,840
So with all that said, please welcome to my interview with Professor David Sinclair.

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Good afternoon, David.

107
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Good afternoon, David.

108
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Nice to be here, Peter.

109
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,120
Thank you for making time today.

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,680
I gathered only by the commotion in this very busy place we're in that there's a lot going

111
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,760
on here and making time to speak with somebody as inconsequential as I am is a big ask.

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,440
So I am incredibly grateful.

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm pleased to be on.

114
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,360
We were introduced by a mutual friend who's no stranger to people listening to this because

115
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,080
I've had him on before, David Sabatini.

116
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,760
And maybe a month ago, maybe a little more than that, I said, David, you know, I really

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,000
want to know more about Sirtuans and who do you recommend that I speak with?

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,240
And he said, well, I think David Sinclair would be perfect.

119
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
So he reached out to you and you very graciously agreed to speak.

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,440
So again, I thank you for that.

121
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,560
And I'm really excited to talk about something that I know very little about, as you will

122
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
undoubtedly learn in the next hour or so.

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,160
Well, yeah, that's kind of David.

124
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,440
As you know, and probably the listeners know as well, he's a bit of a superstar.

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,160
It's kind of him.

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,800
I'll have to, you know, send him a note for that.

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,320
But no, honestly, it's really great to be on because I know you delve into the details

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,280
of the science more than anyone I've heard.

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,440
And I'm excited to be able to share that with listeners.

130
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Well, yeah, that's the part that's got me excited.

131
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,200
So a lot of times I've listened to talks that you've given and I can tell your, I don't

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,440
want to use the word dumbing it down, but you're, you know, you're speaking to an audience

133
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,000
where you realize that if you go too far in the weeds, they're going to miss the point.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,920
And so I found myself watching talks you've given on YouTube going, I wish he would elaborate

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,280
on that point and that point.

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,200
Hey, maybe then I don't understand it myself.

137
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,760
Let's see.

138
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,600
So I think just for a bit of background, I know you did your undergrad, your PhD in

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,560
Australia, and then somehow you wind up in Lenny's lab at MIT.

140
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
How did that happen?

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,040
I've been interested in aging since I was four, since I realized that everybody and

142
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,600
everything around me is going to die.

143
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,320
That's a pretty big shock for everybody.

144
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,920
Most people forget about it because you just can't function thinking about it every day.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,880
I forgot about it until my teenage years.

146
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,360
And I realized that with the technology that was coming online, these are the days of early

147
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
PCR and gene sequencing.

148
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,960
We used to call it genetic engineering.

149
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,000
I thought maybe we're just the last generation who's going to live a normal lifespan, a regular

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,040
evolved lifespan.

151
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,520
And our children and our children, children forever are going to be able to benefit from

152
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
these new technologies.

153
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,320
And damn it, this is not right.

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,680
I've got grandparents, parents, friends, and about five billion people who could really

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
be benefited right now.

156
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,080
So at that point, I decided to seek out the best people in the world and see if I could

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
go work with them.

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,440
And I got a PhD in molecular biology, in yeast genetics, and that was a great PhD.

159
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,040
And a real turning point for me was this guy from MIT who I knew about because he was also

160
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
a yeast researcher.

161
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
He was a legend.

162
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
I'd read all these papers.

163
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Lenny Gorenti came to Australia.

164
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,600
And here I am, this young 20-something year old, having dinner with Lenny Gorenti and

165
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,280
my PhD supervisor from Australia.

166
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,480
And Lenny starts telling this story halfway through dinner about this new project that

167
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,680
a guy called Nick Inor, Austrajakko, and Brian Kennedy had just started doing.

168
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,960
And it was to try and find genes that control aging in yeast cells.

169
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,840
And I said, OK, I know yeast.

170
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,560
And I've always wanted to figure this out.

171
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,800
Damn it, that's what I want to do.

172
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Save me a spot, Lenny.

173
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm going to come into your lab.

174
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
And he went, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, as he does to most people who want to join his

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
lab.

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,880
So I wrote to him pretty soon after, maybe six months, I was finishing up, can I come

177
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
to your lab?

178
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,000
And he wrote back like he does to everybody.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,640
Sure, you can come.

180
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,840
But then a millisecond later, I was disappointed because he said, you have to bring your own

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
funding.

182
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
So that was no small task.

183
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
And that's a story in itself.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,320
Just briefly, though, this is a lesson for anyone who's listening who thinks that getting

185
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,040
to somewhere like this is easy.

186
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,520
You have to be massively determined.

187
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,400
You have to have grit.

188
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,800
And I just wouldn't give up because there's nothing else I wanted to do in my life.

189
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,880
I certainly was looking at patent law even.

190
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,160
But that would I think I would have died if I had done that as a career.

191
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,360
I just don't have the attention span.

192
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,000
Anyway, I actually found funding.

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,680
It turns out I applied to the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, which is a prestigious foundation

194
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
here.

195
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,320
And they wrote to me and said, you can't apply.

196
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,560
You're a foreigner.

197
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,880
And I said, well, this is the old days with early email.

198
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,480
I think it might even be post.

199
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,280
And they wrote back and they said, well, you're a foreigner.

200
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,000
We can't afford to fly you out to Boston, Cambridge for an interview.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,800
And I said, well, I'll sell my car and I'll pay for the ticket.

202
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,480
As I understand it, I was the first foreigner who was allowed to interview and I flew here.

203
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,720
I stayed in Nicanor, Ostrichko's basement.

204
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
He was very kind.

205
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,840
And my interview was with a guy who everyone was telling me is a real tough guy, super

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
smart.

207
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
I'd never heard of him.

208
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,520
Of course, now everybody in science knows of Doug Melton.

209
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,640
He's king of, well, endocrinology and stem cells at Harvard.

210
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,880
And I was just this kid showing up for an interview and there was a line of people outside

211
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,320
his door waiting.

212
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:10,240
And I was fifth in line and I went in and Professor Melton said to me, David, tell me

213
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,400
what you want to do.

214
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,920
And I had literally five minutes to impress this guy, one of the smartest people I'll

215
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
ever meet.

216
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,560
I told your car flown 22 hours for a five minute interview.

217
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,200
Yeah, that was basically it.

218
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,840
And so I thought about it most of my adult life, what was aging about.

219
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,960
And a lot of people in those days, back in the late 80s, early 90s, were talking about

220
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,560
the evolution of aging genes, death genes.

221
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,800
And I studied evolutionary biology myself and that didn't make any sense.

222
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
You don't evolve death genes.

223
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,880
And I never subscribed to the group theory of selection.

224
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,520
So every person for themselves, selfish gene, love Dork and stuff.

225
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,080
And so my thought was the only genes that I could understand could evolve that have

226
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,600
relevance to aging are longevity genes.

227
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,480
And right about that time, there was the discovery of in C. elegans, the nematode worm of the

228
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
DAFT mutation from...

229
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, I was about to say this must have corresponded with Cynthia's work, right, around the same

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
time.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,560
It's just happening.

232
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,560
And Lenny at the same time had just discovered a mutation that they weren't sure what it

233
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,280
was doing, but it turns out it led to the Sirtuin story.

234
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,160
And so I said to Doug, I want to come to Lenny's lab and discover life genes, genes that give

235
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
life and longevity.

236
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,960
And I guess he liked the idea of what I was saying, certainly very passionate.

237
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,280
It probably didn't hurt that I brought a bottle of red wine as a present.

238
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,240
I just thought that's what you do when you come to people's place.

239
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,280
Later on, I learned that that's equivalent to bribing somebody, but I was just a young

240
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
kid.

241
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
But yeah, that's what happened.

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,040
No foreshadowing the resveratrol there.

243
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Yeah, definitely.

244
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,640
It was an auspicious kind of a thing.

245
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,480
But being able to come to Lenny's lab, I would have worked in Lenny's lab for free.

246
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,320
I would have lived in the basement and done it.

247
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
That's just how much I wanted to do this.

248
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
So I came over.

249
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,520
It was late 1994, early 95, when things were just starting to take off, trying to understand

250
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,840
what these mutations were that Brian had found.

251
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,520
And was Matt Cabell in there as well?

252
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
Matt's also a close friend.

253
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
He was not there yet.

254
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:14,120
The lab has produced just a ridiculous amount of sort of prolific individuals in this anti-aging

255
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
space.

256
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
It was a golden age.

257
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,240
You could definitely feel that something special was going on in those days.

258
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
But I arrived.

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,960
I was the first postdoc to join to study aging specifically.

260
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,160
Was Brian a PhD student?

261
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Yeah.

262
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,120
So Brian, I was this new guy on the block.

263
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,840
Brian teach me how to do yeast aging.

264
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
And he taught me.

265
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,680
But all the other postdocs, there are probably 18 to 20 postdocs there.

266
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,840
Big lab, all working on transcription regulation.

267
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,800
And that was the sexy thing.

268
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,520
And I was told by, I don't think I've told anybody publicly this, that the postdocs were

269
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,560
saying you're crazy to work on this aging project.

270
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,640
Lenny's lost his mind.

271
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
It's a house of cards.

272
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
It's going to fall down.

273
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,920
You can't study aging in yeast.

274
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,440
All of these things.

275
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,920
And within the first few weeks, I thought maybe I've made a mistake.

276
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,600
Maybe I was just fooled.

277
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,280
Maybe Lenny isn't that smart, as I thought.

278
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
But I stuck with it.

279
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,600
I do remember at one point on the phone, nearly crying to my mother saying, I think

280
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
I made a really big mistake.

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,840
And that stands out as a point where I could have easily just quit.

282
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,360
But I stuck with it.

283
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,480
And thank goodness I did.

284
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Because Lenny was right.

285
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,320
And Lenny is really the smart visionary that saw that this was the right way to go.

286
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
So you sort of alluded to it earlier.

287
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,040
Lenny was sort of onto something, right?

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,600
There was basically a new pathway.

289
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,320
Now, if we go back in time to 1994, what did we know?

290
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,920
Well, we barely knew about Tor.

291
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,600
I mean, it was just being basically figured out that this thing that Michael Hall had

292
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,800
figured out a year earlier, Saul is figuring out, David is figuring out.

293
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,320
I mean, there's still this early triangulation of what's going on with rapamycin.

294
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,560
At the time, they didn't even, if I recall, I don't think we knew that there was mTORC1,

295
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
mTORC2.

296
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,160
And they were doing totally different things.

297
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,080
AMPK is pretty well understood.

298
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,240
Metformin's been around.

299
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,520
But I don't think people really had a sense at the time that it was anything other than

300
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,280
an anti-diabetic drug.

301
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,800
So talk me through this whole sirtuin thing.

302
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
That's a pretty broad question.

303
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,040
Let me narrow it down a little bit.

304
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,200
Talk me through what you were just about to allude to.

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,280
What was Lenny onto when you showed up?

306
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,400
Well, genetics is a fabulous tool because you don't have to go in with any hypothesis

307
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,080
that biology will tell you the answer.

308
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,080
And the gene that had just been cloned by Brian turned out to be what's called Ser4.

309
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,560
Now, Ser4 didn't turn out to be a mammalian conserved gene.

310
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
So Ser4 has not been as exciting.

311
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,360
But there was this partner of the Ser4 gene.

312
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,440
It was called Ser2.

313
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,600
And Ser2 and Ser3 and Ser4 formed this complex of proteins, stick together and control, of

314
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,040
all things, gene silencing.

315
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,760
That's what Ser stands for, silent information regulator, in this case number two.

316
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,720
And that was very unexpected.

317
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,760
In those days, if you think back, the cause of aging was thought to be DNA damage, mutations,

318
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,880
free radicals.

319
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,560
So we were all expecting to find genes that controlled DNA repair or antioxidants.

320
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,400
At that time, because I go back and I think, God, at that time I was still in college studying

321
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
math and engineering.

322
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
I didn't know.

323
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
I hadn't taken a biology course.

324
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,160
So I can't think about it through the context of my own education.

325
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,040
How well was it understood that there were introns and extrons and that much of the genome

326
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,360
wasn't even coding and stuff?

327
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,080
Was that well understood at that point in time?

328
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
It was.

329
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,200
In yeast, actually, they were ahead of anybody else in eukaryotes.

330
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,320
We knew that there were introns and not many introns in yeast anyway.

331
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,040
But we hadn't seen the full genome.

332
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,480
It was still bits and pieces.

333
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,320
Maybe five, 10% was known.

334
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,880
My PhD was sequencing three genes.

335
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,840
That's all it took.

336
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,040
Things were changing rapidly.

337
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,480
This new thing with PCR, you could move tubes into hot tubs and amplify genes.

338
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,280
It was all very exciting.

339
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,400
But what we didn't have any clue was that why a silencing gene that controlled, negatively

340
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,880
controlled genes, other genes, why that would have anything to do with aging.

341
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,200
It was totally bizarre.

342
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,360
It led to a string of cell papers.

343
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,640
One after another, every few months we were actually publishing something new and we had

344
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,360
a science paper.

345
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,880
That was the gold rush of this discovery because it really turned on the lights in this cave

346
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,120
of a whole new area of biology.

347
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,200
We're still trying to understand actually why those silencing proteins are relevant

348
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
to aging.

349
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,080
But what we do know for sure is that these same genes, these sirtuins in all life forms,

350
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,160
whether they're from plants all the way to us, do play a protective role in responding

351
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,400
to energy and nutrients just like the ampikinase neem topophage.

352
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,720
You alluded to sirtu.

353
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,320
Was that first found in yeast?

354
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,640
Yes, it was.

355
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
It was known already actually.

356
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,480
Lenny and we didn't discover sirtu was already known as a silencing protein that controlled

357
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,360
the mating type, in other words, the sex of a yeast cell.

358
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,400
If you don't have the silencing, what happens is that the yeast cells get confused because

359
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,400
they're now turning on genes for A and alpha, which means male and female.

360
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,640
A yeast cell that doesn't know if it's male or female will not mate and it's become sterile.

361
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,240
It turns out that's a hallmark of yeast aging is sterility.

362
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,720
The way you can tell whether a yeast cell is truly old is, is it sterile or is it just

363
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,840
sick?

364
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,480
That's how we used to tell.

365
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,280
But now we actually understand the cause of that sterility.

366
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,160
It's the actual movement of sirtu protein away from those genes that it should be at

367
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,840
to go deal with other problems in the cell.

368
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
I see.

369
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,640
It's not that sirtu becomes deactivated.

370
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,720
It just, for lack of a better description, shifts its attention elsewhere.

371
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Right.

372
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,280
It's distracted by other things going on in the cell.

373
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,280
We had a cell paper in 1999 with Kevin Mills and Lenny where we discovered, and a couple

374
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
of other groups should also get credit for co-discovering this, is that the sirtuins

375
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,560
are also involved in DNA repair.

376
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,600
When you get a broken chromosome, it's the sirtu complex that goes along, helps unwrap

377
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,840
the DNA, we think, and put it back together and repair that.

378
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,720
While the sirtu complex is doing that, it cannot be also silencing.

379
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,040
There's not enough of it to go around.

380
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
You might ask, well, why would the cell do that?

381
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Why don't you just make more sirtu?

382
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:19,240
What we think is that this is a very ancient system that coordinates controlling mating

383
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
and DNA repair.

384
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,920
You don't want to be mating and dividing if you've got a broken chromosome.

385
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,680
This is a way of coordinating those two events.

386
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
It's very ancient.

387
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,920
It's a very active system.

388
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,040
You need DNA checkpoint signaling, so it's not just random.

389
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,760
What we also have come to realize is that this, let's call it this distraction of the

390
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,020
sirtuins, it's conserved.

391
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,540
We find this happens in our own aging process as well.

392
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,620
There's really two roles.

393
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,740
There's gene silencing and DNA repair.

394
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,940
Sirtuins are HDACs.

395
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Is that correct?

396
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Are they all HDACs?

397
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,860
HDAC, histone deacetylases, this is the old name for protein deacetylases now.

398
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,780
What we've all come to realize is histones are just one of the things that sirtuins and

399
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,420
these other HDACs do.

400
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,660
They can target what are called nonhistone proteins.

401
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,420
They remove not just acetyl groups, but also other types of what are called generally

402
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,740
acyl groups.

403
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
That's a whole new world.

404
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,980
That means that sirtuins, the family, there are seven of them in mammals, five of them

405
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,220
in yeast, target other proteins, proteins that are in cytoplasm in the nucleus, even

406
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,100
in the mitochondria.

407
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
That's their role.

408
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,380
It's not so much only about controlling the chromatin and histone, but also about controlling

409
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,580
signaling and metabolism as well.

410
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,700
They can do that by targeting any protein theoretically in the cell.

411
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,020
Thinking back to DAF2, DAF16 as the parallels with FOXO and IGF, were there elegant experiments

412
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:58,340
in the yeast that could show you extreme conditions of lots of sirt, no sirt, and what that phenotype

413
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
is?

414
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Oh yeah.

415
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,340
These were the first experiments.

416
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,420
I'll try to take you through them correctly in sequence.

417
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,940
What we showed with Brian, first of all, this is a 1996 cell paper, was that we were

418
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,380
looking for this movement.

419
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,860
There was this so-called age locus.

420
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
We didn't know what it was.

421
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,020
We didn't know where they were going.

422
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,020
We just knew that they left the silent mating type locus.

423
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,180
What we did was we stained it.

424
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,940
Brian had moved on actually to his post-doc.

425
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,220
Kevin Mills and I, a student at the time, our job was to find where are the sirt proteins

426
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
going.

427
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,180
We stained them and we could look at them on the microscope.

428
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,620
What we saw was they were going to this little place in the nucleus, which we eventually

429
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,660
figured out was the nucleolus, which is what makes the RNA, which makes the ribosomes.

430
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,500
It's a really important part.

431
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,180
The DNA that's within the nucleus is called the ribosomal DNA or the RNA.

432
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,700
That's where they were going, not just during normal aging, but also during an accelerated

433
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
form of aging.

434
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,780
There's a whole story that was lost in history actually that maybe I'll just quickly touch

435
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
on.

436
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,420
One of the first things I did when I got to Lenny's lab was to work on Werner's syndrome,

437
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,660
which is premature aging disease.

438
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,500
These are kids that die in their teens or 20s, aren't they?

439
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,900
No, that's a different Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome.

440
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,500
This one, Werner's, they lived till 40s.

441
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
They lived till their 40s, yeah.

442
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,620
The gene was just cloned by George Martin and his team out there.

443
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,460
The comolog in yeast is called SGS1.

444
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
I picked up the paper.

445
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,620
It was in Science, I recall.

446
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,380
I went into Lenny's office and I said, I've just been scooped, but there's a yeast homolog.

447
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
I'm going to work on that.

448
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,380
Is that okay?

449
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,660
He said, yeah, go for it.

450
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
We worked on SGS1 for a little bit.

451
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,340
What we found was that they were going through accelerated aging as well.

452
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,940
We had a science paper on that.

453
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,460
What was exciting about that was that they were also becoming sterile and the two complex

454
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,100
was moving as well, just like the normal aging.

455
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,820
We had this rapid aging model.

456
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,300
You might say, well, so what's the big deal?

457
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,620
You've got a rapid aging model.

458
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,980
That told us that there was some universal process that results in premature aging in

459
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,620
humans, probably in yeast, the same thing.

460
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,060
We could also study this much more easily than an old yeast cell.

461
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,900
Consider that to find a single old yeast cell, it's really hard, especially if you're just

462
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,580
studying replicative aging, which is the number of times they divide.

463
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,220
Each mother cell produces, on average, 10 to the power of 25 offspring.

464
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,380
That's, by my calculations, about 30 million offspring.

465
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,860
You have to pull out that one cell and study it by chemically.

466
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,460
Wait, you said 10 to the 25?

467
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
Yeah.

468
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Sorry, 2 to the 25.

469
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Oh, okay.

470
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,460
Okay.

471
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Yeah.

472
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,260
In any case, that's way more ... What we used to do is to sort out the old cells.

473
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,100
We'd label them with a chemical and pull them out with magnetic beads.

474
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,060
We couldn't get many of them, you'd just get a handful.

475
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,820
But with these SGS-1s proteins ...

476
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,140
You could get a bunch of them.

477
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,460
The mutants, we could get a lot more.

478
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,820
We'd made a lot of progress using that.

479
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,180
But every time we made a discovery with the SGS protein, our mutants, we went back to

480
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,220
the normal yeast cells and verified.

481
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,340
We were actually able to figure out with that mutant what the distracting problem was for

482
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,140
the CER complex.

483
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,500
That was actually DNA breaks and DNA recombination that was occurring at the most repetitive

484
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,060
regions, the most unstable region of the genome, which is the RDNA, which is in the

485
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,060
nicholleolus.

486
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
That was what was distracting those proteins.

487
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,060
Interesting.

488
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,700
When you knock out SIR2, is it easy to knock it out?

489
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
Yeah.

490
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
That was the next experiment.

491
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Okay.

492
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,140
Then we wanted to know ... The prediction is if you knock out SIR2, you should get a

493
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,220
lot more of this instability at the RDNA.

494
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Yes.

495
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,020
The question is, does it translate to accelerated aging or not necessarily accelerated aging,

496
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,340
but more cancer or some other phenotype, right?

497
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,140
Well, in yeast, it led to accelerated aging through the process I was telling you about,

498
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,980
genomic instability, DNA repair went down.

499
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,660
Also, that happens in animals, although it's a little more complex because it's embryonic

500
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,620
lethal in a lot of mice.

501
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,540
You can't easily do that experiment.

502
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,140
What you can do is the opposite.

503
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,100
You can turn on or over express the SIR2 gene in a yeast cell.

504
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,100
If we're right, you should get a few things that are going to happen.

505
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,860
You'll have more genomic stability at this, particularly at this RDNA locus in the nicholleolus,

506
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,740
and the yeast cells should live longer.

507
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,100
That experiment was done by an incoming graduate student, Matt Cabellon.

508
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,220
What a fantastic project to get when you walk in.

509
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,780
He did it, and the day that he got life plan extension with XTRISR2 was a very good one

510
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,380
for him and the lab.

511
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,460
What's the next step from there?

512
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,100
The most obvious thing is, how do you develop a compound that would do this without the

513
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,540
genetic mutation that empowered it?

514
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,980
Yeah, that was the issue because you can't easily genetically manipulate humans.

515
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,260
The question was, how do you turn on these genes?

516
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,660
We spent about three, four years working on caloric restriction in yeast and then in

517
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
mammals.

518
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,980
My lab and some others were leading the charge in showing that SIR2 ends, both in yeast and

519
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,860
mammals, were not only necessary but were sufficient when you over express them to mimic

520
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
calorie restriction.

521
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,060
Put another way, if you knock out SIR2, you don't get the benefits of calorie restriction.

522
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,820
You don't get the benefits of CR.

523
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Right.

524
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,500
That's also now being shown by others to be true in mice as well.

525
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
That led to the idea that-

526
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,180
Is that true in all mice?

527
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,220
I couldn't say.

528
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,260
Even in yeast, you can get around the need for SIR2 and if you stress the yeast really

529
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,140
intensely with very little amount of calories.

530
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,060
But there are aspects of calorie restriction benefits such as a lifespan extension that

531
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:37,780
are ameliorated lessened by a SIR2 knockout but it's still complexified by the fact that

532
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,540
it's lethal in embryos and you have to knock it out in the adult to do a real experiment.

533
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,900
That's the same sort of issue that Cynthia had with the DAFs which was if you do too

534
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,940
early, the C. elegans doesn't make it into an intermediate stage.

535
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
You know what?

536
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,660
Somebody hasn't even done the proper experiment which is to take a mouse that you can knock

537
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,780
out SIR1 in an adult whole body and then calorie restrict.

538
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,100
Something that we probably should have done years ago.

539
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,260
But the technology is there to do that.

540
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,980
But what we did learn actually was both in yeast and in mammals was that it's not just

541
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,700
one of these genes that's important.

542
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
It's the whole family.

543
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,100
And that if you knock out, take yeast for example, if you knock out SIR2 in yeast, you

544
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,620
lose the ability to respond to some mild calorie restriction but if you really calorie restrict

545
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,340
them, they'll still live longer.

546
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,220
And there was a big debate actually between Brian, Matt, myself about that.

547
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:34,740
And where we settled on was that these other SIR2 related genes were also helping and they

548
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
work as a family.

549
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,700
And if you knock one out, the others can compensate.

550
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,100
Did yeast only have one?

551
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
Yeast of five.

552
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
Yeast of five.

553
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
And humans have a whole family.

554
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Like eight or something.

555
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Just seven.

556
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Oh okay.

557
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
So only two more.

558
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
That's interesting.

559
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,380
Little known fact, most people ignore the other yeast SIR2 ones but they're just as interesting

560
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,460
and what we found is they also can extend lifespan as well.

561
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,860
So when you ... Actually it's funny, I was going to go back to something else you said

562
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:04,780
a second ago but what's the teleologic explanation for why caloric restriction and SIR2 ones would

563
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
move hand in hand?

564
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,580
Like for men, you talked earlier about your appreciation for evolutionary biology.

565
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:16,340
So an organism is in a nutrient deprived environment.

566
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,740
It still has to be able to do a bunch of things if it's going to be fit.

567
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,940
Do we believe that that's an environment where we need to see more stabilization of the genome

568
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,660
or repair or silencing or what do we think is the biggest insult during that period of

569
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
time?

570
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,540
Yeah, so the biggest insult to any life form is a broken chromosome.

571
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,100
That's lethal if you don't fix it.

572
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,060
Do we see that more likely happening during nutrient deprivation?

573
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
I would see that as ... I would have assumed, to be honest with you, I would have assumed

574
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,220
that was independent of nutrient exposure or at least if anything inversely correlated.

575
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,740
Well, if you don't have enough nucleotides to complete replication, you're going to break

576
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
a lot of times.

577
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
I see.

578
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,100
So they do go hand in hand but the bigger picture is that the SIR2 ones evolved, we believe,

579
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,340
what are we talking about, three and a half billion years ago in the first life forms,

580
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,180
probably life forms.

581
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,540
Maybe just after one of the first proteins to actually evolve, we think, would be a SIR2.

582
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:13,140
And its job is to sense biological stress in the environment, whether it's DNA damage

583
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,460
or it's a burst of cosmic rays, change in temperature or a lack of nutrients.

584
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,980
And their job is to allow that organism to hunker down and survive.

585
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,620
Stop mating, stop breeding.

586
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,300
We can do that in another day.

587
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,900
If we don't survive this, our offspring are going to die anyway.

588
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,540
So we think they control which genes to turn on and off in response to adversity and they

589
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,060
allow those organisms to survive.

590
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,020
But they're also talking to other pathways.

591
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,260
So they're going to talk to mTOR, they're going to talk to Cynthia's DAF pathway.

592
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,860
And collectively, these are the genes that we've settled on as the longevity pathways

593
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,740
but they didn't evolve for longevity, they evolved for survival during adversity.

594
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,860
How conserved are these across, let's use the big four models of eukaryotes from yeast,

595
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,700
worms, flies, larger mammals like mice and rodents.

596
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,660
Is this relatively well conserved the way the tor pathway is conserved or does it have

597
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
more bends in the road?

598
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,060
Well, they're surprisingly conserved that you can just manipulate one gene in each of

599
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,300
these organisms and get lifespan extension or one drug works in all of these organisms.

600
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,140
I would challenge anyone to use a chemotherapy to help a yeast cell.

601
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,580
So this is quite a magical discovery that the same pathways are that well conserved

602
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,020
and that ancient.

603
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,220
And that's actually one of the advantages we have.

604
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,260
Aging is actually not that difficult to be able to control and that's because our models

605
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,740
are very good.

606
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:47,380
If we can, I truly believe that if we can extend the lifespan of a yeast, a worm and

607
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,380
a mouse, humans are so close.

608
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,380
If you can do it across a billion years, you should be able to make that leap to a

609
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,660
few other hundred million years.

610
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Exactly.

611
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,180
It's really just the regulatory agencies making sure that we don't do any harm and it's safe.

612
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,020
But the biology is all still there going way back three and a half billion years ago.

613
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,060
So it was 2006, 2007.

614
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:13,460
When did resveratrol emerge as an early search to an activator?

615
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
2003.

616
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,460
Okay.

617
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,580
And the story behind that was that we were looking for an activator, we're hoping for

618
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
an activator.

619
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
Were you in your own lab at this point?

620
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Yeah.

621
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
You'd finish your postdoc, I'm guessing.

622
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
Yeah.

623
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,060
I managed to move to Harvard in 1999.

624
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,700
So that was the year when a lot of things happened.

625
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,980
While I was moving, we published the Stenia Repair Committee.

626
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,860
But just going back to the silly sort of social question, did you at some point think I want

627
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,220
to go back to Australia and set up a lab here?

628
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,260
Was it a difficult decision for you to stay in Boston as opposed to ... because you came

629
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,460
from Sydney, if I recall.

630
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
Right.

631
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Well, the goal was to ...

632
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,940
Those are pretty different climates.

633
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,260
I've been to Sydney once, I spent two weeks there, I could stay there.

634
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,740
Yeah, I missed that.

635
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,460
But I also like adversity.

636
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,940
I thrive on adversity.

637
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,420
And so I've come to like living here.

638
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,860
The intention was to come here for two years.

639
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,220
I had a job to go back to.

640
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,420
But the first week of being here in Boston was like a city I could only dream about.

641
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,980
This is the Athens of ancient Greece, Rome of ancient Rome.

642
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,100
For biology, this is it.

643
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,820
And so I was in heaven.

644
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,100
I'd never experienced a city where you're on the train and people around you are reading

645
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,620
Science Magazine and Nature.

646
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,540
That's my dream.

647
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:31,580
So it was a very easy decision not to go back to Australia for reasons that if you really

648
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,620
want to change the world, you got to do it from here.

649
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,820
So now you're in the process of kick-starting your own lab, which comes with its own stresses.

650
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Right?

651
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,380
You've got to secure funding and all those other things.

652
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,260
And then what's happening on the front of this stuff?

653
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,420
Yeah, so 1999, a few major things happened.

654
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,420
One was this DNA repair connection.

655
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:57,540
The second one was Lenny's lab published that NAD was a requirement for sirtuin activity.

656
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,500
And Shin Ami, who's at Wash U now, was the postdoc who made that somewhat serendipitous,

657
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,900
but brilliant discovery.

658
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,260
And then the third thing was the connection to calorie restriction was happening around

659
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
that time too.

660
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,980
Going back to the second thing, we talk about it now today, like it's in textbooks.

661
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
It's so obvious, right?

662
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,900
Sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacetylase.

663
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,900
Okay.

664
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:25,620
NAD is so ubiquitous in cells that if the quantity you could have in a cell varies on

665
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:31,460
a scale from one to 10, what is sufficient to produce this deacetylase activity?

666
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,180
Is it anywhere from two to 10 or does it have to be quite a high concentration?

667
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
It can be two to 10.

668
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,460
You can actually get very low levels in some disease conditions and the animal is still

669
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
alive.

670
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:48,420
And you're basically only saying that NAD is necessary for sirtuins to work.

671
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Right.

672
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,340
Well, without NAD, we'd be dead in 30 seconds.

673
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,980
By other reasons as well.

674
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,900
Wouldn't we be dead just from not being able to do electron transports?

675
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
We would.

676
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,460
And there's more than 500 reactions that we need just to survive.

677
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,940
But what we didn't know in the 2000s, and it was actually quite a crazy thing to think

678
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,460
that NAD was regulating anything.

679
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,700
And that was actually what we first worked on in my lab was the control of sirtuins

680
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
with NAD levels.

681
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:19,900
The reason it's crazy is you read textbooks and NAD is the most ubiquitous important molecule

682
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,540
in the cell.

683
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,180
How could it possibly be varied during aging, let alone during the day when you eat something

684
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,020
or your circadian rhythm?

685
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
Now it's obvious.

686
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
We know NAD goes up and down.

687
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
It changes with age.

688
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:37,020
But in those days, people thought if you change the NAD levels, you'd probably die.

689
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,020
That's not true.

690
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,500
Down at the time that doesn't complex one of the mitochondria basically convert NAD

691
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
H to NAD?

692
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,460
So you would at least know that in the mitochondria, the concentration of NAD must go up and down,

693
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,020
or else you couldn't actually respire.

694
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,140
Well locally it goes up and down, but the steady state level is pretty constant.

695
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,860
And when you say going up and down, are you talking cytoplasmic, nuclear, plasma?

696
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Where are we talking about?

697
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,300
We had a paper, I think it was 2007, where we had quite a surprising result, which told

698
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,100
us that it's not just the cytoplasm that it goes up and down.

699
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,280
It was also the mitochondria going up and down.

700
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,700
And we didn't know that.

701
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
We actually stumbled upon it.

702
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,140
We found that if we kept cells with high amounts of NAD, they would survive better, DNA damage,

703
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,580
other insults.

704
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,860
And we could deplete NAD in the cytoplasm, but the cells still lived.

705
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
We didn't understand that.

706
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,860
How did you do that, by the way?

707
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,860
How do you deplete NAD?

708
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,020
Actually, come to think of it, we could either overexpress NAD depleting enzymes, but actually

709
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,340
the way we found it was that when you damage cells with a DNA damaging agent, say chemotherapy

710
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:52,420
drug, the cells themselves deplete NAD naturally with this enzyme called PARP1, which is an

711
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,140
NAD-consuming enzyme.

712
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,540
And actually, that's very well known that if you hit a cell with a DNA damaging agent,

713
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,500
the reason that it dies is NAD depletion.

714
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,780
So we were measuring the NAD depletion in the context of...

715
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,740
And that's because the cell is trying to utilize that NAD to repair the damage you've just

716
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
caused?

717
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
Right.

718
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
Or you didn't know that at the time?

719
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
No, that was well known.

720
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,820
So PARP1 is a no-NDNA repair protein.

721
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,020
And if you block PARP, you also protect cells.

722
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,500
But what was interesting was that we could overexpress, give more copies of a gene that

723
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:30,100
made NAD, and this is called an MPT, which is the equivalent of the PNC1 gene in yeast,

724
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,740
which we found was important for lifespan in those organisms.

725
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,220
So we were overexpressing this MPT.

726
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Cells had more NAD.

727
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,340
We hit them with the toxin.

728
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,020
They'd survive better than regular cells.

729
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,420
But the NAD was still being almost completely depleted from the side of...

730
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,580
Sorry, just because this is sort of the crux of it.

731
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,380
Did they survive because they were unable to deplete their NAD?

732
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,420
No, we saw that NAD just disappeared from the cell, but they survived.

733
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
But they still survived.

734
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,780
But there was a place we weren't looking at the time.

735
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,260
We tracked it down to the mitochondria.

736
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,540
So this begs the term the mitochondrial oasis hypothesis.

737
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,740
So myself and Anthony Solveil from Cornell coined this term.

738
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,980
So what we found was that as long as the mitochondria stayed active with their NAD, it didn't matter.

739
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,260
The cell could survive and recover from that stress.

740
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,420
And actually, it turns out that the levels in mitochondria, NAD levels are even more

741
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,500
important than cytoplasmic NAD levels for survival.

742
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
That makes sense.

743
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,860
And of course, that's a hard thing to measure, isn't it?

744
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
It was extremely hard.

745
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
That's where Anthony came in.

746
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,300
Anthony is a chemist and a biochemist at heart.

747
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,540
And it was extremely hard to isolate these mitochondria, preserve the NAD.

748
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,340
And then we had to use new technologies to be able to do that.

749
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
How was that done?

750
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,820
We were using mass spectrometry for the first time to measure NAD.

751
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,500
And what Anthony did brilliantly was to make labeled versions of NAD in its precursors.

752
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,020
And he could spike those in and use those as references to measure NAD levels in these

753
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
compartments.

754
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,900
And NAD, if I recall from just biochemistry, you don't get to move that in and out of plasma

755
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,460
into cells.

756
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,340
It's made de novo in the cell.

757
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,340
You have what you have.

758
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
You can make more.

759
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,140
You can bring in precursors, but you don't get to shuttle NAD between cells, correct?

760
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,140
As far as we know, right.

761
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
Okay.

762
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Yeah.

763
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,140
It's sort of like an ATP problem.

764
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,980
It's really hard to quantify ATP in a cell.

765
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,940
By the way, does NADP do any of this as well?

766
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,220
Well, it's important, no doubt.

767
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,540
It's part of this whole problem that we're working on.

768
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:34,140
But if you add NADP or even NADH, which is only different by 100, those don't work to

769
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
activate sirtuins.

770
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,220
Only NAD plus will do that.

771
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,340
And I mean, not to get too nerdy on this, but it's obviously more than just the charge,

772
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,020
but the charge must play a role if NADH can't work, right?

773
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
Yeah.

774
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,900
So it's probably a combination of the charge and some other...

775
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Good size, yeah.

776
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Size, yeah.

777
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Okay.

778
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:56,180
So now you've made these three discoveries, the second of which we just went into in a

779
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,020
little bit more detail.

780
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,260
How does the story unfold now?

781
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,500
You've got your spanking new lab.

782
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,740
Well, you worked for a little while on the SGS1 furnace protein and telomeres.

783
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Put out a paper on that.

784
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,340
And we didn't work on sirtuins for about a year because Lenny said, I don't want you

785
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,140
working on sirtuins when I left the lab, which was a bit of a shock.

786
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Why?

787
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,300
He didn't want the competition, I suppose.

788
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,220
I thought a year was enough to give him a head start, but we quickly started working

789
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
back on that.

790
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,060
Is that a common request of people when postdocs leave their labs?

791
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,140
No, of course not.

792
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,660
But what am I going to do?

793
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,900
I mean, the guy trained me.

794
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
I go in my career.

796
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,580
But in those days, it was very competitive.

797
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,300
So the Lenny of today is not the Lenny of previous years, and he's a wonderful friend

798
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
and mentor to me.

799
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,900
But that's how it was in those days.

800
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
It was very cutthroat.

801
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,900
I see.

802
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,020
But if it were up to you, you would have continued to work on sirtuins.

803
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,020
Right.

804
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,540
Now we're basically back to 2001, 2002.

805
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,700
The moratorium is up.

806
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,980
You're now back to working on it.

807
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:58,380
And nobody at this point in time has yet figured out a way to exogenously manipulate sirtuins

808
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,780
more than the stuff that we've already talked about, which is nutrients, stress, and things

809
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
like that.

810
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,180
Yeah, we were trying to feed yeast, NAD, and we gave them nicotinamide, which is a precursor

811
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,420
to NAD, vitamin B3.

812
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,460
And actually, Kevin Bitterman, who's now a very successful venture capitalist, my first

813
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,580
friend, he put nicotinamide on yeast, and we could measure the sirtu activity by the

814
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
color.

815
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,860
And if sirtu was more active, they'd turn red.

816
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,380
And he walked into my office, one of his first experiments when we worked on sirtuins, and

817
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,180
he said, David, something's weird.

818
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,300
We didn't get activation.

819
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,980
We got inhibition.

820
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,100
So the yeast had gone red.

821
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,900
And I said, Kevin, it doesn't matter what happens.

822
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
As for some expected, that's even better.

823
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,860
So that led to a paper that said that vitamin B3 high doses is inhibitory of sirtuins.

824
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,580
And now the labs around the world use nicotinamide as an inhibitor for sirtuins.

825
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,660
And I wouldn't recommend taking really high doses of nicotinamide.

826
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
Why is that?

827
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,940
There's a few answers.

828
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:57,940
By chemical answer is that there's an evolved pocket in the sirtuin structure that measures

829
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,020
nicotinamide levels, and it's a feedback loop.

830
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,300
So nicotinamide, to get nerdy, is the product of the reaction.

831
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,460
It takes NAD, cleaves it.

832
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Oh, I got it.

833
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,460
So it's just a negative feedback loop.

834
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
It's negative feedback loop.

835
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,980
So we're going to study in the context of tuberculosis.

836
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,340
And what we found was that when we calorically restricted yeast cells, this was one of the

837
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,940
most highly upregulated genes in the whole yeast cell, which was very unusual.

838
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,820
People had discovered this before in their own lab, but they were wondering, what the

839
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,820
heck is this?

840
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,220
NAD synthesis pathway got to do with calorie restriction, got to do with stress, but we

841
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,460
knew exactly what was happening.

842
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:10,180
This is a stress response that was turning on NAD production and activating sirtuins.

843
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:16,480
So we had our first Nature paper, actually, on that 2002, I think, 2003.

844
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,660
And we found that PNC1 could mimic caloric restriction and raise NAD availability.

845
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,420
And if we knocked out the PNC1 gene, yeast cells didn't live longer when we calorie restricted

846
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
them.

847
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,460
And what's really interesting about that, I think, is that PNC1 doesn't just get turned

848
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,100
on by caloric restriction.

849
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:38,660
It's turned on by heat, low amino acids, salt, high salt.

850
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,580
And so this is a gene that senses the environment and turns on the sirtuins.

851
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,540
Exactly what I was explaining earlier about those early life forms on the planet, sense

852
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:52,300
their environment and through NAD and other ways they can turn on these pathways for defense.

853
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,500
So where did you go from PNC1 to Resveratrol?

854
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,180
Well, we teamed up with a company at the time.

855
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,420
They were called Biomol.

856
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,100
And they were making reagents for H-DAC assays, this kind of thing.

857
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,620
And Conrad Howitz was a scientist there.

858
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:14,260
And he had invented, wasn't even available yet, an assay for sirtuin activity in vitro.

859
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,860
I forget why he reached out to me, but he said, hey, well, maybe I wrote to him.

860
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,500
But whatever happened, he sent me some kits to test.

861
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,500
And they worked.

862
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
And it looked great.

863
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,900
And what was the gold standard prior to these kits?

864
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,900
Oh, gosh.

865
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:31,660
A mergers for tuin activity required western blotting, which is detecting the cell groups.

866
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,460
It was horribly hard.

867
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,620
Still is.

868
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,380
And this was a very quick way to look for molecules.

869
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,500
And what Conrad did was to take that assay and look through his collection of molecules

870
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
at Biomol.

871
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,740
They had libraries of these things.

872
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:51,380
And two of the first molecules that were discovered by him to change the activity of SIRT1, human

873
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,940
SIRT1, were a couple of plant molecules.

874
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,380
Now he found plenty of inhibitors.

875
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,340
Inhibiting wasn't the hard part.

876
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,340
Exactly.

877
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,500
But he called me up and he said, David, this is something's weird.

878
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,780
We've got these molecules that seem to activate the enzyme.

879
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,300
And I said, that's great.

880
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
That's what we need.

881
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,300
And he goes, well, I don't know if it's real, but let's work on this.

882
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,980
So we worked on it together for about six months trying to prove this wrong.

883
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,820
Because in the history of pharmaceuticals, there's only been a handful of molecules ever

884
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,780
that have been true allosteric activators, as these apparently were.

885
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,860
But we thought it could be fake.

886
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,140
It could be messing with the assay.

887
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,260
It could be an antioxidant activity.

888
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,740
But what really clinched it for me at first was we put these molecules onto cells.

889
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,420
And they lived longer, but only when the SIRT2 gene was present.

890
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,820
And the chance of that happening and us being wrong about this idea were pretty low.

891
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,820
So that was a good sign.

892
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,220
But the other thing that's not well known in history is that those first two molecules

893
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,540
that Conrad Howitz discovered, they were not resveratrol.

894
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,820
They were actually, I think, pisetanal and quercetin.

895
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,260
Quercetin's found in fruits and onions, I think.

896
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,700
But there was a brilliant CEO, Rob Zipkin.

897
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,660
And Rob was a chemist.

898
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,580
And Conrad showed him these structures that were quite similar, these two molecules.

899
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,820
They look like two rings connected by a bridge.

900
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,660
And Rob said, hey, you know what these two molecules look like?

901
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,660
Resveratrol.

902
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,100
And so Conrad and I are like, oh, what's resveratrol?

903
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,700
Anyway, I certainly was.

904
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,860
I didn't know much about resveratrol.

905
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:31,140
But I Googled it and comes up with, I'll suspect an ingredient for red wine.

906
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,980
And I could just see the next 10 years of media, which actually happened.

907
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:42,100
But it was an interesting time because we were, it was the first molecule that I can

908
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:47,980
recall was clearly lifespan extending in an organism that you had a defined genetic pathway

909
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,340
that wasn't just found off the shelf.

910
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,860
We really knew the pathway and we figured out.

911
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,500
And it's still, as far as I know, the only drug program that has come out of the aging

912
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,940
field where it was by design that we find these molecules.

913
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:08,500
So full credit to Dave and to others who have their molecules that have come out of drug

914
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
development.

915
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,220
So when they first started to make resveratrol for the purpose of these experiments, they

916
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,380
weren't extracting it out of naturally occurring sources.

917
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,220
It was just being synthesized straight away, even though it was acknowledged that, hey,

918
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,580
this thing also exists in nature.

919
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,740
Well, no, I think that probably was an extract, but I'm not being very articulate.

920
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,140
But the point I want to make is we did it in a different order.

921
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,300
So Rapamycin and Metformin were already on the shelf doing other things discovered by

922
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,020
others for doing things.

923
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,740
And then you can trace them back to the pathway and you get lifespan extension.

924
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,740
We didn't do it that way.

925
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,740
We said, here's the pathway.

926
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,360
This was the direct target.

927
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:47,280
We went genetics first and then found a molecule and then tested on the organism, which is,

928
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,120
you can do it both ways, but this was more rational science.

929
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,680
But anyway, that's the reason.

930
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,600
But we also had this very interesting result that we found a yeast mutant that, and actually

931
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,560
a sort of mammalian mutant, that was blocked that couldn't respond to resveratrol.

932
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,880
So we already knew that there was an amino acid that was required for this activation

933
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,200
by resveratrol in the test tube, which told me this isn't just some random thing.

934
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,760
This is a highly conserved mechanism because we could also show this amino acid was found

935
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,600
in other organisms as well.

936
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,880
And which amino acid was that?

937
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,280
In SIRT1, it's called E230 and the mutation made a lysine.

938
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,840
So it went from a negative charge to a positive charge at that location.

939
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,740
We didn't know why it blocked it.

940
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,740
Now we do.

941
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,960
But that was one of the early things that we had in our knowledge base to be able to

942
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
go forward.

943
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,640
Now, when you put resveratrol in cell culture like you had with the previous two compounds,

944
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,220
you mentioned with the previous compounds, if they lacked SIRT2 and they did not get

945
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,720
the longevity phenotype.

946
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,940
Did you see the same thing with resveratrol?

947
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,480
We did in yeast and then in worms and then in flies.

948
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,400
And so the fly work, a couple of Brown University scientists, Mark Tater and Stephen Helphand,

949
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
did the fly work.

950
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,840
We did the worm work predominantly.

951
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:08,040
And that went into another science paper, I think 2005, 2004.

952
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,440
And what was exciting about those days was that here we had things as distant as a yeast

953
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,060
cell and a fly separated probably by 500 million years or more.

954
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:24,620
And we had a SIRT2 dependent drug lifespan extension, molecule lifespan extension, which

955
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,040
to me said that we're on to something interesting here.

956
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
Yep.

957
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,720
Remind me, what was the phenotype of the non-SIRT bearing organism?

958
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,800
Oh, now you're stretching my memory.

959
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,400
In flies, I don't recall there being a strong phenotype.

960
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,120
If you're asking where they really short lived.

961
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

962
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,840
That's what I'm basically trying to get at is when you demonstrate the first proof of

963
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,680
concept, which is this drug won't work on you if you don't have SIRT.

964
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:55,480
In other words, I think where I'm really going with this is are there other plausible explanations

965
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,920
for how these compounds could have extended life outside of SIRT2?

966
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,480
Yeah, yeah, sure.

967
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
There's plenty of possibilities.

968
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,920
I mean, it could have just been that the SIRT2 ones were making them so sick that they

969
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,920
weren't.

970
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,400
But one of the reasons that we thought that it was real was that we tried to rule out

971
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
every other possibility.

972
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,920
We fed flies antioxidants, even if you got life-saving extension wasn't through the SIRT2

973
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
ones.

974
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,040
You can only make hypotheses and test them as best you can with the tools you have in

975
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,040
those days.

976
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,080
That's what we did.

977
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:28,920
But now we can actually go back and replace the SIRT2 mutant with this point mutation

978
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,080
that only knocks out changes one amino acid, which is real.

979
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,600
That's real microsurgery.

980
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:40,800
And when we do that and we go back now, we can still see a requirement for SIRT2 for

981
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,880
these effects.

982
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:49,920
So it was the mouse paper in 0506 that was the one that kind of brought this to everybody's

983
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,360
attention, even outside of the aging community, correct?

984
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,360
Right.

985
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,840
Well, so the resveratrol story in yeast was one thing.

986
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,840
But when the mouse paper came out in Nature in 2006, it went global and it caught the

987
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:07,160
attention of probably most people on the planet, certainly those who drank wine paid attention.

988
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,680
The wine industry sales, I'm told, went up 30 percent and have stayed up.

989
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,640
But yeah, that was 2006.

990
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,800
Very interesting time.

991
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,960
What's not well known in history is that we didn't know if this was going to work.

992
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,440
Was it real Hail Mary pass of experiment?

993
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,560
Going back to that experiment, those were not wild type mice.

994
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,280
Those were overfed mice, correct?

995
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,320
They were metabolically ill?

996
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,800
We had both experiments running in parallel.

997
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,040
But we got the results earlier for the fat mice.

998
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,040
And that was what?

999
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,120
So you had the control mice and you had the treatment mice, the control mice.

1000
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,800
Both mice were fed the same, which was a sort of high fat, high sugar, metabolically disruptive

1001
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,560
diet, presumably the usual.

1002
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,160
Yeah, the so-called Western diet, correct?

1003
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,160
Yeah.

1004
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,840
So what was the outcome of that experiment?

1005
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,560
How much longer did the resveratrol treated animals live, approximately?

1006
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,520
I think it was 20 percent, something like that, 25 percent.

1007
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,320
And that was initiated at what age?

1008
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,320
A year.

1009
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,200
So those are pretty mature mice.

1010
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,600
They're middle-aged mice almost, right?

1011
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,880
They're what, 30, 40 years old equivalent?

1012
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,880
Exactly.

1013
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,880
What dose, do you remember?

1014
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,760
I'm going to guess, I think it was 200 milligrams per kilogram.

1015
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Per day.

1016
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,760
Per day.

1017
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,240
But we also had a group on feeding every other day as well.

1018
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,680
And those turned out to be pretty interesting as well.

1019
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,280
That's a pretty high dose relative to, did the ITPs that came out that following used

1020
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,320
doses that high?

1021
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,800
So we've done it now in two different doses.

1022
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,360
We've done 210 times less.

1023
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,780
And it actually, it works in both.

1024
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:43,040
And what we find actually is that the higher dose is acting on other pathways, including

1025
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,080
the AMP kinase metformin-related pathway.

1026
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,040
Activating it, so it's synergistic with metformin?

1027
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:54,280
We don't know that, but part of the debate about resveratrol is that if you give cells

1028
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:01,000
in culture or mice too much resveratrol, then it kicks in other pathways.

1029
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,920
And in this case, it was activating AMP kinase as well.

1030
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,560
We published that in our first paper in 2006 in the supplemental that most people haven't

1031
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,760
read.

1032
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,720
But we knew it was activating AMP kinase at that high dose.

1033
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,400
And what that means is that when you're activating multiple pathways, it's very hard to dissect

1034
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
that.

1035
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,040
We these days, both in cell culture and in mice, were very careful to use the minimum

1036
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,560
dose to get an effect, not overdose, because it just makes things much more complicated.

1037
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,320
So you mentioned that you had a parallel experiment that was done in presumably mice that were

1038
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,260
not overfed.

1039
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,720
What did that experiment show?

1040
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,600
So the fat mice, they were healthier.

1041
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,120
That goes without saying, I think.

1042
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,480
Most people know that.

1043
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,120
In the thin mice, they also were healthier.

1044
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,600
They had better cardiovascular system, less cancer, a whole variety of things that were

1045
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,640
it didn't reach statistical significance when they ate resveratrol every day.

1046
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:57,000
But if we gave it to them in their diet every other day, we saw a lifespan extension that

1047
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,200
tells me a couple of things.

1048
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,640
One is that it could be that being fed every other day kicks in some other pathways that

1049
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,640
are helpful.

1050
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,640
We don't know that for sure.

1051
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,160
We'd be kicking in pathways that aren't helpful, wouldn't it?

1052
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,120
If I understood you correctly, didn't you say that the mice, the non- so the lean, we're

1053
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,480
going back to the lean experiment, if you fed the treatment animals resveratrol every

1054
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,600
day, they did not have a statistically significant survival advantage.

1055
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,800
If you fed them resveratrol every other day, they did.

1056
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,960
Is that what you said?

1057
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,960
Yeah.

1058
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,380
So if you only give them food with resveratrol every second day, we had mice that were living

1059
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,320
far longer than just the diet alone.

1060
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,960
Were they being fed non- resveratrol food on the alternate days?

1061
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
No, they were.

1062
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,360
So they were calorically restricted.

1063
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,360
Right.

1064
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,360
Okay.

1065
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,360
So there's now two variants.

1066
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,840
So they could have been the caloric restriction that was extending their lives.

1067
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,600
No, because the resveratrol added on to that as well.

1068
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,320
So there was another control of just being fed every other day.

1069
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
Exactly.

1070
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
Right.

1071
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,320
Right.

1072
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,320
And that came out in a cell metabolism paper in 2008.

1073
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:55,880
So from that experiment, one might conclude that resveratrol enhanced caloric restriction,

1074
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,960
the response to CR.

1075
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
It did.

1076
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Yeah.

1077
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,560
So if you had a control group, a CR group fed every other day, and then a CR plus resveratrol

1078
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,720
group, you would see a dose response.

1079
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,720
And we did that.

1080
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,760
And one of the things that might have been happening is that now resveratrol is not a

1081
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,760
very potent molecule.

1082
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,480
You've got things that are a thousand times more potent now.

1083
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,320
But the other problem with resveratrol is that it's not very soluble.

1084
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,120
And the blood levels, both in mice and in humans, doesn't get up very high unless you

1085
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,440
eat some fat.

1086
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:30,080
So that Western diet, we had much better absorption than this low dose lean diet.

1087
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,640
And so it may have just been getting the drug on board, quote unquote, the drug, or it may

1088
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,160
just be that resveratrol isn't potent enough, or that we're wrong about this.

1089
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,200
But the reason I don't think we're wrong about the sirtuins is when you overexpress

1090
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,040
the gene in the brain, for example, it will extend lifespan.

1091
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,640
And other sirtuins do that as well.

1092
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,240
Just going back to that, that's a very interesting idea about the fat solubility.

1093
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,120
Was the experiment ever done where you took mice and you fed them with and without the

1094
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
resveratrol?

1095
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,520
Because presumably, it's not the solubility of the fat that they're eating.

1096
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:08,000
It's the bile acids that enable the emulsification of the molecule and the, you know, whatever,

1097
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,680
the jejunal absorption.

1098
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,080
So that would be a quick way to show even without a hard outcome, if you were just getting

1099
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,120
more into the cells, right, if the resveratrol had greater absorption with and without a

1100
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,160
fatty food that's resulted in bile acids secretion.

1101
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,600
Yeah, well, we didn't measure bile acids, but we could definitely see by measuring blood

1102
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,400
levels that resveratrol was getting on board when we gave some fat in the food.

1103
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,560
And that's true in humans.

1104
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:37,200
That's why if I take resveratrol, I do it with something that's fatty.

1105
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,960
So some oil, a yogurt, it works really well.

1106
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,960
Got it.

1107
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Okay, well, that's elegant.

1108
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,480
Okay, so then three studies come out thereafter.

1109
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,360
Two of them were ITPs through NIA.

1110
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,660
One was not.

1111
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,720
You were on two of those papers, I believe.

1112
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,320
And one of them, actually two of them were sort of looking at multiple molecules in testing,

1113
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,320
correct?

1114
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,280
And I think one of them, I thought it was odd because it looked at rapamycin, which

1115
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,240
made sense, and then simvastatin, and then resveratrol.

1116
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,040
I never understood the simvastatin part.

1117
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,920
I wouldn't expect that a short-term treatment with simvastatin would have much of an outcome.

1118
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,480
What did those studies find, the ITPs?

1119
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,320
They just showed what we already published, which is that if you give resveratrol in regular

1120
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,000
food, it doesn't extend lifespan.

1121
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,320
And why couldn't that have been overcome?

1122
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,640
That seems like they should have, given that you'd already, because you published years

1123
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,440
in 06, these were like 08 and 11 or 11, 12, something like these were several years later.

1124
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,440
Sure.

1125
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,240
Yeah, those scientists didn't consult me at all.

1126
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,880
They just put in the food and went for it.

1127
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,880
I see.

1128
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,360
So in parallel to this now, something really interesting happens, which is all of a sudden

1129
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,660
a pharma company takes notice of something, which is resveratrol.

1130
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:53,480
Was there an IND that gets filed on that, or was this a pure grass application, meaning

1131
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,920
an FDA sort of generally regarded a safe pathway?

1132
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,560
How was resveratrol taken into a clinical trial?

1133
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,560
With humans, that is.

1134
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,840
What was going on in the commercial side was screening of more molecules.

1135
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,040
So there was a whole bunch of synthetic molecules that we can talk about.

1136
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,080
Resveratrol itself was considered a proof of concept molecule largely.

1137
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,880
If it ended up in the clinic, I mean, as a drug, it would have been great.

1138
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,880
But what we're trying to do-

1139
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,240
And your intuition was, it might be, it might not be.

1140
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,120
Well, we knew it was a terrible molecule.

1141
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,400
Because of the solubility alone.

1142
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Yeah, right.

1143
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,840
But was it millimolar?

1144
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,760
What kind of concentrations were needed once it was in the plasma to reach it?

1145
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,280
Is it a micromolar or a millimolar?

1146
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,160
It's a micromolar, which is, it really, that's not a drug you'd want to go ahead with.

1147
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,480
But it allowed us to get into humans and see what would happen.

1148
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,560
Do we see the same kinds of things?

1149
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,760
Or could we deliver it on the skin or on the eye?

1150
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,480
So that was our goal.

1151
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,040
And there was some very good formulation chemists who were trying to, and succeeded in working

1152
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,360
out ways to make resveratrol absorbable in the body.

1153
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,960
And there were some clinical trials that were initiated under an IND.

1154
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,840
There was one that was looking at blood sugar levels.

1155
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,120
And that one, I think, is published now.

1156
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,560
And what kind of doses were they using in the phase one?

1157
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,200
Do you remember?

1158
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:14,240
It was massive levels because the scientists that were running the studies, they were worried

1159
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,520
that there wasn't enough about bioavailability.

1160
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,560
So they were giving, I think, 10 grams a day, which is-

1161
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,640
Was there any toxicity at 10 grams?

1162
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,760
Unclear, unclear.

1163
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,000
That there was some, in regular people, there was nothing.

1164
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,440
There was a couple of patients in a cancer study that had renal failure, which happens

1165
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,320
anyway in these late stage patients.

1166
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,200
But that was enough to say, this is not worth it.

1167
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,080
Because this is a blockbuster drug anyway.

1168
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:45,760
It's a probe at best, at least according to the company that was running the trials.

1169
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,920
So they exercised an abundance of caution and stopped that trial in the cancer patients.

1170
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
That's odd.

1171
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,920
Why was it being done in cancer patients?

1172
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,080
Part of it was that trying to remember, but the person who was running the trials had

1173
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,880
a lot of experience in it.

1174
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,480
But I recall that there was some animal data, or at least some in vitro data, that was very

1175
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,600
well could help there.

1176
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,400
I see.

1177
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,480
So I didn't actually realize that at all.

1178
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,080
So you're saying it was in a phase one that they had this questionable outcome and thought,

1179
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,280
well, maybe it's not worth pursuing this, and we'll move on to the second and third

1180
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,760
generation variants of these?

1181
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,760
Well, right.

1182
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,880
So the company was bought by a large pharmaceutical company.

1183
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,320
And a large pharmaceutical company looks at resveratrol and they say, this is not a drug.

1184
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,800
This is not something that we want to continue with.

1185
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,680
And so that was certainly part of the decision I'm imagining.

1186
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,440
But what they really were excited about were the new chemical entities.

1187
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,720
There were hundreds of them made, or very potent drug-like molecules that they wanted

1188
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,720
to take further.

1189
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,040
And they did take those into humans as well.

1190
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,240
And I should mention that those molecules have been in mice.

1191
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,360
And Rafael de Cabo deserves a lot of credit for doing that.

1192
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,400
And so he's taken the same molecule that went into humans, put them into mice, these same

1193
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:07,800
one-year-old mice, and found that those do live longer, even on a regular diet.

1194
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,160
So that's why I think maybe it's just resveratrol wasn't as potent as we needed it.

1195
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,360
And these other molecules succeeded.

1196
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,920
Now, you mentioned, and I want to come back to this at the end, because it's interesting

1197
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,480
you're one of the few people in this space who speaks openly about, look, in the presence

1198
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,080
of incomplete information, I still take compound XY.

1199
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,280
You alluded to a moment where you still take resveratrol.

1200
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:31,240
Without having any certainty, is it your hypothesis that you might not be taking enough, but it's

1201
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,600
unlikely that there's any harm?

1202
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,520
And you said you take how much about a gram?

1203
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,280
Well, so my calculation is this.

1204
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,040
First of all, I like experimenting.

1205
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,800
I'm not afraid of death, that's for sure.

1206
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,720
But I want to be the first person to know if there's a problem.

1207
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,960
I'm also keenly aware that what's going to happen to all of us if we don't do anything

1208
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,400
is not pretty either.

1209
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,680
And so what have I got to lose?

1210
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,680
It's cheap.

1211
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,560
I've got buckets of it in my basement.

1212
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,360
There's been never any sign of toxicity.

1213
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,360
It's been in humans for a long time now.

1214
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,360
So there's no downside here.

1215
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,840
But the bigger risk it would seem is, what if you're not taking enough?

1216
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,840
Sure, but one gram, I think, if it's not working at a gram, then it's not working.

1217
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,080
I don't think it's worth going higher.

1218
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,840
What's important is that we've made advances since then.

1219
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,400
We're talking about discoveries from a decade ago.

1220
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,600
We've got much better things now.

1221
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:25,120
So I still take my reserve role because I've seen enough data in humans as well

1222
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,920
that it can protect the heart.

1223
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,400
Is it going to make me live 10 years longer?

1224
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,520
Probably not, not even five.

1225
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,200
But will it potentially delay cardiovascular disease?

1226
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
Absolutely.

1227
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,560
You mentioned in a talk that you, I think you mentioned this in the talk,

1228
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,000
but you take metformin as well.

1229
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,440
Yeah, quite recently, probably at least half my colleagues that I talked to.

1230
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,440
Yeah.

1231
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,640
Now, you're only taking a pretty low dose, if I recall, from at least what you said in

1232
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,640
that talk.

1233
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,680
Is that because of the additive effects potentially of resveratrol also activating AMPK?

1234
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,160
Yeah, you're exactly right.

1235
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,880
If you're starting to take combinations of molecules like I do, you want to ramp it up.

1236
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,280
We're going into unknown territory.

1237
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,280
So I'm...

1238
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,200
Especially if there's overlap in these pathways, right?

1239
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,200
As you've alluded to.

1240
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,440
There absolutely is overlap.

1241
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,680
Anyone who says there isn't, is myopic or lying?

1242
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,940
These are pathways that are additive.

1243
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:20,080
So it could be that taking two grams of metformin plus, I'm taking two other molecules, would

1244
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,380
be overdosing it.

1245
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,640
And I don't want to do that.

1246
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,280
So what I do is I start on a reasonable low dose based on all the data that I've read.

1247
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,520
And then I make sure that I'm okay.

1248
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,520
I feel okay.

1249
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,240
My blood tests are okay.

1250
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,120
And then I talk to the experts, they're all my friends, and I say, what do you think about

1251
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,400
going up to?

1252
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,160
One gram, one half gram.

1253
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,520
So actually, recently I have gone up to one and a half grams, given advice from people

1254
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,840
who shall remain nameless.

1255
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,260
Yes, we'll keep everybody nameless.

1256
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:53,560
So let's fast forward to some of these other molecules because this story is just so interesting.

1257
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:58,540
And feel free to go back and patch pieces of history if it makes things to where we

1258
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,540
are today.

1259
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,000
But today we are in a place where there's a company, there are two companies out there

1260
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,960
that are selling NR, precursor to NAD.

1261
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,360
They're packaging it with, is it Terrestilbene?

1262
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,640
Tell me what that molecule does specifically and why it would make sense to include that

1263
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,640
with NR.

1264
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,720
Yeah, so Terrestilbene is essentially just resveratrol with some methyl groups on it.

1265
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,120
It's a more novel, sexier version of resveratrol.

1266
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,120
But that's the...

1267
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,680
But is it any more active, in your opinion?

1268
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,880
So Lenny has told me that it is, but I don't know enough to be able to give a sensible

1269
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,880
answer.

1270
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,880
Okay.

1271
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:39,720
So you now have a cert activator with an NAD precursor that are both basically over

1272
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
the counter, right?

1273
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,720
That's right.

1274
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,080
So tell me about the excitement in that space.

1275
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,040
I don't want to get too much into the politics of the companies because they're at the time

1276
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,360
of this recording, they are in World War III.

1277
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,520
So let's just talk about the science and not all the other stuff.

1278
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,640
Yeah, well, if you take the 40,000 foot view of this...

1279
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:04,040
So Lenny is in his 60s now and I'm in my 40s, very late 40s.

1280
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,520
And you got to do a calculation, how many years do you have left to not only see what

1281
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,160
happens but potentially even be vindicated.

1282
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,400
And I'm sure that's part of what Lenny's thinking.

1283
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,360
What would Lenny be vindicated for?

1284
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,760
For finding that the sort of two ones are important for health, longevity, in humans.

1285
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,760
Oh, I see.

1286
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:27,480
Meaning that following this discovery, some of the air left the balloon and now there's

1287
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,960
a resurgence of, hey, no, it really did matter.

1288
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,920
Is that what you mean by being vindicated?

1289
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,600
Well, I think there's a race to see whose pathway is more important.

1290
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,600
Got it.

1291
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:43,840
And the sort of two ones and M. Tor and Amy Kynace and some others are in this race.

1292
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,520
I think it's a silly argument because they're all important and they talk to each other.

1293
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,520
Yes.

1294
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:53,000
But ego is involved and people want a legacy and Lenny's legacy, as I understand it, can't

1295
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,440
speak for him directly, but is that he wants to have made a major contribution to human

1296
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,440
health.

1297
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,360
And this is a way of showing that within a timeframe that's reasonable, who wants to

1298
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,360
wait another decade?

1299
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,200
If I was him, I wouldn't want to.

1300
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,680
And so I think that that was a good way of being able to quickly test the hypothesis

1301
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,480
in an area that, going through the supplement route.

1302
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:21,000
I, on the other hand, I think because I'd had the good experience with pharmaceuticals

1303
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,600
and I also had more time to wait, I took that route.

1304
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,440
And so the two of us are heading in parallel.

1305
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,280
No, we're very good friends.

1306
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:33,160
We talk all the time about this, but it's an interesting, from an historical perspective,

1307
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:38,400
that we've got these two guys who are taking very different routes to what we hope has

1308
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,760
achieved the same thing, which is to help people in the end.

1309
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:48,080
And Elysium, obviously they've talked very publicly about their goal is to sort of provide

1310
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,440
a supplement, but at a much higher quality, obviously in the United States.

1311
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,160
I can't speak to this in the, in other countries, but the regulatory environment here is quite

1312
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,040
unique in that basically the supplements are quite unregulated.

1313
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,200
So you're sort of at the mercy of the person who's making the supplement.

1314
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:07,600
And obviously having a number of Nobel laureates involved with a company like Elysium and a

1315
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,240
commitment, a public commitment to use the highest quality stuff, at least a person can

1316
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,400
buy this and say, look, I'm not getting crushed bird feathers, which I'm pretty much guaranteed

1317
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,440
to be getting with half the stuff I buy online.

1318
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:22,840
Look, I bring this up because I think half my patients are either taking Elysium's basis

1319
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:27,320
or ... I can't remember the name of the other company, Chromadex, is that the other ... Yeah.

1320
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,780
Half my patients are probably taking NR.

1321
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,200
They always ask me, what do you think?

1322
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,240
To which I say, I have no earthly clue.

1323
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,580
I'm pretty sure it's safe.

1324
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:38,380
So it passes the first test, which is I don't think it's hurting you.

1325
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:44,160
One of the issues I've always struggled with is if it worked half as well as it works in

1326
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,160
the mice, it shouldn't be subtle.

1327
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:52,560
You showed in one of your talks an exercise, a contrast between two mice running on a treadmill,

1328
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,000
and that was actually one of the milder successes.

1329
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,880
That was like a 50% improvement in exercise tolerance.

1330
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,600
I've seen other studies that talk about an 80% improvement in exercise tolerance.

1331
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,640
If people were experiencing a 20% improvement in exercise tolerance, I believe we'd know

1332
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,920
about it.

1333
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,860
Do you feel that that's happening and we're missing it, or do you feel it's just not going

1334
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:15,980
to be possible to elucidate that without a clinical trial, even though it's a supplement?

1335
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,660
I get a lot of emails every day.

1336
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,700
You might be the single most emailed person on this topic, I'm guessing, right?

1337
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,700
Oh, yeah.

1338
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,700
Wait till your book comes out.

1339
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:28,700
Probably a thousand of them this week, actually, and I'm not exaggerating.

1340
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,180
To any of you who've written to me, I'm sorry.

1341
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,380
I just can't answer them all.

1342
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,380
I will try.

1343
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,860
One of the main questions is-

1344
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:37,740
Well, hopefully by having this discussion, let's go as deep as you want into it so that

1345
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:43,500
you can say, go listen to that discussion and you'll get all your nuanced points across.

1346
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,260
Yeah, or go buy my book.

1347
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,260
Even better.

1348
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,260
That's coming out next year in 2019.

1349
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,620
Do you have a title for it yet, by the way?

1350
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,900
It's a tentative title.

1351
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,900
Okay.

1352
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,580
So at the time of this recording, people listening, we don't yet know the title, but David's book

1353
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,940
will probably be out in the late summer, early fall of 2019.

1354
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,940
That's right.

1355
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,940
Okay.

1356
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,740
Yeah, so I have some insights into this NAD world as it's developed.

1357
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,300
It's extremely hot.

1358
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,460
They're selling tons of the material, which is great.

1359
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,100
That helps people.

1360
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:18,860
Now I get a lot of emails from people who claim and they show me data that they used

1361
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:23,260
to do races when they were 40 and then they now they're 60.

1362
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,620
They can't win races.

1363
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:29,740
They can't cycle, but they've gone on this or that in our product or even at a man and

1364
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,040
now they're winning races again.

1365
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,700
So these are stories I hear constantly every few days, but I can't judge those.

1366
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,140
Because these are people I don't know.

1367
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,740
There's no placebo.

1368
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:44,500
But I think that some of this, if it were true, that's what we would expect.

1369
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,220
If these molecules could help people, you would hear these anecdotes, which I hear.

1370
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,900
But I can't declare that I know anything more than you, Peter, about this because they're

1371
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,220
all anecdotes.

1372
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,340
So that's why we're doing a human clinical trial.

1373
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,820
Now you mentioned N-M-N a moment ago.

1374
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:05,260
Can you tell us listening to this, the difference between NR, nicotinic riboside, which is a

1375
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,740
one-step precursor to NAD and NMN?

1376
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:08,940
Well, it's very simple.

1377
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:15,300
So NR is converted by the body into NMN and then NMN is immediately converted to NAD.

1378
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,300
So those are the steps.

1379
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,300
So I misspoke.

1380
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:22,220
I actually thought it was NR that was one step away from NAD and NMN went to NR, but

1381
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,820
it's the other way around.

1382
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,820
Correct.

1383
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:25,820
Okay.

1384
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:30,540
Both of these can be, we know definitively both of these can be brought into cells to

1385
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,720
be used as cellular building blocks for NAD.

1386
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,560
Is there any dispute about the ability to get from high plasma levels into the cell?

1387
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,560
Yeah.

1388
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,560
There's a debate.

1389
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,560
It's not earth shattering.

1390
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,560
It's very academic.

1391
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,640
But yeah, we're debating in the field about which molecule gets transported and which

1392
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,760
one doesn't.

1393
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,720
And NR definitely gets transported.

1394
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,520
The question is, does any NMN get in transported?

1395
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,920
And I believe you've written, and I think I read in one of your review articles, perhaps,

1396
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,600
but it could have been somebody else's, that NMN might be slightly more stable than NR.

1397
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,440
Well, we find that in a lab that if we put them in solution on the bench or leave them

1398
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:10,360
on the shelf, that NMN is more stable than NR.

1399
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,280
That's why I keep my molecules and lab's molecules in the freezer just to give them

1400
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,680
some extra shelf life.

1401
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,440
And did you imply by what you said a moment ago that there is no dispute that NR at least

1402
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,080
gets, if you have a high plasma level of NR, it is brought into the cell?

1403
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,520
Is that diffusion mediated?

1404
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
Is that transported?

1405
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,240
There's a transporter for NR.

1406
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,960
There's evidence that there's an NR transporter.

1407
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,480
But either way, they both raise NAD levels quite effectively in the body, in humans as

1408
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,480
well.

1409
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,520
And I'm sorry, I know I asked this already, but when you say they raise NAD levels, you

1410
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,560
mean mitochondrial NAD levels or cytoplasmic NAD levels?

1411
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,560
Oh, gee.

1412
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,040
Most of these studies have been done on whole cells from blood or tissue.

1413
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,040
So they're just like PBMCs or something like that?

1414
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,040
Yeah, exactly.

1415
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,040
Exactly.

1416
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,320
The problem with that is that it's a very dynamic system.

1417
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,920
This isn't a regular drug that just hangs around and you can measure it.

1418
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,760
This is actively utilized by the body.

1419
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,840
So even if it disappears into some pathway, it's still probably being recycled.

1420
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,480
So we have to be very careful not to jump to conclusions.

1421
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:13,000
If you don't see it in the blood, maybe it was taken up by the muscle or the brain.

1422
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,320
So these are the studies that are ongoing now.

1423
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,960
And if you see it in the PBMC, it doesn't mean it made it into the hepatocyte.

1424
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,960
Right.

1425
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,000
This is all just in an animal you can do that.

1426
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,240
We're starting to do those experiments in humans right now using NMR to be able to

1427
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,280
measure NAD levels in living tissue.

1428
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,720
And when you say NMR, do you mean like MRS or like?

1429
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,720
Yes.

1430
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,720
Okay.

1431
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,720
I do.

1432
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
So phosphorus, MRS.

1433
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,720
Yeah.

1434
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,720
And you can measure ATP, NAD.

1435
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,720
Right, right.

1436
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,080
So those are really powerful and you can actually now do it with seven Tesla magnets with people

1437
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,680
in the machine while they're exercising.

1438
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:49,280
So that's where we're headed with this in our next clinical trial, hopefully.

1439
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:55,400
In your intuition, David, if you could cherry pick the hierarchy with where you'd want to

1440
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:00,280
see the upregulation of NAD most, which cells would you preferentially be directing it into?

1441
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,880
Well, it depends on the...

1442
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,960
If we want to treat a disease, obviously we've got to target that particular tissue.

1443
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,960
So if we're treating a mitochondrial disorder of the muscle, obviously the muscle, for longevity,

1444
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,960
I would want it to definitely get into all tissues if possible.

1445
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,560
I think it would help if it could get into the hypothalamus where there's some central

1446
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,920
regulation.

1447
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,080
But what the field has discovered is that all these tissues, not all, but many of these

1448
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,280
major tissues are secreting proteins that can induce longevity.

1449
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,960
So I wouldn't want to prioritize unless we're talking about a particular disease like liver

1450
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,400
disease or muscle wasting.

1451
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,880
One of the things David Sabatini and I talk a lot about, I'm actually going to see David

1452
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:44,560
for dinner tonight and I'm sure this will come up, is if you could wave a magic wand

1453
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,040
and make rapamycin, for example, tissue specific, let alone complex specific.

1454
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,160
But you get into this.

1455
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,720
And the same thing with metformin.

1456
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,280
It probably does have some tissue specificity, probably working more in the liver than it

1457
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,640
is working in other cells.

1458
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,240
It seems unlikely that a molecule would have uniform and ubiquitous take-up of all cells,

1459
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,240
right?

1460
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,240
Of course, yeah.

1461
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,160
So with NAD, we don't know.

1462
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:13,000
We're basically still in the infancy of knowing where the NR or NMN would be preferentially

1463
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
taken up.

1464
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,400
The MRS studies would help us understand that.

1465
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,400
So that's going to help.

1466
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:21,040
And the reason I qualified that statement was that we're still getting approval for

1467
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,920
these studies, but that's the plan.

1468
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:27,760
But also there are labs that I'm aware of who I think shall remain nameless as well

1469
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,480
for to protect their own confidentiality, but they are working on tracer studies to

1470
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,600
be able to give NR and NMN and see where it goes in the body and be able to measure each

1471
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,600
tissue.

1472
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,040
That we'll know probably within the next six months to a year.

1473
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:46,320
So you mentioned that what Elysium or Chromadex are doing is using ... They're just basically

1474
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,480
in a different regulatory paradigm, which is they're using molecules that are generally

1475
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,480
regarded as safe.

1476
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,840
They're outside of these IND pathways.

1477
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,160
You're interested in the same sort of targets, but you're going to go down ... I don't want

1478
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,600
to say more rigorous, but it is more rigorous.

1479
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,600
Let's call this my spade.

1480
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,600
You're going down a much more rigorous pathway.

1481
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,600
It's more expensive, that's for sure.

1482
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,600
Yeah.

1483
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,700
I mean, literally two logs more expensive, if not three logs more expensive.

1484
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:15,060
I want to be sensitive to any confidentiality because that's the nature of the work that

1485
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,060
you're doing now.

1486
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:20,100
But what can you tell us about the molecules you're working on directly and indirectly

1487
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,100
in that space?

1488
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,100
Sure.

1489
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,220
In the NAD space, there's a couple of companies.

1490
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:28,460
One is ... I can go of old is called Metro Biotech, which is here in Massachusetts.

1491
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:32,180
And they work on ... They've been working for five years on making NAD precursor molecules

1492
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:36,020
that are better than these two that are available publicly.

1493
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:38,300
And there are ways to improve them.

1494
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:42,260
Better bioavailability, better stability, better efficacy.

1495
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:45,100
And those are moving into the clinic as well.

1496
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:49,140
And then there's another company called Jumpstart Fertility, which is both here in Massachusetts

1497
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,460
and down in Australia.

1498
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:55,860
And we're finding really great effects of these molecules on female infertility or low

1499
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,500
fertility.

1500
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,460
And that's something we're going to be publishing shortly.

1501
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,740
And is there a type of infertility that this seems most amenable to?

1502
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:07,380
Because going back to your evolutionary argument, under periods of stress, we see fertility

1503
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,900
as one of the first things to go for obvious reasons.

1504
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,940
But infertility comes in so many flavors, right?

1505
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:16,540
There could be an inability to release an egg.

1506
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,500
There can be aneuploidy.

1507
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,020
Even when the eggs are secreted, there can be uterine hostility.

1508
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,540
There's so many things that can result in infertility.

1509
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,540
What does this particular thing target?

1510
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:30,060
Well, so what we find in the biochemical pathway we've figured out, and we published a little

1511
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:35,140
bit on this, is that there's a protein called BabR1, which is a kinase that regulates spindle

1512
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,460
quality.

1513
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:40,260
And one of the problems with old eggs is that they don't have nice spindles and they rip

1514
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,660
their chromosomes apart when they...

1515
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,660
Hence the aneuploidy.

1516
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:43,660
Exactly.

1517
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:47,260
So down syndrome, et cetera, abortion, aborted fetuses.

1518
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:54,420
But what we found is that this BabR1 is regulated by the SRT2 protein, which requires NAD.

1519
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,380
And what we think is going on after chemotherapy or during aging is that the levels of NAD

1520
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:04,380
in the ovary and in the egg are low and it's getting this aneuploidy.

1521
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,860
And that explains why when we give NAD to...

1522
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:14,460
Or any precursors to eggs in vivo, the eggs come out healthier, more numerous, and are

1523
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,780
much better at allowing for fertilization and healthy offspring.

1524
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:22,540
I don't know much about fertility as this next question will illustrate, but presumably

1525
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,060
you can still see aneuploidy on the male side.

1526
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:28,220
So is there a male fertility opportunity here as well?

1527
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:33,900
I realize it's not as probably as common a problem, but presumably you still have to

1528
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,180
have a perfect split of the chromosome in the sperm.

1529
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,180
Yeah.

1530
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,180
Possibly.

1531
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,180
It's an area that we're looking into.

1532
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:46,340
I don't have anything solid enough to be able to say if it works or not, but in theory, yeah.

1533
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,940
And you just went back to something earlier.

1534
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,900
Is NMN available over the counter?

1535
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,020
It is.

1536
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,580
More recently I can see it on the internet.

1537
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,580
Okay.

1538
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:58,660
But one of the things that I want to bring up is you can find my name all over these

1539
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,820
products.

1540
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:00,820
Not basis.

1541
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,700
They're reputable, but there are others that use my name all over the place.

1542
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,340
Meaning without your permission.

1543
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,340
Correct.

1544
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,340
And Harvard's permission.

1545
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:11,500
And so I've sent more cease and desist letters than you can imagine, and they keep popping

1546
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,500
up.

1547
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,500
So that's an important point.

1548
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,740
So if a listener after this talk is saying, hey, David Sinclair sounds like a smart, reputable

1549
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:18,740
guy.

1550
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:19,980
If his name's on something, I should take it.

1551
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:24,380
What can your name be associated with right now that is with your permission?

1552
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,380
Nothing.

1553
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,380
Okay.

1554
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:29,220
So basically anything that's out there that's over the counter that has your name on it

1555
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,420
is not endorsed by you.

1556
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,420
Correct.

1557
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,420
Okay.

1558
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,420
Thank you for clarifying that.

1559
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,460
Great.

1560
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,460
Yeah, it is.

1561
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,460
But I try to stay above the fray.

1562
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:41,060
It's nice when you can stand on Harvard's shoulders and let their lawyers send those

1563
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,300
cease and desist letters.

1564
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:45,420
It would be nice if that were true when I spend a portion of my salary every year on

1565
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,420
this.

1566
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,420
Really?

1567
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,100
That's a shame.

1568
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,380
I'm sorry to hear that.

1569
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:53,100
So fertility is a super interesting angle.

1570
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,500
I would have never thought about that.

1571
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:00,900
That strikes me as highly testable as well, which one of the challenges of longevity research,

1572
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:07,260
as you know better than I do, is if you want to make claims in humans, you better buckle

1573
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:10,540
up because it's going to be ... I mean, it's almost untestable.

1574
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:15,700
So when you look at what other companies are doing, like Restore Bio going down the mTOR

1575
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,140
pathway, they're not going after longevity, right?

1576
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:22,460
They're going after very, very specific indications that are testable in shorter periods of time

1577
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,300
in a respiratory failure, things like that.

1578
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,980
What are the other disease states that you think would be most exciting if you don't

1579
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,100
already have plans to go down that from your pharmacologic standpoint?

1580
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:38,020
Well, we've been targeting diseases that are rare and have a high unmet need.

1581
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:41,060
So I can't divulge all of those because that's company stuff.

1582
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,940
But the fertility part, that's very clear.

1583
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:49,340
I'm able to tell you that those trials will begin next year in IVF clinics.

1584
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:53,580
And that will be the first time a doctor looks at those eggs from a woman.

1585
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:57,260
She'll probably know that it's working or not.

1586
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,260
So that's very clear.

1587
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:02,500
So it's a company ... So we're sitting right now in a headquarters that is the name of

1588
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,500
... What's it called?

1589
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,940
Is it Life Bioscience?

1590
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,940
Yes.

1591
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:11,620
And that's a parent company or sort of ... Tell me how that fits into a number of the scientific

1592
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,980
entities that you're involved in.

1593
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:18,180
So Life Bioscience is a family of companies that uses shared resources and knowledge.

1594
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:23,060
There are eight of us right now that work on different aspects of aging, not just NAD

1595
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,460
biology, but the usual suspects.

1596
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,780
All the major hallmarks of aging that we could list off.

1597
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:33,340
Each one of these companies has world leaders and drug development programs in that so that

1598
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:38,240
we think we can, quote unquote, conquer aging from different aspects.

1599
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,820
But together we're stronger as one unified company, Life Biosciences.

1600
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:48,740
Earlier you spoke about sort of eight or nine central tenets of aging.

1601
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,220
We've covered some of them, and I'm guessing that your book is going to go into this in

1602
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,220
greater detail.

1603
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:59,140
But can you rehash what you ... Or at least as many of those as you're going to recall

1604
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:01,500
on the spot, not to put you on the spot.

1605
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,500
That's a long list.

1606
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,500
Yeah, sure.

1607
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,980
There's epigenetic changes, cells of cell communication and inflammation.

1608
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,620
Let me count this.

1609
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:11,580
Analytics, so senescent cells build up.

1610
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,180
There's protein misfolding.

1611
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,940
There's telomere loss and genomic instability.

1612
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:17,380
There's metabolic changes.

1613
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:21,100
So MP kinase and metformin would address that.

1614
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:27,980
And then there's responses to what we call amino acids and other nutrient inputs.

1615
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,020
And those collectively go awry during aging.

1616
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,740
But what causes all of those to happen?

1617
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,660
That's something that we've been working on for quite a while.

1618
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:39,580
And you think those are more coupled than they are uncoupled, those pathways?

1619
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:44,320
Or do you think that ... I mean, there are clearly situations in which external stressors

1620
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,460
can perturb more than one of those.

1621
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:51,380
But senescence seems somewhat uncoupled from nutrient sensing, doesn't it?

1622
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,380
It may.

1623
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,180
And I'm not asking that rhetorically.

1624
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,180
I just don't know.

1625
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,180
Well, no.

1626
01:20:56,180 --> 01:21:01,020
The answer is we think that we've found an explanation for all of these things to happen.

1627
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,580
A unifying theory?

1628
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:03,580
Right.

1629
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,860
So I've kept it close to my vest for a number of years.

1630
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:10,780
But it actually goes all the way back to the Sirtuin story in yeast.

1631
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:15,220
And hopefully the listeners who've stuck with this podcast are still with us because this

1632
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,220
is the punchline.

1633
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,980
I promise you they are with us.

1634
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:22,980
So the punchline is that ... So this is all off the top of my head here.

1635
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:28,940
We haven't published this yet, but I'm going to tell you my thoughts and your listeners.

1636
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,780
So the genome is digital information.

1637
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,180
It's very easy to preserve.

1638
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:36,340
It's the reason we went from analog to digital in the 2000s.

1639
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,300
DNA is four letters.

1640
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,300
It's digital.

1641
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,300
It's easy to replicate.

1642
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,300
It's easy to store.

1643
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,300
You can boil it.

1644
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,300
It's very robust.

1645
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:47,420
What we've actually come to discover is that the genome is fairly intact in old people

1646
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,020
and old animals.

1647
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,180
We've sequenced the genomes of lots of old mice.

1648
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,180
And all the genes are still largely intact.

1649
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,180
So what's going wrong?

1650
01:21:55,180 --> 01:22:01,180
Well, the other part of information that you inherit from your parents is the epigenetic

1651
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,180
information.

1652
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:07,140
And I use that term loosely, but basically it means what's the pattern of gene expression,

1653
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:10,020
which genes are turned on and off at which time.

1654
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,620
And that is analog information.

1655
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:16,660
That has to be analog because instead of just being a single code, it has to operate

1656
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:19,900
in three dimensions, actually four if you count time.

1657
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:21,580
And so that's an analog system.

1658
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:27,740
And it's constantly adapting to what we eat, what we drink, if we run, when we sleep.

1659
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,380
And you have to turn genes on and off all the time.

1660
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:35,500
But that pattern of gene expression that's set down when we're young, because it's analog,

1661
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,820
analog information doesn't last very long.

1662
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:43,260
Anyone who's had a record player or magnetic tape knows that these things don't last.

1663
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:48,100
And that's the problem, I think, with aging, is that we don't lose the digital information.

1664
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:51,620
So the compact disk of our lives is still intact when rolled.

1665
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:56,100
But it's as if we've got a scratched CD and the cells don't read the right genes at the

1666
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,100
right time anymore.

1667
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,100
And they lose their identity.

1668
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:02,860
In fact, if we, there's an analogy, which is called Waddington's landscape, where in

1669
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,820
the 1950s, Waddington grew a picture.

1670
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:07,260
It's a beautiful picture of some hills.

1671
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,820
It's a mountainscape.

1672
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:13,480
And cells actually roll down the mountainscape and land in different valleys down below.

1673
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:18,740
And that's to, before he had access to the genome, that was his way of saying, this is

1674
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,300
how cells know what they are.

1675
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,900
They land in these valleys and they stay there.

1676
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,620
But what I think is happening during aging is due to the vibration of noise over time,

1677
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,380
we lose that pattern of gene expression.

1678
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,820
We lose that information, genetic information.

1679
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:37,700
And those cells or those marbles in Waddington's landscape, they jump over into different

1680
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,620
valleys and lose their identity.

1681
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:42,100
So your neurons are not functional like neurons anymore.

1682
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,580
Your liver cells are more like neurons.

1683
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,140
And we see that in our lab.

1684
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:50,300
We're just writing up a couple of papers right now for this.

1685
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:56,540
And we're able to actually manipulate the epigenome in cells and in mice and have a

1686
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,820
look what happens to those animals.

1687
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:01,140
And the prediction is that you get all the hallmarks of aging.

1688
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:06,300
The challenge with this entire space is you think back to the time in the 1950s when he

1689
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,660
created that analogy.

1690
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:13,540
And in some ways, it's amazing that it could still be relevant 75, 80 years later, whatever

1691
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,820
it is.

1692
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:20,300
On the other hand, it humbles you to realize how much more has been learned about that

1693
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,500
process in that time.

1694
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:27,380
And sometimes I think about it because you and I are interested in the same problem that

1695
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:29,380
I'm worried I just don't know anything.

1696
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:35,020
I'm worried that in 10 years I'll look back at my hypotheses and my, or not even my hypothesis,

1697
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:39,180
just my understanding of the current state of the art today and think, you know what,

1698
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:44,500
that was directionally right, but it was so oversimplified.

1699
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,220
And oh my goodness, like, you know, so it's sort of like we're back in this problem of

1700
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,220
time.

1701
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,220
Like we're going to run out of time.

1702
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:54,500
And I mean, how confident are you that in, because you and I are almost the same age,

1703
01:24:54,500 --> 01:25:00,220
how confident are you that in our lifetime we will see step function changes in human

1704
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,220
longevity?

1705
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:07,220
And to put this in context, there really hasn't been a step function change in human longevity

1706
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,900
probably since the introduction of sanitation.

1707
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:15,100
I mean, everything has been quite incremental, maybe antibiotics, vaccinations, antibiotics

1708
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,620
have probably been the last step function change.

1709
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,020
Will we see one in our lifetime?

1710
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,020
How confident are you?

1711
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:21,700
I'm getting more and more confident.

1712
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:26,060
Honestly, when I started in this field, I thought we'd probably not see the type of

1713
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,940
technologies that I'm seeing now.

1714
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:32,940
It's making my head spin, not just in the technologies, but also the investment and

1715
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:34,460
the number of people working on this now.

1716
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,780
This was the back order of biology when we started.

1717
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:41,380
And there's been some new results, which I'll just hint upon because we haven't published

1718
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:46,860
and it's very early, but I've seen, it sounds like a scene out of Blade Runner, but I've

1719
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,900
seen things you wouldn't believe.

1720
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:53,940
It's maybe not that dramatic, but let me go back to the compact disk analogy.

1721
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,020
You've got the scratched CD.

1722
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,180
How do you find the polish?

1723
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,740
What is that?

1724
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,020
Let's go back to the yeast analogy.

1725
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,100
What causes those scratches?

1726
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,060
Why do you get loss of gene regulation?

1727
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:08,660
Anyone who was paying attention earlier on in this conversation will remember that these

1728
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:14,820
DNA breaks in the chromosome, broken chromosomes, distract the CER complex and they move away

1729
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:18,980
and you get the expression of genes that have no right being on.

1730
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:24,020
Because the CER-2-1s have lost, they're distracted from the deactivation function and they're

1731
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,740
dealing with the repair function.

1732
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:26,740
Exactly.

1733
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:31,420
So using that, what we've got a lot of evidence for now is that something very similar, if

1734
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:36,500
not essentially identical in principle, happens in mammals as we age.

1735
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:41,540
What that means is that insults to the genome, and one of the major insults is a double strand

1736
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:46,300
break, but there are probably others, cause these proteins, CER-2-1s and other factors,

1737
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:51,060
I'm not saying only CER-2-1s, but factors that control gene expression, silencing and

1738
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:56,460
other things, have a dual role, we know, in DNA repair and other things, such as responding

1739
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:00,100
to stresses, heat, whatever.

1740
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:04,500
But this is the cell's way of coordinating gene expression changes, hunkering down during

1741
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,420
times of adversity and going off to repair the system, which in this case we study DNA

1742
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:10,620
breaks.

1743
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,220
And that's a beautiful system when you're young.

1744
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:13,620
It works great.

1745
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:17,700
You get exposed to cosmic rays, you go out in the sun, you've got lots of DNA breaks,

1746
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,860
eventually these proteins will go, repair those breaks, and then go back to where they

1747
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:26,580
came from to settle down the response, to turn off the inflammation, to turn off the

1748
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:28,300
DNA repair when it's not needed.

1749
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:31,580
But the problem we think is it's antagonistic pleiotropy.

1750
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:38,020
Okay, so Peter Medawar and the other brilliant scientists in the 50s speculated, I think

1751
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:41,300
correctly is that things that are really good for you when you're young come back to bite

1752
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,860
you in the ass when you're older.

1753
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:45,500
And I think that's what's happening here is that this response to these stresses like

1754
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,940
a break end up not just distracting these proteins, but end up disrupting the actual

1755
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,820
structure of our chromatin.

1756
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:56,060
And these proteins don't always go back to where they came from 100%.

1757
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,980
Do that for 70 or 80 years.

1758
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:02,860
And it's not surprising that the genes that were once perfectly programmed and turned

1759
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,340
on at the right time, lose their ability to do that.

1760
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:11,500
And we've got remnants of that program when we're 70 and 80.

1761
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,140
What's exciting is that information is still there to be accessed.

1762
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:17,700
The question is, how do you get the cells to remember to access at the right time?

1763
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,060
What's that polish?

1764
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,900
And I think we're pretty close to finding that.

1765
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:27,820
If you had unlimited resources, and not just financial resources, but metaphysical resources,

1766
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:30,580
like any experiment would be ethical.

1767
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:34,340
You could do something that today no IRB would approve.

1768
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:38,860
Is there an experiment that you would wish to see done that could accelerate our knowledge

1769
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,980
in this space log fold?

1770
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:45,140
That would mean staying within ethical boundaries.

1771
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:50,460
For example, to do a human experiment in longevity would be ethical, but impractical

1772
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,900
because of the duration of time.

1773
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:55,900
But if I gave you a time machine and an infinite amount of resources, tell me what the most

1774
01:28:55,900 --> 01:29:00,420
elegant experiment you can think of that would, again, just leapfrog our knowledge.

1775
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:06,460
So the experiment that needs to be done, whether it's with metformin or other drugs in development,

1776
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:14,900
including these raphologs and the NAD precursors, is to take a group of 5,000 people.

1777
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,380
That would be sufficient.

1778
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:19,660
And just give them the medicine and wait three, four years.

1779
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:24,940
And you'd know from that number of people that you're changing the hazard ratio, the

1780
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:26,340
mortality rate.

1781
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,220
You'd have to start with people probably in their 70s.

1782
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:30,940
I think that was the calculation that I did.

1783
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,420
But you don't need to wait a whole lifetime to know that these things work.

1784
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:35,100
So this is basically Nier's argument.

1785
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,100
Yeah, exactly.

1786
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:39,380
Nier's not doing mortality as much as he's doing health span.

1787
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,380
But it's exactly right.

1788
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,380
You do enough people.

1789
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:44,420
I mean, it's going to cost tens of millions of dollars.

1790
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:47,700
But think of the trillions of dollars that would be saved if we can prove this.

1791
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:52,380
But if I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment, what if by doing that experiment,

1792
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:57,540
we are missing the opportunity, the window of opportunity for these drugs to act?

1793
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:02,580
In other words, we know that caloric restriction is less and less effective the longer you

1794
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,780
wait in the organism, at least within mice.

1795
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:08,820
And that's what made rapamycin so interesting is it blew everybody away that you could start

1796
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:18,300
this drug on mice that were 600 days old and they still had 9%, 14% increase in lifespan.

1797
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:24,500
If you had more time, do you think we could get a more clear answer starting earlier?

1798
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,620
Acknowledging that you'd have to wait longer if you wanted to use a hard outcome.

1799
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:32,060
Do you worry that we would risk doing this in people in their eighth decade that it might

1800
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:35,660
not work, but that just tells us that it doesn't work late, not that it doesn't work

1801
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:36,660
period?

1802
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:37,660
I don't worry about that.

1803
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:43,860
We could, with enough capital and money invested, we could do multiple different experiments.

1804
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,460
We could do people in their 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s.

1805
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:48,860
So dream with me.

1806
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:52,860
The other thing that makes me optimistic is it's not just rapamycin that works late in

1807
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:53,860
life.

1808
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:58,900
We've got results in my lab now that we'll be publishing that if we start even later

1809
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:03,580
than 600 days in a mouse, which is what, closer to a 75-80?

1810
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,300
We can still extend lifespan.

1811
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:06,300
Using what?

1812
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,300
I know you won't name the company.

1813
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,300
No, I can tell you.

1814
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,300
We're using the NMN.

1815
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,340
So there are multiple ways to act late in life.

1816
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:19,100
When you use NMN in the lab, are you also using a PT analog or a resveratrol analog?

1817
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,700
Are you able to just use NMN and see?

1818
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,460
Just the natural molecule will work.

1819
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,460
We're now gearing up to do the drug subjects.

1820
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:28,660
This is not in high-fat, over-fed animals.

1821
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:29,940
This is in wild-type animals.

1822
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,580
We just put it in there drinking water.

1823
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,500
Oh, because NMN is more soluble.

1824
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,500
Exactly.

1825
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,500
Interesting.

1826
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,380
Yeah, but we've got better molecules that we're now testing.

1827
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:42,620
We think that we can beat, or again, try to beat, rapamycin and maybe a combination together.

1828
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:44,300
Do you think there's overlap in those pathways?

1829
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,300
Yeah, yeah.

1830
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,300
We're both thinking the same thing.

1831
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,300
We want to do the combination.

1832
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1833
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,460
And I want to take the combination one day.

1834
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:54,020
Well, we now actually have some early data.

1835
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:59,140
I don't want to scoot myself, but we're able to now genetically modify adult mice with

1836
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:02,700
AAV, the virus, the endosociative virus.

1837
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,140
And we can now genetically change a mouse.

1838
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:10,140
So we've just put in all seven sort of genes into mice, in old mice.

1839
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:13,060
You've put the seven human sort genes into mice.

1840
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,140
Seven mouse genes into the mouse.

1841
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:19,820
But that sort of experiment would have taken a decade to do just a few years ago, but now

1842
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:22,420
that we can deliver genes, we can do very good experiments.

1843
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,100
Not only that, we can also do multiplexed.

1844
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:28,380
We can do combinations of genes and combinations of molecules.

1845
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:29,380
So even experiment.

1846
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,820
Yeah, you're stacking the matrix now.

1847
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:31,820
Well, yeah.

1848
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,180
I mean, we should be doing this.

1849
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,420
It's just a matter of resources.

1850
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,900
But I think we're now at a point in the aging community where these combinations need to

1851
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,900
be tested.

1852
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,540
It's the question that's on everybody's mind.

1853
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,340
What happens if you put them in combination?

1854
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,860
Are they better or worse together?

1855
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:51,060
And so what we've done is we've put all seven sort of genes into a mouse and fed them some

1856
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:55,540
man-to-man to give them the fuel and the genetic requirement.

1857
01:32:55,540 --> 01:33:00,060
And interestingly, there are additive effects when you do both of those things.

1858
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:04,380
And this is how we're able to see these dramatic effects in these old mice.

1859
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:13,460
So is your optimism towards the NAD precursor space and these two inactivating space equivalent?

1860
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:16,220
And do you see them as necessarily parallel paths?

1861
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,420
They have different uses.

1862
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:21,140
The NAD is where I'm mostly focused on now.

1863
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,940
And is that because of the observed age-related decline in NAD?

1864
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:30,420
In part, but it's also because in theory, all of the seven Sirtuins should be good.

1865
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:36,620
And their lack of NAD could be the main problem that's going on in older people.

1866
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:41,580
And so the idea is that instead of just activating one Sirtuin, which is what resveratrol did,

1867
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:46,680
we think, you can potentially activate all seven of them and replenish what's been lost

1868
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,180
over time.

1869
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,540
And I think seven is probably better than one.

1870
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:54,500
You mentioned at the outset of this discussion that you were four years old when you became

1871
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,540
aware of mortality.

1872
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,700
Was there something that occurred that made you aware of mortality at such a young age?

1873
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:03,300
I had an unusual grandmother who was brutally honest with me.

1874
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,300
She would never lie.

1875
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,300
And any question I asked, I was quite...

1876
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,380
And you were probably very precocious and curious.

1877
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:09,380
I suppose I was.

1878
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:10,820
But yeah, she would never lie.

1879
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:15,100
So my question that most kids have is, are you always going to be around?

1880
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,100
She didn't even...

1881
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,100
She didn't call her grandma.

1882
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,420
She wanted to use her first name, which is Vera.

1883
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,780
So Vera, you're always going to be around.

1884
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,780
Of course not.

1885
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:22,780
I'm going to die.

1886
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,300
Yeah, but what about mom and dad?

1887
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,780
Yeah, they're going to die.

1888
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:26,780
What about my cat?

1889
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,780
It's going to die.

1890
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:31,700
And then of course you're thinking, if they're all going to die, what's going to happen to

1891
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,700
me?

1892
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,220
But it turns out all kids go through this.

1893
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:39,140
It's been studied extensively that between the ages of four and seven, kids understand

1894
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,980
that there's death.

1895
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:41,980
And at first they're in denial.

1896
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:45,740
They're saying, well, maybe those adults will die, but my teachers and my parents, they're

1897
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:46,900
not going to die.

1898
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,460
But then by age seven, it's undeniable.

1899
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:51,820
All kids know that everything around them that's living at one day will die, including

1900
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,820
themselves.

1901
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:58,620
But what's very interesting that happens at age seven is it's buried deep in the subconscious.

1902
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:02,740
You very rarely think about it until you have to, because I don't think as a species we

1903
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:06,980
could get by for all running around, oh my God, we're going to die one day.

1904
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:10,700
So seven-year-olds onward till about 50, you try not to think about it.

1905
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:11,700
That's pretty common.

1906
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,800
You start looking at yourself in the mirror at 50.

1907
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,020
You notice your teeth are wearing out.

1908
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,300
You feel a little bit of age.

1909
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:16,980
You see some wrinkles.

1910
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:19,540
You think, oh, yeah, crap.

1911
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,260
This is really happening.

1912
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,260
And you think more and more about it.

1913
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,060
I'm unusual because I work on this every day.

1914
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,500
So I'm always thinking about it.

1915
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,860
But I think on average, when I talk to people, especially in their 20s and 30s, it's not

1916
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:35,500
something that is on their radar because it's going to be something that happens in a

1917
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,300
distant future that they're not even looking at.

1918
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:38,260
Do you have kids?

1919
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:38,900
I have three.

1920
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:39,700
How old are they?

1921
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:41,940
They are 15, 13 and 11.

1922
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,660
How do you explain what you do to them?

1923
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:47,020
I was just as brutal to them as my grandmother was to me.

1924
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:48,220
Yeah.

1925
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:52,660
And actually I saw my oldest daughter go through this, actually all my kids, but it

1926
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,660
was more dramatic to see it for the first time myself.

1927
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,740
And I gave a TED Talk about this.

1928
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:01,940
When I told her that I was going to die, she burst out crying and for a week couldn't

1929
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:02,300
sleep.

1930
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,220
It was traumatic.

1931
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:07,420
And, you know, maybe I'm a cruel parent, but I also try not to BS my kids either.

1932
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:12,980
But what I saw with her was what even I think most kids do, including myself was, you

1933
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,820
just can't think about it.

1934
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:15,500
It drives you not, you won't sleep.

1935
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:18,940
So she forgot about it and we've never talked about it ever again.

1936
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,740
And if I talk about death, she says, shut up.

1937
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,700
Don't want to hear about it.

1938
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:27,980
And she probably won't think about it in a big way until I'm old or her grandparents

1939
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:28,300
are dying.

1940
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,940
David, this has been a really interesting discussion.

1941
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,540
I want to be sensitive to your time.

1942
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:36,820
I think the listeners of this podcast will be upset to know that we're only going for

1943
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:40,860
about, you know, an hour and 40 minutes instead of the usual three or four hours.

1944
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:45,380
But where can people find you on social media and how do you like to interact with

1945
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:49,140
people that have questions besides adding to the list of the thousands of emails you

1946
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:49,580
get a day?

1947
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,220
Yeah, emails.

1948
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:55,460
I can't reply to everyone, but on social media, I'm now on social media.

1949
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,580
I find that's a good way to communicate with people.

1950
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:02,140
And so I have a Twitter handle, which is David Asyncler.

1951
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:07,220
And I'm also on LinkedIn, but we're putting together a social media page so we can have

1952
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:07,900
a discussion.

1953
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,020
It's now there's so many people interested in this.

1954
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:11,340
Yeah.

1955
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:14,860
And the information that's locked in my head seems to be on demand.

1956
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:16,100
So that's how I want to reach people.

1957
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:21,260
This book is coming out, which has me regurgitating and vomiting on the page, everything

1958
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:27,820
from what we've learned in my life with my kids all the way through to understanding why we

1959
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:31,460
age in this universal hypothesis that we're putting, I'm putting forward.

1960
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:35,140
And then the consequences of what happens when we do this.

1961
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,620
Now, it's not a question of if anymore.

1962
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,660
It's a when it's going to happen.

1963
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:40,540
What happens to planet earth?

1964
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,580
What happens to humanity?

1965
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:45,020
What happens to your family as this starts to come out?

1966
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:49,660
And some good, some bad, what do you have to get ready for economically, socially?

1967
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,820
And it's all going to be in there.

1968
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:52,300
Well, I really look forward to reading it.

1969
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,100
You know, I'm in the midst of writing a book as well.

1970
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:59,100
And I'm guessing you struggled with the same thing I'm struggling with, which is not just

1971
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:03,500
the writing of it, but more importantly, you almost don't want to hand the thing in

1972
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,500
because you know that the day you hand it in, there's something new that you're going to

1973
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,340
want. You're going to know something more.

1974
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:14,300
And so as we were talking about it before we started the podcast, like you submit these

1975
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,980
books a full year before they hit the press.

1976
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:20,660
And then, of course, it basically is a static document until, you know, sure, you could

1977
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,900
have an online updated to information.

1978
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,220
But did you struggle with that?

1979
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:30,380
Especially, I think, you know, people like us, I think, have a little bit of a humility

1980
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:31,940
around the half life of facts.

1981
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:35,740
And that's that sounds like a very sort of pompous thing for us to say.

1982
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:41,180
But I just think we have the luxury of knowing that basically whatever we know today is, you

1983
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:43,820
know, quite likely to not be entirely true tomorrow.

1984
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,380
How did you cope with that?

1985
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,820
This is now just a very personal question for me as I'm struggling with this phenomenon.

1986
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:51,540
Well, yeah, you're a perceptive guy, Peter.

1987
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:55,900
So I'm also one of those guys that I'm at the podium about to give a talk to a thousand

1988
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,740
people. I'm still changing my PowerPoint slides.

1989
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,700
I'm just obsessed with perfection.

1990
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,300
And that's one of my downfalls.

1991
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:03,660
Same thing with the book.

1992
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:07,820
I've been writing it for 10 years and it's needed updating, of course, even to the point

1993
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,380
that last night I was editing it.

1994
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:13,060
I've already turned it into my editor three weeks ago.

1995
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,660
You're a nightmare to the editor.

1996
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:17,660
And she's received probably seven updates already.

1997
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,700
And I'm going to stop.

1998
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:24,500
I promised. But every time I wake up, there's something more really interesting to add that I

1999
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,340
want to put in there.

2000
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,500
And, you know, a year from now, I think it's going to be an even better book than it is now.

2001
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:32,180
But I'm really happy with everything I've gotten down on the page.

2002
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:36,900
Because when I talk to people, people write to me every day, unable to answer questions that I

2003
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,780
think are burning in a lot of people's minds.

2004
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:40,060
Well, David, this has been great.

2005
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:44,420
I find it sometimes hard to talk to people you don't know until the day of the podcast, which is

2006
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:49,180
the case here. But I found there's a common language that we that we speak or maybe a common

2007
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,460
passion, not a common language.

2008
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,620
This is a topic that's new to me.

2009
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:54,980
But anyway, this has been really exciting and I can't thank you enough for your time.

2010
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,220
Well, I appreciate the opportunity and I really enjoyed it too.

2011
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:57,580
Thanks.
