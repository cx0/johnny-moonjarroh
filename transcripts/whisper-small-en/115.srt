00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,920
today's episode. I guess this week is professor David Watkins. David is a professor of pathology

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,840
at the George Washington University Medical School, where he recently relocated from the

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,680
University of Miami. There's an interesting story about his recent relocation, which we

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,200
touched on at the opening part of this interview. Dr. Watkins was elected a fellow of the American

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,640
Academy of Microbiology and was vice chair of research in pathology at the University of Miami

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,440
prior to this recent transition. His early work focused on the similarities between non-human

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,480
primate, simian immunodeficiency virus, SIV, and HIV. In fact, SIV is a great animal model for

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,440
HIV, which is where David has spent the bulk of his career. We touch on that quite a bit in this

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,160
episode, because there's a lot you can learn about what may or may not work with coronavirus.

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,400
Obviously, the purpose of this discussion was really to talk about coronavirus, but really,

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,600
what I find great about this episode is the immunology 101 discussion that I wanted to open

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,360
with, and we did open with, but we went deeper than I expected we would go. I just can't say

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,600
enough about that. I think if you are trying to make sense of what you are hearing about this

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,000
vaccine versus that vaccine versus this test for antibodies versus that test for antibodies,

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,520
if that stuff isn't crystal clear to you, you're going to want to listen to this. Even if you

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,960
don't care about some of the other stuff we get into in the more nuanced science later on,

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,520
I think the first part of this interview will appeal to anybody who's trying to understand

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,880
immunology and doesn't know the difference between the innate system versus the adaptive

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,640
system, the cellular system versus the humoral system. I think the show notes for this are

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,120
going to be really helpful because again, there's just so much content here. David does just a great

29
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,240
job explaining the overall different categories of vaccines, the inactivated viruses, the attenuated

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,880
viruses, et cetera, and we go into what the examples are of each of these. And then finally,

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,040
David talks about what he is most excited about on this front, which is the potential for monoclonal

32
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,920
antibodies. So I hope you enjoyed this episode and it's not going to be the last one on this

33
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,720
topic, but this one's an important one if you want to understand anything that we go into deeper. So

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,160
without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with David Watkins.

35
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:13,320
David, thank you so much for making time to sit down after you just barely had a chance to settle

36
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,560
into Washington DC. My pleasure. I'm still not fully settled in and it's been a series of

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,520
disasters that have occurred in our move here to Washington, but hopefully we will get over those

38
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,400
things pretty quickly. Yeah. I didn't know about this until recently. Would you be comfortable

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,000
sharing with people the major disaster that is, I mean, if not for the fact that you were laughing,

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,440
I certainly wouldn't have a smile on my face because it's so sad. Well, our freezer truck

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:51,120
traveling from Miami to Washington DC. Maybe explain to folks that you've just left the

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,280
University of Miami. Yeah. So I've been at the University of Miami for 10 years and recently

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,760
decided to move to GW medical school. And so I needed to transport all of my samples that I've

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,080
accumulated over probably 30 years of research. And they came up in a single truck in a variety

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,320
of freezers that were plugged into the truck. And there were a couple of liquid nitrogen's

46
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,760
freezers in that truck. And in North Carolina, the truck caught fire and destroyed all of those

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,240
samples. So over a hundred thousand samples were destroyed in this truck. So we're now thinking

48
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,080
and working with the insurance company as to how to regenerate the most important samples in that

49
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,800
truck. So yes, we had a little bit of a setback. So David, you and I have met through this very

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,400
interesting project. We're trying to get off the ground working with a bunch of really smart

51
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,640
people. And we won't get too much into that project specifically. But the point for the listener is

52
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,440
some of my colleagues and I reached out to you on the basis of your expertise in terms of understanding

53
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:06,160
coronaviruses and specifically around a question that pertains to how long could we expect the

54
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,960
immunity of an infected person to last. So if a person gets infected and is fortunate enough to

55
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,600
survive, which fortunately is the majority of people, what does that say about their ability

56
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,160
to survive a subsequent infection? So a lot of paths and roads led to David Watkins. So help me

57
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,560
understand a little bit about your path. I know you were born in Uganda and I know that you studied

58
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,160
the Zika virus. I know you have a great interest clinically in HIV, but kind of connect some dots

59
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,800
there for me in terms of where the interest in immunology came from. So yes, I was born in

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,040
Uganda and then I grew up in the West Indies until I was 11. And then I think it was in the

61
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:50,880
West Indies that I developed a keen interest in nature and all things tropical really, because it

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,840
was a very happy period in my life. My mother decided I needed to have a proper education. So

63
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,680
I went to an old boy's British boarding school in South Wales, which was a pretty traumatic event

64
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,480
coming from the color and the beauty and the freedom of the West Indies to an old boy's boarding

65
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,520
school. However, I survived that, but I think that what I got from my time in the West Indies was a

66
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,560
deep appreciation of nature and especially tropical nature, the diversity. So I studied

67
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,320
biology. That was what was my great passion. And I did a degree, undergraduate degree in botany and

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,520
zoology, and then went to the United States to study immunology, really the evolution of the

69
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:52,800
immune system, and then went to Boston and worked on the HIV epidemic in the long term. But initially

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,600
in the short term, worked on the evolution of the immune response. So how did, first of all, frogs

71
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:08,000
make an immune response, and then how did monkeys make immune responses? So I was really an

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,240
evolutionary biologist. And then HIV came along, and this is the most dramatic example of evolution

73
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,320
that I certainly have ever seen, where the virus populations can change after infection

74
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,880
in two weeks, where the infecting virus can be essentially removed and a new virus appears

75
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,200
under pressure from the immune response. And then because of my roots in the West Indies,

76
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:47,440
I had the occasion to visit Brazil about 20 years ago and realized that I was back in the West Indies

77
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,840
because of the neotropical fauna were exactly the same. So I was back home. And since then, I've

78
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,680
fallen in love with Brazil and learned how to speak Portuguese, and now study many viruses that

79
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:10,240
are tropical diseases like Zika and dengue. So I guess that's how I came to develop my interest in

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,840
tropical diseases. Well, I share your love for Brazil, though clearly not your ability to speak

81
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,160
the language, nor probably the frequency, but you've been there, but it is a place I hold very

82
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,200
special. And I'm very bummed to probably not be making a trip this fall there. I was planning to

83
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,400
take my wife, potentially my daughter, to Sao Paulo. So I do look forward to getting back to

84
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,080
Brazil, though, because I agree with you. It is a very, very special place on this planet.

85
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
By the way, before we get into something, when you said the evolutionary thing,

86
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,760
I question popped into my mind that may or may not be relevant, but just out of pure curiosity,

87
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,280
when you think about our evolution as humans, people point to the development of language

88
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:55,600
as a big step function change in our development, or developmental changes in the brain, some of which,

89
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,320
of course, enable that change in language or standing upright. All of these various things

90
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,640
that represented not just linear, but sort of logarithmic changes. Again, not that they occurred

91
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,880
very quickly in real time. Over a log scale, they look to have occurred more quickly.

92
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,280
What was the biggest change in the evolution of the immune system as you studied it?

93
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:26,160
I think probably the advent of the adaptive immune response, because many, many different animals have

94
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,960
innate immune responses that are incredibly important. But the evolution of T and B cells

95
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,440
that then allowed the immune system to have greater memory to respond to pathogens,

96
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,320
and in the end, is the basis for vaccination, which, as you know, is the public health

97
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,760
measure that has saved more human lives than any other public health measure. So, yeah,

98
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,320
probably the adaptive immune response. And of course, that's what I'm interested in too,

99
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,520
so there's a little bit of bias here. When did that take place? How long ago did we acquire

100
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,120
that out of just the innate system? We certainly know that amphibians have T and B cells and make

101
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:19,520
antibody responses and T cell responses. So this occurred well before that branch of the animal

102
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,120
kingdom. That's amazing. I actually would not have guessed that. I would have guessed it was

103
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,800
more recent than that, but that's pretty impressive and it speaks to obviously the importance of it.

104
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,000
So let's build up what you just said and give people a really good primer on immunology.

105
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,040
I love this topic as well, David, and I studied immunology, but in a different lens. I studied

106
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,000
it through the cancer lens, so mostly focused on the cellular branch of the adaptive system.

107
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,760
Could you walk people through kind of a diagram that people might keep in their mind's eye,

108
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,040
which says you first would bifurcate the immune system as innate and adaptive, and then you would

109
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,160
further bifurcate the adaptive system as cellular and humoral. So maybe talk about what those two

110
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,960
branch points mean. Let's say people get infected with influenza virus, or even coronavirus. What

111
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,120
happens is that the virus enters a cell through a reset and the virus can't replicate by itself. It

112
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,120
needs to get into that cell and replicate. And then the virus starts replicating, produces copies

113
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,280
of itself, which are set out into the blood and infects other cells. That infection event triggers

114
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:39,120
the innate immune response. There are sensors inside cells that will then trigger the production

115
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,000
of interferons, which will then start to turn on immune system, including the adaptive immune

116
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,480
system. And the adaptive immune system really has two major arms, the T cells and the B cells.

117
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,360
I'm going to talk a little bit about the B cell response for the moment, because that is what has

118
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,000
really fascinated me for the last two or three years. And we're getting influenza infection

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,200
on lymph nodes under our jaws, swell up. And the question is what's going on. And what's happening

120
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:21,600
there is that pieces of the virus are being presented to the B cells. And the B cells have

121
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:30,320
receptors on their surface and they recognize this piece of the virus and they bind very weakly.

122
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,240
But that stimulates a cell to divide. Every time the cell divides, it makes an error in copying

123
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,760
this receptor on the cell surface. And some of those errors make that antibody less able to bind.

124
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:54,800
And that B cell will die, but some make it better able to bind the antigen. And this process goes

125
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,200
on and on. And so the B cells start growing and your lymph nodes start swelling. And during this

126
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,800
process, even though you're born with a set of B cell genes, by the time you're 60, you may end

127
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,040
up with a different set of B cell genes through this beautiful evolution. In fact, this after HIV

128
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,200
evolution, the face of the immune response is one of the most beautiful examples of evolution that

129
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,480
I've ever seen. So what happens is this receptor on the B cell starts mutating and then is selected

130
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:42,160
and you arrive at a antibody that now binds to the antigen with very high affinity.

131
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,640
And can you tell people the difference between an antibody and an antigen and what some of the

132
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,840
different antibodies are? Absolutely. Antigen simply means a piece of the virus. So when the

133
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,720
virus comes in to the body, it starts replicating and be picked up by a macrophage, which will

134
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,360
engulf it and then put it back out on the surface of that cell or on dendritic cells.

135
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,960
It's all very mechanical. And I think it's important that people understand this, right?

136
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,920
These things you're talking about, like these are physical proteins. This is a virus that

137
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,840
invades a cell. I think for people who don't understand immunology, it seems like a bit of

138
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,520
a black box, but the way you're explaining it, if people understand that you're talking about

139
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,440
a physical piece of the virus, a tangible piece of virus makes its way into these cells that

140
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,360
present the antigens. I mean, it becomes actually a lot less intimidating, I think,

141
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,920
to understand what you're saying. It's simply a piece of the virus. Antigen, perhaps, is a

142
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,040
piece of jargon that we shouldn't use. So just a small piece of the virus. And that's out on the

143
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,040
surface of this cell. But it's enough for us to know it's not us. That's the key point here,

144
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,600
is it's an antigen not just because it's a piece of the virus. It's an antigen

145
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,840
because our body has some capacity to realize, hey, that thing is foreign. Isn't that sort of

146
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:09,120
the key piece of this? Yes, it's a recognition of something that's not self. That is what stimulates

147
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,200
these B cells to start replicating. And then on the surface of the B cells is another protein,

148
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:24,000
which you can think of as a shape or a structure. And this interacts with the piece of the virus.

149
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,480
On the other cell, which is presenting that to the B cell. And then the B cell replicates.

150
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,640
And every time it does, it makes a mistake. And it gets either a better or a receptor that's not so

151
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:47,680
good. But those better receptors then start binding to the piece of the virus with greater affinity.

152
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:57,680
And can basically now bind very tightly to the piece of the virus. So then they circulate in the

153
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,880
body, in your blood. And in a year's time, you have another infection from the same virus. And

154
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:15,520
this time, those antibodies are there already pre-made, they bind to that virus. And they stop

155
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,560
infecting cells and you're protected. And again, that's the basis of vaccination. If I vaccinate

156
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:30,960
somebody, I give them the virus. And that gets presented to the B cells, they make these

157
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:39,360
antibodies, and they make them better every time they see a piece of the virus. And so,

158
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,560
even though you haven't been infected with the virus, you've been vaccinated. The next time you

159
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:56,560
see live virus, these antibodies will bind to the live virus and prevent it infecting cells.

160
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,200
Let's talk about a virus that doesn't really mutate much from season to season. I don't know,

161
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:08,000
pick a rotavirus or something like that. In that first round of iterative replication of the B cell,

162
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,560
where it's basically going through an evolutionary process on its own to, quote unquote,

163
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:20,320
naturally select for the best antibodies, how many times, what's the speed with which it is

164
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,800
able to replicate until it starts to converge on picking the optimal antibody? The cells are

165
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:37,440
replicating in a matter of hours. But with a new virus, maybe after a week or two, you'll see

166
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:46,320
antibodies that will be able to neutralize the virus. Now, neutralizes a bit of a technical

167
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,720
term, and I'm going to try to explain it now. You'll get many antibodies that will bind to the

168
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:02,000
virus, but they won't necessarily neutralize the virus because they won't stop it infecting cells.

169
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,480
They are bind to it, but they won't affect its ability to infect cells.

170
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,080
And so the key antibody that most of us are most interested in are these neutralizing antibodies.

171
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,280
And that is that they will bind to a part of the virus and prevent that part of the virus

172
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:30,160
getting into a cell. So let's take an example of the new coronavirus that has a spike on its surface.

173
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:39,440
Part of that spike is a region that binds to its receptor on a human cell. And if you have an

174
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:48,640
antibody that covers up that area, that will stop infection of a human cell. That's a neutralizing

175
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,000
antibody. If you have an antibody that binds to another region of the spike that's not involved

176
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,000
in binding to the receptor on the human cell, it won't necessarily prevent infection.

177
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,400
So David, let me pause you for a sec because this is such an important point that I want to make sure

178
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,400
everybody understands it. And I want to throw in an orthogonal concept, which is most people,

179
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,480
when they start hearing about antibodies, they think about these serology tests because they're

180
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,120
all over the news and they start to say, wait, antibody, I've heard of that. That's IgG, IgM,

181
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,640
or maybe they remember hearing about IgA. So I want to now have you explain a little bit,

182
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,640
what's the difference between IgG, IgM? Let's just keep those two simple. And then talk about how

183
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,400
knowing that you have those antibodies doesn't necessarily mean they're neutralizing and vice

184
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,960
versa. So how do we reconcile that nomenclature and explain, I guess, going back to the beginning,

185
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,920
what does immunoglobulin G or IgG refer to versus IgA, et cetera?

186
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,440
There are many different types of antibodies that can be used at different mucosal surfaces and can

187
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,000
be used for various different tasks in the body. So when you get infected, let's say you get

188
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,320
infected with dengue virus, the first antibody that comes up is an IgM antibody. So if you have

189
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,320
a test that says your IgM positive for dengue, that means it's a very recent infection. Those

190
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,120
IgM antibodies tail off over time, maybe two months, three months, not everybody is the same.

191
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,680
Then come up your IgG antibodies. Now these are the antibodies that will contain your neutralizing

192
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,680
antibodies eventually. Although IgM antibodies can also carry out neutralization, that is they

193
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:43,440
combine regions of the virus and prevent infection. IgA antibodies are generally found

194
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,800
at mucosal surface. So obviously are very good for mucosal infections.

195
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,240
So let's focus mostly on the IgG and the IgM. So you said the IgM is the first antibody that

196
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,920
typically shows up and then the IgG comes up as the IgM is trailing off. What determines when

197
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,600
a person makes those in that first exposure, if they are neutralizing or not neutralizing.

198
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,360
In other words, could you take two people who are exposed to the same virus who both manage to

199
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,520
successfully fight off the virus, but do so with a different proportion of neutralizing antibodies

200
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,120
and therefore maintain a memory of different neutralizing antibodies that would render one

201
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,000
more versus less successful years later? There was actually an enormous variability in the way

202
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,040
that people make neutralizing antibodies. There's a paper under consideration, Coronavirus at the

203
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,280
moment from a very, very good lab in Rockefeller. They looked at, I think it was 70 individuals and

204
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,000
they looked for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. And they found that almost 20% of

205
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,640
them did not make neutralizing antibodies. So there could be enormous differences in the way

206
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,000
that we make neutralizing antibodies. I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I understand that.

207
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,800
Does that imply you're saying 20% of individuals who were seropositive for exposure to Coronavirus,

208
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,040
so meaning on an ELISA test or some other point of care test, they showed the presence of IgG or

209
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,160
IgM in the blood. But when you did a special assay to see if those antibodies would actually

210
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,160
neutralize the virus, they did not neutralize the virus? That's exactly correct. Furthermore,

211
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,240
there was a great degradation in the ability of these individuals to make neutralizing antibodies.

212
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,080
One or two of them made neutralizing antibodies at very high titers. And what that means is that

213
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,840
you can dilute their sera and it will still neutralize the virus at a one to 5,000 dilution,

214
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,560
whereas most people, it's one to 100 dilution can still neutralize the virus. So there was an

215
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:09,040
enormous variation in the levels of neutralizing antibodies made. Now, I know the sample isn't

216
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,720
large, but did they speculate on whether that directly factored into the clinical response

217
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,800
of those patients? Not sure. Not sure. Because the next question it begs is those 20 patients

218
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,320
that did not have neutralizing antibodies, how did they thwart the virus? Or did they not? Is

219
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,680
that the point? Not necessarily. They could have had a lower inoculum of infection. They could have

220
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,280
been asymptomatic. I would have to go back to the data to make a correlation between those two

221
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:49,040
things. But I think what it says is that there's enormous variability in the B cell response to this

222
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:56,000
virus. And that means for me, at least those individuals that didn't make a good neutralizing

223
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:06,400
antibody response, can they be reinfected? And can they be reinfected? How soon after their initial

224
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,560
infection, we know that people infected with other coronaviruses, like the cold virus, for example,

225
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:25,120
can be repeatedly infected with the same virus. So one of the big issues for me at least is,

226
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:33,200
if you've been infected, can you be infected again? That ability to be infected,

227
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,080
does it correlate with neutralizing antibodies in the serum? Which is a likely thought,

228
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,520
but maybe completely wrong. Remember, you also have T cells that I haven't talked about.

229
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm saving those guys in the back for a moment. We're not stopping the B cell discussion yet.

230
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,080
I should say that I spent 15 years of my life working on T cells and only more recently

231
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,200
have been working on B cells. And I'm sure there's some B cell experts that will be listening to this

232
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,760
and laughing at me, but this is my understanding of B cell responses.

233
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,680
So another question I think digging deeper into this is, and not to put you on the spot,

234
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,160
but do you know if there has been a study done where they've taken and look at many,

235
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,000
many subjects who were vaccine naive, given them a vaccine, so human challenge vaccine,

236
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,320
for a virus that does not have huge genetic drift. So that would exclude influenza vaccine.

237
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,920
And then done what you've proposed, which is followed those people post-vaccination

238
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,720
for measurement of neutralizing antibodies. Because at least in that situation,

239
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,280
you would have a standardized inoculum, presumably. And then you could sort of try to adjust for

240
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,840
other host factors, such as age, but you could maybe say, look, you have four different cohorts

241
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,440
of neutralizing response, but they generally correlate to factors X, Y, or Z. Do you know

242
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,080
if that's been done? It may well have been done, but I'm not aware of the results. But I can tell

243
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,760
you of a study that we've done in collaboration with Asper Callis in Sao Paulo and Mirna

244
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,640
Bernaldom in Fiercrouz in Rio. We looked at the immune response to one of the most successful

245
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,760
vaccines. And that is the 17D yellow fever vaccine. So this is an attenuated vaccine

246
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,520
that was derived from somebody in Africa who had the yellow fever, was then put into monkeys,

247
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,520
and then cultured in the laboratory for many, many rounds of tissue culture. What emanated from this

248
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:43,760
was a virus that was weakened, and we call that an attenuated virus. This has many differences

249
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,360
genetically from the original virus in Africa. But if I inject this into a human, the virus will

250
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:58,080
replicate, and it will do all of those things that I talked about initially. Turn on the immune

251
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,440
response, then the adaptive, you'll have T and B cells generated, and you will have antibodies

252
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:12,160
generated against the vaccine virus. And in fact, the best way to make a vaccine is often attenuating

253
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,440
or weakening the original virus. Now, there's a few problems with the yellow fever virus vaccine,

254
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,760
and that is that there are some people whose immune responses cannot handle the attenuated virus.

255
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:34,640
And some of these people will actually, one in 300,000, will get sick from the virus. And some

256
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,680
of those people will die from the virus, especially if you're old. There is some risk

257
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,480
associated with it. And for perspective, I think measles, mumps, chicken pox would be other

258
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,880
examples of live attenuated viruses. But this one is— Something about this one, the 17D, is

259
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,640
its efficacy is great. What is the approximate efficacy? The one thing about humans is they're

260
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,880
all different. They're all different ages. And as you get older, your immune responses are not

261
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,720
as good. But the study that we did with Merna and Asper shows that all of those

262
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,800
vaccinated individuals will make beautiful neutralizing antibody responses against 17D,

263
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,040
one in 5,000. So I can dilute their serum, one in 5,000, and it'll still stop the virus from

264
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:35,920
infecting cells. Beautiful immune responses. But if we take a virus out of a dead monkey that's died

265
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:44,800
of yellow fever recently in Brazil, not the same. So one or two individuals didn't make any responses

266
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:55,680
against the wild-type primary icing, because these viruses that come right out of a monkey, for example,

267
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:05,440
are incredibly well adapted to replicating in the monkey and have not been adapted to replicate in

268
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,720
tissue culture. But was there anything special about the gentleman in Africa who was the person

269
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,680
who, from whom the yellow fever virus was first pulled, or was it just that happened to be a

270
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,600
person there? Was there some characteristic about this person that seated? No, I don't think there

271
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,920
was anything special about this individual. But the virus has so changed the vaccine virus from

272
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,400
that original virus that it engenders immune responses that may not be able to recognize

273
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:43,120
a pathogenic primary isolate. And this primary isolate is incredibly important to test any

274
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,520
vaccine against. But what we found is that there was a large range in ability of these people that

275
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,840
were vaccinated to respond to the wild-type virus. So I want to come back to a really deep discussion

276
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,880
actually on viruses and take what you've just talked about, which is these attenuated viruses

277
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,240
and put them in the context of RNA and mRNA viruses, the inactivated viruses, and also some

278
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,320
viruses for which we have not yet come up with vaccines. RSV, at least not safely, HIV and

279
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,880
hepatitis C. I want to come back and talk about that. But I think to do so, we have to go back to

280
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,440
these B cells and these pesky T cells. So I think you've done an amazing job, at least to me,

281
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,280
clarifying some of the nuances around B cells. And I just want to make sure I'm playing it back

282
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,600
correctly, which is the B cells arrive pretty soon after that innate response takes place. And if

283
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,840
anything, they're probably sped up by the cytokine storm that follows the innate response. They go

284
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:52,720
through this sort of evolutionary replicative cycle until they converge on the perfect antigen.

285
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,080
And if we're lucky, they preserve that memory. So the B cells that reside in our bone marrow

286
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,760
for years and years later will always hold on to the dear memory of what the final best antigen was.

287
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,840
And if we get reinfected, it's a neutralizing antibody if we're lucky that goes back and gets

288
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,640
it. But the risk that we don't yet understand is why do some people not make neutralizing antibodies

289
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,720
and of course, what's the implication of that clinically? Is that a fair synthesis?

290
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,840
Yeah. I mean, the only addition I would make to that is that once the antibodies, the B cells,

291
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,080
we call it affinity matured, that is, they get better and better at binding to the piece of

292
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,360
virus that they attach to. And this occurs in the lymph nodes where the architecture is very

293
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,040
important because you've got T cells that are absolutely necessary to help them develop in

294
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:49,920
those lymph nodes. But then they exit the lymph nodes about seven to 14 days later,

295
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:57,280
and then they become either memory B cells, which are very small B cells that circulate,

296
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,440
or they go into the bone marrow where they become these big plasma cells, which essentially become

297
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:11,440
the factories of antibodies. So if you have laid down in your bone marrow a plasma cell,

298
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:19,760
we call them plasma cells, they are large cells that are spewing out antibodies. And if one of

299
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,080
those cells is making considerable amounts of neutralizing antibodies, you will be protected

300
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,320
likely from an infection with that virus that you've just seen for a long, long time. Now,

301
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:42,880
that will vary from virus to virus, but that's essentially the ontogeny and evolution of the B

302
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,880
cell response. David, you've consistently referred to the delusions that you do when you're actually

303
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,280
looking for basically a way to quantify neutralizing antibodies. I'm going to take it to mean then that

304
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:04,400
when I either poke a person's finger or draw blood and look at the quantification of IgG or IgM that

305
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,680
we are typically now seeing as common tests that people are doing for coronavirus, we are not

306
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,000
distinguishing whether or not neutralizing antibodies are present. That is not an assay

307
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,800
that is capable of determining this. Is that correct? Absolutely. You're not neutralizing

308
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:26,640
antibodies at all. You're looking at the quantity of antibody that is bound to the piece of virus

309
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,480
that you're using in that assay. And that doesn't tell you if those antibodies

310
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,480
combine to the region of the spike protein on the surface of the virus that is critical

311
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,320
in binding to the receptor on the human cells for entry. And the value of those antibodies that are

312
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:56,800
not neutralizing, not clear at all. But we do know that antibodies that neutralize are really,

313
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,120
really very important. That's really the goal of any of the vaccine efforts that are underway at

314
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,560
the moment. It's to generate neutralizing antibodies. I'll admit something kind of embarrassing.

315
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,560
I did not know that until I met you and Stanley Perlman. So just to put that in perspective,

316
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:22,880
up until two months ago, I did not know that the antibodies we measured in a person's serum,

317
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,480
whether it be to coronavirus, which we're doing now, or those that I've looked at my entire

318
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,840
medical career when I check a patient's antibody levels, whether it be to see if they had varicella

319
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,840
zoster and they're at risk for shingles or whether they had Epstein-Barr or what, like you pick any

320
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,680
virus. I had no clue that every time I ordered that lab test on a patient and I was looking at

321
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:52,720
their IgGs and IgM levels, that I was not necessarily being assured of immunity because

322
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,080
I had no insight into whether those were neutralizing or not. And that must be the analogy,

323
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,800
would be, you know, making this up as I go, but like a cardiologist looking at a patient's lipid

324
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,400
numbers, but realizing that no matter what these numbers say, 20% of the time potentially,

325
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,720
this has no bearing on anything because it's not actually the lipid that matters. You're measuring

326
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,840
the lipid level in a cell as opposed to the lipid level in a lipoprotein, which is the one responsible

327
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,840
for disease. Like it's such a stark wake up call to me. I'm guessing I'm not the first person to

328
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:32,080
be shocked by this. And the fact that we still don't have clinical assays to do this, only laboratory

329
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,440
assays, suggests it's very difficult to do this, or at least not cost-effective to just routinely

330
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,640
screen patients for neutralizing antibodies. It's quite a difficult assay that requires you

331
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:51,360
incubating the patient's plasma or serum with the actual virus, then plating it out over cells,

332
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:59,920
and then watching the virus infect the cells over the next two, three, four, five, six days,

333
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:07,840
depending on the virus. So what you're looking for is a serum that will block the virus of

334
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,960
interest from infecting the cells. So it's not trivial, but we standardly do it for HIV,

335
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:23,040
physique, fadengi in a laboratory, and we'll soon be doing it for the new coronavirus.

336
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,480
So let's now pivot to that second arm of the adaptive immune system, this highly,

337
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,400
highly advanced immune system, where you actually spent the majority of your

338
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,840
career, which is talking about these T cells. First of all, how does a T cell differ from a B cell?

339
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,640
How do we define it as a different cell? They're clearly both very advanced types of immune cells.

340
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,320
Well, I lost something that I know something about. I used to think that the most important

341
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,800
cell in the body was the cytotoxic T cell. And worse than that, I used to think that the

342
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,000
heart had one function, and that is to pump T cells around it.

343
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,920
I would see the immunology meetings now with pictures of hearts and just, you know, one

344
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,320
function, pump T cells around the lungs only function, provide cellular respiration for T

345
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,440
cells, the kidneys only function, filter T cells. There's a whole T-shirt industry for you.

346
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,760
But I have to admit that I love the cytotoxic T cell. It's called the CD8 T cell. It is a cell

347
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:42,960
of immense power, probably one of the most powerful immune cells you have. We can see it's awesome

348
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,000
power in HIV. By the way, just for the record, I'm kind of partial to CD4. We'll come back to it,

349
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,360
especially CD4, CD25, but we'll get to that later.

350
00:37:53,360 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm less interested in CD4 cells as an infection. The CD8 cells are really, really action. So we made

351
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:10,320
a discovery in the early days of HIV in the animal model of HIV infection, which is a

352
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:19,120
SIV, Simeon Immune Deficiency Virus. I remember this very clearly. We infected monkeys with

353
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,440
a Simeon Immune Deficiency Virus, and then we looked at the virus two weeks later. And two

354
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,360
weeks later, we couldn't find the virus we infected those monkeys with. There was virus replicating

355
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,840
in the blood, but it was a new virus. And it had changed at one site. And I remember

356
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,160
when the student brought in the sequence of the new virus, and it had one change. And I said,

357
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,200
you've made an error. We need to get this checked by other labs because I couldn't believe it.

358
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
But what had happened is that-

359
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
How many base pairs, by the way, just to put in-

360
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
It had two or three changes. It depends.

361
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,240
This is an RNA or DNA virus?

362
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,280
This is an RNA virus. So this is HIV, which is an RNA virus. And it's notoriously

363
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:17,280
error prone when it copies itself. But what we discovered that happened is that the monkey had

364
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,160
made a massive T cell response directed against eight amino acids. And an amino acid is,

365
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,600
think of it like a string of pearls. And this was eight pearls. This T cell response had wiped out

366
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,480
the initial infected virus. So that all that was present replicating in that animal now

367
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:47,840
was a virus that had mutations in that area. So when you see dramatic effects like this,

368
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,160
you understand the power of the cytotoxic T cell. So basically these CTLs had been generated.

369
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,720
And I use CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytics, the abbreviation. They had wiped out the virus that

370
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,680
I put into these monkeys. And more recently, you've seen this in cancer. There was a paper

371
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,520
published in the New England Journal where, if I remember the paper correctly, this patient had

372
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,520
a melanoma and then she had a massive- She tried every treatment and she had a massive tumor

373
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:29,840
under her left breast, I think it was. She was treated with an antibody that turns the T cells

374
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:36,480
back on. And in a matter of weeks, she now had a hole in her chest because the T cells had just

375
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:45,280
gone and wiped out the tumor. So to me, this is the awesome power of these CD8 T cells.

376
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:54,160
And that's what I initially fell in love with, was CD8 T cells in the immune system. But after

377
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:02,240
spending 20 years trying to make a vaccine against HIV based on inducing T cell responses

378
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,440
and failed spectacularly at that, and then recently discovered the power and the beauty

379
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:17,440
of B cell responses and antibody evolution, which is the same way that the virus had evolved

380
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,840
in the face of this CD8 T cell onslaught, is the same way that a antibody evolves when it

381
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,920
affinity matures to become the perfect fit binding antibody. There's two sides of the same coin.

382
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,800
Let's explain a little bit to how that CTL works. The cancer example, of course,

383
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:46,400
is near and dear to my heart, but let's use another viral example to explain how the CTL

384
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:54,480
or the CD8 T cell is basically instructed to destroy in the same way that the B cell makes

385
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,360
neutralizing antibodies that ultimately destroy the virus. So this is a different method of

386
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,400
killing. So let's walk the listener through that. It's completely different method of killing.

387
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:13,440
So again, a virus, let's use HIV as the example. A virus will enter a cell and within 24 hours

388
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,120
will make thousands of copies of itself and will burst the infected cell. And in the case of HIV,

389
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:29,040
these are CD4 cells. The virus enters the cell 24 hours later, hundreds and thousands of copies of

390
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:37,280
this virus are now released into the blood. Now, an antibody can interact to stop the virus

391
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,600
from getting into the cell, although that's proven to be very difficult in HIV. And we

392
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:51,600
can talk about that later. But once that virus is in the cell, it cannot do anything. The antibody

393
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:58,080
cannot get inside the cell. So the game's over as far as an antibody is concerned. This is where

394
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:05,680
CD8 T cells come in. Sorry. And is that just because HIV has so much replicative power or is

395
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:13,520
it because just by some stroke of horrible, horrible luck, the cell that HIV uses to replicate

396
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,240
happens to be the general of the cellular immune system, the CD4 cell. Like what is it about that

397
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:28,640
that is so ironically bad? Well, I mean, most viruses will get into any cell that has their

398
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:37,280
receptor on the surface of it. But in the case of HIV, this receptor, the CD4 receptors on the

399
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:46,320
surface of CD4 cells, these helper cells, but in any event, an antibody, whether it's in a

400
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:53,440
epithelial cell that's been infected or a CD4 cell, once that infection event is over, an antibody

401
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:02,480
can do nothing because antibody can't get into that cell. So what we need is a cell that can

402
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,040
recognize an infected cell and kill it before it releases all the progeny virus. So I like to think

403
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:16,160
of an infected cell as a virus factory. You need to shut that virus factory down. So how do you get

404
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:26,720
another cell to recognize an infected cell? Because that cell can't go around killing cells

405
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,520
indiscriminately in your body. It has to be able to recognize an infected from an uninfected cell.

406
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:43,840
And that is what a CD8T cell does in a very elegant way. When the virus binds to the receptor and gets

407
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:54,720
into the cell, it starts to make its own proteins in that cell. Then we have these buckets called

408
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:04,240
MHC molecules, major histocompatibility complex molecules. These buckets sample what's on the

409
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,240
inside of the cell and they put it up on the surface of the cell. And in the buckets on the

410
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:20,080
cell surface are pieces of the virus in an infected cell. In a normal cell, they're normal

411
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:29,040
proteins of normal cellular machinery that goes on inside the cell. So a killer T cell will come

412
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,440
along and it will see, let's say it has 10 cells in front of it. Five of them have been infected

413
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,200
with HIV and five of them have not. So it'll move over them. It has on its surface a T cell

414
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,960
receptor that looks like an antibody. It'll move over and look at the buckets and say, okay,

415
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,880
I've got five uninfected cells here. I'm not going to kill these guys. But then it comes to

416
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,600
an HIV infected cell and it sees a piece of the virus in one of these buckets and it goes crazy.

417
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,840
It binds to that and then it blows holes in that infected cell and it closes the factory down.

418
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:16,960
So these buckets full of pieces of HIV are like flags on the surface of an infected cell that say,

419
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:24,960
kill me, because if you don't, I'm going to release a thousand or two virus particles into

420
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,720
the infected person's blood. So that is what a CD8 T cell does and it plays a critically important

421
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:42,800
role in almost any viral infection. And in fact, you need both arms of the immune system,

422
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,960
although I've waxed lyrically about the B cell response and the beauty of antibodies and their

423
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,800
ability to neutralize. Sometimes they don't neutralize every virus that comes in. You need

424
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,040
your CD8 T cells, which are such efficient killers to come in and kill those virus factories.

425
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:08,800
And so as with anything, you need multiple approaches to control an infection. And it also

426
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,120
depends on the quantity of virus that's in the system as well. But the CD8 T cells are really

427
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:25,440
exquisitely good at closing down virus factories and that's really their main job.

428
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:33,200
Now, we can't generate beautiful neutralizing antibodies or these incredibly powerful CD8 cells

429
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:41,840
without helper cells that are critically important in providing a milieu for the development

430
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:50,000
of the CD8 killer cells and for the B cells. And of course, the most dramatic example of

431
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,160
the importance of CD4 cells is HIV. When a person gets infected, what happens is we get massive

432
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,440
virus replication initially because there's no immune response. And what's happening during that

433
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,280
first two or three weeks is the innate immune response is being turned on and that's generating

434
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:16,000
the adaptive immune response about day seven to day 40 income the CD8 T cells and they destroy

435
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:24,400
everything they can. But unfortunately, they destroy the first virus they saw, but the virus

436
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:33,040
has been making errors. And so that now by the time you're two weeks out, you have so many copies

437
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:40,480
of different viruses in that infected individual and it's simple Darwinian evolution. The CD8 T

438
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,240
cells will search and destroy every infected cell that they can, but there'll be one that has a

439
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:54,320
mutation in that string of eight pearls that the CD8 T cells are seeing in that bucket on the surface

440
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,800
of the infected cell. Those CD8 T cells cannot recognize that. That cell will start spewing out

441
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,840
thousands and thousands of copies of virus and that will become the new virus in the individual.

442
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,840
And so does that mean that every patient who's infected with HIV will ultimately converge to a

443
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:22,000
mutation that at least contains that section? It would if everybody had the same buckets.

444
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:30,080
So it's different for different patients. Right. So the MHC is incredibly interesting

445
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:39,200
because it has so much diversity. So your MHC didn't a different than mine. And if you needed

446
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,840
a skin graft, you couldn't have a skin graft for me for active reasons, including the fact

447
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,040
that your T cells would recognize my skin as foreign because of the MHC molecules on the

448
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:58,160
surface and just slough it off. Yeah. I mean, the T cells are really, I mean, not just as you've

449
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,960
described it, their role in treating viruses or combating viruses, but their role in treating

450
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,480
cancer in transplantation, human transplantation, so organ rejection, their role can't be overstated.

451
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,200
The example you gave of the woman with melanoma is a very extreme one, but there's reasonable

452
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,000
evidence that most people walking around have cancerous cells in them, i.e. cells that do not

453
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,520
respond to normal cell cycle growth. And yet they will not go on to develop cancer anytime soon.

454
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,400
And that's a great testament to the CD8 cell, which is able to recognize those cancer cells

455
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,560
as non-self, which is the key determinant and to eradicate them. And of course,

456
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,600
this is exactly the reason we have to give patients who have been given a transplanted organ

457
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,400
immune suppressing drugs. It's really suppressing this arm of the immune system to prevent them

458
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,240
from doing their job, which is saying, hey, that kidney or that skin graft or whatever is not me.

459
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,080
And therefore, it needs to be eradicated. I share your enthusiasm for this day,

460
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,640
but I find this to be some of the most interesting biology in the human system.

461
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,840
And so it's kind of remarkable. It's funny, I still don't think I really understand why certain

462
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:12,480
viruses, in particular HIV and hep C, are not vaccinated against. And I think maybe naively,

463
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:20,480
I assumed that the problem with HIV was the rate of mutation and the fact that it was

464
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:26,400
primarily targeting the CD4 cell. Are those effectively the two reasons that we don't have

465
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:36,000
a vaccine against HIV? Most of our vaccines are based on immunizing an individual so that they

466
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:44,080
develop neutralizing antibodies. There are very few T cell based vaccines, although it's likely

467
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:49,520
that T cells play a very, very important role in the vaccination process, but it's those

468
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,880
neutralizing antibodies that when you first get infected, they come in and they stop infection.

469
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,120
Your T cells can come in then and clean up afterwards, but they are really the basis of

470
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:12,400
almost all licensed vaccines. So the first attempt was to make neutralizing antibodies by vaccination.

471
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:25,040
And the problem is it's very difficult to make a neutralizing antibody against HIV and SIV.

472
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,600
Just for structural reasons, meaning?

473
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:33,040
I'll explain that. That's not to say that neutralizing antibodies aren't generated. So

474
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:41,760
let's go back to this infected person or a monkey. Massive virus replication, you can have

475
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:50,160
10 to 100 million copies of virus per ML in those first two or three weeks. It's a massive

476
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,800
population size, and they're almost all of them are different. So you've got enormous variability,

477
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,520
and that's the basis for selection. So in comes your CD8 T cell response that kills everything

478
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:10,880
it can. And now what you're left with growing out are these new viruses that have CTL escape units.

479
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,760
Your antibody response then kicks in along the lines that we discuss, and patients will make a

480
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,400
neutralizing antibody response. But guess what happens? The virus escapes. So you go through

481
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:31,040
these cycles of escape generation of new antibody responses, but there are rare individuals.

482
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:39,600
Well, the point also is that there is enormous variability in HIV. Reason for the enormous

483
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:49,920
variability you've already guessed, and that is this error-prone mechanism of generating new variants

484
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:58,720
coupled with the fact that HIV, unlike most viruses, is a chronic virus. So the virus constantly

485
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:06,480
gets selected upon by the immune response. And we've done these experiments. We can infect a monkey

486
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,080
with a clone virus. So we know entire sequence. We can then get that virus

487
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:20,720
a year later and look at the variation in the virus. An outside envelope, which is the piece

488
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,400
of the virus on the surface of the virus for entry, all of the variation is selected for by

489
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:34,640
CTLs, by killer cells. On an envelope, it's all selected for by antibodies. So this virus,

490
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,000
because it's chronic, is so variable. So when you talk about HIV, you're basically talking about

491
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,560
lots of different HIVs. So here's the question for a vaccinologist. How am I going to make a vaccine

492
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,400
that I'm going to give to a hundred people in Boston, but those hundred people are all going

493
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,640
to be exposed to different viruses? If I vaccinate the yellow fever, I know pretty much what the

494
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:07,040
sequence will be. But here I've got a hugely diverse set of viruses that I'll be challenged

495
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:15,200
with. The second problem is that today, nobody has been able to generate by vaccination a neutralizing

496
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:23,600
antibody against HIV. Meaning every vaccine that has been given to patients, even if it generates

497
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:30,480
antibodies, they fail to actually neutralize the virus. Exactly. That's the big problem. I can

498
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,960
vaccinate monkeys and generate huge levels of antibodies. The bind, none of them neutralize

499
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,120
the virus that I'm going to challenge the monkeys with. That's another huge problem. The reason for

500
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,720
that is that this virus, this envelope, first of all, they have very few copies of envelope

501
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:55,280
on the surface of a HIV variant. That envelope is a protein, but it's covered in a shield of sugars.

502
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:03,600
So it's hard to get in to bind to the regions of the envelope that are important for binding the

503
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:13,280
CD4 and getting into the cell. So this virus is unlike anything I've ever seen. It is so, so

504
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:21,040
difficult to generate neutralizing antibody responses because of the biology of the virus.

505
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,560
And the biology by that, I mean both the fact that it's covered in this sugar shield. And if I

506
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:35,440
vaccinate with one envelope, humans, they're going to be challenged with a bunch of different viruses

507
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,440
that have all gone through selection and mutation and a different one from the other. And this can

508
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:48,320
be as different as 30% of their structure. It's a very, very difficult issue.

509
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:55,040
And the fortunate news here is that on a drug development standpoint, the progress has been

510
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,080
remarkable. I mean, the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid 90s

511
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:08,800
is a game changer. I mean, it is unbelievable if you just take a retrospective look for 40 years

512
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:15,600
at HIV mortality matched against exposure to or capacity to receive heart, highly active

513
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,720
antiretroviral therapy. It's, I don't want to say overnight, but it's like within a span of two

514
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,360
years, you took something that was uniformly fatal and you've rendered it a chronic disease that is

515
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:35,600
to no way diminish the struggle of it. But having friends with HIV and watching how long they can

516
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:42,880
live with T cell counts that would have in the past rendered them dead within months. It's,

517
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,720
on the bad news, I think you came up against a virus with the most superpowers of any virus.

518
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,240
The good news is it's a very chronic killer. On the medicine side, there were opportunities to

519
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,760
keep it at bay. Am I being overly optimistic there? No, no, no. And I think the bigger point

520
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,160
you raise is that as we stand here with the coronavirus epidemic three months old,

521
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:13,040
I think we should have faith that science will find a solution to this. And I'll go back 30 years

522
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,960
and I'm in a lab at Harvard at the primate center there. And I'm hearing about these people in San

523
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:27,760
Francisco with these lesions and they're dying. And I remember we don't know what's causing this

524
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,000
bacterium. Is it drugs? Is it a virus? Nobody could isolate virus from these individuals. And

525
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,600
I'm at the primate center and monkeys are dying as well. And rondarosia is at the primate center,

526
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:47,520
the New England primate center, isolated a virus that looked very similar to HIV. And that was the

527
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:53,600
birth of the animal model that we were able to test therapies on. So we discovered it was a virus.

528
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:59,520
We thought, well, okay, then we can use condoms to protect from it. Okay, that's good. That's a

529
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:06,320
behavioral measure. Then came AZT. And that was not until the late eighties that that insight...

530
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:11,200
I can't remember the exact time. Maybe a bit earlier, right? Potentially mid eighties, but okay.

531
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,360
But so now we have the first measure against the virus. We have social distancing. That's right.

532
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:24,800
So and then AZT was a repurposed drug. And I remember where you could see the virus loads

533
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,040
coming down and then they came back up, of course, because the virus escaped. Then Ray

534
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:37,600
Shannazzi at Emory discovered a couple of drugs that if you put these together or in combination

535
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:43,920
with other drugs, you now had a treatment. And this was the game changer. The rest of us are

536
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,200
working on vaccines and immune responses. And what we're learning is that it's so difficult,

537
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:56,800
this virus can escape from just about any immune response we throw in it. And then you have the

538
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:06,240
groundbreaking prep studies, pre-exposure prophylaxis, where people take a drug, Truvada in this case,

539
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:15,040
every day, and they simply don't get infected. And if everybody who's sexually active takes Truvada,

540
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
the epidemic of new infections is over. We still have a large number of people

541
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:32,240
already infected and they need to get on treatment. But in that example, science found a solution

542
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,960
to the epidemic. Although it wasn't a vaccine because of the unique nature of the virus. And

543
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:45,200
now I think it's important to understand that every virus presents its own particular set

544
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:51,040
of challenges. And HIV presented us as vaccinologists with a set of challenges, which I

545
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,520
think frankly are going to be insurmountable. And thankfully we have these drugs that are highly

546
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:05,040
effective. That's not to say that we don't need an HIV vaccine. We need an HIV vaccine. And this

547
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:13,360
virus has infected 75 million people. To give you some perspective on the new coronavirus infection

548
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:20,240
numbers, it's killed 32 million people. Again, we're not even close to that with coronavirus.

549
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:28,480
But I think the general lessons that we learned from the HIV epidemic and many of us that worked

550
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:35,440
in the HIV epidemic are now better able to deal with the coronavirus because we've learned a lot

551
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:42,080
of valuable lessons from HIV. Now, how much do you know about hepatitis C? It has a similar story

552
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:47,040
in that I remember 20 years ago or a little longer than that, maybe 22, 23 years ago. I'm in medical

553
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,000
school. I'm sitting in my immunology 101 class and they're saying, just so you understand, there

554
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
will never be a vaccine for this virus. Don't think about that anymore. And not going into that field,

555
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,720
I never did think about it anymore. But I did notice that by the way, a couple of years ago,

556
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:07,600
we got a drug that now eradicates hep C and it's a lot like the HIV story, which is we still don't

557
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:12,320
have a vaccine. I don't understand why. I'm hoping you might be able to offer an insight there. But

558
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,480
there was a pretty successful workaround because prior to that, David, it was predicted that hep C

559
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,040
was going to be accounting for something to the tune of 70% of liver transplants.

560
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:28,000
Absolutely. Hep C is a virus that replicates to enormous levels, even higher than HIV,

561
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:35,360
generates lots and lots of variants and is going to be very, very, has enormous variability,

562
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,160
even though it's a different family of viruses, but it's a virus that's going to be very, very

563
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:47,920
difficult to find a vaccine for. But luckily, the same man, Raishan Aze, PhD biochemist,

564
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:54,080
who discovered the first two drugs, he was involved in the discovery of these first drugs that

565
01:02:54,080 --> 01:03:02,320
not only treat hep C, but they cure hep C, which is the key. The virus is gone. Now, even with our

566
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:08,400
best antiretroviral drug therapies, we're still not curing the infected individuals. And of course,

567
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:15,200
that's a huge and important area of research. My view on this is, I want to be careful,

568
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,880
I don't say something that I'm going to think sounds really stupid after the fact, but I'm

569
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,160
going to go ahead and say it anyway. It's quite possible there has been no greater advancement

570
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:30,720
in medicine in the past 10 years than the drugs that cure hep C. When you think about the scale

571
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,440
of what that has done, it is enormous. And to put this in perspective, when I was in residency,

572
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,760
I did my training in surgery, so we were always exposed to sharps and things like that.

573
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:49,200
I was far, far more afraid of hepatitis C than HIV for the following reason. Hep B, so the big

574
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,880
three are hep B, hep C, and HIV. Those are the things that are bloodborne transmission. You're

575
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,920
going to be worried about them. All of them have devastating consequences. Hep C probably having

576
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:07,280
the quickest consequences if you are untreated. Hep B we could vaccinate against. HIV was a lousy

577
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,640
virus in terms of transmission. A solid needle going through a double glove is pretty low

578
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:18,640
transmission. But hep C was a very transmissible virus. If my memory serves me correctly,

579
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,120
it's at least an order of magnitude more transmissible than HIV. And no treatment,

580
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:32,000
no vaccine. So I remember being scared senseless of hep C and to think that, as you said today,

581
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,800
I think it's about a 30 to 60 day course of a medication, albeit a very expensive one.

582
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,640
And you take somebody who's got a 40 to 50% chance of dying of liver failure in a decade

583
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,720
and you cure them. I mean, this is unbelievable. Science is truly wonderful. I want to bring it

584
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,880
back to your point, which is we are still early in this coronavirus situation. And there's probably

585
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,920
a greater effort on this than there is on anything else that we've talked about,

586
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,480
at least relative to the moment in time when it was perceived to be an issue.

587
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:13,280
I completely agree. And I think we have to put it into context of other pandemics like HIV,

588
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:21,600
like the 1918 flu, for example, where 50 to 100 million people likely died from influenza.

589
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:33,200
I think we're much better able to mount a rapid response. I think that this virus will be easier

590
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:40,880
to develop a vaccine against, but I should put it in a disclaimer here. And that is that I have

591
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:48,240
been wrong about every prediction I've made about this new coronavirus since January, where I

592
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:54,800
thought that maybe this would be like a very, very bad flu. And I was completely wrong about that.

593
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:59,120
But do you think you are wrong about that, David? I mean, it's still not entirely clear to me that

594
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:04,640
this isn't just three to five times worse than a flu. How much worse do you think it is?

595
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:10,560
I don't think that a really bad flu has closed down the world economy like this.

596
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:17,680
I'm sorry. Yes, no, no. Okay. I'm speaking from a purely biologic standpoint, not from a sort of

597
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:23,680
policy standpoint, but from a biology standpoint, my reading of the data is that when you really

598
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:31,280
look at the IFR and not focus on the CFR and you age stratify, this is a disease that, depending on

599
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:37,920
your age, is maybe twice as bad as the flu, is maybe five times, maybe eight times as bad as the

600
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:44,400
flu, but it's not 25 times as bad as the flu. How do you read the literature? Again, remember the

601
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,840
caveat. When I first started looking at this and I looked at some of the crucial data, I thought,

602
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:56,240
yeah, this is going to be five to 10 times worse than seasonal flu. I think it's more likely 10

603
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,840
times worse, but I think it also depends on what sort of pre-existing conditions that you have,

604
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:07,760
diabetes, obesity. And I think there are lots of things that we don't understand that can predispose

605
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,280
you to this. I mean, what about the amount of virus that you see initially? So I think there's

606
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:19,840
a lot of things that we need to have a lot of humility about understanding in this new virus,

607
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:28,560
but I am buoyed by the fact that the evidence for escape, there is some, but it's logs less than we

608
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:37,040
see with HIV. This is not a chronic virus. So that means that it is possible to generate a

609
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:42,080
antibody response. It's been difficult in the monkey studies to understand the exact

610
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:50,560
title of the neutralizing antibody response, but the key experiments are putting these

611
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:59,920
vaccine concepts into humans and looking at their neutralizing antibody response. But

612
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:08,640
we don't know what levels of neutralizing antibody responses will be sufficient to prevent

613
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,680
infection. And I think that's a very important issue.

614
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,000
We don't know that. So we don't know what percentage. We don't know the frequency of

615
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,360
people who would develop them. And we don't know the duration that they will last.

616
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:27,520
Duration, I think, is a key issue with respect to infected people and with respect to vaccines,

617
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,520
because you've got to make a neutralizing response and then you've got to keep that

618
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:40,560
neutralizing response up to a level where it will prevent infection. But for me, the most exciting

619
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:49,920
hope that we have for treating this virus is neutralizing antibodies delivered as monoclonal

620
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:59,200
antibodies. And maybe I should explain that concept because it really is a beautiful concept.

621
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:09,760
So let's go back to the example I gave of yellow fever. If I vaccinate 100 people with this yellow

622
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:16,000
fever virus that's attenuated, let's say 90% of them will make a response against the vaccine

623
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:24,560
virus. 20% of them won't make a response against the wild type virus, the virus that's circulated.

624
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,120
So they're going to be susceptible to infection. But at the other end, you're going to have three

625
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,640
or four individuals who are going to make wonderful antibody responses against the vaccine virus and

626
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,000
the wild type virus. So those individuals, what if I could take their blood and give it to everybody

627
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,480
else? Well, there's lots of problems with that. And that was proposed very early via the lingo of

628
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,520
convalescent serum, right? Exactly. Which is we give concentrated amounts of convalescent serum

629
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,480
to people who are sick. Maybe we give diluted amounts of convalescent serum to people who are

630
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,600
not sick, but at high risk because they presumably wouldn't need as many antibodies to fight off the

631
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:07,200
initial response if exposed. Right. So I've got these three people that are super responders that

632
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,760
are making beautiful antibody responses that neutralize the virus. Well, what I'm going to

633
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:19,520
go in and do is I'm going to get their memory B cells. And I'm going to clone the genes of those

634
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:25,120
antibodies that remember have been through this beautiful process of affinity maturation

635
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:34,640
and changed and now bind very well to the piece of virus that prevents the virus from getting inside

636
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,880
the cell. So they neutralize. So I'm going to get these neutralizing antibodies and I'm going to

637
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,240
clone them. And then I'm going to test them against the virus. And then I'm going to test them in

638
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:54,720
animal models. And then I'm going to grow them up in large vats. And I'm going to go into a nursing

639
01:10:54,720 --> 01:11:00,240
home. Let's say it's a hundred people and I'm going to give them each an injection of this

640
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:08,640
monoclonal antibody. And that is going to prevent infection. How long will that last? It depends.

641
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:18,320
It depends on the dose you give. And it depends on how you genetically engineer that antibody. So

642
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:24,080
you can put mutations into that antibody where that antibody will last for three to six months

643
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:32,320
at levels that should prevent infection. To me, this is the most exciting aspect and the most

644
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:42,080
hopeful treatment for coronavirus. And it's a new type of vaccinology, if you will. And it's,

645
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:49,840
I think, the way forward for the vaccine field is to get those individuals that make the best

646
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:56,400
antibody responses, clone their best antibodies, grow them up in vats and then distribute that

647
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:03,600
to the people that need it. And this can be used for prevention and it can be used for treatment.

648
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,800
And one of the things that we're doing at the moment is in the setting of yellow fever,

649
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,640
there have been yellow fever outbreaks in Brazil. And my colleague, Esme Callas, has been managing

650
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:20,720
patients in Sao Paulo and they come in and you don't know if they're going to die or they're

651
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:26,880
going to live. And 40% of these people are dying and there's nothing we can do about it.

652
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:32,800
So the exciting idea is to inject them with an antibody that neutralizes the virus and stops it

653
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:41,360
replicating. Can we save their lives? And as you saw from what happened with Ebola last fall,

654
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,520
simple injection of a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the virus after infection

655
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:57,680
saved many, many people's lives. Drop the death rate from, I think, 50% to about 15%.

656
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,760
And that's the part I want to actually double click on here a little bit. So let's go back and review.

657
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,240
We spent a lot of time talking about vaccines and the goal of a vaccine, for the most part,

658
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:14,000
is a B-cell strategy, which is put in some form of attenuated inactivated virus or maybe just its

659
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:20,640
RNA. We'll come back to all the full means. But you do something that elicits an immune response

660
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,440
that is appropriate. If we're lucky, we not only get the appropriate immune response, but it

661
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,360
generates these specific antibodies called neutralizing antibodies. They're the ones that

662
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:36,240
matter. We go off and if we're lucky, we get beautiful big fat effector B-cells that turn

663
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:41,520
into plasma cells. They hang out in bone marrow. They are just sitting there primed and ready.

664
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,880
And if you see this infection again, it's not even going to be a blip on the radar

665
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:52,000
because the antibodies are right there right away to neutralize. You're saying, great, in parallel,

666
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,120
here's another strategy. We figure out who the Olympic champions of making neutralizing

667
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:03,440
antibodies are and using recombinant engineering, recombinant DNA technology, we basically make

668
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,240
copies of these things, effectively synthetic copies of these things and inject them into people

669
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:13,520
so that even if their B-cells are out to lunch, it doesn't matter because it's the substrate or

670
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,800
it's really the product of the B-cell that is sitting there waiting. Now, the issues with this

671
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:24,240
are as follows. One, they don't last forever. So you said get three to six months out of this.

672
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:29,680
So if we said, look, this will be something that we would use to target the most high risk people,

673
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:35,120
presumably the elderly, those with the greatest number of comorbidities and healthcare workers,

674
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,120
then I think then that there's also tiers of other people who are working in close proximity

675
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:43,760
to others, et cetera, et cetera. You would come up with a list of people who probably need to

676
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,560
receive these monoclonal antibodies on some regular frequency, say two to four times per year.

677
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:57,680
How feasible is that in the context of what it takes to basically scale and deliver vaccines?

678
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:02,640
Is it on par with that in terms of challenge? Is it more difficult? Where does it rank?

679
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:10,880
No, I mean, let's not forget that a cheap vaccine is really the best way to go with all of this.

680
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,280
And we need this for HIV. There's not a doubt in my mind that we need this for HIV.

681
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:22,400
And if we can get that for coronavirus, that'll be great. And I think one of these vaccine

682
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:28,880
approaches will result in durable neutralizing antibodies. And then you can do a prime boost

683
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:36,480
with a different vaccine to boost your immune responses. But there are certain people who don't

684
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:43,040
do so well with vaccines, and that's the elderly. They don't make such robust immune responses.

685
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:50,000
And in fact, it's this population that you might vaccinate with these new vaccines against

686
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:58,480
coronavirus, but they may not make such robust responses. So using a monoclonal antibody,

687
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:04,080
I think, or a combination of monoclonal antibodies would be the way to go in this population.

688
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,560
If we can increase the herd immunity in the younger people by vaccination, therefore reducing

689
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:17,600
the number of transmission events, then that would decrease transmission to the elderly.

690
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:24,960
But as we've learned with HIV, we need to use lots of different approaches to treat this virus.

691
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:32,320
So initially we use condoms, we have drugs, and we can use drugs to prevent infection. So the same

692
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:38,960
thing will be with coronavirus. We need drugs, we need social distancing, we need vaccines.

693
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:48,880
But the point with regard to is this feasible is the follows, is as follows. Humira is one of the

694
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:54,720
most prescribed drugs that we have today. That's a monoclonal antibody that's repeatedly given to

695
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:04,640
people. So I think that the advent of monoclonal antibodies is going to be very, very important

696
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:11,120
to treat infectious diseases. And in fact, it may be the way of the future. There's a trial going on

697
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:19,120
now using monoclonal antibodies that neutralize HIV to see if it can prevent infection in Africa.

698
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,840
And it's going to be very, very interesting. Where did they get the neutralizing antibodies

699
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,760
in the first place, given that so few people, if any, would generate them?

700
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:35,120
Absolutely right. That's an excellent question. So one of my colleagues, Dennis Burton, at Scripps,

701
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:42,720
was instrumental and a pioneer in this area. So they developed these huge cohorts. So after about

702
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:52,160
five to 10 years, a small number of individuals make antibodies that can neutralize not only their

703
01:17:52,240 --> 01:18:00,560
own virus, but they neutralize many other different viruses. And what this is, is that

704
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:08,720
they'll bind to conserved regions on the envelope. And by binding to those conserved regions on the

705
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:17,360
envelope, they'll prevent infection. So that's how these very rare antibodies were isolated.

706
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,880
And Dennis was amongst the first to clone and express these and test them in monkey

707
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:30,400
animal models. And then subsequently, many different antibodies that are what we call

708
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,720
broadly neutralizing. So it's important to understand, we have neutralizing antibodies,

709
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:39,520
and people infected with HIV will make neutralizing antibodies. But the virus that escapes,

710
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:46,480
and that neutralizing antibody will be peculiar to their own virus. But then later on, as the

711
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:52,800
virus evolves and the antibody evolves along with it, they will generate what we call broadly

712
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:58,960
neutralizing antibodies. And those are the key antibodies. Those can not only neutralize their

713
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:04,880
own virus, but everybody else's. And so that's how they isolated those. And that was a massive

714
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:12,480
breakthrough for the HIV vaccine treatment field. So David, coming back to this vaccine issue,

715
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:17,680
you've touched on one of the pillars of vaccine development, which is using the attenuated virus.

716
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,440
It's weakened. And again, the example that you used there of yellow fever being a very successful

717
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,600
one, and again, other very successful ones would be measles, mumps, and varicellas,

718
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,440
oster on the inactivated virus side. So these are viruses that can't do anything,

719
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:38,480
but you still have the entire coat of the virus that's given. Polio, hepatitis A,

720
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:45,680
and rabies would be the sort of flagship stories there. Those two categories of either

721
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:51,200
inactivated or attenuate are the lion's share of our vaccines. I mean, I know that the spike

722
01:19:51,200 --> 01:20:00,000
proteins did hep B, and I think maybe HPV, I think so. But most of the current approaches to

723
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,280
coronavirus vaccines are not looking at the inactivated or attenuated strategies, are they?

724
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,760
Or am I just misreading it? Because all of the stories that we're reading about the companies,

725
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,960
whether it be Pfizer, the Oxford example, Moderna example, which I think is getting far more

726
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,360
attention than it deserves, I mean, they're all looking at other sort of newer approaches of

727
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:25,520
taking DNA or mRNA from these viruses or spike proteins directly. So is it just that that's the

728
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,120
way technology is going and this is the first time we're seeing an all hands on deck fire drill

729
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:37,280
for a vaccine development? Or is it that there's something about inactivated versions of

730
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:43,680
coronaviruses or attenuated versions that scares us? So I'm going to give you an example. Very early

731
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:52,720
on, Ron DeRocias at Harvard Medical School, the man who isolated the first simian immunodeficiency

732
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:57,760
virus, the subsequent clones of that virus, and really is a pioneer in this field and

733
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:04,080
some tremendous work, he discovered that if you attenuate that virus,

734
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:12,400
SIV, by knocking out a piece of nev and you vaccinate, you infect animals, the virus replicates,

735
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:19,520
but it's weak. It then goes away to a very low level of replication. But if you come back with

736
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:26,560
a wild type virus 20 weeks later, those animals are protected. I mean, this is the best vaccine

737
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:34,560
that we have. And so the argument would be, well, let's go into Africa and vaccinate everybody with

738
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,400
us. Well, there's a couple of problems. It was noticed that monkeys that were given this

739
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:48,720
nev attenuated virus many years later started developing some clinical signs of SIV infection.

740
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:58,160
It had repaired itself and was now pathogenic. In fact, we did an experiment where we took

741
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:05,840
attenuated virus infected monkeys, and then we challenged them with a different virus.

742
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:13,600
And we got some level of protection. But what we saw was a few animals that had very,

743
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:20,720
very high virus loads and were not protected at all. The incoming virus had recombined with a

744
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:28,320
vaccine virus to form an entirely new virus that was highly pathogenic. A remarkable story.

745
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,600
We couldn't understand why a couple of these animals had these huge virus loads. And when

746
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:39,920
we sequenced the virus, there was a chimer between the incoming challenge virus. And then I think

747
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,200
this also bears on the issue that development of vaccines is very, very difficult. And you have to

748
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:53,120
be very, very careful before going on to thousands and millions of people with whatever vaccine

749
01:22:53,120 --> 01:23:01,040
construct you might have. And that is part of the problem in developing vaccines. But every way to

750
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:07,360
make a vaccine has been tried at the moment. The Oxford approach is to use a chimp adenovirus

751
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:16,800
to express the spike protein of the coronavirus. And it's going to be very interesting to see what

752
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:24,720
sort of neutralizing antibodies that vaccine generates in humans. Do they test that, David,

753
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,960
in sort of interrupt you, do they test for that in phase one, even though the purpose of phase one

754
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,760
in humans is safety, given what's at stake, do they at least use the phase one to confirm

755
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:42,000
that when I stick a piece of spike protein into this defective adenovirus and give it to even a

756
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
hundred humans just to make sure it doesn't cause any acute toxicity, oh, by the way, I can at least

757
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,240
find a couple of neutralizing antibodies. And if I can't, I better question whether we're going to

758
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:57,840
move ahead. I guess what I would say is I would hope that they would be doing that. But again,

759
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:05,280
it depends on what sort of titan is being induced by these antibodies, by these vaccines.

760
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,280
What's the neutralizing titan? And not necessarily just in monkeys, in humans, because in the end,

761
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:20,000
that's the only experiment that we truly care about. And then how long does that antibody titan

762
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:27,200
stay there? But in this case, remember, what we're trying to do is not necessarily provide

763
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:32,800
sterilizing immunity, which is what we really needed to do in the case of HIV. We're trying to

764
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:43,680
knock down initial virus inoculum to a level where it doesn't cause symptoms and also reduces

765
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:51,360
the amount of transmission. And so the goal for this vaccine is not the same as an HIV vaccine,

766
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:57,440
if you will, where we were trying to provide sterilizing immunity, because once HIV starts

767
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:04,400
replicating, it spawns the necessary mutations to escape from any sort of immune response. But if

768
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:11,200
we can knock down the amount of virus in people that challenged with the virus after vaccination,

769
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:17,520
and it prevents them from going to the ICU, prevents them, reduces the days that they are

770
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:26,240
infectious, that for me is a game. And so the goal of an HIV vaccine and the coronavirus vaccine

771
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:32,160
are quite different. You've also studied Zika extensively, and I know that that ties into your

772
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:38,960
love of Brazil. Is there anything that you've learned through your years of studying Zika,

773
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,240
both in its epidemiology and its immunology, that factors into how you think about coronavirus,

774
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:50,800
either optimistically or pessimistically? Zika virus had its own special set of issues,

775
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:58,320
and that is that Zika virus infecting you and me is not really going to cause much of an issue.

776
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:06,480
The problem is, is if it infects pregnant women, the legacy of Zika virus in South America is far

777
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:13,440
greater than we could have ever envisaged. There are many children walking around today

778
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:22,160
that don't look as if they're unusual, but because this virus infects brain tissue,

779
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:32,000
they will have many, many deficits, neurological deficits. So that had its own set of issues.

780
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:38,560
I think a vaccine against Zika virus again faces the same problems that you need to

781
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:47,600
induce neutralizing antibodies that can be durable. But in the end, we decided to take the

782
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,040
approach to make antibodies, and this is a collaboration that we had with Dennis Burton,

783
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,920
to make antibodies that we could inject into monkeys and prevent infection.

784
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:06,720
So if you're a pregnant woman and you wanted to have a baby when there's a Zika outbreak,

785
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:14,160
if we gave you these neutralizing antibodies, would that prevent infection? And in fact,

786
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:22,320
we were able to show in monkeys that a combination of antibodies completely gave sterilizing immunity

787
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:28,800
to those monkeys. They couldn't be infected with Zika virus. Now we did the same experiment

788
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,920
on pregnant monkeys that were already infected. So we treated them at day three with our monoclonal

789
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:42,640
antibody, and it was a very small number of monkeys, but we did not prevent transmission

790
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:50,000
to the fetus. So in that case, we failed. So again, it depends on the biology of the virus,

791
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:58,560
what you need to do to ameliorate suffering from that virus as to the approach that you might take.

792
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,800
Yeah, I think that's actually a very helpful explanation, David, because it really frames for

793
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:09,520
me and the listener why you don't need a vaccine here that is perfect. It has to be good enough.

794
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,200
It has to have neutralizing antibodies. That's non-negotiable. If you don't have that,

795
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:17,680
it's all for show, and so what? Who cares how many IgGs you have if they can't neutralize?

796
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:24,560
But what you have to do is reduce the viral load, because one, it reduces the transmission, and two,

797
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:30,880
the viral load is proportional to the damage. So more viruses, more entry through cells that bear

798
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,080
the ACE2 receptor, presumably is also more of a cytokine storm, so you get more of the immune

799
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:41,760
modulation. And let's assume either through some combination of monoclonal antibodies or effective

800
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:49,200
vaccines, you can reduce the viral load upon first contact by 70, 80%. That could have a commensurate

801
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:53,520
reduction in mortality and spread. And all of a sudden, I want to come back to something that you

802
01:28:53,600 --> 01:29:00,480
brought up earlier, which is I think it's unfair to compare SARS-CoV-2 to influenza, because

803
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:07,600
influenza, meaning the resistance to influenza, has many advantages. And that is that healthcare

804
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,640
workers are all vaccinated against it, and so are the elderly each year. Now, that doesn't mean it's

805
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:17,360
necessarily always an effective vaccine, but you know your enemy, you know where they are,

806
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,160
and you're ready for them. And I think a lot of the damage we saw out of the gate with coronavirus

807
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:27,600
was nosocomial. It was transmission within hospitals, which also probably means higher

808
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:33,520
viral loads. And so that becomes yet another advantage to a coronavirus vaccine, even if it

809
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:39,360
is not perfect, because the flu vaccine is never perfect, but it's good enough to do all those

810
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:44,800
things you said. And I like this idea of you've got a few patients that are extra high risk,

811
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:50,480
and you bolster on to the vaccine with the monoclonal antibodies, especially if this ends

812
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,360
up having a seasonal component to it, which I guess we're not going to know for a while,

813
01:29:55,360 --> 01:30:01,440
then even be more targeted in your therapy. I'm a huge fan of monoclonal antibodies. In fact,

814
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:07,680
that's what we're doing in our lab, is trying to develop monoclonal antibodies against both this

815
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:12,720
virus. And you know that there are going to be new viruses down the road. So I think that we have

816
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:18,560
to be a bit smarter now. This is not the first SARS virus we've seen in the last 20 years.

817
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:27,840
So we need to try to anticipate the next one. And I think that monoclonal antibodies, for me,

818
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:34,720
are the way forward to treat almost all infectious disease, to prevent and treat. And they're a

819
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:43,040
logical extension of a vaccine. We're simply taking from the best responders, the best antibodies,

820
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:48,080
and we're now distributing that to everybody, because everybody genetically

821
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:55,200
were not able to make those robust and highly specific and high binding neutralizing antibodies.

822
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:00,720
So there's an internal beauty to the idea as well. It's just the new vaccinology, if you will.

823
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:05,600
Well, I'm glad to hear that these approaches are going on in parallel. Again, I'm not privy to all

824
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,120
of it. I certainly see sort of the five to 10 large vaccine efforts, but again, they're generally

825
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:18,320
on the DNA or mRNA side. But hopefully there is at least some effort on the inactivated side,

826
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,040
as you point out, the attenuated is the diciest of them all, though it has probably the potential

827
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:28,080
to do the best. And I agree with you completely, David, that my greatest hope in all of this is

828
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,360
that people don't forget about it. I think it's left a big enough shock that people aren't going

829
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:36,400
to forget about it. But lots of smart people were sounding alarms on this after some of the recent

830
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:41,680
pandemics where they were near misses. This one obviously was not a near miss. In some ways it is

831
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:47,360
in terms of this could have been a lot worse, right? You pointed it out. If SARS-CoV-2 was 10

832
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:56,160
times more deadly, if it was on par with the H1N1 of 1918, I mean, it's hard to imagine what that

833
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:00,240
would do in a world that is disconnected. It's not something I give a lot of thought to because

834
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:07,600
it's so devastating. No, I completely agree with you. If this virus had the W-shaped curve of the

835
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:15,200
1918 flu, that is, it killed the young and then went down and then came up between the ages of 20

836
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:23,120
and 40, came down and then went up again with older people, this would for me have been a

837
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:33,440
horrendous, horrendous pandemic. So we're very lucky in that sense. The other message that I think

838
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:38,720
I'd like to give, when I was a young scientist, I always thought, oh, this is the approach, this

839
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:48,000
is the single approach. And as I age, I think the message is, guys, try everything that you can. We

840
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,640
need everybody's approaches. And one of them is going to work better than another, but we need a

841
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:59,920
combination of all of these approaches. So for example, I used to think, oh, yes, a T cell-based

842
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:05,440
vaccine is the way forward because a neutralizing antibody vaccine is not going to work against HIV.

843
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:12,160
Well, I was completely wrong as usual. But in this sense, let's try all the different vaccine

844
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:20,880
approaches. And in the end, the ultimate purveyor is putting them into humans and then seeing if

845
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,320
they're effective. A very famous vaccinologist once stood up at a meeting, we were talking about monkey

846
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:30,960
data. And of course, I was working in monkeys and I thought it was important. And it's not really.

847
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:37,200
And he said, look, David, human data trumps everything. And he was correct, right?

848
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:43,600
I couldn't agree more. And I think that extends beyond immunology and vaccinology into every aspect

849
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:49,040
of human health. With that, David, I want to thank you for your generosity, not just, of course,

850
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:54,000
with this interview, which has been great, but also the work that you've been doing on the project

851
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,200
that we're working on collectively with that huge team. And obviously, in the midst of such a, what

852
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:05,360
can only be described as very disappointing and upsetting loss of your life's work, as you

853
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:11,440
transferred your lab from Miami to Washington, DC, one, to maintain your sense of humor about it,

854
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:16,720
and two, to just keep sort of working on the problem. It's really a remarkable example for

855
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:21,360
someone like me who can easily get frustrated, frankly, when existential crises hit.

856
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:28,400
It's a real pleasure to talk to you. And I'm hopeful that we can embark upon this study and see

857
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:35,520
whether a person that has had a coronavirus can be reinfected. And that to me is a very,

858
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,920
very important issue. Thanks so much, David. All right. Cheers.

859
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,600
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

860
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:50,000
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

861
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,440
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

862
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,720
back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a

863
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:06,320
bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

864
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,440
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes

865
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:16,800
rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes, hearing these episodes

866
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,560
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

867
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,920
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast, typically less

868
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,240
than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions,

869
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:37,360
topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up

870
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:41,280
on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

871
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:47,280
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse.

872
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,440
And a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you

873
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:56,240
want to learn more and access these member only benefits, you can head over to PeterAttiaMD.com
