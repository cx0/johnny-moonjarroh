00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,800
today's episode. I guess this week is Dr. Gerald Schulman. Jerry's a professor of medicine and

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,760
cellular and molecular physiology at Yale. He's also the co-director of the Yale Diabetes

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,720
Research Center. In 2018, he received the Banting Medal for scientific achievement, arguably the

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,960
most prestigious award one can win in this field. He's pioneered the use of magnetic resonance

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,040
spectroscopy combined with mass spec to noninvasively examine cellular glucose and fat metabolism. Now,

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,760
you may ask, why does that matter? And we get to that right at the outset of this interview. If you

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,720
want to understand insulin resistance, if you want to understand hyperinsulinemia, type 2 diabetes,

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,560
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, you have to understand the movement of glucose and fat.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,120
A way to think about this is to think about it this way. If you go and get a blood test,

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,560
even the most fancy blood test imaginable, you're basically looking at a picture, a snapshot,

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,920
a moment in time. What these techniques that Jerry and his collaborators have developed over

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,720
many years are basically allowing you to watch videos. You can see the flux, you can see the

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,640
movement of glucose. Furthermore, they've been able to see those things as they happen inside

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,960
even human cells. So I'm going to, I guess, maybe make an apology at the outset of this and say

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,120
that this is about as technical an interview as I probably have done in a while. There are probably

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,120
only a few interviews that I've done on this podcast that get into more technical weeds than

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,200
this one. But unfortunately, that is the price one has to pay if they want to understand arguably

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,960
the most important pathologic condition in our species. And I get into what I mean by that in

27
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:45,640
the interview, so I won't elaborate on that further. We talk a lot about what it is to be

28
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,800
insulin resistant. This term gets thrown around with such ubiquity that you'd think everybody

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,040
knows what it means and yet to define it is very complicated. But I think by the end of this

30
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,280
interview, you will undoubtedly understand how to define insulin resistance. And I think you will

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,560
have a very good sense of where it begins and what it means in a subclinical versus a clinical

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,360
state and what the sequence of events are that lead to a condition in the muscle ultimately

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,240
affecting the liver, ultimately affecting the whole body. I'm not going to promise you that

34
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,880
you'll get that on the first listen. I think that might require more than one listen and it probably

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,880
requires going through the show notes, which will be littered with fantastic figures. In fact,

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,160
as Jerry and I did this interview over zoom for, I don't know, I would say maybe half to two thirds

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,120
of the interview, he was sharing slides as we were doing it. And keep in mind, I'm quite familiar

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,960
with these concepts. So for someone who's less familiar with these concepts, I think it will be

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,920
only that much more valuable. One really nice little bonus thing that came out of this is a

40
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,520
beautiful discussion at the end of metformin, where I actually learned something really profound that

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,640
was incredibly relevant to my understanding of metformin in my ongoing interest around the question

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,880
of metformin suitability as a longevity agent. I could say more about this, but I think it's just

43
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,920
one of those things where I asked you to sort of take a leap of faith with me that this is important,

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,640
even if it feels a little bit like drinking your cough syrup at times. But if you really want to

45
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,080
understand longevity, you're going to have to sort of figure out what insulin resistance means. So

46
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,840
without further delay, please enjoy my very in-depth conversation with Dr. Gerald Schulman.

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:41,400
Jerry, thank you so much for making time to sit down virtually with me today. As I said before we

48
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,080
hopped on, this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart. And frankly, all roads seem to point

49
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,640
to you. And that goes back to, I don't know, at least for me, probably 2011, when I became really

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,520
fascinated by this topic. And there aren't a lot of topics where I've personally experienced the

51
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,760
following problem, which is the more I think I understand it, the less I do. So now when someone

52
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,280
says to me, Peter, what's insulin resistance? You know, I can sort of give glib answers to that

53
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,640
question, but the reality of it is I don't think I fully understand what it is. And I don't know

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,400
that I can represent to the listener that by the end of this, they will fully understand what

55
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,720
insulin resistance is. But what I think they'll understand is how maybe we can think about it

56
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,560
through the lens of different tissues and what may or may not be going on. And in large part,

57
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,000
I think that's due to the incredible work you've done over your entire career. I guess I'd like to

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,840
kind of just start with a little bit of background. You did an MD and a PhD and you're trained as an

59
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,440
endocrinologist, correct? Yeah, that's correct. And then I did residency in medicine at Duke,

60
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,320
fellowship in endocrinology at the Mass General Harvard. And then I've always been interested in

61
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:59,880
metabolism, diabetes. I guess probably my father was a diabetologist, went to summer camp. He was

62
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,920
the doctor for type one diabetics at an early age, was exposed to problems type one diabetes in my

63
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,240
peers. I was just a camper and saw my peers getting hypoglycemic or getting into issues

64
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,760
with ketoacidosis. So I think I was exposed to metabolism at an early age. I'm sure it left an

65
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,320
impression on me. My father wanted me to become a radiologist because my physics background, but

66
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,040
I ended up staying in metabolism and doing endocrinology. I'm sure you would have done great

67
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,680
things in radiology, but I also think we're far better off for the contributions you've made in

68
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,720
this field. When did this particular question of understanding what insulin resistance meant

69
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,000
and actually starting to differentiate between some of these phenotypes of what is the fate of

70
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,280
glucose in a person with normal metabolism versus what is the fate of ingested glucose in someone

71
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,080
with type two diabetes? When did that question begin to obsess you? And specifically now that's

72
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,600
a sort of change from the patients that you grew up with with type one diabetes.

73
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,800
Studying as an undergraduate medical school, I was always interested in biochemistry, physiology.

74
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I had an experience. I was visiting a medical student at Vanderbilt in the 70s and got interested

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,520
in in vivo metabolism, doing study metabolism in awake animals, looking specifically at glucose

76
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,440
and fatty acid turnover, using tracers to actually measure how fast things are being made,

77
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,440
glucose is made, how fast fatty acids are being made in the body and metabolized.

78
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,760
In medical training, you go back to medical school, you learn how to become a good doctor,

79
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,280
take care of patients. But then in your fellowship years, you're back in the lab.

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I really wanted to get back to understand metabolism by looking inside the cell. So

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,640
everything I had done prior to then, and most people studying biochemistry, physiology would,

82
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,960
to understand, so diabetes, metabolic disease, I was interested in this question. It's an important

83
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,480
disease, leading cause of blindness, end stage renal disease, leading cause of non-traumatic

84
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,480
loss of limb. The cost to U.S. society is a huge impact and now it's becoming a global problem

85
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,720
as they adapt to Westernized diets and things. And I wanted to look inside the cell, metabolism

86
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,960
inside the cell. And so that took me into the world of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

87
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,320
It actually brought me down to New Haven, where they were just setting up methods, this technique,

88
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,240
to actually look inside living yeast cells. I said, gosh, this, we can adapt this to humans and look

89
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,560
inside metabolism in humans, in liver and muscle and other organs. To specifically get at your

90
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,960
question, I think it's such an important metabolic disease, the most common metabolic disease. And so

91
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,000
someone's who's interested in metabolism, it's a natural segue. I sometimes describe it to patients

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,240
as the foundation upon which the major three chronic diseases sit. So you described some ways

93
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,520
in which patients with type 2 diabetes die, specifically through amputations or complications

94
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,240
of amputations, such as infections and obviously through end stage renal disease. But I would

95
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,880
argue that the majority of the mortality through diabetes comes not so much through diabetes, but

96
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,040
through its amplification of atherosclerotic disease, cancer and dementia, all of which are

97
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,800
force multiplied in spades by type 2 diabetes. So the way I explain it to people, and I hope that

98
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,680
by the end of this, you'll help me refine this because it may not be accurate. But I describe

99
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,280
to patients that there is a continuum from hyperinsulinemia to impaired glucose disposal,

100
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:33,160
to naphyl D and NASH to type 2 diabetes. And that continuum makes up a plane upon which all

101
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,120
chronic disease get worse. If we're going to be serious about the business of delaying the onset

102
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,600
of death, we have to be serious about the business of delaying the onset of chronic disease. And if

103
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,240
we want to do that, we must fix our metabolisms. That's my thesis. Total agreement. You're spot

104
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,600
on. So insulin resistance is the main factor which leads to type 2 diabetes, but it also,

105
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,320
and again, this is give credit to Jerry Reven, who in his 1988 Banting lecture first got everyone's

106
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:10,200
interest in basically saying insulin resistance is not only leading to diabetes, but as you say,

107
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,920
atherosclerosis, basically hyperlipidemia associated with inflammation, higher acid,

108
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,760
polycystic ovarian disease. Now we can kind of add to that. Now we can talk about naphyl,

109
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,200
or I prefer the term metabolic associated fatty liver disease, MATHL-D. That's going to be the

110
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,680
most common cause of liver disease, liver inflammation, end stage liver disease, and

111
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,320
liver cancer. And finally, another arm for Jerry's circle of insulin resistance and all these arms

112
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,680
budding off of them, heart disease, as we talked about high uric acid, high triglycerides, and high

113
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,040
cholesterol is cancer. So we're now, as you know, seeing huge increases in many forms of cancers,

114
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,240
which are associated with obesity, breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer.

115
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,640
And by the bed, it's insulin resistance that's driving the increase in all of these cancers.

116
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,960
Now it's not causing them necessarily, but it's promoting the growth. And again, we have very

117
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,720
strong preclinical evidence for this in animals. You can take animals, Rachel Perry, who was in my

118
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,520
group and now starting her own lab, has taken breast cancer models, human breast cancer models,

119
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,840
colon cancer, put them into mice and just giving them insulin, putting in insulin pumps, and that

120
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,040
the rate of tumor growth is accelerated and you treat them with an insulin sensitizing agents and

121
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,600
you can slow down tumor growth. So I think you're spot on, Peter. Insulin resistance is driving a lot

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,720
of disease. And you're also spot on in that that's what's killing our patients with type 2 diabetes.

123
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,040
It is heart disease. These other things are the chronic complications of hyperglycemia, the

124
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,160
blindness, the end stage renal disease and the small vessel disease leading to non-traumatic

125
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,000
loss of limb. Also hyperglycemia, but insulin resistance, which is very common. It's probably

126
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
one quarter of our population and one half of our population has it perfectly asymptomatic.

127
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,720
You don't know you have it. We can test for it using sophisticated tools that we can talk about,

128
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,280
but it's a very common phenomenon. So before we launch into what I think is an important

129
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,600
discussion around the fate of glucose under normal conditions, which is the backdrop against which I

130
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,880
think everything we are going to talk about has to be laid out. I'd like you to spend a moment doing

131
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,160
something you're probably not asked to do often, which is at least explain to some extent what the

132
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,600
NMR technique allows you to do because so much of what we're going to talk about today requires

133
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,000
either a leap of faith that you know what you're talking about or at least some sense of how a

134
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,440
scientist is able to actually look at substrates and substrate utilization and substrate movement

135
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,240
in the ways that we have to be able to talk about them at a molecular and cellular level to make

136
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,000
sense. So I know it's a bit complicated, but because it is such a cornerstone of your work,

137
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,280
can you explain what labeling means and how you can measure those labeled molecules in vivo?

138
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:19,480
In metabolism, the traditional methods, since going back to dates maybe 50 years ago, when you wanted

139
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,240
to measure more than just concentration of a metabolite, you go to your doc, you measure blood

140
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,840
sugar, cholesterol, and it's a static concentration. And what we know is what's much more important

141
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:37,640
than just measuring concentration is flux. And that's basically production versus uptake by a

142
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,320
tissue and know where something's being made, where it's going. And the traditional approach has been

143
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,320
to put a label on that, whatever you're interested in tracing, the glucose. And so you're used to

144
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,560
basically with the advent of cyclotrons. It really started in California, in Berkeley, they started,

145
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,840
you know, had cyclotrons, they're interested in nuclear theory. The side product is you can make

146
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,240
isotopes. So you can make carbon radio labeled, so it's an emitter, and put that carbon onto a glucose

147
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,040
molecule and then trace it. So for more than 50 years, we've been able to buy radio labeled isotopes

148
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,680
and put a carbon C14, which is radioactive, low dose radiation or tritium, which is a form of

149
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,240
hydrogen, and then give it to a person, an animal, and do blood sampling and actually measure then

150
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,760
turnover of that metabolite. So that's telling us very important information. Many, many important

151
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,840
studies have used this and to dates, we still use this to track production and clearance of whatever

152
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,840
we're labeling. What you can't get from that though, is really what's happening inside the cell,

153
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,080
which is really where I wanted to go. So we've been measuring turnover of metabolites. Again,

154
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,040
that's what I did many years ago, where I first started my interest in metabolism. To do that,

155
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,760
you need to get inside and look at the cell. So the approaches have been traditionally something

156
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,280
called positron emission tomography, which is now used clinically sometimes to track tumor growth,

157
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,960
because tumors take up glucose and you can give a pet emitter of glucose and then see if the tumor

158
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,240
is taking it up. That's radioactive. And again, I'm a clinical physiologist. I prefer not to give

159
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,720
radio labeled substrates, radioactive substrates to volunteers who volunteer for my study. The other

160
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,200
approach was nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There were two groups that were pioneering this

161
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,480
kind of work. There was one group in George Rada at Oxford, and this was phosphor centimar. And so

162
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:41,320
what George was doing, so NMR takes advantage of the fact that the nuclei of certain atoms have

163
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,520
spin properties. And I won't get into all the physics behind this, but they make them behave

164
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,880
like tiny bar magnets. And so when you put them in a strong magnetic field, they tend to line up or

165
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,240
against this magnetic field. And because they have spin properties, they will actually precess in this

166
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,560
magnetic field at a set frequency. If you pulse them at the frequency that they're precessing,

167
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,440
they tip out of this field. And then when they relax, they emit energy that you can pick up with

168
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:15,160
a little rate with an antenna and basically get chemical information about where that label is

169
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,480
within the molecule. So everything I just said, all you need to understand is you can use this

170
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,960
method to basically measure the amount of the metabolite, more importantly, which, for example,

171
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,720
carbon atom within that glucose molecule is labeled. It has something called chemical shift,

172
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,400
experiences a slightly different magnetic field depending where it is within that glucose molecule.

173
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,400
So for the listeners, all you need to understand is using this method, we're able to get

174
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,400
biochemical information of not only measuring a metabolite, but then using the power of

175
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,880
for example, C13 NMR track the label as it's being metabolized inside the cell. So that's

176
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:05,560
carbon NMR. So in our bodies, 99% of the carbon in our body is C12, which is NMR invisible, but 1%

177
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,480
is C13, which is NMR visible, has this precession properties. You can use a labeled, for example,

178
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,600
C1 labeled glucose and then track that C1 glucose as it gets into the say muscle cell or liver cell

179
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,760
and gets metabolized and finds its way into glycogen. And then you can measure flux. You can

180
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:33,960
actually, for the first time in humans non-invasively without any ionizing radiation, measure how much

181
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,960
is going in through measure intracellular pathway flux. Phosphorus NMR as getting back to George

182
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,600
Roddet, George pioneered Phosphorus NMR. There you don't have to give any isotopes. There

183
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,120
you actually see P31, Phosphorus 31 is 100% natural abundant. You see all the phosphorus

184
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,480
that's in solution in our bodies. So for example, when our volunteers go into side of the magnet

185
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,120
and we put a leg or arm into the magnet, we can see all the high energy phosphates in, for example,

186
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,680
ATP and the same triphosphate. There are three phosphates and you can actually see each one of

187
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,040
those phosphates. You can see phosphocreatin has a different chemical shift. You can see inorganic

188
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,720
phosphate and we developed methods. Doug Rothman and others at Yale who I worked with were able to

189
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,280
develop methods measure glucose six phosphate. So we can actually look at one a key intermediate

190
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,240
getting glucose from outside inside. Another method we developed was we can measure intracellular

191
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,480
glucose inside human muscle non-invasively. So by measuring these metabolites, measuring flux,

192
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,160
we can actually then ask the very simple questions, which this is how we started out

193
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,000
in humans. As you say, you know, again, diabetes is an abnormality of metabolism. Glucose is the

194
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,600
metabolite. And we were able to basically ask very simple questions when a person, a human,

195
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,640
which is my favorite model because it's the one most relevant to understanding diabetes and

196
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,840
metabolic disease. When we ingest carbohydrate, how much of that carbohydrate ends up in glycogen

197
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,720
versus oxidation into carbon dioxide or gets converted to lactate through glycolysis. And so

198
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,480
and then more importantly in the patient with or the volunteer with diabetes, how important is that

199
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,840
pathway glucose to glycogen accounting for their insulin resistance? This story is very short.

200
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,880
Before you go there, let's demonstrate clinically a difference between these two people. So let's

201
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:39,240
take the normal patient without type 2 diabetes, and then let's contrast them with a very similar

202
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,200
person of similar size who has type 2 diabetes. We will feed them both a high carbohydrate meal

203
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,320
in the evening. Let's just assume that that meal contains 100 to 200 grams of carbohydrate. They

204
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,600
will digest their food. We won't really have much insight into what's happening overnight, you will

205
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,240
tell us. But at the next morning, we do a fasting blood glucose level on them. This is now 12 hours

206
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,120
after their meal. The patient who does not have type 2 diabetes might arrive with a blood sugar of

207
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,840
100 milligrams per deciliter, which we will say is normal. His counterpart with type 2 diabetes

208
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,240
may actually at that time have a blood sugar of 200 milligrams per deciliter, which is obviously

209
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,320
abnormal and consistent with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Now of course, that only represents

210
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,480
about an extra 5 grams of glucose in the circulation that is the difference between the 100 and the 200

211
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,280
milligrams per deciliter, which is a small fraction of the, call it 1 to 200 milligrams,

212
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,160
pardon me, grams rather, 5 gram difference. So it's a small fraction of what was ingested the

213
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,200
night before. What is the difference between those two people? Why does one of them have such a hard

214
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:03,400
time with that extra 5 grams of glucose? What was the fate of glucose in the healthy person to begin

215
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,840
with? How did the body treat it? The body when you take in, and again this is what we were able to

216
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,440
demonstrate by actually measuring glycogen flux in liver and muscle, that ingested in a healthy

217
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,640
individual ends up as mostly liver and muscle glycogen. It takes up muscle and depends on the

218
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,880
size of the meal and how it's being administered, the proportionality between liver and muscle. But

219
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:36,360
the bottom line, it's 80-90% is stored as glycogen. In the diabetic contrast is there's two processes

220
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:45,640
that have gone awry. One is that the liver is geared up to make more glucose than it should be

221
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,920
through a process called gluconeogenesis, the conversion of non-glucose precursors like

222
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:58,200
amino acids, alanine, lactate to glucose. And that process is accelerated, so the liver is making

223
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,240
twice the amount of glucose as it should. And then you have a block in the periphery where the glucose

224
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,680
same amount of insulin is not causing the glucose to be taken up by the muscle. Again, in terms of

225
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,600
flux, what I care most about, production is up and clearance or disappearance is down. And besides

226
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,880
this, also even in some diabetics, insulin is inappropriately low because we know if we give

227
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,680
more insulin, we can overcome these abnormalities. And so the beta cell has also become abnormal in

228
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,160
the established diabetic where it's not making enough insulin. That can be secondary to these

229
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,360
other issues, glucose toxicity and other factors that have caused this beta cell impairment. Because

230
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,720
we know most importantly when we reverse the insulin resistance, this is a very important study,

231
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,920
is we've taken these type 2 diabetics and short-term hypocaloric feeding, 1200 calories a day.

232
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,800
We basically can reverse all these abnormalities through reduction in the topic lipid, which we

233
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,200
can get into molecular mechanisms and reverse their diabetes. And this has now been shown

234
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,080
by many, many other investigators. And most recently, Roy Taylor, my colleague who trained

235
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,160
with us, is now doing this in the primary care clinic back in the UK. But usually you've asked

236
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:17,320
the question, usually when we talk about diabetes, actually it may be easier to understand when you

237
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,440
start in the young lean 20-year-old who already has insulin resistance. These are the young lean

238
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,920
college students that we study. It's actually easier, I think, for your listeners to understand

239
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,880
if we start with just pure insulin resistance, which we see is the most common thing, as I said,

240
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,600
probably half the people in the US actually have insulin resistance don't know it because they're

241
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,160
asymptomatic. And we even see this in young lean 20-year-olds, Yale undergraduates who volunteer for

242
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,600
our studies, profound insulin resistance in muscle, no problems in liver, and then take you through

243
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:57,080
the progression from how you just go from insulin resistance in muscle to fatty liver and insulin

244
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,200
resistance in the liver and then progress to type 2 diabetes. That's something we can actually go

245
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,200
through that would be of interest. It would because it actually kind of fits with the way I was going

246
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,560
to try to temporally split this, which would look as follows. When we take a patient who has normal

247
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,760
fasting glucose and normal fasting insulin, and we challenge them with an oral glycemic load,

248
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,640
and then measure insulin and glucose in 30-minute intervals, a lot of times we expose a problem

249
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,360
that seems most easily explained by the muscles inability to assimilate glycogen.

250
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,040
So a person shows up and they have a normal fasting insulin, say it's 5, and their fasting

251
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:50,120
glucose is, say, 90. You challenge them with 75 to 100 grams of glucose, but say 30 or 60 minutes

252
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:57,800
later their fasting glucose is 200, their insulin is 70. We call that insulin resistance, and we

253
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:05,240
impute from that that something has broken down in the pathway that prevents their muscle from taking

254
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,360
in glucose. Now you've done very elegant work to examine all of the possible places that failure

255
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,480
could have taken place. Did it take place at the Glute 4 transporter or one of the mechanisms which

256
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,680
we should discuss how the Glute 4 transporter gets across the cell membrane? Is it a problem

257
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:29,480
not of bringing glucose in, but really is the problem downstream at hexokinase or glycogen

258
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,480
synthase, things like that. So is that sort of what you're saying, which is can we start with

259
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,000
postprandial hyperglycemia? Yeah, I think we're not even hyperglycemia. This before any abnormal,

260
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,200
just insulin resistance. What I like about the question you asked and how you pointed out,

261
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,440
insulin resistance is the root cause for not only diabetes, but it's going to be the root cause for

262
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:57,800
all these other abnormalities, fatty liver disease, make us prone, makes a lot of cancers worse,

263
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,080
heart disease. And again, that's the number one killer in this country. It's insulin resistance

264
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,640
that's driving all these things. And not even talking about, even though I'm a diabetologist,

265
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,320
I of course care, I want to fix diabetes, but even before blood sugar goes up, which is how we define

266
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,520
diabetes. Let's understand insulin resistance cause if we can understand insulin resistance,

267
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,320
then that's going to be the best way to fix diabetes, type two diabetes, heart disease,

268
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,040
they're going to make a big impact there, fatty liver disease and slow down cancers.

269
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:33,000
So let's start with insulin resistance. Okay. What is insulin resistance? So we define it by

270
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,760
giving insulin and we know insulin normally does some effects, makes glucose being taken up by

271
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:45,160
liver and muscle. And when that same amount of insulin is not doing these things, we say

272
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,680
there's insulin resistance. So you need more insulin than to cause muscle to take up glucose or the

273
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,920
liver to turn off glucose production or take up glucose. And the same thing again, in the fat cell,

274
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,480
what insulin does in the fat cell is that puts the break on breakdown of fat and it's called

275
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:08,200
that lipolysis or take up glucose to esterify fatty acids into glucose. So these are the three

276
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,680
key insulin responsive organs. And when insulin is not doing that properly, we call that insulin

277
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,920
resistance. And again, keep emphasizing, I think for your listeners, this is probably every other

278
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,600
person in this country or in Western Europe are insulin resistant. Your doctor won't even know

279
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,480
this unless they do careful, maybe studies to assess insulin resistance. Cause you won't pick

280
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,520
this up as the simple plasma glucose test. So what causes resistance? Let's start with muscle.

281
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:45,080
And the reason I like to start with muscle is when we study our young volunteers, again,

282
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,480
I like them because they're perfectly healthy. They're 20 years of age, 19 to 20. They're lean

283
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,720
because we know everyone who's overweight or obese probably has insulin resistance.

284
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:03,160
There's so many confounding factors that happen in overweight obesity. These are lean 22, 23 BMI,

285
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,560
lean, non-smoking. So we screen out smoking, no medications, no drugs and sedentary. Because we

286
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,320
know people who exercise, we can reverse insulin resistance and we can talk about how that happens.

287
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,360
So you give these young 20 year olds, let's say you screen, we screen to this date, probably a

288
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,960
thousand, but you get a distribution, given a drink of glucose tolerance, 75 grams. You measure

289
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,040
insulin and you can calculate insulin sensitivity index. It's a crude index and it's kind of a bell

290
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:39,320
shaped curve. And you have people in the bottom quartile who are insulin resistant by definition,

291
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,920
the top quartile. Then you ask, why are those people in the bottom quartile insulin resistant?

292
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,840
And you measure glycogen synthesis using the methods we talked about briefly, carbon NMR,

293
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:58,120
give C1 glucose, measure flux into glycogen. And it's already down by 50% compared to the

294
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,520
sensitive ones under matched insulin and glucose concentrations. So they're resistant because they

295
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,480
can't get glucose and glycogen. That's the major pathway. It's not glucose to lactate, not glucose

296
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,560
oxidation. So that's your pathway. Then you want to know where the block in that pathway is. With

297
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,640
phosphorus NMR, we can measure glucose six phosphate inside the cell with a carbon NMR method. We can

298
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,000
measure glucose inside the muscle cell. The reason this is important is we can see where the

299
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,600
biochemical block is. So your listeners all just probably get into a car and they're on the road.

300
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,040
And if there's construction going on, we all know construction piles up after that, whatever that

301
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,320
roadblock is, where the construction is happening. Biochemistry is the same thing. You have a roadblock

302
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,680
and traffic builds up behind it. So we measure G6P to argue, you mentioned about three steps,

303
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,640
synthase, hexokinase and transport, glucose transport. They had all been implicated

304
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,240
to be the roadblock, the step response for the insulin resistance. And so we were able to sort

305
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,480
out which was rate controlling by measuring these intermediates. So if the block is at synthase,

306
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,760
glucose six phosphate should build up and glucose should build up. If the block is at hexokinase,

307
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,680
you should basically have lower G6P and a buildup of glucose. And if the block is at transport,

308
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,720
there should be reductions in both glucose six phosphate and glucose. To a series of studies,

309
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,560
we found in not only these young lean insulin resistant offspring, but obese insulin resistant

310
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:37,720
individuals as well as individuals with poorly controlled diabetes, G6P, glucose six phosphate

311
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,680
and glucose are both reduced in the muscle cell, in vivo, in humans, implicating transport. That's

312
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:51,400
where your biochemical block is. So the block is at transport. That's your target to fix if you

313
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,160
want to fix muscle insulin resistance. And the corollary is these other steps are not good

314
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,000
targets, drug targets to go after to fix insulin resistance in muscle. This is the first abnormality

315
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,080
we found in its transport and in these young healthy 20 year olds. And then the question is,

316
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,160
what's wrong with the transport mechanism that led us into the world of lipids? Again, it's been

317
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,200
known for decades that obesity associated with insulin resistance, that's why virtually every

318
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,000
obese adult or child have insulin resistance. There are rare exceptions. And then we basically

319
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,600
found we developed a method to measure fat inside the muscle cell. And that was the best predictor

320
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:39,000
for insulin resistance in muscle and this block and translocation. Let's give people a quick primer

321
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,920
on normal glucose disposal into a cell. So when the insulin molecule hits the insulin receptor

322
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:57,080
on the surface, I believe it auto phosphorylates itself, correct? That then signals to insulin

323
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,400
receptor substrate one IRS one inside the cell. So that sends a signal inside the cell, which also

324
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:10,680
leads to a phosphorylation, which then signals PI three kinase that upregulates PI three kinase.

325
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:16,440
And that basically leads to a glute four transporter, which you can think of as like a big

326
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:23,400
tube being shoved up to the surface of the cell across its membrane. And that basically

327
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,680
passively allows glucose in it is not an active transporter, correct? That's correct. Everything

328
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,960
you said is spot on. Basically up until now, we don't know where the breakdown is in that

329
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,200
whole process. All we know is that something is impaired in getting glucose in the cell. But

330
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,400
in terms of is it there's not enough insulin that hits insulin receptor? Is there something wrong

331
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,720
with IRS one with PI three K? Is there something blocking the transporter? We're going to have to

332
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,040
figure that out still. But you've already taken two thirds of this puzzle off the plate by saying

333
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:02,040
we know it's not downstream of that. That's correct. If you fix the transporter, that's where

334
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:09,320
the roadblock is. And that's the target. The next set of questions becomes why isn't insulin causing?

335
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,440
And as you point out, this translocation of the glute four transporter to the membrane to allow

336
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,800
glucose to come into the cell through facilitated transport down a gradient. So that's what we can

337
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,080
talk about next if you want to. That's perfect. Can I share my screen with you at this point?

338
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,160
You can. And what we will do, Jerry, is we are going to take everything that you are sharing with

339
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:39,320
me and we're going to turn these into show notes that will be time stamped to this part of the

340
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,880
discussion because while I guess people like you and I do tend to picture these things in our head

341
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,640
easily, I think for many people it is going to be incredibly helpful to be able to actually look at

342
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,480
some biochemical drawings. I benefit from this greatly. It's still not purely second nature to me.

343
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,120
I like to think in pictures too. So as much as we can help the audience out with graphics,

344
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,240
I think it will be beneficial. So here's a cartoon. I'll walk you through this and stop me.

345
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,600
If you have questions, this is a cartoon of a muscle cell. We went through how insulin normally

346
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,320
works. Insulin binds to the receptor and everything, as you said, we're going to actually show this in

347
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,200
this cartoon. It binds to the receptor. The receptor autophosphorylates, becomes a kinase.

348
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:28,280
The key substrate for this kinase, since receptor kinase in muscles, insulin receptor substrate one,

349
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,360
which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, allows it to bind and activate this other protein,

350
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:41,480
PI3 kinase, which Lou Cantley discovered. And that's a required step for translocation. So that's

351
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,120
all been worked out. And somehow this is not working. This is broken in the insulin resistant

352
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,440
individual. And again, these young 20 year olds, the patient with diabetes, the obese insulin

353
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,880
resistant individual. And the question is, what's wrong? So I'm going to share with you, at least my

354
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:04,600
view, which would explain insulin resistance in most situations of lipid induced insulin resistance,

355
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,760
which I think accounts for, I would say, the majority of these patients I see who have type

356
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,000
two diabetes or who obese insulin resistance, or even these young lean insulin resistant offspring.

357
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,640
And so this is the picture. So here, and it relates to fatty fat metabolism. Before I told you,

358
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,720
the other MR method that we developed is actually something called proton NMR. And this is actually,

359
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,800
most of your listeners are very familiar with you. Everyone knows about MRI, magnetic resonance

360
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,240
imaging. This is people go into a scanner and they get very pretty pictures of an organ brain

361
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,480
or some other organ for diagnostic reasons. And it's the same biophysical principles. You're

362
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:53,560
basically getting this NMR signal from protons and protons are the most abundant NMR visible

363
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,840
nucleus in the body. And it's mostly water we're looking at. So when you're basically getting the

364
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:05,240
same signal from protons and mostly protons are water and fat. And so an imager gives you this

365
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,040
three-dimensional reconstruction of proton density in water and fat. And that's what gives you the

366
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,680
images. And again, we're doing biochemistry. So we're getting, taking that same kind of information,

367
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:21,800
but actually looking at individual carbon atoms or phosphorus atoms, or in this case, protons lining

368
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:28,040
the carbons and triglyceride. It's fat. So what I said, using proton NMR to measure fat inside the

369
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,040
cell, this is different from fat outside the cell. So if you look at a steak and you see the marbling

370
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,160
of fat in a steak, that's fat outside the muscle cell, which you don't see if you look at a steak

371
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:46,120
is the fat inside the muscle cell. And using NMR, we can actually discern fat outside the cell

372
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,640
versus fat inside the cell. And we can do this in many organs and muscle started to muscle.

373
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,240
And using this approach, we found fat inside the muscle was the best predictor for this block and

374
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,920
transport in all of our volunteers, young people, old people, children, sedentary individuals,

375
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,440
sedentary individuals, fat inside the cells, the best predictor for insulin resistance. And so this

376
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:15,080
led us into the world of lipids. We're keen to understand then if finding the lipid intermediate

377
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:21,560
that might do this. And in studies where we took healthy individuals, perfectly normal

378
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:28,760
sensitivity, we gave them an inter lipid infusion, just raised plasma, fatty acids for three to four

379
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,680
hours and found that after three to four hours, we can make them as insulin resistant as anyone

380
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,880
with type two diabetes. And others had shown that in addition to us. I mean, this is, we weren't the

381
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,760
first to show this, but what we were the first to show is it's due to this block in glycogen

382
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,400
synthesis. And it's the same block, it's that block and transport. Just to be clear, when you deliver

383
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,680
intra lipid, that's intravenous lipid as a triacylglycerol or diacylglycerol? No, this is a

384
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,760
triglyceride. This is an emulsion, a triglyceride emulsion. It's often given to patients for

385
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,760
hyper elementation when they can't eat, you give us energy rich infusion. Just like TPN or something

386
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,400
like that. It's used in TPN often. But what we also do is just a little low dose of heparin to

387
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,800
activate lipoprotein lipase. So all of a sudden, then you can artificially raise fatty acids

388
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,400
twofold, something up to about one and a half millimolar and ask the question, what does this

389
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,200
do? What does this have to do with visit ultra metabolism? And it has profound effects.

390
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,240
So by increasing LPL expression, not expression activity, I did not know that heparin activated

391
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,960
LPL. So by activating LPL with heparin, cool trick to know, I'll keep that in mind,

392
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,760
you're going to get more of that lipid into the muscle cell. You will raise fatty. So what the

393
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:59,320
heparin does is it causes activation of lipoprotein lipase. And that will then break down the

394
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,120
triglycerides to raise fatty acids and more delivery of fatty acids to all cells in the body.

395
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:12,440
Okay. So this becomes basically a quick vehicle by which you can deliver lipid directly into the

396
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,600
muscle cell. Exactly. Where you can acutely change that. And again, you can't do this just by getting

397
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,520
fatty acids. Fatty acid turnover is so fast, you can't just infuse fatty acids to significantly

398
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,640
raise. So this is a way we're able to raise fatty acids specifically in vivo, in humans.

399
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,400
And we do this in animals and it's that, so it's a nice pharmacological way of asking the question,

400
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,440
what impact is just simply raising fatty acids for a few hours have on metabolism. And it's

401
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,040
profound. It takes three to four hours before you see this. And then boom, it's you get very

402
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,400
profound insulin resistance. And in our early studies, again, we showed using the same methods

403
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,800
I told you about measuring glucose, six phosphate, measuring intracellular glucose, measuring

404
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,520
glycogen synthesis. We found simply raising fatty acids for three to four hours, blocks glycogen

405
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,120
synthesis, profound insulin resistance, as they say, as anyone with obesity or type two diabetes.

406
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,000
And it's due to the same and acquired block and transport insulin activation, transport,

407
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,800
both G6P and glucose are down. So that to us was a very important lesson because it basically

408
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,720
changed the paradigm because prior to this people, workers, biochemists, you may know the name

409
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Philip Randall, who did some pioneering studies in the sixties at University of Bristol and was

410
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,640
really the first to say, hey, fatty acids may be toxic, may be causing insulin resistance and did

411
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,600
studies in rat tissue, you know, cells, heart tissue, diaphragm muscles taken from rats in vitro,

412
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,880
incubated it with fatty acids and in vitro in the test tube, induced insulin resistance.

413
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:57,800
The mechanism that they postulated was that it was altering basically oxidation, the TCA cycle

414
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,000
citrate levels would build up and lead to inhibition of phosphofructokinase, which is

415
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,200
a key glycolytic enzyme. The prediction that Randall made was glucose six phosphate should increase,

416
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,280
leading to inhibition of hexokinase. We were interested in that because we said, oh, fat in

417
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,720
our hands is important. We're raising fatty acids and causing resistance. And we see this

418
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,360
really strong relationship between fat in the muscle cell and insulin resistance in all of our

419
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:33,160
subjects, obese, diabetic, young insulin resistant individuals. And so we wanted to see if his

420
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,640
mechanism, Randall's postulate mechanism translates to humans, because these were all

421
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,800
in vitro studies done in tissues taken from animals. So in a series of studies, we took,

422
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,840
again, the healthy individuals, raised fatty acids through this triglyceride and little dose

423
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:55,000
of heparin infusion and found just the opposite to what Randall predicted. They got insulin

424
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,760
resistance, which is what he would have said, but not through his mechanism. He said, G6P should go

425
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,240
up. We saw it go down and we saw glucose go down. So it wasn't through inhibition of glycolysis

426
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:13,080
as he said, it's somehow interfering with the insulin activation of transport. So and again,

427
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,680
same rate controlling step we saw in all of our diabetics and obese individuals and

428
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:26,120
predybetic individuals. But just to be clear, Jerry, it caused hypoglycemia. The intra lipid

429
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:33,240
dropped glucose? No. Raising the fatty acids caused insulin resistance, inability of insulin

430
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,120
to stimulate glucose transport. Okay. Okay. Yep. I may have misheard you, but okay.

431
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,160
I'm going to now fast forward. We then took these observations back to the bench. We were able to

432
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:50,200
replicate this and rodents, rats and mice. And the power, even though I'm most passionate about

433
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,480
our human studies, I'm a clinical physiologist and I care most about understanding what's happening

434
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,800
in humans. The animal models allow you to really interrogate biochemical process. There we can get

435
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,400
tissue out in humans. I like to be non-invasive with our MR methodology, but here sometimes you

436
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,760
need to get tissues to measure activities, phosphorylation events. And, and also you have

437
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,680
the power of mouse genetics. You can knock genes in and out of mice to really rigorously test

438
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,480
hypothesis. I should tell you one experiment before I moved to this cartoon that we did

439
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:30,440
in humans is we did biopsies in these humans when we raised fatty acids and found this block in

440
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:38,040
transport and asked the question, is a lipid intermediate fatty acid metabolite interfering

441
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,120
with insulin signaling cascade, which we just discussed receptor and somewhere to PI3 kinase.

442
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,040
And what we found was indeed in healthy individuals just give glucose and insulin.

443
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,840
You get activation of PI3 kinase. This is the step you mentioned. This is the required step

444
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:02,120
for translocation. And in the follow-up study, same individuals, we raised glucose and insulin

445
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:09,000
and also raised fatty acids. And then we totally abrogate insulin activation of PI3 kinase.

446
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,760
That study basically in humans in the model we care about is saying, yeah, somehow a fatty acid

447
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,640
metabolite is leading to this block in insulin action somewhere between PI3 kinase and the

448
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,680
receptor. So we've narrowed it down to that. I'll walk you through the steps that I think then are

449
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,440
the biochemical metabolite that's mediating this, the lipid fatty acid mediator that's leading to

450
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,800
this, and then the biochemical mechanism. Does that sound good? Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

451
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:47,080
Here we have a cartoon of a muscle cell. And my view, again, thinking about flux, it has to do with

452
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,880
relative imbalance. So basically doing focus lipidomics, we zeroed in on this metabolite,

453
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,560
fatty acid metabolite called diacylglycerol. And yeah, I heard you mentioned that before.

454
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:05,480
It's the precursor, it's the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis, diacyl, two fatty acids

455
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,720
on a glycerol backbone. This is a bioactive metabolite. It's been known for years to activate

456
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:19,080
novel PKCs. This is what we found tracked in our animal models with lipid-induced insulin resistance.

457
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:25,160
Do high fat feeding in a mouse or rat, get muscle insulin resistance. And it was this metabolite

458
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,080
that tracked with insulin resistance. And then we did the lipid, same type of lipid infusion we did

459
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,560
in humans, simply raise plasma fatty acids by giving triglyceride and heparin. We saw acyl-CoA's

460
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:46,440
go up. We saw DAGs go up. Right when DAGs reached a peak, then we got activation of novel PKCs,

461
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,920
PKC theta and epsilon in the muscle. Then we linked to this block in insulin action,

462
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,640
which I'll show you in a second, at the level of the receptor and one step downstream of the

463
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:05,560
receptor. The concept that I'd like to impart on you is it's this imbalance between fluxes. So fatty

464
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:12,440
acids are continuously being delivered to muscle cells. And we're going to do the same thing if we

465
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,040
have time to talk about the liver, because that's the other key insulin-responsive organ. But we'll

466
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:22,120
start with muscle. Fatty acids are being delivered through fatty acids or even hydrolysis of

467
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,240
triglycerides through LPL, endothelial barrier, delivering more fatty acids to the muscle cell.

468
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:36,520
When it's the flux of fatty acids into the muscle cell that exceeds the ability of the mitochondria

469
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:44,760
to oxidize the fat or store this fatty acids acyl-CoA's as triglyceride, you get net

470
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:52,120
accumulation of diacylglycerol. This is a very important point. Triglycerides are neutral. So

471
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,160
I want to emphasize this. So even though triglycerides often track with insulin resistance,

472
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,440
we've dissociated it inside the muscle cell and liver cell from insulin resistance. It's a marker

473
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,040
for DAGs, typically tracks very well, but it's in a NERP storage form of lipid. So triglycerides

474
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,240
are not the culprit. We've dissociated in liver and muscle, but it's a pretty good marker if you

475
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,040
can't measure the DAGs with mass spec. Let's go back to that for a second. I want to make sure

476
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,920
people understand what we're saying here. So triacylglyceride or triglyceride, those two we

477
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,240
use interchangeably, has this three carbon glycerol backbone with three free fatty acids on it.

478
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,920
That's the way that we very, very efficiently store energy in the most energy dense hydrocarbon

479
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:44,440
in our body. The DAG by extension has only two of those free fatty acids. What typically sits on

480
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,960
that third carbon and what is it about that confirmation that renders the DAG, in this case

481
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:59,320
at least, seemingly much more of a problem than the TG or TAG? Basically it's a hydroxyl group,

482
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:06,680
a simple hydroxyl group. It's the two fatty acids of the DAG that sit into the bile layer,

483
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:13,640
membrane bile layer, and then the hydrophilic hydroxyl group sits in the cytoplasm. And that's

484
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:20,440
what then will pull the novel PKCs to the plasma membrane. So that's the troublemaker. That's the

485
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:27,080
troublemaker. Basically then when you get this imbalance between fatty acid uptake versus

486
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:34,040
oxidation in the mito versus storage as neutral lipid, you get activation of these two novel

487
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:42,840
PKCs in muscle, theta and epsilon. Theta blocks insulin action at the level somewhere between the

488
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:49,640
receptor and iris-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. And epsilon, and we'll get into this for the liver,

489
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:56,440
directly binds to the insulin receptor and then hits the receptor kinase. If we have a chance,

490
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,240
I'd love to share this with you and your listeners because this I think has important evolutionary

491
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,720
mechanisms behind it. Why does this exist? And it's going to be very important for

492
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:14,280
survival during starvation. But nevertheless, when both of these NPKCs in muscle are activated,

493
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,120
you have reduced insulin tyrosine phosphorylation of iris-1, less PI through kinase activation.

494
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,040
And as we talked about, then less boot fortranslocation. So to me, the real culprit,

495
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,480
and we've been able to just quickly really test this rigorously, gene knockout, we've been able to

496
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:37,960
inactivate isoforms, NPKC theta, you get protection. We've been able to block

497
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:45,000
mitoxidation and you make these animals prone to that buildup insulin resistance. We block

498
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,280
fat entry into the myocyte, inactivate F84, they're protected. You overexpress lipoprotein lipase

499
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,080
in the muscle, more fatty acid delivery muscle specific insulin resistance. And then finally,

500
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:03,480
if you rev up mitochondrial fat oxidation, let's say through uncoupling, overexpress UCP3

501
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,960
in the muscle, you get protection from insulin resistance and all these track with

502
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,360
DAGs going up or down with the insulin resistance or protection from insulin resistance.

503
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,680
Let's talk a little bit about how we think this is different in an active versus inactive person

504
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,880
because the outset you said, look, when we're trying to find this in the youngest cohort of

505
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,400
patients, these 20 year old basically undergrads at Yale that we're going to study, we screen on

506
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,800
many things, but an important thing we screen for is sedentary behavior. You mentioned that at the

507
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:41,800
very outset, which leads me to believe that if you did a sampling across the cross country team,

508
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:49,560
the crew team, you wouldn't find this phenomenon. So what is it about activity or the lack thereof

509
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:56,600
that presumably points to this elevation of intracellular DAGs that kicks off this cascade?

510
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,920
Let me just show you. So this is where we talked about Reven and his hypothesis of insulin

511
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,120
resistance and how what we wanted was to build on it. Because I'm going to answer your question

512
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:13,320
about exercise and I want to do two things that I want to show you how exercise reverses this

513
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,960
muscle insulin resistance. But I also want to show you and your listeners why exercise in muscle

514
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,080
actually will prevent fatty liver and liver insulin resistance. I think that this is a

515
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:31,880
useful segue. And so this is from Jerry Reven's Banting Lecture in 1988. And at that time,

516
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,400
people were still arguing whether insulin resistance was driving all these other things

517
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,520
we see around the circle, atherosclerosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, polycystic

518
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,160
ovarian disease, inflammation, or are these just common things clustering together?

519
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,040
So what we wanted to do was actually ask the question, what we see in these young 20 year

520
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,760
olds, these volunteers, is the first thing we see is muscle insulin resistance. And maybe

521
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,720
that's driving atherogenic dyslebigemia, who is going to lead to heart disease, high triglycerides,

522
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:11,400
low HDL, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by changing the fate of ingested carbohydrate

523
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,560
from glycogen to fat. So this is the distribution I was telling you about and healthy young,

524
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,440
sedentary individuals, we're going to get into exercise in a second. We simply take the bottom

525
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:28,600
quartile, one in four versus the top quartile, and we give them two high carbohydrate meals. And we

526
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,240
say, where's the energy going from that carbohydrate? How is it being stored? Getting at the very first

527
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:40,520
question you asked me, we can use our NMR to measure changes in fat storage and liver and muscle.

528
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:48,600
As well as glycogen in liver and muscle. And what we found then is you give them two high carbohydrate

529
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:55,240
milkshakes, and there's virtually no difference in the plasma glucose concentrations at this late

530
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,440
breakfast and lunchtime high carbohydrate shake. But you can see it's at the expense of severe

531
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:06,040
hyperinsulinemia is what we talked about. So the reason these young insulin resistant, as well as

532
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,480
every insulin resistant person is perfectly fine is the beta cells are pumping out two to three

533
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,520
times the amount of insulin just to maintain euglycemia. So these beta cells are just being whipped,

534
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,440
working really hard. And that's why no one's diabetic, you're insulin resistant. That's why

535
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:26,600
virtually every obese insulin resistant person is normal glycemia because the beta cells are working

536
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,240
so hard to maintain this. And you can see that here. The other thing I want to point out is

537
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:37,800
the insulin levels are given number, you know, so normal, maybe 100 at the peak and maybe 180

538
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,480
at the peak in the resistant individuals. But this is in plasma, the portal vein with the liver

539
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,240
seeds is three times the liver seen huge amounts of insulin in these insulin resistant individuals

540
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:55,800
just to maintain normal glycemia. We use carbon NMR to look at changes in muscle glycogen and

541
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:01,640
liver glycogen. You can see, again, young insulin resistant 20 year olds can't get glucose into

542
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,080
muscle glycogen due to a block in transport because they have increased ectopic fat in the

543
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:15,480
myocyte, the eggs are up, no problem in liver. And then you look at the changes in fat and this

544
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:21,960
carbohydrate, this is change in liver triglyceride, it's up two and a half, 2.3 fold. You put some

545
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,880
heavy water, stable, heavy water into the milkshake to track de novo lipogenesis. That's

546
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,800
the conversion of glucose to fat. And that's also up greater than two fold. Quick question there.

547
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,680
There was a very famous experiment. It's been so long since I've read it. I certainly know I spent

548
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:46,520
many hours on it. It was by Mark Hellerstein circa 94 ish. And he looked at this question of

549
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:54,200
how much carbohydrate could be converted to fat via de novo lipogenesis. And if I recall correctly,

550
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:00,120
the answer was, at least from that paper, was not that much. But also, I believe one of the criticisms

551
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,920
of that was that he was looking at an insulin sensitive population. Am I remembering that

552
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,800
correctly? Because what you're showing here would suggest the opposite, which suggests that an

553
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:16,440
insulin resistant person is capable of significant de novo lipogenesis. Everything you've said is

554
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:22,360
correct. When you're thinking about de novo lipogenesis, two things is you get what conditions

555
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:27,640
are you studying this? Is it after meal ingestion? Is it in the fasting state when a lot of people

556
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:34,120
have measured this in the past? It's minimal and it makes sense. It only gears up with substrate

557
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:40,680
is taking in. And then depending on the type of substrate, you can alter this quite a bit. So

558
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:46,120
it can be changed by simply putting more fructose, more glucose in the meal by increase

559
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:51,080
the meal size. Mark's done beautiful work in the past. It is what it is. Those studies are what

560
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,360
they are. But clearly what we're learning here is just as you say, you know, is significant. It's

561
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,320
not the majority of the fat. I think most investigators would agree the majority of fat

562
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:07,000
synthesis in liver is occurring through a stearification that is fatty acids coming to

563
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,760
the liver, getting corporate into triglyceride. But there is a significant importance for DNL.

564
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,160
And again, especially if you track it chronically in patients who are continuously high carb

565
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,040
feeding, especially high sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, we want to get into that, but

566
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,960
fructose basically gets funneled into the liver, into the DNL pathway. It's ubiquitous. You can

567
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:36,360
push DNL to be significant and it is a significant contributor to metabolic fatty liver disease.

568
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,360
And it's upregulated with peripheral sensitivity. I think this is the major

569
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,560
message I want to give here is when you have muscle insulin resistance, specifically,

570
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:53,720
it will drive the liver fat synthesis by DNL. When you have that, when your liver is making

571
00:56:53,720 --> 00:57:01,880
more fat through DNL, it makes more BLDL exports. So plasma triglycerides go up and HDL goes down.

572
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,720
So what I find interesting about this before you go further, Jerry, is this is all from the 2007

573
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,840
PNAS paper by your wife, actually, right? Kit Peterson. Yeah, Kit Peterson. So what I find

574
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,920
interesting about these data is that these patients were euglycemic. I mean, that to me

575
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:26,440
is the staggering piece of this. These patients are still potentially a decade away from seeing

576
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:33,880
an interference in glucose homeostasis. They're a decade away from their doctor saying, hey,

577
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:39,080
your glucose is a little higher than it should be post-prandily, nevermind even at the fast.

578
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:45,560
And yet they're already seeing an 80% increase in triglyceride, which I just want to sort of

579
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:51,240
talk a little bit about this clinically. Most laboratory assays will say a triglyceride level

580
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,640
of 150 milligrams per deciliter is considered normal. Well, we don't say that in our practice.

581
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:04,360
We view anything over 100 as abnormal. That's a red flag. And if your trigs are more than 2x your

582
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:10,360
HDL cholesterol, that's a very big red flag. Although most people would accept triglycerides

583
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:16,440
of three or four, if not five times above HDL cholesterol before the sirens would go off.

584
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:22,680
And yet when you look at these patients, again, euglycemic, you see a difference of approximately

585
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:30,200
100 to 105 of the trigs in the insulin resistant to 60 in the insulin sensitive. So it's all kind

586
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,200
of right here in front of you, sort of in a way that unfortunately just doesn't get appreciated.

587
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,160
But it's the more intense stuff that's mind boggling to me, which is the two and three-fold

588
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:47,800
difference we see in de novo lipogenesis, hepatic synthesis of fat, impaired hepatic

589
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:52,680
glucose sensitivity. And I guess it speaks to the point you made earlier, Jerry, which is

590
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,880
when the portal vein amplification of insulin differences is as big as it is, it becomes

591
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:03,640
basically a magnifier of everything we're seeing in the periphery. Exactly. Yeah. And our normative

592
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:09,240
data, in my view, we need to reset what we consider normal is to me, this is when we look at our

593
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,520
insulin sensitive, that's what our normal should be and guiding us. You asked about exercise and

594
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:19,160
something we're quite passionate about. And I want to kind of tell you how that fits in here.

595
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:25,240
So again, conceptually, here we have a normal person ingesting carbohydrate. First question,

596
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:30,600
how is this distributed? It's in glycogen is where you want to store your ingested carbohydrate.

597
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:36,200
It gets stored in glycogen and liver and muscle. And again, this is one quarter of our young, lean,

598
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:42,120
healthy volunteers are insulin resistant. And again, if you're overweight or obese, you're there

599
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,520
already because these are lean individuals and that's still one quarter of the population.

600
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:52,120
You can't get that ingested glucose into glycogen due to this block in transport,

601
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:58,840
due to the block in DAG, PKC inhibition of insulin signaling. It's diverted to liver.

602
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,320
You have that insulin in the portal vein that's three times periphery, it's up to five,

603
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:11,720
600 micro units per mil. That turns on SRIBP1C, the master transcriptional regulator of triglyceride

604
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:18,360
synthesis gears up all the DNL enzymes. So you have increased DNL that leads to this increase.

605
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:24,520
We just reviewed plasma triglycerides, this reduction in HDL. This is going to set

606
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:31,080
these healthy individuals up to atherogenic dyslipidemia, heart disease in their 40s and 50s.

607
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:36,200
With time, it's metabolic associated fatty liver disease now. And again, most common

608
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:43,960
cause of liver disease now in the world. It's now leading cause of NASH, leading cause of liver

609
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,680
fibrosis, cirrhosis, end stage liver disease and going to be liver cancer. So it's all going to be

610
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:58,280
metabolic driven and from that hyperinsulinemia in my view. So exercise, can we do anything about this?

611
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,400
This hypothesis is right, we can test it. And so you asked about exercise. So this is a study we did

612
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,880
some years ago, published in the New England Journal, took these young insulin resistant

613
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,640
offspring. And this is with parents with type 2 diabetes. And the Jocelyn group did a really nice

614
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:18,600
study. They found that if you have two parents with type 2 diabetes, and if you're insulin

615
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,000
resistant, that single parameter is the best predictor whether or not you would go on to

616
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,280
develop type 2 diabetes. So we've tried to study these individuals with our methodology extensively.

617
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,640
And John Luca Persagian, who did this study when he was a fellow with me, took these and just studied

618
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,040
them in the basal state shown here that, you know, again, in the insulin resistant, again,

619
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:47,640
everyone's hears lean, not smoking, no medications, they're in their 20s and 30s, BMI 23, 24 to factor

620
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,920
out obesity, confounding of factors of obesity, medication, smoking, other things. So young, lean,

621
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,960
healthy individuals, but just parents with diabetes, insulin resistant. You study them,

622
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:03,080
and in the basal state, take up less than half the amount of glucose in muscle, and it's due to a

623
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:08,520
block in transport. So same thing as I've gone on and on before in the diabetics and the obese

624
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:14,680
individuals, this block in transport. And we asked the question, does exercise, can we bypass the

625
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:20,680
sound normality? And the answer is yes. So here you can see this was after six weeks of being on a

626
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:27,800
stair master, three 15 minute bouts at about 65% MBO2 max. And here we're normalizing insulin

627
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,080
stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis. And we usually measuring glucose 6-phosphate, we've opened

628
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:39,800
up that door of getting glucose into the myocyte. So, and I think molecular explanation for this is

629
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:46,440
this protein called ANPK, which we can talk about, gets activated with exercise. And that has been

630
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,880
shown to cause borotranslocation independent, independent of pediatric kinase. And so we're

631
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:58,840
kind of short circuiting that block with exercise. To test our overall hypothesis, does muscle

632
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:05,800
insulin resistance drive fatty liver and DNL and high triglycerides? We took these young insulin

633
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,280
resistant individuals and we showed, John Luca showed in that New England Journal study, even a

634
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:17,000
single bout, 45 minute bout was sufficient to open up the door to glucose, cause that glute four

635
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,400
translocations. And Rasmus Rabaul, when he was a clinical fellow with me, did one single bout

636
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,080
in these same individuals I showed you before, insulin resistance and muscle.

637
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:33,720
The ones had high triglycerides, low HDL and prone to increased DNL. With the single bout, we able to

638
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:39,800
show that that same ingested glucose would lead to more glucose deposition as muscle glycogen.

639
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:46,200
And we got significant reductions in de nova lipogenesis, significant reductions in liver

640
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,680
triglyceride. I just want to make sure I understand that. And it's relevant to another question I have

641
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:56,040
about the difference between insulin dependent and independent glucose uptake. So do we know if that

642
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:05,480
single bout of exercise, which particular piece of the pathway got released? Did it have some direct

643
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:13,720
effect on the root cause, the DAG or some of the kinases downstream? Was it even further downstream

644
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:19,000
at the very last step where the transporter gets released? Like where was the actual bottleneck

645
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,600
alleviated with that single bout of exercise? I can speculate in these were human studies.

646
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:29,800
I can tell you that we opened up the door. We measured glucose 6-phosphate in them and that

647
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:36,200
goes up. So we opened the door for that defect in insulin stimulating transport is now reversed. So

648
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,720
glucose transporters and the membrane glucose is coming in. What I can't tell you is whether or not

649
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:47,560
we've altered DAGs and we're getting improved insulin signaling at the level of the receptor

650
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:55,400
and IRS1. And or is it just AMPK causing this glute IV translocation? If I had to speculate,

651
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:02,120
I would think most of it is through the latter. We were simply with an acute bout causing AMPK

652
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,800
induced glute IV translocation, which we know happens independent of the kindness. That's

653
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:13,080
established. So we're short circuiting. We're just causing glute IV right at all the lower mechanisms

654
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,200
to get to the membrane. So we fixed the block in insulin action. I think though with chronic

655
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:24,520
exercise therapy, we're going to be doing both where we get melt away. The lipid and DAGs go down.

656
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,000
So we have improved insulin signaling as well as more AMPK induced glute IV translocation.

657
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,400
Yeah, I'll tell you just I think I've even discussed this on a previous podcast.

658
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,200
I've had a couple of patients with type 1 diabetes that I've taken care of, not many,

659
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,560
but in the phenotype of patients with type 1 diabetes where there is a significant amount of

660
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:50,600
exercise, specifically sort of modest intensity aerobic exercise. So a person who is, for example,

661
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:56,760
doing brisk walking, very brisk walking sort of to the tune of four miles an hour, an hour to two

662
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:04,600
hours a day. These patients with type 1 diabetes can be virtually free of insulin and maintain

663
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,320
reasonable glycemic control so they can walk around with a hemoglobin A1c of 6%

664
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,360
using maybe 12 units of insulin a day and obviously restricting carbohydrates. But again,

665
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:22,200
it suggests, I say this, having watched them change the intensity duration of the exercise,

666
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:27,640
that it seems that that exercise becomes a spigot to how much glucose they can dispose

667
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:33,240
in their muscle seemingly without insulin. It's almost like a total bypass of the system,

668
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:38,200
which again, I think to your point is chronic. I don't think this is something we see acutely.

669
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,320
I obviously can't comment on it. The first time I saw it, which was probably about six years ago,

670
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:49,880
it really sent a light bulb off, which is imagine now being able to maximize both insulin dependent

671
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:56,360
and insulin independent glucose uptake into a muscle that really becomes a powerful tool to

672
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,880
combat all of this sort of metabolic dysregulation. That's what AMPK does is insulin dependent glucose

673
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:08,360
uptake. And I can see in combination with reduced carbohydrate consumption, less coming into

674
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:14,280
the circulation and whatever little comes in is taken care of through AMPK, insulin independent

675
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:20,440
good for trans location. So that fits. Before we go to the liver, and I do want to actually

676
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,640
talk about how all of this works in the liver. I want to go back to one other thing that you

677
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:31,960
very briefly touched on, which is the evolutionary explanation for some of this.

678
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,640
That would be best done, if I might say with the liver.

679
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,600
Okay, great. Let's do it because I want to understand this. Yeah.

680
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,360
That's kind of fun. So let's now turn. So I kind of walked you through at least my thinking about

681
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:50,040
insulin resistance, why it's so important for not only diabetes, but so many diseases. I've shown

682
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:55,480
you the physiological cause for insulin resistance in muscle can't get glucose in the glycogen.

683
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:00,680
I've shown you that block is a transport and then I've given you a molecular understanding

684
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:06,520
of how that insulin resistance and muscle happens. My view is lipid disaglycerol is block leading to

685
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:13,480
activation of a novel protein kinase C, epsilon, theta blocking insulin signaling. Okay. So let's

686
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,280
now, and then I've shown you how muscle insulin resistance can lead to fat accumulation in liver,

687
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:25,880
atherogenic, dyslipidema, and fatty liver. Now we know fatty liver is what then leads to insulin

688
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,600
resistance in the liver. And so I want to take you through the molecular basis for how fat and liver

689
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,080
causes insulin resistance. And it's pretty much what's nice now that you understand muscle,

690
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,600
lipid induced muscle insulin resistance, it's pretty close to the same story in liver. So here's a

691
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:46,360
cartoon of the liver cell. But is the direction of causation, Jerry, in the order in which you're

692
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:52,840
telling the story, in other words, is the hyperinsulinemia as a result of muscle insulin

693
01:08:52,840 --> 01:09:00,520
resistance? Let me clarify that muscle insulin resistance, which leads to peripheral hyperinsulinemia,

694
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:06,600
which is accompanied by portal vein hyperinsulinemia, which leads to what you're about to tell us. Is

695
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,480
that the order in which you think this occurs? I do. As I say, this is what we see in our

696
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:17,800
volunteers as we march through the progression in different stages. We don't see liver abnormalities

697
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,120
in these young 20 year olds. It's all muscle and maybe a little bit of the fat cell, which we'll

698
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:28,120
come to at the end, but it's the muscle. There's no alterations in the liver until they get fatty

699
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:34,200
liver. Once they get fatty liver, then we see both insulin resistance in liver and insulin resistance

700
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:40,360
in muscle. A very important distinction between humans and rodents. We've studied both models quite

701
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,560
extensively. Rodents develop insulin resistance in the reverse direction. They get liver fat first,

702
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:51,560
liver insulin resistance, and then muscle. Most of the studies done in rodents is a very important

703
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:57,240
distinction in terms of the progression and very different humans versus rodents. We can talk about

704
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:02,360
similarities and differences if you want, but we're going to focus mostly on humans for this talk.

705
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:10,920
And that makes total sense. So it is, again, its peripheral IR, hepatic IR, hepatic consequences,

706
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,280
which then basically amplify it. That's my belief, yeah. And again, leading to this beta cell

707
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:21,720
compensation, compensation, and then again, something when you get both muscle and liver

708
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,680
insulin resistance and it's increased glucose production by liver, then something happens to

709
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:30,680
the beta cell. And that's when things really start to spiral where you have very profound

710
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:37,080
hyperglycemia fasting the postprandial. Here's the cartoon of the liver cell. And again, glucose

711
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:41,480
transport is not rate controlling, as you know, in the liver cell. Glucose just diffuses in through

712
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:47,960
Glut2 transporters and the insulin, again, binds the receptor, same thing, autophosphorylation.

713
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:54,520
The key intermediate there in liver is IRS2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, use cathekinase,

714
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:02,760
just as you did in muscle like AT2. And in liver, what happens is you have a few things. One,

715
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,560
not shown here is glucokinase translocation. And that we've recently shown is probably very

716
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,760
important for rate control, getting glucose into the hepatocyte. You also get activation of glycogen

717
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:19,160
synthase and more glycogen synthesis. And then you have this phosphorylation of FOXO,

718
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:27,000
which is a transcriptional regulator. And that then is excluded from the nucleus and then down

719
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,080
regulates then gluconeogenesis through a transcriptional mechanism. And if we have a

720
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:36,440
chance, I'd like to come back to this because we have some interesting data that speaks to really

721
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:42,760
how insulin is inhibiting this key process. So let's now just focus on how lipid causes insulin

722
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:50,920
resistance in liver. Same metabolite, it's the disaglystrols. They go to activate epsilon,

723
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:58,520
that's really the major isoform of PKC, novel PKCs in liver, and work by Varmin Samuel when

724
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:05,000
he was doing his PhD with me in a series of studies. Varmin showed that epsilon binds to

725
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,920
the insulin receptor and directly inhibits the receptor kinase itself. And that then leads to

726
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,480
downstream abnormalities. What I want to share with you now, which I think, and again,

727
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,040
gets into this evolutionary basis for insulin resistance, which I think your listeners might

728
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:27,720
find interesting is how is epsilon inhibiting the receptor kinase? We worked on this Jesse

729
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:34,120
Reinhardt and Max Peterson, he was an MD PhD student with me. We did untargeted phosphoproteomics.

730
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:40,680
And what I'm showing here is the catalytic domain of the insulin receptor. Yeah, I can just describe

731
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:47,560
it for the listeners. It's a loop. You can picture it as a door over the pocket for the catalytic

732
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:54,200
domain of the insulin receptor. And this door is closed. IRS1, IRS2 can't go into the pocket for

733
01:12:54,200 --> 01:13:01,720
tyrosine phosphorylation. When insulin binds the receptor, these three tyrosines, the 1158,

734
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:08,600
the 1162, and the 1163 become phosphorylated, that opens the door, that loop flips out, and then

735
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,560
IRS1, IRS2 go into the pocket and undergo tyrosine phosphorylation to get the rest of the

736
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,880
cascade going. Using untargeted phosphoproteomics, we were able to show Jesse Reinhardt, who is our

737
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:27,480
collaborator and mass spec maven, identified using purified receptor, purified PKC epsilon,

738
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:33,000
that when you add activated epsilon to the receptor, you phosphorylate this threonine.

739
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,640
And that got us very excited because, golly, that's one amino acid away from these two tyrosines

740
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:45,880
that are required for activation receptors, maybe doing something important. And so the other thing

741
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:53,000
that got us excited about, and here's getting into evolution, is the sequence of the catalytic domain

742
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,160
for the receptor. And it's been conserved all the way from humans down to fruit flies,

743
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:05,880
those three tyrosines, same position, and that threonine that sits right between the two tyrosines,

744
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:12,840
1158, 1162, has been conserved all the way, again, from Homo sapiens down to Drosophila,

745
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:17,640
through evolution, if something's important, it usually hangs around. That's a long time.

746
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:23,480
So to prove this, we very simply, we did some genetics. Again, that's what you can do is you

747
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:30,120
can knock a glutamic acid, replace that threonine with glutamic acid, mimic a phosphorylation event,

748
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:35,320
and that kills the kinase activity. You can mutate the threonine to an alanine so it can't

749
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:40,840
get phosphorylated, and then you have protection in vitro from epsilon-induced reduction in IRC

750
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,960
activity. And then you can make the mouse. And so here in this paper, we made mice where we replaced

751
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,920
the threonine in that key position, the 11, this is the mouse homologue, the 1150 is the

752
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:59,240
homologue for the 1160 in humans. So all the threonines are instead alanines. And I won't

753
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:03,480
get into the data, other say the mice are perfectly normal, normal chow, normal insulin

754
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:10,600
sensitivity, nothing, you know, normal size, normal growth. But when Max fed these mice a high-fat diet,

755
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:15,640
the wild-type mice get profound hepatic insulin resistance. And this we see, and everyone else on

756
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:22,200
the planet sees, you feed mice high-fat diet, even for three days, they get fat accumulation,

757
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:27,000
DAG accumulation, hepatic insulin resistance. Does it have to have sucrose in it as well,

758
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,120
or just fat? Doesn't need to be. You can make it worse if you add a little sucrose. They like

759
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,760
that in the drinking water, and they have even more fatty liver to put sucrose in the drinking

760
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:42,200
water. But this is just with fat alone, but it's even more greater when you put sucrose or fructose

761
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:48,680
or whatever sugar you want in the drinking water. And here, then you can see when you simply mutate

762
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:55,800
that threonine, now you have perfectly normal hepatic insulin sensitivity as reflected by

763
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,920
insulin's ability to suppress hepatic glucose production. And this is despite the same amount

764
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:07,640
of liver fat, same amount of liver DAGs in the liver. This tells us that that single amino acid

765
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,360
is doing something very important in terms of mediating lipid-induced insulin resistance.

766
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:17,320
And this actually just came out this last week, this paper now, just to summarize, where we've

767
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:23,800
now shown that there's different isoforms. We didn't get into this, into the abdysyl glycerol,

768
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:31,000
and it really matters which isoform it is and what compartment it is. Just to summarize this

769
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,360
paper that just came out in cell metabolism, we were able to show by measuring the three different

770
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:43,960
stereoisomers of diisoglycerols. It's really the SN1,2 isoform and measuring these different

771
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:49,320
isoforms in five different intracellular compartments, the plasma membrane, the cytosol,

772
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:56,760
lipid droplet, ER, and the mitochondria. It's really specifically the SN1,2 isoform in the

773
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:02,840
plasma membrane that's important. If you just measure total DAGs, you may easily miss this.

774
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:08,440
We learned that this recent study, and that we showed both that PKC epsilon is both necessary

775
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:14,280
and sufficient for this process by doing a knock-in and over expression. But I just want to basically

776
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:20,680
touch on the question you asked me about. Why do we have insulin resistance? Why should it exist?

777
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:28,280
And the reason I think it exists is it's protective for us during starvation. When you starve,

778
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:35,080
this is true pretty much in all mammals, mice, rats, and humans. When we starve, we get fatty

779
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:41,320
liver. Here in this study, this is Rachel Perry's paper in cell from a couple years ago. Take rats,

780
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:47,480
just starve them for 48 hours. You have increased lipolysis, more fatty acids delivered to the

781
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:56,840
liver, hepatic fat accumulation. DAGs we show go up, SN1,2, PKC epsilon translocation, and insulin

782
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:03,000
resistance in liver. And the main thing that insulin does in the liver is it promotes glucose

783
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,240
uptake and storage as glycogen. When you think about it, that's what you want turned off during

784
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:15,800
starvation because during starvation, glucose is a very precious molecule, and you want to preserve

785
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:23,000
this in circulation for the CNS, which is critically in need. It's really the major source of energy

786
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:31,320
for the CNS. And so by promoting hepatic insulin resistance, we're promoting glucose in circulation

787
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:37,880
for basically the CNS to operate. And so that to me is why that threonine is preserved all the way

788
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:45,000
from humans to fruit flies. And I just wanted to show you this cover of nature, this Mexican cave

789
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,320
fish. It's a fun story because after our paper came out, this little fish made the cover of nature.

790
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,680
And what was so fascinating about it, so these little fish, they live inside caves.

791
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:02,520
They spend most of their life starving. The only time they are able to eat is when something smaller

792
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:08,040
than them swims in front of the cave, and then they can reach out and grab it and pull it back

793
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:15,320
into the cave and gobble it up. And these workers who studied this Mexican cave fish found this cave

794
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:21,720
fish had a mutation in the insulin receptor, had profound hepatic insulin resistance, and they also

795
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:27,880
went on to say this was important to allow them to survive. In my view, insulin resistance was a

796
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:34,360
protective mechanism throughout evolution that allowed us to survive all species during starvation,

797
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:40,200
which was probably the predominant environmental exposure we've had for the last many, many

798
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:47,400
millennia. And it's only in recent years, recent decades that now we're in this toxic environment

799
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:53,560
of over nutrition. And it's when these same pathways now are going the opposite direction,

800
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:59,800
promoting disease by doing what they were at one time was protective. And now they're actually

801
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:05,320
being told metabolic disease that we just discussed. So I want to make sure I can unpack this a little

802
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:09,640
bit. So I want to start in the muscle because I think it's easier. And again, we'll even talk

803
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:14,520
about it in humans, which means we can do it on a sort of different timescale, because obviously 48

804
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:21,640
hours of fasting in a mouse is a seismic fast, a near fatal fast. But let's say 48 to 72 hours

805
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:28,200
of fasting in a human, we still would expect to see significant muscle insulin resistance. And

806
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:34,520
there would be a great reason for that evolutionarily, because you would want to make sure that as much

807
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:40,120
glucose as possible in that circulation, which by this point is all coming through hepatic glucose

808
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:48,520
output is not being quote unquote wasted in muscle glycogen synthesis. To your point, every gram of

809
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:53,000
gluconeogenic substrate that's going through the liver and then coming out the liver should be

810
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,680
preserved for the brain. Because even Cahill's studies show that after 40 days of starvation,

811
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:07,160
humans were still getting about 40% of CNS energy from glucose, the remainder from ketones. So

812
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:13,400
glucose never went away as a substrate for the brain. So I think I have a handle on the muscle

813
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:21,240
side of things. I'm still struggling a little bit to understand the physiologic consequence of hepatic

814
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:28,280
insulin resistance, and how that feeds into what I think should be an environment that says,

815
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:36,760
figure out a way to make as much glucose for the CNS as possible. Why does more fat accumulation

816
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:43,400
in the liver make it better served to protect the brain? So first of all, let me step back. So both

817
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:49,720
organs during starvation, both liver, even though I focus here on liver, muscle will become insulin

818
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:54,440
resistant also through increased circulating fatty acids through the mechanisms we talked

819
01:21:54,440 --> 01:22:00,200
about DAGS building up PKC theta. So insulin resistance in all organs are going to preserve

820
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:07,400
glucose for the CNS. I was just focusing on the threonine here in liver because that's where

821
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:14,200
Epsilon was taking us. To understand the liver, I want to just take you to another cartoon because

822
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:20,840
you're asking a very important question about processes, about regulation, how insulin works

823
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:27,000
in liver. And I think to do this, let me just step back. The conceptual view, again, this is a

824
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,640
cartoon I always like to show how does insulin work. This was from 20 years ago when I was first

825
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:36,600
studying it, maybe 30 years ago. Insulin binds to receptor magic happens, something happens,

826
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:41,480
and you have an effect. And so even though insulin has been since its discovery, we're still

827
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:47,160
trying to really understand what's happening in different tissues, how it works and getting

828
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:53,320
surprises. So this is the canonical view we just went through of how insulin works on liver, it

829
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:59,960
binds the receptor, it activates the cascade to promote glycogen synthesis and turn off gluconeogenesis.

830
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:08,040
And what we're finding is the simple view doesn't explain many things and I think needs modification,

831
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:14,120
especially in terms of insulin regulating gluconeogenesis, this process that is required

832
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:18,680
to keep us alive during starvation. Without gluconeogenesis, we're not going to wake up in

833
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:23,400
the morning because it's gluconeogenesis that supplies glucose for the CNS while we're sleeping.

834
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:27,240
And certainly during starvation, without this process, we're in trouble.

835
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,240
I don't think that can be overstated, by the way. Let's go back to what you just said.

836
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:37,960
We couldn't survive, by my calculation, Jerry, we'd have a hard time surviving 10 minutes without

837
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:44,680
gluconeogenesis as a species. Well, I'll modify that a little bit. As Pashy did, I'd love to hear

838
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:50,840
you state the importance of gluconeogenesis. No, we know clinically you can. And again,

839
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,880
from the lessons learned from Gene Knockout, unfortunately, there are patients with inherited

840
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:00,680
disease, Bongariki's disease. As you know, patients who don't have glucose 6-phosphatase,

841
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:06,360
the last key step getting glucose 6-phosphate out. We do know that can be compatible with life. We

842
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:12,680
have patients with glucose 6-phosphatase. And the way we keep them alive is just continuously to feed

843
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:18,280
them. Yeah, that's my point. Without continuous glucose feeding, your lifespan would be measured

844
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:24,760
in minutes to hours without gluconeogenesis to regulate glucosomastasis. It's critical for

845
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:30,920
life function. We're on the same page. So let's just talk about then how it's thought to operate

846
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:36,680
and regulate it. It's also important to be able to modulate it. So we eat a meal, and we have to

847
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:42,600
suppress gluconeogenesis. Otherwise, glucose would go up to 400 or 500 after eating a carbohydrate

848
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,320
meal. So it has to be a process that's turned on, turned off. And that turned on too much,

849
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,680
you know, in terms of diabetes, because that's what drives fast and hyperglycemia.

850
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:55,880
Traditionally, pretty much the major textbooks, physiology, biochemistry,

851
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:02,040
insulin is thought to be turned off gluconeogenesis through transcriptional

852
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:09,400
mechanisms. And again, this is this FoxO phosphorylation by AKT exclusion from the nucleus.

853
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:16,280
Then you get downregulation of Pepsi cakes, excuse me, and 6-phosphatase. FoxO is the transcription

854
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:22,360
regulator for these downregulation. The problem with this view, and again, there's some beautiful

855
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:26,760
molecular biology, and I'm not going to want to deny that this doesn't happen, but the problem

856
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:34,840
with this being the predominant regulating mechanism is threefold. One is you can knock out

857
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:41,240
AKT or FoxO and give insulin to the mouse, and you can still turn off gluconeogenesis in a fasted

858
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:46,040
mouse, which is totally dependent on gluconeogenesis. That speaks to the fact you don't need

859
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:52,200
these key insulin signaling pathways to regulate gluconeogenesis. The second thing in terms of its

860
01:25:52,280 --> 01:26:00,760
role in mediating fast in hyperglycemia and diabetes is we got liver from patients with

861
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:06,760
poorly controlled diabetes. So when patients go in for a Roux-en-Y or bariatric surgery,

862
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:11,160
the surgeon can take a little piece of liver under direct visualization, so it's very safe,

863
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:17,560
and give us enough liver to we can do actually protein measurement and enzyme measurements of

864
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:24,760
Pepsi-K 6-phosphatase, not just message, but actually the proteins themselves. And to my surprise,

865
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:30,600
I thought all these enzymes from everything I was thinking about biochemistry and at least what I

866
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:36,040
learned when I was a luxury medical student is I expected Pepsi-K and 6-phosphatase and

867
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:42,840
fructose 1,6-biphosphatase all to be upregulated two to threefold in the poorly controlled diabetic

868
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:49,160
that was undergoing ruined bypass surgery compared to the non-diabetic. And we found

869
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:54,440
no relationship between protein expression of these enzymes, gluconeogenic enzymes,

870
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,280
and at least fasting glucose and insulin and history of diabetes. Finally, when you develop

871
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:06,600
methods, the flux methods we won't get into to actually quantify this flux of gluconeogenesis,

872
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,320
which has not been easy to measure, by the way, but we have methods now, they're very good to

873
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:18,040
measure this flux, we can turn off gluconeogenesis within five minutes. And that's much faster than

874
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:23,880
you'd expect in transcriptional translational mechanisms. Just to kind of talk about how

875
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:29,640
gluconeogenesis, this is the gluconeogenic pathway lactate to glucose, you can have transcriptional

876
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:35,880
regulation, you can have substrate regulation. So glycerol we've shown from lipolysis, there is

877
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:41,400
no rate control. The more glycerol that comes from fat breakdown in the fat cell that fluxes

878
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:46,200
the liver comes right out of glucose. There's no rate control, it's just all substrate driven.

879
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:52,680
Redox we've shown in the liver cell regulates gluconeogenesis. And this in a series of studies

880
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:57,960
that Anilla has done, that's how I think metformin works. And we can talk about that if you're

881
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:04,280
interested. But finally, I want to emphasize is this allosteric regulation of gluconeogenesis

882
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:11,480
by Acetyl-CoA. This had been known for decades to be a regulator of pyrovacinoxalase and had kind

883
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:16,600
of been forgotten because it was very hard to measure and no one looked at it in vivo, because

884
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:22,360
it's hard to measure in vivo or especially in the diabetic situation. We said, well, wait a minute,

885
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:27,240
let's go back and look at Acetyl-CoA. We developed the methods tandem mass spec methods, very

886
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:32,680
sensitive, very specific. To do this and freeze clamp tissues from animals with varying degrees

887
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:40,280
of diabetes, hyperglycemia. The bottom line is found a very robust relationship between Acetyl-CoA,

888
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:45,480
which is, as you know, the end product of beta-oxidation. Take fatty acids and break them down

889
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:51,480
to beta-oxidation, the end product as before it enters the TCA cycle. And there's this very

890
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:57,400
robust relationship, just all these different studies. But basically every study we do,

891
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:02,520
we give insulin, we get suppression of Acetyl-CoA. This explains how insulin acutely

892
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:08,840
suppresses gluconeogenesis. When diabetic models, when you have increased gluconeogenesis,

893
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:14,680
it's two-fold increases in Acetyl-CoA, but it perfectly follows rates of gluconeogenesis,

894
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:21,240
which we quantify track perfectly with concentrations of tatic Acetyl-CoA content.

895
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:25,000
I just want to take you how insulin normally works in the liver cell,

896
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,280
and then how it becomes dysregulated in diabetes. And this is going to answer your question about

897
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:36,120
how do we distinguish insulin promoting storage as glycogen, yet keeping gluconeogenesis

898
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,400
going for the brain. So this is very important to answer that question. So in my view,

899
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:49,400
insulin binds the receptor and it has direct effects through the receptor. That is mostly

900
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:55,480
to promote glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. The effects on gluconeogenesis,

901
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:01,880
the process that keeps us going during starvation, is really mostly regulated, not through the

902
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:09,400
receptor in liver, but it's through its effect on the fat cell in the periphery. In studies we've

903
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:14,920
done in awake rats, and we're translating this to humans, it's really insulin putting the brake on

904
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:23,400
peripheral lipolysis, less fatty acid delivery to liver, less generation of Acetyl-CoA. And we've

905
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:30,040
shown this, the more fatty acids that flux the liver track almost perfectly with Acetyl-CoA content,

906
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:35,880
less pyruvic carboxylase activity. And again, there's about 10-15% of this gluconeogenesis

907
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,440
is simply coming from less glycerol from lipolysis to liver through substrate push.

908
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:45,960
So you have two very different processes here. One is glycogen synthesis. That's what the

909
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:52,440
receptor is doing in liver. Gluconeogenesis is mostly 90%, I would say, maybe a little bit of

910
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:57,800
intrapadic lipolysis regulation, but mostly through its effect to put the brake on peripheral

911
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:03,560
lipolysis. And this model, by the way, will explain in my view the explanation for all the

912
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:09,640
controversies of insulin action that have been described through the last decades in mice, where

913
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:16,120
you knock out AKT in the mouse, insulin still works. You do things to the periphery, fat cell,

914
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:22,440
and you affect glucose metabolism, gluconeogenesis. All these studies that appear to be conflicting

915
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:27,320
can be explained if you use this model as a template to understand insulin action.

916
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:32,680
And again, I have short-term fast and long-term fast. This is important species differentiation.

917
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:39,240
Mice, and as you pointed this out, Peter, even after an overnight fast, boom, all the glycogen's

918
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:45,800
gone. Very different from humans. Humans hold on to their glycogen like dogs, probably for two days.

919
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:50,280
We've done these measurements with starvation in humans. We've shown that it takes about two days

920
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:56,680
to deplete liver glycogen. When you have glycogen in liver, it's really these direct effects of

921
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:02,680
insulin on liver will predominate. But as you move to the fasting state, so in a mouse after a 12-hour

922
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:09,400
fast or longer, and in a human probably have to go 24 or longer fast, then it's really insulin,

923
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:15,800
these indirect effects will predominate. And this will also explain all the controversies in dogs,

924
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:21,320
Sherrington, Bergman in terms of direct, indirect. They've each published a dozen papers on going

925
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:26,520
back and forth, which predominates. This mechanism would explain, I believe, all of those findings.

926
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:31,880
And then I just want to now show you how I view the dysregulation and diabetes. So now,

927
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:37,880
typically on the background of obesity, which is what happens in most of our diabetics,

928
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:44,680
so you have lean individuals who also have this, you have expanded fat stores in the periphery,

929
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:50,120
but now you have insulin resistance in the fat. So insulin can't put the brake on like

930
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:54,760
polycystin. We can talk about that mechanism, which we're now working on, but it's going to be very

931
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:59,560
similar in terms of liver and muscle. But you also have this component of inflammation.

932
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:05,400
This has been described by many, many individuals. You get crown-like structures, macrophages,

933
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:12,440
move in, they release TNF alpha IL-6. And what we were able to discern, a lot of people would argue,

934
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:16,840
it was inflammation. If you go back to the insulin resistance literature 10, 20 years ago,

935
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:26,040
everyone was discussing inflammation, circulating cytokines, TNF alpha IL-6 resistant, RVP circulating

936
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:31,880
factors that were released from inflammation driving insulin resistance. What we found is,

937
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,800
again, you can dissociate inflammation from insulin resistance. That's what I spent the

938
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:41,560
first three decades of my life doing, showing that just ectopic lipid dags would drive insulin

939
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:47,400
resistance, independent of inflammation. But the transition from just insulin resistance

940
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:54,040
in liver and muscle to fasting hyperglycemia depends on inflammation. And it's through this

941
01:33:54,040 --> 01:34:02,040
mechanism where now you have localized inflammation in the fat cell. TNF alpha IL-6,

942
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:07,240
I'm sure there's other things, will promote increased lipolysis in the fat cell.

943
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:16,600
More lipolysis, more fatty acid, delivery to liver, dags go up, epsilon gets activated. You block

944
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:22,280
insulin action, so you have less glucose being taken up into glycogen. This is what happens in

945
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:28,200
virtually most patients with fatty liver disease. But again, what takes you to fasting

946
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:36,040
hyperglycemia is this, and that's where acetyl-CoA goes up. And again, now your rates of lipolysis,

947
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:41,080
when you measure turnover, not just fatty acid concentrations, but turnover, palmitate,

948
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:47,720
turnover production and glycerol turnover, it's up twofold. This increases acetyl-CoA concentrations

949
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:55,080
twofold. This activates pyruvicovoxalase activity and flux twofold. And then in addition,

950
01:34:55,080 --> 01:35:01,480
your glycerol delivery to liver is up twofold. And now your rates of gluconeogenesis are increased

951
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:07,720
twofold. And this is now what's driving fasting hyperglycemia in every poorly controlled type

952
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:13,320
two diabetes. It's this gluconeogenic process that we've shown using many, many methods,

953
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:20,440
and others have shown this too. This is what now is driving hyperglycemia in type two diabetics.

954
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:27,240
Okay. I have several questions, Jerry. First, these adipocytes that are undergoing lipolysis,

955
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,640
these are peripheral adipocytes, is that correct?

956
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:35,560
Yes. You can have situations where even fat in the liver is probably contributing to this,

957
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:41,000
especially in the lipodistrophic individual, it has no peripheral fat cells. So under conditions,

958
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:46,040
the liver fat is playing a role, but most of it in most of, you know, I would say garden

959
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,160
bright when I see it, it's going to be peripheral lipolysis.

960
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:58,360
So when we think about an insulin resistant, obese person with metabolic syndrome, so this is

961
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:04,760
what, 20% of the US population, maybe even more. We've clearly established they are insulin resistant

962
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:09,160
in the muscle. We've established that they are insulin resistant in the hepatocyte.

963
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:15,080
They are obese. So would we still say they are insulin resistant at the fat cell or would we

964
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:20,360
say they are insulin sensitive at the fat cell because they are correctly undergoing

965
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:25,960
lipogenesis in the fat cell? They're at least taking up a esterified fat and they're presumably

966
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:31,320
impairing lipolysis, which is why they retain adipose cell mass. In other words, there's a,

967
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:35,560
the flux through the fat cell is negative. They're holding onto fat, correct?

968
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:41,160
Yeah. But I think, and this is a question, a very important question we're going to next.

969
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:46,440
I would still predict if you do careful studies of measuring rates of lipolysis,

970
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:53,720
by definition, they will have insulin resistance in the fat cell. And that's because the reason

971
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,800
they're doing everything you just said, they're holding onto fat, they're not happy about it,

972
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:02,840
the doctor's not happy about it, is because it's at hyperinsulinemia. So their insulin

973
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:08,120
concentrations are two to three fold. So again, their curve is right shifted. Insulin is doing

974
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:13,160
the thing, but if you brought them down to normal levels of insulin, then you might see more lipolysis,

975
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,240
not a thing. So I think if you were to do those studies and they've been done, there is peripheral

976
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:23,800
insulin resistance, but then you superimpose in addition, and I'll just say, I'll share with your

977
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:29,400
listeners, we're finding actually the same mechanism that we have in liver and muscle.

978
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:34,280
And we're seeing this in many other tissues too, in the fat cell, the diacylglycerol epsilon pathway

979
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:40,920
is also accounting for this defect in insulin action in the fat cell. So it's going to actually

980
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:46,360
be a common mediator. And again, most of the fat, of course, in the fat cells in the lipid droplet.

981
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:52,680
So again, the plasma membrane, diacylglycerols that lead to epsilon activation in the membrane

982
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:58,200
of the fat cells. And we're seeing the same thing. And we see those same mice that I showed you before,

983
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:03,160
the IRC nockemites are protected from lipid induced fat insulin resistance.

984
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:10,120
On the fat topic, we've talked a lot about the intra myocellular lipid. You've distinguished

985
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:17,240
it from say, marbling or fat between cells. One thing we haven't spoken about that clinically gets

986
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:23,640
a lot of attention is visceral fat. So you alluded to doing an MRI. So we do a T1 weighted image of

987
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,600
a person in an MRI gives us a beautiful resolution anatomically of what's happening.

988
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,840
And you can see the difference between a healthy person and an unhealthy person. And one of the

989
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:40,280
most glaring differences between people on that type of proton imaging is the amount of fat

990
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:47,560
that is inside the fascia. So you have subcutaneous fat that may not be aesthetically pleasing.

991
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:52,920
But more importantly, when you go inside the corset of fascia, you have some people that will

992
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,880
have a heavy ring of fat around their kidneys, their spleen, their liver. We call this visceral

993
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:03,720
fat and the association between this amount of visceral fat and poor health is very well

994
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:08,680
understood. Whereas there seems to be very little association between subcutaneous fat

995
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:15,640
and poor health. How does that visceral fat identification square with the intra lipid

996
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:19,720
myocellular component that you've described so elegantly at a cellular level?

997
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:25,400
In my view, and everything you said is correct, subq, if you're going to store fat somewhere,

998
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,560
that's the best place to store it. You certainly don't want to keep it inside

999
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:35,240
liver and muscle cells. In my view, and again, studies have been done to look at the visceral

1000
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:40,600
fat and it's very clear. It is again, a very apple shaped people have visceral fats, a very

1001
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:47,640
good predictor of insulin resistance. It's really more of a marker for intrapatic fat. So anytime

1002
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:52,280
when you're doing your imaging, if you just look at the liver too, they're going to correlate

1003
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:58,760
one to one 99 out of a hundred times. So what you're really doing there is a marker. Now it's

1004
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:04,440
the visceral fat will also pour fatty acids into the portal vein, presumably. And again,

1005
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:10,200
fatty acids, liver portal veins, probably going to lead to increase the acetyl CoA. Again, we'll

1006
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:16,920
contribute some degree to me. The major abnormality is really the fat inside the path. More poorly,

1007
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:23,800
the acetyl CoA within the hepatocyte. I want to give one example that makes this point clearly,

1008
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:28,680
at least to me, the lesson I learned and that's lipodystrophy. And as you know,

1009
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:35,720
that's a situation where there is no fat, no subq fat or visceral fat. These patients

1010
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:42,120
have no visceral fat, huge livers, hepatomegaly, chock full of fat and liver. And again, diabetes

1011
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:47,320
through these mechanisms, acetyl CoA driving gluconeogenesis. And that's independent of this

1012
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:52,360
real fat. So that shows you, you don't need the visceral fat at all to drive this. It's fat in

1013
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:59,800
the hepatocyte. If I depict two molecules that are driving metabolic disease, it's acetyl CoA

1014
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:06,280
driving pervert cobalys. And again, the diisoblisterols activating Epsilon. And again,

1015
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:12,840
it's the Epsilon that drives insulin resistance, no diabetes, no hyperglycemia. Then it's this

1016
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:18,920
accelerated gluconeogenesis through this mechanism that's taking you from just pure insulin resistance

1017
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:24,200
to fastened hyperglycemia and diabetes. So let's again pause there for a moment and unpack

1018
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:32,440
something very profound. If we've just established that the accumulation of liver fat is effectively

1019
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:39,160
the hallmark of death to come. And you just said, acetyl CoA and DAGs are two of the biggest

1020
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:45,800
culprits. Well, acetyl CoA of course, is abundance of nutrient on some level, which speaks to

1021
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:51,720
something you said earlier, you take a patient with type two diabetes, put them on 1200 calories

1022
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:57,880
a day. By definition, that has to lower acetyl CoA that immediately is going to improve things,

1023
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:02,360
which it does, whether that's sustainable indefinitely, we can discuss. And of course,

1024
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:07,000
we've already established where these DAGs are coming from. Again, I want to pause for a moment

1025
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,560
on that, because I think a listener of this right now is going to say, guys, you've lost me, okay,

1026
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:17,880
they don't know the difference between Pepsi K, GSK, three, AKT to PI three kinase. I don't think

1027
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:23,720
you have to know those things. I think what you have to understand is that abundance of nutrient

1028
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:29,960
is a relative term. It's not an absolute term. An athlete versus a sedentary person has a very

1029
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:34,760
different amount of what that abundance looks like. I think we've also discussed that not all

1030
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:40,360
nutrients are created equal. You've alluded to it already that sucrose and fructose disproportionately

1031
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:45,720
prime the liver for this. And then of course, we're dealing with carbohydrate metabolism.

1032
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:52,840
This is perhaps an interesting time to also start talking about both the modifications that we can

1033
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:57,480
make. Because again, when we start to think about, you've talked about Western diet and sedentary

1034
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:03,560
behavior a lot. So there's no doubt that there is an our environmental triggers contributing to these

1035
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:09,480
epidemics, which largely began here in the United States, but we have fabulously spread to the West

1036
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:14,760
of the world. And then of course, there's a whole pharmacologic side of this, I would like to revisit

1037
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:19,400
the metformin question. I think it's a very interesting question. Metformin works presumably

1038
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:25,240
by sort of weakly poisoning the mitochondria at complex one that would lead to a redox change

1039
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,440
of NAD and NADH, which goes back to something you talked about. But as of this time, at least we

1040
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:36,200
don't really have many exciting compounds in the pipeline for naphyl D, which as you also alluded

1041
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:43,240
to in about 10 years is going to through NASH and cirrhosis be the leading indication for liver

1042
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:47,400
transplant in the United States. Something that when I was in medical school accounted for less

1043
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:54,040
than 2% of liver transplants just 20 years ago in 30 years, admittedly with the advent of a cure

1044
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:59,960
for hep C, it's now leapfrogged into the lead candidate for liver transplant. And yet what are

1045
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:04,600
we doing for it? Not a lot. That's a lot I want to unpack. And as much as you still have time to

1046
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:10,120
discuss it, let's proceed in any order you see fit. To add on to that, I just did a Zoom conference for

1047
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:14,840
University of Pittsburgh and they're a big liver center. And one of their big problems with

1048
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:21,160
transplanting livers is living donors. They're limited by donors because they all have fatty

1049
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:26,040
liver, which they will not transplant because they don't do well. So not only is it the problem in

1050
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:30,040
treating it in terms of at least this most commonly, that's the most common thing that they do, but

1051
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:36,360
that's an aside. So what can we do about this? If we can get our patients to lose weight, this of

1052
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:41,400
course is the best diet and exercise, of course is the best thing. And that's the first thing

1053
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:47,160
I tell my patient. We really drill into them how we can really fix everything that's wrong with

1054
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:51,960
them through this process. And unfortunately, as you know, and I know it just doesn't work in the

1055
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:58,360
vast majority of our patients. So in terms of pharmacology, my view and here again, it's the

1056
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:04,520
liver. If I had to pick one organ to target, it's the liver. As important as muscle insulin resistance

1057
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:09,160
is at the very beginning, if we actually want to reverse the disease and make the biggest impact,

1058
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:14,760
if I had to pick one or it's the liver, if you're going to target probably the easiest organ to

1059
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:22,440
target. The way I think about the liver is in terms of thermodynamics. It's a thermodynamic

1060
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:28,120
problem. It goes back to my physics training and it's really energy in and energy out. The whole

1061
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:34,920
metabolic problem with the liver is this imbalance of energy. Too much energy in relative to the

1062
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:42,280
ability of the hepatocyte, the liver to oxidize the energy and convert it to CO2 or export it.

1063
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:48,280
The one thing the liver is also able to do is export energy as a form of the LDL triglyceride.

1064
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:53,320
If it's energy, how do we fix it? Well, one way, again, we said diet and exercise limit energy in,

1065
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:57,880
that works. And that we talked about, Kit Peterson did this 20 years ago and it's shown many,

1066
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:03,560
many times. To get the patient to stay on this is challenging. Bariatric surgery works, again,

1067
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:08,520
limiting energy in. We just saw a nice study in the New England Journal. There's no magic

1068
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:13,720
to ruin why. It's simply if you pair of feet, individuals lose same amount of weight, same

1069
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:18,360
effect. Everything the bariatric surgery is doing, at least ruin why, is really through

1070
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:24,360
reducing through the weight loss. How can we do this pharmacologically? Well, GLP-1 agonists are

1071
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:30,840
out there now. They're becoming very popular. Their major effect is energy intake. Our patients

1072
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:37,240
eat less because they eat less, they lose weight, induces nausea, mild nausea. Some people get into

1073
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:42,280
issues with vomiting, nausea, mommy have to cut back on the dose. But this is how the GLP-1 agonists,

1074
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:47,640
I believe, are having its major effect is weight loss. And they are what they are. They do accomplish

1075
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:52,120
reversal fatty liver to some degree. They don't normalize, but it does come down in the right

1076
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:58,440
direction. Why do you think the GLP-1 agonists lead to reduced appetite? I just think through

1077
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:04,920
working through a central mechanism, all these gut peptides lead to nausea, vomiting, glucagon,

1078
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:09,800
will do its amount of statin, will do all these things. If you give them a high enough concentrations,

1079
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:16,440
lead to some degree of nausea and vomiting. To me, it's part of the spectrum. And if you just get

1080
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:21,480
it right, you just get people less interested in food and they eat less. Metformin, that's the one

1081
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:27,240
agent we have that lowers gluconegist. I would just come back. It's not complex one. I want to

1082
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:32,200
challenge you on that. We can talk about that. But to me, it's complex one inhibition happens

1083
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:37,160
at millimolar concentrations, clinically not relevant. Our concentrations of metformin in

1084
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:44,040
humans, metformin are about 50 micromolar, 40 to 50 micromolar, not millimolar, which is what inhibits

1085
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:49,080
complex one. I think it's downstream. It does affect the mitochondria, does lead to the redox,

1086
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:53,880
but it's not through the complex one. It's probably indirectly inhibiting mitochondrial

1087
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:58,440
glycerophosphate, the hydrogenase. That's what leads to the redox. But we can come back to that

1088
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:04,680
if you want. I'd love to. That's very interesting. To focus then on other mechanisms, so GLP1,

1089
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:12,680
limit food intake, energy expenditure, SGLT2 inhibitors cause glucose loss in the urine,

1090
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:18,120
400 calories a day loss. So they lose weight. Unfortunately, it seems to plateau after

1091
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:23,960
several weeks and you get very mild reductions in liver fat. Unfortunately, not as much,

1092
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:28,360
but maybe in combination with other things that might be certainly helping the right direction.

1093
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:33,880
My favorite target is to promote mitochondrial inefficiency. And so one of the things we're

1094
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:39,640
working on now is to mitochondria is where you burn the fat. That's the organelle that

1095
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:45,000
burns the fat through oxidation. If you can promote, then the mitochondria be a little bit

1096
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,240
less efficient so they have to burn more fat to generate the same amount of ATP. This we've shown

1097
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:57,160
in various forms, preclinical models, mice rats with fatty liver and NASH liver fibrosis. It

1098
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:03,000
reverses fatty liver through these mechanisms, reverses NASH, reverses the insulin resistance

1099
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,840
through reductions in diaxis, acetyl-CoA, reverses diabetes and ZDF models. For the NASH world,

1100
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:14,520
it reverses the inflammation and will reverse liver fibrosis. And so I'm very excited about

1101
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:19,800
this because I think it can be done safely. More recently, we've done this in non-human primates

1102
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:26,360
and showed safety and efficacy of this approach in non-human primates. So based on the mechanisms

1103
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:33,320
I've described, I think it fits. And not only what I'm very gratified by is it actually reinforces

1104
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:38,680
the mechanisms I've described here by reversing diabetes, insulin resistance by Lauren Daggs and

1105
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:43,640
acetyl-CoA, but it's also going to be heart healthy. And I want to emphasize this point because

1106
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:50,760
many drugs we have now for naphthal and NASH reduce liver fat, maybe reverse the fibrosis or

1107
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:56,120
slow down the fibrosis, but they may lead to alterations of cholesterol in the wrong

1108
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:01,240
direction. Cholesterol goes up. And again, I have to come back to a nice point you made is

1109
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:06,040
it's heart disease that is killing not only our diabetic, but also fatty liver patients.

1110
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:12,360
It's the heart disease. So whatever we're doing to reverse fixed naphthal, NASH, liver fibrosis,

1111
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:17,480
it has to be heart healthy. And so when you burn fat in liver through this mechanism,

1112
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:24,600
you decrease VLDL export, you lower triglycerides, you raise HDL, and you actually have secondary

1113
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:29,960
beneficial effects on the periphery. So you actually will secondarily improve muscle fat,

1114
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:35,800
reduce muscle fat, muscle insulin resistance. So this again fits into my conceptual view of insulin

1115
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:40,680
resistance and would be I think a nice therapeutic approach that we're going after.

1116
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:47,800
Now does the uncoupling lead to excess Ross creation or anything else? Anytime I hear of

1117
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:53,080
uncoupling in the mitochondria, which is a deliberately induced form of inefficiency,

1118
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:56,680
you wonder, is this an unintended consequence potentially?

1119
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,320
So uncoupling by definition, the biophysics of uncoupling, the energy has to go somewhere.

1120
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:06,520
It's dissipated as heat. You're burning more fat, changes in the energy is going to lead to a

1121
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:11,640
little bit of heat production. You will get energy production in the form of heat,

1122
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:16,120
but because it's liver targeted has no effect on body temperature, will not affect whole body

1123
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:20,680
weight. It's interesting, I can just tell the story of uncouplers. Your listeners might be

1124
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:27,320
interested in this. So they were first discovered actually in the early 1900s in the munitions

1125
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:33,480
factories. Europe was getting ready. They knew a world war was coming. The munition factories

1126
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:39,320
were all getting geared up. Some of the workers in the munition factories were getting this dust,

1127
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:45,400
yellow dust on their hands and actually losing weight. They were just going home and despite

1128
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,560
eating the usual amount, they're finding their weight was going down and maybe they were sweating

1129
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:54,360
a little bit more, a little diaphoresis. And they went to their doctors and told them about the

1130
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:59,240
weight loss despite eating the same and it's a little bit more diaphoresis, more sweating.

1131
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:03,880
And the doctors just said, what is this yellow dust on your skin? And why don't you just wear

1132
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:09,880
gloves, wash your hands and wear gloves? And they got better. This was dinitrophenol. This was a

1133
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:16,760
substance that was used in the munition factories to make TNT. So dinitro TNT. A physician,

1134
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:23,960
tainter in the 1930s basically said, maybe this is good for weight loss. Actually introduced

1135
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:31,080
dinitrophenol as a weight loss drug. It was available over the counter. It wasn't a prescription.

1136
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:37,560
So anyone could go like buying vitamins, get some BNP for weight loss. It actually worked.

1137
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:43,080
So a lot of people, hundreds of thousands of people took dinitrophenol for weight loss.

1138
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:47,960
And it worked. The paper is published in very good journals. JAMA by tainter and others really

1139
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:53,800
describe its beneficial effects. Unfortunately, and a very big unfortunately is again, one of the

1140
01:52:54,520 --> 01:53:00,040
on-target effects we just talked about when you uncouple, you promote heat generation. And this

1141
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:05,640
is in the whole body. DNP is going everywhere and promoting heat generation. Unfortunately,

1142
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:10,440
a handful of these people took too much. They got into problems with hypothermia, increased body

1143
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:16,520
temperature and got very sick from that. And some died with the very first thing, a newly created

1144
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:24,920
FDA 1937. The first act they did was actually to pull DNP from the counters as an over the counter

1145
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:30,600
kind of drug or medication. And the second act they had actually was thalidomide, which they

1146
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:35,720
pulled and now is actually back in the clinic. That was always the problem with DNP. Why again,

1147
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:42,040
we say this is not a good thing. This is a toxic drug and everything else. And as it is, it occurred

1148
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:48,200
to us that the reason it's generating the heat is you're on coupling all the organs in the body.

1149
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:53,400
And what if we just picked one organ, i.e. the liver where the fat is accumulating. This is where

1150
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:59,720
the organ that's driving lipidemia, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. And if we could just melt the fat

1151
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:05,480
away within a liver specific manner, maybe we can have that beneficial effect without the toxicity

1152
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:12,520
and so in a series of studies, we were able to show proof of concept that by simply uncoupling

1153
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:18,520
the liver, you could avoid hyperthermia and all the toxicities that have typically been associated

1154
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:24,920
with the parent compound, DNP, and increase the therapeutic window. Every drug has a therapeutic

1155
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:30,200
window, even aspirin and Tylenol by a hundred fold. Based on this thinking, I think it can be

1156
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:35,560
done very safely and be a treatment for very important metabolic diseases like naphthal and

1157
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:41,960
nash. So the IND has already been filed for this. Is it in phase one human yet? No, no, we're still

1158
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:47,960
exploring preclinical models, thinking potentially about first starting out where there are no

1159
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:54,120
indications for things like lipodystrophy where leptin is not working. So I think my thinking is

1160
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:58,760
I like to go slowly here, hopefully within the next year or two, we may be in humans. I think

1161
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:04,440
initially going after orphan diseases where there simply is no other treatment and that would be

1162
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:10,520
certain forms of lipodystrophy where they get very bad diabetes, naphthal, nash, and especially in

1163
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:14,920
conditions where leptin is not working. Jerry, this has been obviously, as I said, a pretty

1164
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:20,760
technical discussion even by the standards of our podcast. I think the show notes are going to be

1165
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:26,040
integral because your figures, I think frankly, are very helpful. As I said, I understand this

1166
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:30,520
content probably better than most and yet I still find it very helpful to be able to kind of go

1167
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:36,360
through schematics. So I'm going to encourage the listeners to do that. You also have some fantastic

1168
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:41,480
lectures online. I think for the people who really want to go deep into this stuff, I think frankly,

1169
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:45,720
some of your review articles and some of your recent publications are just a great place to go.

1170
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:53,640
As I said at the outset, I just think that this is the nexus from which all diseases stand and

1171
01:55:53,640 --> 01:56:00,760
therefore we are really making a mistake if we want to treat chronic diseases in their silos and

1172
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:05,160
just think about atherosclerosis and just think about cancer and just think about Alzheimer's

1173
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:11,640
disease without understanding how these diseases are fed. And unfortunately, that means rolling up

1174
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:16,680
our sleeves and understanding insulin resistance. There's simply no getting around this. If this

1175
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:22,120
topic were easy, you would have presented it in an easier manner. It's not easy. If I were to just

1176
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:26,280
kind of leave you with sort of, we've talked about exercise, we've talked about nutrition,

1177
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:34,600
do you feel strongly about any form of dietary thinking? So for example, I have found clinically

1178
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:41,320
that carbohydrate restriction is a very effective way for patients with insulin resistance to lose

1179
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:48,280
weight, not uniformly, but it's quite effective. It also seems to be easier to adhere to than outright

1180
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:55,000
caloric restriction, though periodic fasting also seems to do a good job. But have you observed

1181
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:01,320
anything similarly from a clinical perspective that fructose restriction specifically or sugar

1182
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:10,440
restriction specifically as a vehicle to weight loss becomes a more effective tool to ultimately

1183
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:16,200
produce what's understood to be efficacious, just some reduction of weight, either as the cause or

1184
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:21,880
effect of the improvement? My thinking here is what I tell my patients is whatever works to everyone

1185
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:27,800
that's so different, different likes, different dislikes. I say look at the scale, whatever works

1186
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:32,920
for you to lose weight, because I know if you lose the weight, your diabetes is going to get better.

1187
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:39,480
So I say you find something, whatever works for you, stick with it. That's the challenge because

1188
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:45,000
we're very successful in the short term getting patients to lose weight. The unfortunate part is

1189
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,400
they're able to get the weight off and then three months later, six months later, they come back to

1190
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:54,040
the office and they're right back where they started. So it's a matter of I tell them you have

1191
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:58,680
to find something that works for you, get the weight off, but then you have to be able to stick to it.

1192
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:02,760
And that's where the challenge, a lot of diets, people are able to get on and get the weight off

1193
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:08,120
and they just can't adhere to it for the long term. And so it's a marathon. You have to find something

1194
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:12,680
you like, like it enough to be able to stick with that. That's the most important thing because

1195
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:17,560
we've all seen that where people lose the weight and then a few weeks, months later,

1196
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:21,240
right back to where they started. So everyone has to find what works for them.

1197
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:27,080
I guess I want to come back to the metformin thing because it's so interesting. So you mentioned that

1198
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:36,920
the inhibition of complex one actually is probably not taking place because you actually mentioned

1199
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:41,640
basically a thousand fold difference in concentration. Say a little bit more about that and

1200
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:49,320
why you're then imputing that it's the impact of metformin presumably on NAD and NADH, which

1201
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:53,800
you could also get out of an inhibition of complex one, but via some other mechanism, it sounds like.

1202
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:59,320
Studies that we've done and we're still working on this, clearly most the literature, if you read

1203
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:06,280
on metformin, let's talk about the big picture. So metformin lowers glucose in patients with poorly

1204
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:12,040
controlled diabetes, mostly through inhibition of gluconeogenesis. I think most clinical

1205
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:17,560
physiologists would agree with that. And so we've done studies quantifying gluconeogenesis, both by

1206
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:23,320
NMR, heavy water, multiple methods, same individuals. And that's its major effect,

1207
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:28,280
not through inhibition of glycogenolysis, not through gut biome, its gluconeogenesis.

1208
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:34,200
And the other thing clinically is the more poorly controlled diabetes, the greater the effect. You're

1209
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:38,520
not going to see much effect. There's very confusing studies that have been published in

1210
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:42,200
non-diabetic individuals that find all kinds of other things going on. I don't think that's

1211
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:46,600
clinically relevant. It's gluconeogenesis. So then how does it do gluconeogenesis? So

1212
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:52,520
most the literature, if you read it, virtually all the animals that study mechanism have implicated

1213
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:59,640
complex one. And we've known about guanide inhibition. Metformin is a guanide by guanide,

1214
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:05,240
even before metformin, we had fenformin and other guanides that have been studied. And they will

1215
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:10,920
inhibit complex one, no doubt about it. So, and most have focused on complex one inhibition,

1216
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:19,320
leading to either AMPK activation or buildup of a metabolite that inhibits gluconeogenesis,

1217
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:24,840
or something 99% of the mechanisms have talked about complex one inhibition.

1218
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:32,200
My issue with that is again, not very many studies have done careful measurements of this

1219
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:38,760
most commonly used drug on the planet. For your readership, guanides have been used for diabetes

1220
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:45,000
for hundreds of years. The French lilac extracts have been used 300 years ago, been description.

1221
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,040
They didn't know what diabetes was at that time. It wasn't defined, but patients with polyuria,

1222
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:55,880
polydipsia were overweight, treated with the extract, the French lilac, and their symptoms

1223
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:00,280
improved. Most studies, if you look at, were used at millimolar concentrations. And again,

1224
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:06,680
when they look at complex one inhibition, which has been implicated to then lower ATP, raise ADP,

1225
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:12,920
and activate AMPK, it requires millimolar concentrations. And so when you actually measure

1226
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:19,320
metformin in the patient who's taking one gram twice a day, which is your maximal dose, when

1227
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:25,800
pretty much the best efficacious dose, your levels in plasma are about 30 to 50 micromolar.

1228
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:29,640
So you could say even, you know, in portal vein, its pills are taken orally,

1229
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:34,200
give it two to three times that you're still talking about maybe a hundred micromolar,

1230
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:39,480
10 fold less than what all of these studies have been doing, even both the in vitro studies and the

1231
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:45,560
literature and well, the in vivo studies, giving levels that achieve millimolar concentrations.

1232
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:50,440
So yes, you see things, complex one's an important, it's an electron transporter,

1233
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:55,080
it's important for function and health. And you're going to see effects when you inhibit complex one

1234
02:01:55,080 --> 02:02:00,920
at those high concentrations. In my view, they're not clinically relevant. So the effects that I do

1235
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:07,720
think are clinically relevant that we have observed at 50 and a hundred micromolar of metformin

1236
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:13,320
are really on the enzyme glycerol three phosphate dehydrogenase, the mitochondrial isiform

1237
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:20,360
that is required to move the protons from outside to inside the mitochondria. And when you inhibit

1238
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:27,160
this enzyme, NADH goes up, NAD goes down. When you have this increase in the cytosolic redox,

1239
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:35,000
you can't get lactate to pyruvate and you can't get glycerol to DHAP. So if I'm right,

1240
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:40,520
it's going to be substrate dependent inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Whereas if you inhibit complex

1241
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:46,120
one and AMPK or whatever mechanism downstream, it should be gluconeogenesis independent of

1242
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:52,600
substrate. And what we've shown both in vitro and in vivo, most importantly in vivo in two or three

1243
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:59,560
different models metformin at these clinically relevant doses and concentrations only inhibit

1244
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:07,080
gluconeogenesis from glycerol and lactate. It doesn't inhibit it from alanine or DHAP

1245
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:14,360
or anything that does not depend on the cytosolic redox state. This also explains why we rarely see

1246
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:19,960
clinically hypoglycemia on patients treated with metformin because there's these alternative

1247
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:25,640
gluconeogenic substrates that can come in alanine can keep coming out. So you never see rarely,

1248
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:31,080
unless they have another agent on top of metformin like insulin or SU, you rarely see it if ever.

1249
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:37,800
And that's why also you see the lactic acidosis, which is a fortunate toxicity of metformin where

1250
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:41,880
again, it's specifically getting that lactate to pyruvate conversion, which is dependent on

1251
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:47,560
the redox state. So that's the mechanism I believe is clinically relevant. And now the last step is

1252
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:51,880
how is it inhibiting this enzyme? And I believe it's actually through an indirect effect on this

1253
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:58,280
enzyme that we'll hopefully have ready for prime time in the year. And do you think that in a

1254
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:04,600
healthy individual who's eating well, is abnormal weight, is insulin sensitive and is exercising

1255
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:13,400
robustly, metformin could actually be counteractive to benefit? That's a profound question. I don't

1256
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:18,040
know the answer to that. And it gets into, I don't know if you're going to take me there in terms of

1257
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:23,400
the use of metformin for aging. Healthy people are taking it for aging now. I think that's why

1258
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:28,600
it's so important to understand this mechanism, then understand the implications of it. It is

1259
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:34,360
redox. Is that a good thing or not for longevity and health? That's a question that remains to be

1260
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:40,360
answered. I find myself very much on the fence with that question while in the insulin resistant

1261
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:47,000
patient, even without diabetes, feeling that this is a very net positive agent. But my personal views

1262
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,760
on it just based on clinical observation is that in the person I described earlier, the lean insulin

1263
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:59,960
sensitive, vigorously exercising individual, it may actually not provide benefit. But again,

1264
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:04,440
there are studies in the works that are going to hopefully be able to provide some fidelity to

1265
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:08,600
understanding that. It sounds like you're equally kind of undecided on that as well.

1266
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:09,240
Yes.

1267
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:13,240
Well, Jerry, I can't thank you enough. Again, I say this to many people I interview, but I really

1268
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:16,760
mean it here. It's not just for this discussion and the time you put into it, but obviously much

1269
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:22,600
more importantly for the career and for this incredible body of work that you've amassed

1270
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:28,840
through your pursuit and obviously remarkable collaborations with so many people. I've enjoyed

1271
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:33,240
this discussion immensely. It's actually one of the discussions I'm going to have to probably go

1272
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:38,520
back and listen to again. So I hope that a listener isn't hearing this and isn't discouraged by the

1273
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:41,960
fact that you're at this point in the discussion and you're thinking, oh my God, I might have only

1274
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:47,000
retained half of that. That's okay. I'm going to be listening to this one and I just finished

1275
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,240
listening to it now and I'm going to listen to it again. So thank you very much, Jerry, for that.

1276
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:52,680
Thank you, Peter. It's been a pleasure.

1277
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:57,320
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1278
02:05:57,320 --> 02:06:01,720
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you

1279
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:07,160
more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure members get

1280
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:12,440
back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits include a

1281
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:18,040
bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic,

1282
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:23,160
paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show notes

1283
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:28,520
rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes

1284
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:34,280
completely. Access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having

1285
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:39,560
to listen to spiel's like this. The Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release

1286
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:44,040
every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

1287
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:49,320
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

1288
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:54,840
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

1289
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:59,480
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

1290
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:04,120
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits,

1291
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:10,360
