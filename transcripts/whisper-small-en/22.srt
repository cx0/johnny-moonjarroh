00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,920
Welcome everybody to episode three of the week of day spring.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,880
In this episode, we talk about reverse cholesterol transport.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,600
We talk about lipid transportation.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,880
We talk about apolipoproteins and we talk about CTEP inhibitors and HDL.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,800
Of all the things we talk about here, the thing that I think is the most interesting

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,280
is the discussion on HDL, which I think most people today would agree is far from being

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,880
understood and is probably far more complicated than LDL biology.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
I would say that of all of the things that Tom and I discussed over this seven hours,

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,420
I learned the most personally in our HDL discussion and our discussion of the CTEP inhibitors.

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,380
I was very familiar with all of the trials here, but Tom brought a level of nuance to

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,820
this that actually sharpened my understanding of this and for that I am of course eternally

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,820
grateful.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,880
So welcome to episode three.

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,700
Let's define now direct versus indirect RCT.

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,000
All right.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,660
So if we're talking about the cholesterol, it's in lipoproteins.

27
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,140
So at the end of the day, you have perfect cholesterol homeostasis.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,300
For some reason, there's some cholesterol excess in your body.

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,900
It's going to wind up in your artery wall or if you're lucky, it's going to wind up

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,980
in your stool.

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,420
That would be the preference way.

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,500
So the body clearly had nose.

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,940
Beyond a certain point, we don't want cholesterol.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,620
We've talked about that at a bit of length so far.

35
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,180
So now how can the body get rid of cholesterol that's already inside, is made by cells, the

36
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,180
motion of the joint.

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,420
And everybody thinks the liver makes most of the cholesterol.

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,820
We're not talking about the brain now.

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,820
That's separate.

40
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,020
Of your rest of your cholesterol in your body, the liver makes 20% of it.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,640
The rest is made in your peripheral cells.

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,380
So the bulk of your cholesterol that's in your body, if your peripheral cells are making

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,260
too much, it's got to get out or that cell will die.

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,740
So the cells through even beyond ABCA1 efflux that we've talked about, they can free diffuse

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
out of there.

46
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,740
ABC transported a compound cholesterol out and it gets in a lipoprotein or it binds to

47
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,120
albumin or binds to a red blood cell and it can be taken elsewhere.

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:06,700
So classically we were taught that, aha, the HDL particles are definitely a substrate that

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:14,620
a cell can efflux cholesterol out into, especially an empty HDL, APOA1, the protein itself, that's

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,460
unlipidated or a real baby HDL particle, very small HDL particle, is a great cholesterol

51
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,700
acceptor.

52
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,540
And we have membrane transporters that can give them free cholesterol.

53
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,860
All right.

54
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,500
So now the HDL has cholesterol and what were we taught?

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,260
Well, of course, the HDL just brings it right back to the liver and the liver then will,

56
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,940
if it has a need for cholesterol, it'll use it up and then it'll put it in your bile.

57
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,620
It'll go down and go right out your rear end.

58
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,260
Or your liver can actually change it to a bile cell, which it sends down the bile and

59
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,420
your bile cell could be excreted in the stool.

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,220
So in fact, that's a way, it's a major way of getting rid of cholesterol, but our ilium

61
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,220
doesn't cooperate.

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,740
Our ilium typically reabsorbs about 90 to 95% of the bile salts and reuses them.

63
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,500
So it's not the best way.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,700
Unless you can make sure that bile cell is being excreted and we have a drug, the bile

65
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,140
cell questions that make sure that happens, then you would deplete internal cholesterol.

66
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,120
So that's so simple.

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,960
So our VLDLs and LDLs and colomicrons bring cholesterol to the tissues.

68
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,980
And if for some reason there's too much cholesterol, the HDLs bring it back to the liver and it

69
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,620
goes bye-bye.

70
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,140
If you're talking to a second grader or physician at one point in our careers, that made great

71
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,140
sense.

72
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,140
That's plausible.

73
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,140
That's perfect.

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,420
That's why HDLs are not delivering cholesterol to the artery wall.

75
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,940
They're bringing it back to an organ that's going to get rid of it or use it properly.

76
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,940
Perfect.

77
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,640
And if the other, the VLDLs, kylos and LDLs are bringing cholesterol to the tissues,

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,020
they never colded that, but I would say, well, that's forward cholesterol transport.

79
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,060
And if the HDLs are bringing it back, that's reverse.

80
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,060
Perfect.

81
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,020
And if we have a great balance between forward and reverse cholesterol transport, that's

82
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,060
good cholesterol homeostasis.

83
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,500
You're not going to get in trouble.

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,340
And then we made the mistake of, aha, our metrics of these pathways are going to be

85
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,940
LDL cholesterol, maybe total cholesterol or HDL cholesterol.

86
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,460
And that's where the whole thing falls apart because those metrics have zero to do with

87
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,260
describing the complex flux and trafficking of all these pools of cholesterol or so.

88
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Zero.

89
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,860
There is no cholesterol measurement in the plasma that tells you anything about that

90
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,860
movement.

91
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,260
Are you in, are yourselves building up too much cholesterol or are they not?

92
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,540
Or God, you have great reverse cholesterol transport.

93
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,780
So it made such perfect sense and we were all stupid in medical school.

94
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,380
We're never going to contradict a professor or even give it two seconds worth of thought

95
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,020
if somebody told us something that the higher your HDL cholesterol, you got great reverse

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,700
cholesterol transport because that HDL is going to take it to the liver.

97
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,260
At a certain point in my studying of lipid understanding this stuff, and I knew, God,

98
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,060
what is it about not everybody with high HDL cholesterol is protected.

99
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,080
There are people with low HDL cholesterol who don't get disease.

100
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,780
But if what HDLs do is reverse cholesterol transport and they're bringing cholesterol

101
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,180
back to the liver, shouldn't your HDL cholesterol go down?

102
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,660
Why would HDL cholesterol go up if it was bringing it back to the liver and being internalized

103
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
or delipidated?

104
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,340
That made no sense to me.

105
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,180
So I knew there was more to the study.

106
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,900
And of course, guys like Dan Rader, who I alluded to before, and Brian Brewer and John

107
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,380
Chapman, our HDL experts in this world have figured this out pretty much by now.

108
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:55,020
So I know it's a, this lipid transportation system is way more complex than an HDL bringing

109
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
it back.

110
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,740
And in those, we give that a different name now.

111
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,820
So HDLs indeed are capable of bringing cholesterol back to the liver itself.

112
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,500
There is a receptor that will delipidated cholesterol S there from an HDL.

113
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,460
That's called the scavenger receptor B1 and SRB1.

114
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,060
There is a holoparticle receptor that can internalize large HDL particles and bring them into the

115
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,740
liver.

116
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,820
But free diffusion can also occur.

117
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:30,140
A big HDL can abut against a hepatocyte and cholesterol just diffuses from the HDL membrane

118
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,540
into the liver.

119
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,740
So there are at least three pathways of cholesterol getting back to the liver.

120
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,020
Hey, that same thing we now know happens at the intestine also.

121
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,300
So HDLs don't even have to go anywhere near the liver.

122
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,580
They can go get rid of some cholesterol at the intestine.

123
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,260
Remember that TICE pathway, Transintestinal Cholesterol Leaf Lux?

124
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,500
Right now we are boggled our minds and there are great papers on this.

125
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,260
Red blood cells carry way more cholesterol than deliproproteins.

126
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,940
They're so much bigger.

127
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,820
Now granted, the cholesterol is all in their surface, but they have a ton of cell membrane

128
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
surface.

129
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,180
So there's free cholesterol.

130
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,900
Albumin at least per albumin molecule can attach to 17 molecules of cholesterol.

131
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,580
So we now know to variable degrees both red blood cells and albumin can just abut against

132
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,740
any cell in your body and accept free cholesterol by free diffusion.

133
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,380
And LDL particle can abut against the cell and accept cholesterol by free diffusion from

134
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,700
a cell.

135
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,100
So now LDLs have another way of acquiring cholesterol.

136
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
It's interesting.

137
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,100
This would be a great question for someone like Josh Knowles who's such an expert on

138
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
FH.

139
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,900
Has anybody looked at red blood cell cholesterol membrane concentration or even size in FH

140
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
patients?

141
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Because one hypothesis would be they will, especially the FH patients who have FH as

142
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,020
a result of LDL receptor deficiencies in some sort, you'd think that there'd be more free

143
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,660
diffusion of cholesterol from their LDL into their red blood cell.

144
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Yeah.

145
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,060
And whether anybody's ever looked at that.

146
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,980
I mean, it might not be the case at all, but that would be a question.

147
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,260
Theoretically, free diffusion can occur between any two membrane surfaces.

148
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:17,020
So do their red blood cells, I would imagine at a certain degree it would cause red blood

149
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,020
cell irregularities.

150
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,940
Well, yeah, there might be too much noise, but you'd look at the MCV or something like

151
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,660
that and you'd say, have you increased or decreased the mean corpuscular volume of these

152
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
things?

153
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Is there anything happening?

154
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
I don't know.

155
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,940
You're changing certainly the membrane structure if that process is occurring in those people,

156
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,820
whether that would affect red blood cell functionality.

157
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,260
Remember when you start putting phytosterols into red blood cell membranes, you get hemolytic

158
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,900
anemias and stuff.

159
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
Cytostrolemia, phytosterolemia, that's part of their pathology because the red blood cells

160
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,860
looking for cholesterol to stay healthy, not phytosterols.

161
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,700
I didn't know that, so I didn't realize that that's one of the hallmarks.

162
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,140
It's part of the phenotypic picture of cytostrolemia, red blood cell hemolytic anemias, or crazy

163
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,780
red blood cell structure, spherocytes and things like that.

164
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,180
So it's one way that the early investigators will, this person has an only phytosol, what's

165
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,980
this red blood cell problem going on this person too?

166
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
So this is interesting.

167
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,140
The HDL story is one where the more time goes on, the less I know.

168
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,300
I mean, there are a few things in lipidology that humble me more than my complete and utter

169
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,300
buffoonery and ignorance when it comes to understanding high density lipoproteins.

170
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,260
It's true of all of us, and that's why I don't want you reading my 2002 lipid hall.

171
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
It's anonymous.

172
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
You're embarrassed.

173
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,140
Oh, God, I would criticize somebody with spout net stuff today.

175
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,780
So only if you read it with that in mind and you would see how things change.

176
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,980
Can we use a very specific example to explain this?

177
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,700
Let's talk about the first failed CTEP inhibitor trial, which was Pfizer's back in the mid-2000.

178
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,340
So let me give the background, and then I want you to explain why this may have failed.

179
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,260
Maybe I just want to explain a little more about the lipid transportation system.

180
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

181
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,340
So you know what CTEP is.

182
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,580
So remember I talked about the early on view with forward cholesterol transport, even though

183
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
they didn't call it.

184
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,300
That's the ApoB family bringing cholesterol to tissues and the HDL family bringing it

185
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,460
back.

186
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,020
And here's why that's just such an absurd theory.

187
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,060
Because when the intestine pumps out colomicrons that have a lot of your absorbed cholesterol

188
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,380
in it and your liver, certainly when it manufactures a VLDL particle whose primary purpose,

189
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,940
and everybody please listen to this, the VLDL has two purposes, one of which is not to deliver

190
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,740
cholesterol anywhere.

191
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,700
The liver is to develop transport triglycerides energy to cells that either store or utilize

192
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,300
any fatty acids for energy and to transport phospholipids.

193
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,820
All right, so that's what your VLDLs and colomicrons do.

194
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,820
So they're part of the forward cholesterol transportation system.

195
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,220
So the liver or the intestine excretes them and then they're floating around.

196
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,660
So what do they do?

197
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:14,260
They go to adipocytes or they go to muscle cells, their triglycerides are extracted,

198
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,720
and then their phospholipids break off and are utilized by cells.

199
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,240
So what are you left with when a chylomicron loses surface phospholipids and core triglycerides?

200
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,760
You're left with a smaller VLDL or a smaller chylomicron.

201
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,660
Any lipoprotein that goes from a bigger size to a smaller size, but it's still within the

202
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,280
density of a VLDL or chylomicron is called a remnant.

203
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
It's a smaller.

204
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,760
Hey, if Peter just amputated my right arm now, I'd be a remnant of my former self because

205
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,520
I'd have one less arm.

206
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,600
So the VLDLs and colos have lost their core triglycerides and they've lost their core

207
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,920
phospholipids and a few proteins have broken off too.

208
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,780
So now what happens to those remnant VLDLs and colos?

209
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:15,240
They're virtually instantly cleared by receptors that exist in the liver primarily.

210
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,200
How do those receptors clear these VLDL particles and these chylomicron particles that have

211
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,860
accomplished their mission and delivered triglycerides?

212
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,640
They bind to either the Apo-B100 that's on the VLDL, but LDL receptors won't bind to

213
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,680
Apo-B48 and the chylomicron, but they bind to Apo-E.

214
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,960
And chylos and VLDLs typically, if you're lucky, have multiple copies of VLDLs.

215
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,400
So as soon as the chylos or VLDLs deliver your energy, deliver your phospholipids,

216
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,840
they are cleared, which is why the chylomicron half-life is minutes and the VLDL half-life

217
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,800
is a couple of hours.

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Don't ever confuse half-life with plasma residence time.

219
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,120
That's a little bit longer, but that's only a few particles that are persisting beyond

220
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,680
those average half-life or so.

221
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,340
So now any of the VLDLs that are not totally cleared by the liver keep getting smaller.

222
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,820
They become smaller remnants, but then they change densities to a certain different degree

223
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
density range.

224
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,660
So you can't call it a VLDL anymore.

225
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,020
You call it an intermediate density lipoprotein.

226
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,300
The same thing, that's got a half-life of an hour.

227
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,320
That's also clear because IDLs have a lot of Apo-E on it.

228
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,260
But at the liver, as they're being cleared, there's another enzyme that transforms some

229
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,760
of your IDLs into a smaller.

230
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:47,560
It's an IDL remnant called, well, you'd be entering a new specific density boundary,

231
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,680
and it would be called the low-density lipoprotein.

232
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,640
So technically, you can say, yes, some VLDLs do become IDLs, do become LDLs, and in the

233
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,680
LDLs, we'll hang around forever until the LDL receptor clears in LDL by binding to Apo-B.

234
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,720
The reason Chylos, VLDLs, and IDLs get cleared so much more quickly than LDLs is the Apo-E

235
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,920
content, which is a mega ligand for the LDL receptor.

236
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,880
The LDL receptor is really an Apo-B, Apo-E receptor, and there are other Apo-E receptors,

237
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
too.

238
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,240
So that's why those particles don't last long.

239
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,760
And just to interrupt you for a sec, Apo-E greatly amplifies the efficacy of that ligand,

240
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
the Apo-B ligand?

241
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:38,600
It just is a preferred ligand for either an LDL receptor or other, they're called LDL

242
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,420
receptor-related receptors.

243
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,540
I'm sorry, I want to come right back to what you're saying, but I know I'll forget to ask,

244
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,060
what percentage of LDL particles also co-express Apo-E?

245
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Yeah, so if you are lucky enough to have that genetic gift, and your LDL happens to contain

246
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,820
an A-B, it's half-life is pretty much the same as an IDL.

247
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,900
They're gone.

248
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,820
So if they're gone, guess where they came and wind up?

249
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,180
You have enhanced clearance, your Apo-B, your LDL particle level will be much lower, and

250
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,780
you don't get heart disease.

251
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,940
And in average population, it's about 3 to 4%.

252
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,060
But I guarantee you, depending on genes you've inherited, some people probably have a lot

253
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,140
of Apo-E on their LDLs, and of course I would bet if they were studying genetic drugs, they

254
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,540
don't get heart disease, you know, because it's being cleared, all those particles.

255
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,060
And we'll talk about it later, there are other Apo proteins that can retard clearance of

256
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,460
VLDLs, IDLs, and even LDLs.

257
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,180
I'll just mention its name now, it's Apo-Liproprotein C3.

258
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,020
You got that on your particles, you're going to have seriously increased plasma residence

259
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,660
time of all those things, and LDL with Apo-C3 on it is intensely more atherogenic than in

260
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,820
LDL that only has Apo-B100 on it.

261
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,380
You once told me, this was probably a couple months ago, we were just shooting the breeze

262
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,980
one day by phone, and I remember you saying that if you could add one clinical assay to

263
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,580
the arsenal of lipidologists, it would be an Apo-C3 assay, is that still true?

264
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,460
It would be, because I think that's going to be the way we really are going to smartly

265
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,380
identify remnant lipoproteins that are the VLDLs that are potentially causing trouble.

266
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,820
Most VLDLs are not troublemakers, they're cleared rapidly, or the LDLs that are number

267
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,140
one in a list as to what's going in your arterial wall.

268
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:33,660
Apo-C3, as you know, Peter, is over expressing insulin resistance situations.

269
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,260
I have no doubt that one day that would be a cool test, unless maybe we can just measure

270
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,220
your genetic, the genes that give you Apo-C3.

271
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,580
Except that insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance impact it, which would suggest that

272
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,060
if you took two people with the same lipid profile at the lipoprotein level, but one

273
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,260
had higher Apo-C3 than the other, that person's at higher risk.

274
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,300
And I think we got enough data now, it shows that, and to show you, pharma believes that

275
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,660
there's a major ongoing now with an Apo-C3 inhibitor that's coming, because it'll be

276
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,580
the way to get rid of these extremely epigenic problems.

277
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Is this ISIS doing this?

278
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,980
Yeah, I believe so, yeah.

279
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,580
Oh, sorry, just for the listener.

280
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,780
ISIS, I'm not referring to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,500
This is ISIS, there's a pharma company, it's in San Diego, they're actually based out of

282
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,780
San Diego, because that's where Sam Tamekis is, but it is ISIS.

283
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,100
Yeah, it's one of these new...

284
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Yeah, and they're looking at oligonucleotide...

285
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Oligonucleotide, yeah, they're looking at oligosense.

286
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
...an anti-sense thing, so keep your fingers crossed.

287
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,220
So we should come back and talk about that, because the anti-C3 and the anti-sense oligonucleotide

288
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,060
against Apo-Lipoprotein little a, those are hugely interesting.

289
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,460
Yeah, they're going to probably be great therapeutic avenues for us if we need it.

290
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,900
So yeah, I think there will be utility for measuring this right now before a third party

291
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,300
payer is ever going to pay some lab for doing that, it's going to need a little more proof

292
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,340
than what we have so far and everything.

293
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,500
But back to our lipid transportation system, so please understand, and there are just too

294
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,460
many people out there who think every VLDL becomes an LDL, it's not even close.

295
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,700
And in fact, if you are not insulin resistant and you don't have a, however you define a

296
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,860
triglyceride issue, which I might define as a trig above 1.30 or so anyway, I think

297
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,260
40% of the ApoB particles coming out of your liver, they're not VLDLs, they're LDLs.

298
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,860
And the VLDLs that are coming out are not big, because they're not carrying extra triglycerides

299
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,300
because you don't have them.

300
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,220
They're just carrying some degree of cholesterol and a little bit of triglycerides to supply

301
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,580
the energy you really need.

302
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:44,460
And that's why if you are measuring some VLDL metric, big VLDLs occur only in triglyceride-rich

303
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,580
lipoprotein pathologies by far the most common of which is insulin resistance.

304
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,180
And clearly because that VLDL would come out, and I guarantee it's probably got ApoC3 on

305
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,940
it, it doesn't have a half-life of a few hours, its plasma residence time is much longer,

306
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,900
there is more conversion of that VLDL particle into LDL particles, which would be triglyceride-rich.

307
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,220
Through some transformation they become the small LDLs, which are even less rapidly cleared.

308
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,860
So your ApoB particle number, your LDL particle number goes through the roof.

309
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,460
Now yes, part of those ApoB are the remnants, but I've posted enough slides on Twitter right

310
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,500
now, I'm pretty sure it's in Peter's package here.

311
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,540
Even when you take these type 2 diabetics with severe insulin resistance, or insulin

312
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:38,900
resistance just proved by an insulin clamp study, their ApoB level, their particle levels

313
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,540
are going up, but the LDL particles go up astronomically, and the VLDL maybe doubles

314
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,740
or triples, it goes from 30 to 90, whereas the VLDL particles go from 1,000 to 3,000.

315
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,820
The LDL, yeah.

316
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
Yeah, yeah.

317
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
That's an important distinction.

318
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,020
So a lot of people will say when you're insulin resistant, all of that net difference is,

319
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,940
we see, because there's no disputing, the more insulin resistance you get, the more

320
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,700
discordant you get between your LDL-P and your LDL-C. And all things equal, the LDL-P

321
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,620
is just going up and up and up as you become more insulin resistant.

322
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,180
So people will say, it's all the VLDL.

323
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,260
Furthermore, they'll confuse a percentage increase that's relative with an absolute

324
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
increase.

325
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,180
So as you pointed out, if you're referring to the Garvey paper, I think, so in that paper,

326
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,060
you might see VLDL particle number, I'm making this up, so someone will see the numbers and

327
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,380
decide for themselves, but it might go from 30 to 60.

328
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
Yeah, or 150.

329
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
An animal per liter.

330
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,380
An animal per liter.

331
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,940
And you think, well, God, that's a much bigger relative increase.

332
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
And it is.

333
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,140
But if anybody's read our lengthy treaties on relative versus absolute risk, you cannot

334
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,300
evaluate a relative change without understanding its absolute change.

335
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,900
And so even though the relative change on the LDL-P is smaller, it's starting from such

336
00:21:52,900 --> 00:22:00,220
a high base that it might add 300 to 400 nanomole per liter, which might only be a 30 or 40%

337
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,580
increase, but that absolutely dominates the lion's share of the increase, not the extra

338
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,420
30 to 50 nanomole per liter you might get on the VLDL.

339
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,460
This is a really important point if you want to be a lipid geek.

340
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
It is.

341
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:19,820
And this is one reason why non-HDL cholesterol has become in vogue, because remember, non-HDL

342
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,460
cholesterol, we told you, you calculated by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol,

343
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:32,540
but you could really add directly measured LDL cholesterol to a VLDL cholesterol.

344
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,940
Your cholesterol is not in your HDL particles, theoretically, potentially, atherogenic cholesterol.

345
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,800
And hey, that's a free calculation, too.

346
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,900
So they use non-HDL cholesterol as a marker of remnants.

347
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,460
Okay.

348
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,980
And there's no doubt some of those VLDL particles would be remnants, but we'll get into this

349
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
later, I hope.

350
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,580
I'll make the case that a lot of those VLDL particles are not remnants and they're not

351
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
going into your heart.

352
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Yeah, it's funny.

353
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,660
I used to always sit a patient down, and the very first time we reviewed a blood test,

354
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,660
I would say, look, there's four things we're going to talk about from a lipid standpoint.

355
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,660
We got to know your LP little A. We have to know your LDL P. I'd like to know how many

356
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,260
of those are small, because it's a proxy for some other stuff, and I want to know your

357
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
VLDL remnant.

358
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,180
Well, I can't measure that, so I'm going to approximate it with VLDLC.

359
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,500
Well, I don't say that anymore, because I've come to realize...

360
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,380
That's a very crude, crude estimation that's almost useless.

361
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,900
I wouldn't call it useless, because...

362
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,060
I use the word almost in front of it.

363
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Yeah, okay, yeah.

364
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,380
And I'll get all my lipid colleagues real mad at me if I start saying that, because

365
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,140
I get into this in a lot of the papers.

366
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
And we still target.

367
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,140
I mean, I still say to patients, I want your VLDL cholesterol less than 15 milligrams per

368
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
deciliter.

369
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,940
And the odds are good in an insulin resistant patient.

370
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,900
You have other ways of knowing whose insulin resistance who's not.

371
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,780
If that marker is up, remnant lipoproteins are part of their pathology.

372
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,780
But the exact same therapy I'm going to give you to get rid of the real troublemaker, your

373
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,300
LDL particles, is going to get rid of the remnants too.

374
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:08,180
So at the end of the day, it's I got to normalize APOB, your LDL particle number, and there

375
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,940
is significant discordance.

376
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,540
Alan Snyderman has published it many times.

377
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:19,780
As good as non-HCl cholesterol, meaning better than LDL cholesterol, is a metric of APOB.

378
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,020
There's a lot of discordance between APOB, your LDL particle number, and non-HCl cholesterol.

379
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,060
So I understand it's a free calculation.

380
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,180
Please and people who you really are worried about or you think, Aris, you've got to use

381
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,700
particle numbers to make the proper clinical decisions.

382
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,940
This reminds me, I need an excuse to go to Montreal so I can interview Alan.

383
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,860
If you can get him on a podcast, I'll be your first listener.

384
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,460
Nothing comes out of his mouth that you don't want to write down.

385
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,740
If you don't make anything up.

386
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,740
Alan is sounds a special guy.

387
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,420
Alan is not afraid to call a spade a spade, so to speak.

388
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,060
He will just tell you.

389
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
And that's why I love him.

390
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,340
I don't mind Alan telling me I'm an idiot.

391
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
No time you're wrong.

392
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
I know here's the way it is.

393
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,220
Again, you learn some guys like that or not afraid to put you in your place.

394
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,260
Alan, if you're listening to this, why don't you come up with an excuse to come to New

395
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,260
York or San Diego?

396
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,580
And if I do have an excuse to come to Montreal, I will.

397
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,220
Let's get back to our lipid transportation system now.

398
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,380
So we have our theoretical forward delivering particles, the APOB particles, and I tell

399
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,820
you how they transform into one another, how they deliver their cholesterol.

400
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,100
By the way, no VLDL or IDL or Kylo is delivering cholesterol to your peripheral cells.

401
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
They don't need it.

402
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,780
They're making all they need.

403
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,820
So just restate that, please, for the courts transcript.

404
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,540
So tell me again what Kylo's are doing are not doing what you walked out of this.

405
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,580
I was in the room to do so when I was explaining what Kyle is in VLDL.

406
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,940
Tom just outed me.

407
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,020
I went to go take a leak a minute ago.

408
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,620
So I explicitly went over that the purpose, the functional purpose of Kylo microns in

409
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:06,620
VLDL is to deliver energy in a form of triglycerides, the adipocytes and myocytes and phospholipids

410
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,420
not to deliver cholesterol to any darn cell in your body.

411
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,420
So spend your time reading on it.

412
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,620
That's what they do.

413
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,940
You could even make the case that if they're not delivering cholesterol, why is cholesterol

414
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
even in their particles?

415
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,620
And it goes back to something what Peter said.

416
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,760
These particles have to be spherical.

417
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:34,420
So when a VLDL or an anthracite is starting to lipidate APOB48 or especially liver APOB100,

418
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,820
if you put cholesterol in that and we have proteins that do that, microsomal triglyceride

419
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,180
transfer and other cellular lipid transport proteins, by putting cholesterol on the APOB,

420
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,340
it becomes a spherical particle.

421
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:56,220
So all primordial VLDLs and Kylo microns are first just very cholesterol rich spherical

422
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,220
particles.

423
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,820
They don't have the triglycerides yet.

424
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,100
Then when they're spherical particle, they can really fill up with their triglycerides.

425
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:11,060
So the cholesterol is in there for a structural property to make them spherical particles

426
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,500
so that they can carry more triglycerides.

427
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,020
And that's why when they go out, they become smaller spherical particles that are triglyceride

428
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,980
depleted and they just bring their cholesterol back to the liver or the intestine and they

429
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,220
do whatever they do with it.

430
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,380
So that's why cholesterol is in there.

431
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,620
They're not bringing cholesterol to my nose or your kidney or any place else because those

432
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,460
cells need cholesterol.

433
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,540
Those cells will make it or they'll get it by some free diffusion if they really need

434
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,140
it or absolutely virtually any cell of it absolutely needed cholesterol because for

435
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,000
some reason the synthesis was broken.

436
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,900
Any cell could ultimately up regulate an LDL receptor, but most of them don't.

437
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,260
So because they have no need for the cholesterol that's in an LDL.

438
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,780
The liver up regulates most your LDL receptors because that's involved with clearance of

439
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,980
these particles.

440
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,300
That's where your LDL receptors are heavily expressed.

441
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,940
But now you do have these particles that have certain half-lives or plasma residence times,

442
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:17,820
VLDLs even for a few hours or LDLs for at least a day in some instances more, HDLs for

443
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,500
a few days.

444
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
So are they stagnant particles that never change?

445
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,460
No, guess what?

446
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,540
They're living, breathing particles.

447
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,300
So I used to have nice animated diagrams of this.

448
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:35,140
Every second of every minute of every day, your particles are having sex with one another.

449
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,460
They're transferring bodily fluids.

450
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,440
They exchange from their core.

451
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,860
Every lipoprotein in your body has some degree in its core of triglycerides and cholesterol

452
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,620
ester.

453
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,740
Every particle from an HDL to a cholomicron to a VLDL, IDL and LDL.

454
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,900
And we actually have a protein that's pretty much carried on HDLs.

455
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:07,780
It was originally called apoprotein or apolipoprotein D as in DORG, capital D. And in my dirty New

456
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:13,620
Jersey mind, think of an HDL particle which carries most of the APOD.

457
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,460
Men carry something between their legs that if it got erect, it's sticking up and it can

458
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,620
penetrate something else.

459
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:25,940
So if HDLs are carrying this APOD and it suddenly sticks up, it can penetrate another

460
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,140
particle, be it another HDL or an APOB particle.

461
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,100
And that's a phospholipid sort of tunnel.

462
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,060
It's like a little tunnel that can connect two circulating lipoproteins.

463
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,260
And therefore, the core lipids can exchange.

464
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,780
And this is HDL to HDL or can it be HDL to LDL?

465
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:50,980
The HDL to HDL, in which case it's called a homotypic transfer because it's like particles

466
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:57,940
exchange in their bodily fluids or a heterotypic where APOA particles exchange their core lipids

467
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,860
with APOB particles.

468
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,460
What is hardly known out there is two APOB particles can exchange their lipids.

469
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,260
A VLDL can exchange its core lipids with an LDL.

470
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,940
And I'm going to tell you, that's where remnants get a lot of their cholesterol.

471
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,900
So that would be homotypic exchange of cholesterol and triglycerides between two different APOB

472
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,460
containing particles.

473
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,260
So a lot of it is between HDLs and APOB particles.

474
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,580
And why?

475
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,820
Why would we even be given that lipid transfer protein?

476
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,300
Because HDL's job is to be a great cholesterol acceptor.

477
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,280
It is very important in delipidation, helping cells efflux the cholesterol they don't want.

478
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,120
So when an HDL acquires that free cholesterol from a cell, what does it do?

479
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,360
Well, HDL carries that ACAT enzyme I talk about it, except it's called LCAT because

480
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,520
it's an lipoprotein.

481
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,680
It starifies the cholesterol to cholesterol ester, goes to the core of the particle, the

482
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,240
HDL becomes bigger.

483
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,120
Then the HDL transfers its cholesterol ester to, let's say, an APOB particle, 95% of which

484
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,060
are LDL particles.

485
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,720
So here's where the joke comes in.

486
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,800
So I know you're all calling the cholesterol in an HDL.

487
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,600
That's good cholesterol.

488
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,700
But what do you call that cholesterol molecule the second an HDL transfers it to an LDL?

489
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,320
Does it instantly become bad?

490
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,120
Oh, it's bad now.

491
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,520
If I looked at it, it's still the same exact cholesterol molecule.

492
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,760
So if you want to use those darn adjectives with a patient, I guess what's going to determine

493
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,680
what's good or bad cholesterol is, what is that lipoprotein going to do with its cholesterol?

494
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,320
It's a cholesterol molecule.

495
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,360
If it's an HDL and it's an LDL and it's bringing it back to the liver or the intestine, well,

496
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
that's not bad.

497
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't think, because those organs know how to get rid of cholesterol.

498
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,120
So I don't know, maybe that's a good cholesterol pathway, but I don't think you can apply that

499
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,800
to the cholesterol molecule itself.

500
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,120
But follow me here.

501
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,720
What if that HDL pulled cholesterol out of your cell because it was overproducing too

502
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,120
much and he gave it to an LDL and said, buddy, take off.

503
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
The liver's got that LDL receptor.

504
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
It's going to clear you.

505
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,320
And that LDL particle raced back to the liver.

506
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,120
And for some reason, there was no LDL receptors, so there weren't enough of them there.

507
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,060
Where's that LDL going?

508
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,600
He might wind his way back into circulation.

509
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,640
He will, because he's not going to be clear.

510
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,760
He might wind his way back to endothelium.

511
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,160
All of a sudden, your good cholesterol is in the macrophage in your arterial wall.

512
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,800
So spare me the nonsense.

513
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,080
Stop using its absurd term.

514
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,800
It has no meaning.

515
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,080
You're mis-educating patients, if you tell them it's good cholesterol, because they use

516
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,240
that because they're measuring HDL cholesterol and blood is a marker that I'm in good shape

517
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,720
or not.

518
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,760
And trust me, virtually all of the early trials that showed low HDL cholesterol was bad news,

519
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,960
were never ever adjusted for ApoB or LDL particle counts.

520
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,920
Because I'm going to tell you right now.

521
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,160
And that includes Framingham, which I alluded to earlier.

522
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Yes.

523
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,760
A lot of people like to hang their hat on the fact that Framingham, because most people

524
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,840
forget what Framingham is.

525
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
They throw the term around.

526
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,200
So let me just spend one minute explaining this.

527
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,720
Framingham started out as a five geography, a five city or five region observational study,

528
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,920
purely observational, of which Framingham was one.

529
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
And I used to know them all.

530
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,600
No, Framingham is only Framingham, Massachusetts.

531
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,720
No, no, no, but the original cohort of that study from NIH was Framingham, Puerto Rico,

532
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,560
San Francisco, Hallelujah.

533
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Where did Framingham evolve from?

534
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
That's right.

535
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,320
Then there was a five city group here.

536
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,000
And that's where they gathered the information.

537
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,680
That's where they made the observation.

538
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,280
So there was a purely retrospective assessment of five cities.

539
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,400
And I'm blanking on the fit, but I think one was Puerto Rico, Honolulu.

540
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,640
I'm pretty sure Stanford might have been one.

541
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,640
But anyway, the point, but the prospective work was then concentrated in Framingham, Massachusetts.

542
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,200
But the point is, a lot of people like to point out that LDL is irrelevant because the

543
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,120
LDL cholesterol, which by the way, was calculated, not measured directly.

544
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
So you've introduced a variability.

545
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,320
Years later, not in the first 20 years.

546
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Correct.

547
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,320
It turned out to be less predictive than the ratio, not the ratio, I'm sorry, the absolute

548
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,360
level of HDLC and triglyceride.

549
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,840
And a lot of people like to stop at that and say, well, look, that means LDL doesn't matter.

550
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,760
What they don't realize is those are two enormous proxies for APOB.

551
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,160
That's all they are.

552
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,800
And virtually all of your insulin resistant patients are getting atherosclerotic disease.

553
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
It's APOB.

554
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,960
It's LDL particle mediated because everybody who's not on a drug or a serious diet who

555
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,920
had a triglyceride HDL cholesterol axis abnormality has astronomical APOB.

556
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:49,000
So if you go back for all this cited forever epidemiologic data, that low HDL cholesterol

557
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,040
is such an important risk factor, do me a favor, pal, adjust it for APOB or LDL-P, which

558
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,680
has never done and can't be done in those studies now, it would disappear as an independent

559
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,800
risk factor or low HDL cholesterol.

560
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
Well that's certainly the hypothesis.

561
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,020
I mean, I guess the question is, does Mesa still have enough blood kicking around to

562
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,880
measure that or Framingham offspring?

563
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
It does.

564
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,760
Mesa has certainly shown in the discordant people where there's the discordance with

565
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:22,920
APOB and LDL cholesterol or, and people have low HDL cholesterol, APOB, LDL particle is

566
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,760
your most important metric.

567
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
So Mesa has shown-

568
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,280
And Mesa, when we're saying this, by the way, folks, we're not talking Mesa, Arizona.

569
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,660
We're talking about the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, which is abbreviated Mesa.

570
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,380
So we'll often, you'll often hear people refer to Mesa and Framingham and what they're referring

571
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,920
to are enormous studies of atherosclerosis that still have biobanks that are available

572
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,640
to do these retrospective analyses on prospectively collected samples.

573
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Yeah.

574
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,200
And that is much more contemporary and multi-ethnic.

575
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
So it's-

576
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,280
Yeah, because I've got another criticism of Framingham is you've taught me a lot about

577
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
middle-class white people in-

578
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
Boston, right.

579
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
... the Northeast.

580
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,080
But what have you told me about African-American, Hispanic, et cetera?

581
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,360
All information is always good.

582
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,280
There's always weaknesses with all information or shortcomings or so, but we build stepwise

583
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,320
on it.

584
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:20,680
So before you declare, make any statements based on an HDL metric, please make sure you

585
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,740
have an LDL particle or APL B metric in front of you also, and pretty much base what you're

586
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,360
going to advise a patient on risk and assessment based on-

587
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,240
So one of the most amazing papers you've ever sent me, and this was actually kind of recent.

588
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,320
I feel like this was a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago, was a case study of a woman

589
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:46,800
who had an HDL cholesterol of about 130 to 140 milligrams per deciliter.

590
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,820
So for the listener, you just never see levels of HDL like that unless you work in the lipid

591
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,000
community or you're a lipidologist, which means I don't see them because I'm not a lipidologist.

592
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,600
I just pretend to be one.

593
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,560
But the average person, the average female might walk around with an HDL cholesterol

594
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,360
of 60 milligrams per deciliter.

595
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,840
So this woman is showing up at two and a half times normal.

596
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,960
And interestingly, I don't even know you remember this case study, Tom, but if not,

597
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,420
I think I remember enough of the details, she had very accelerated atherosclerosis.

598
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:20,320
She did not, by the way, to my recollection, have particularly elevated LDL cholesterol.

599
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,080
Her LDL cholesterol was probably about 110 milligrams per deciliter, slightly below her

600
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
HDL cholesterol.

601
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,840
And of course, the question was, why did this woman have elevated atherosclerosis when

602
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:38,560
she had normal amounts of quote unquote the bad cholesterol and two and a half to three

603
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,640
times normal good cholesterol?

604
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,120
Do you remember this case?

605
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,320
Not per se, but it's been well explained.

606
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,800
And this is a rare genetic thing where this cholesterol trafficking pattern is disrupted

607
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,080
in certain ways.

608
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,680
Something's wrong with that pathway because that HDL should be getting rid of its cholesterol

609
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,600
and it should be bringing blood back someplace.

610
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:06,600
So this person would have to have incredibly massive HDL particles that are carrying way

611
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,800
more cholesterol particles per HDL particle than it should be.

612
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,160
And it turns out, and they're not being cleared as much as they should.

613
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:22,080
So this is going to turn out to be cholesterol rich HDL particles that don't have a protein

614
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,200
that's very integral with clearing HDLs and say PoE again.

615
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,960
So if you don't have a PoE on your HDLs, they might become very cholesterol rich.

616
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,720
Your HDL cholesterol is through the roof.

617
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Those are incredibly dysfunctional HDLs.

618
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,800
And part of their dysfunction is they're probably carrying the wrong type of phospholipids and

619
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,120
are not carrying the type of protective proteins that an HDL should be carrying.

620
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,760
Because when you have a surface area that's that big, the proteins that should be binding

621
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,960
to it no longer bind because it's not, they're looking for the molecules they're supposed

622
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,120
to covalently bind to and they can't find it or so.

623
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,280
So that's a circumstance of very dysfunctional HDL.

624
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,280
And now I remember the context, which was a really good friend of mine from med school

625
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,960
sent me a friend of a friend's blood and the numbers were like that.

626
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,360
And I remember reaching out to you saying, this is odd, Tom, what do you make of this?

627
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,080
You sent me the case study.

628
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,120
There's really nothing to do to treat these people except lower APOB, right?

629
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,480
You just have to chase.

630
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,760
It's sort of like, what do we do for LP little A nowadays?

631
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,480
You chase every other identifiable cardiovascular risk factor.

632
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,240
And I remember saying, nobody would do it to her, but there is a product that induces

633
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,120
a receptor in the liver that pulls cholesterol out of HDL particles.

634
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,960
It's a, was I called probucal.

635
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,920
I don't know if it's even still available by prescription.

636
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,160
It induces the scavenger receptor drastically lowers HDL, but it's a powerful antioxidant.

637
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,320
And there were some early arteriographic studies that suggested this is good.

638
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,720
Studies at least on an arterial imaging look better.

639
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,600
So say, saw or Milan.

640
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,560
I'm sorry, just to be clear, the reason why, I mean, again, there's a 217 ways to be fooled

641
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,640
by an angiogram.

642
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,640
It's about as crude a way to assess this process as anything that said, if you believe that

643
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,160
this is improving, you believe it's basically increasing the throughput of HDL to D lipidate.

644
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Yeah.

645
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,200
So the theory would be, uh-huh.

646
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,080
This is the case where, hey, remember I espoused the theory before that if HDLs are really

647
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,560
delivering cholesterol back to the liver, shouldn't HDL cholesterol be going down?

648
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,400
Well, here's a drug that depletes HDL cholesterol and at least arteriographically people look

649
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
better.

650
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,680
We now have identified a gene that regulates the functioning of the scavenger receptor.

651
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,280
So if you have an inactivity of that scavenger receptor, you have very big HDL particles,

652
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,560
high HDL cholesterol and coronary atherosclerosis.

653
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
This is a nice transition.

654
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,840
So let's summarize that.

655
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,880
This is, again, overly simplistic.

656
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,040
This is a zeroth order analysis.

657
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,960
So we're just going to put our fourth grade hats on, which is acceptable for limited periods

658
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,520
of time.

659
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,960
If you have low HDLC, you cannot infer if it's low because you're failing to quote unquote

660
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,400
pick up cholesterol or because you're delivering it quickly.

661
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
You don't know.

662
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,040
Conversely, or similarly, I should say, if you have high HDLC, it is not clear if it

663
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,840
is high because you pick up a lot, which in theory would be quote unquote good, or because

664
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,880
you're deficient at dropping it off, which would be quote unquote bad.

665
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,000
And therein lies perhaps one of the most interesting or certainly top five interesting drug stories,

666
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
which are the CTEP inhibitors.

667
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Right.

668
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,840
And again, I'm just going to do it because I just want to finish this whole.

669
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,640
So I told you HDL has this-

670
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
APOD.

671
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,160
But APOD is better known as cholesterol ester transfer protein.

672
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,120
It really ought to be called cholesterol ester triglyceride transfer protein.

673
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,240
C E T P.

674
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,680
So we're going to talk about a CTEP inhibitor in a moment because it's going to stop that

675
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
process.

676
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,400
The lipoproteins can't exchange the particles anymore.

677
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,940
Now wait a minute.

678
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,560
If you're following me so far, and HDL, which is pulling cholesterol out of cells, it's

679
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,440
really good at that, is then transferring a lot of that cholesterol to LDLs.

680
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,340
Here's something that's going to shock you.

681
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:23,860
In an average person, anywhere from 30 to 60% of the cholesterol in that LDL particle

682
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,640
arrived via an HDL particle.

683
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:36,640
So if that LDL particle will accept that cholesterol from an HDL and race it back to the liver,

684
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,120
thank you LDL.

685
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,800
It's like the HDL was a quarterback, it passed it to the tight end, we ran it across the

686
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
goal line.

687
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,000
Who gets the credit, the quarterback or the tight end or both of them?

688
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,740
So in the lipid transportation system, they work harmoniously together if everything works,

689
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,100
including the lipid transfer proteins.

690
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,140
We're not going to talk about it today, but God also gave us lipid inhibitory transfer

691
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,760
proteins, apolipoprotein, FAPO, C1.

692
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,680
So everything is tightly regulated in our homeostatic system.

693
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,120
But we'll leave that for another day.

694
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,560
Yeah, so if this is the master's class on lipid, that will be the whatever falls above

695
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
a master.

696
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,640
So it's always more complicated.

697
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,560
So now just to finish up the definitions of a reverse cholesterol transport, all day is

698
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,940
HDL back to the liver.

699
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:29,800
Nowadays it's HDL gets cholesterol from wherever.

700
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,040
If things go right, it could bring it back to either the liver or the small intestine

701
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,960
or an adrenal gland or an ovary or a testis.

702
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,360
So that's going to be called direct because the HDL is doing it.

703
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,240
And we're saying he's the primary factor here because he does pull cholesterol out of the

704
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,400
cells.

705
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:58,040
But we now also know that HDL can give its cholesterol to an LDL, to a VLDL, to a chylomicron,

706
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,640
to an IDL.

707
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,040
It's most of them are LDLs.

708
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,400
It's giving most of it to an LDL.

709
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,160
And they can bring that cholesterol.

710
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,120
They're going to be cleared at the liver if you have the proper number of LDL receptors.

711
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:16,800
Hey, so if an HDL gives its cholesterol to an APOB particle, it brings it back to the

712
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,280
liver.

713
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,280
That is called indirect reverse cholesterol transport.

714
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,720
We're still debating can an LDL bring it back to the small intestine also for a while.

715
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
That was yes.

716
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,040
That was probably not.

717
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,160
Now it's back to a probably yes again.

718
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:39,920
But if an LDL brings it back to the liver for sure and the intestine, then that's indirect

719
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,160
cholesterol, reverse cholesterol transport if you still need the reverse adjective put

720
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,960
in there or so.

721
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,920
But part of that pathway is it's not the liver.

722
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,400
It's the intestine, the trans-intestinal cholesterol efflux.

723
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,520
So if you want to talk about total reverse cholesterol transport, I would rather just

724
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,440
talk about lipid transport.

725
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,000
It's every particle is part of the system.

726
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,840
But if you want to stick with reverse cholesterol transport, total RCT is the sum of indirect

727
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,720
plus direct.

728
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,360
And both direct and indirect involve the liver and the intestine.

729
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,720
And a serum HDL cholesterol tells you nada about that process.

730
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,960
Yeah, we may or may not have time to get into this, but yesterday over dinner we talked

731
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,320
about the futility or the challenges maybe is a better way of saying it to be a little

732
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,640
more optimistic.

733
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,680
But the challenges in coming up with HDL functional assays because once you get deep enough into

734
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:42,480
this topic, as we're getting now, you very quickly start to realize that to measure HDL

735
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:50,600
cholesterol or even HDL particle number is so crude in terms of providing an insight

736
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,440
into its functional status.

737
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,520
The best we can do today is we measure HDL cholesterol, HDL particle number, and HDL

738
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,720
particle size.

739
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,480
And we try to triangulate just as we used to when we could look at LPa mass and LPa

740
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
cholesterol.

741
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,620
We could sort of triangulate if we were in the zone.

742
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,840
But that's still not the answer.

743
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,320
I mean, that just doesn't tell us how well these things function.

744
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,440
We just need more specific biomarkers nowadays to take it to the next level and the types

745
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,000
of therapies that are coming along.

746
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,760
And I think that's even important knowledge to know when you're going to prescribe a

747
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,040
specific nutritional therapy also that all these things come into play.

748
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,240
So very important to understand this stuff, but I hope you can see how this world has

749
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,480
changed and we ought to stop using even the term reverse cholesterol transport.

750
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,480
It's idiotic.

751
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,520
It's so immensely complex.

752
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,640
You don't know what you're talking about and you have no biomarker that you can evaluate

753
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,680
that on the given patient.

754
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,160
And the functionality of these particles, like do they really participate in these pathways

755
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,360
or not, are determined in large part by their phospholipid content in the proteins that

756
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,960
are on these surfaces apart from just the APOD we talked about.

757
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,240
And with HDLs, just briefly, I think there is probably hundreds of HDL subpopulations.

758
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:14,240
HDLs carry an immense number of proteins, way more than LDLs or VLDLs ever can.

759
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
But they all can carry one or two proteins.

760
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,120
They can't carry 200 proteins that have been identified as coming from HDLs.

761
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,080
So it's probably the protein signature of an HDL or even the phospholipid makeup, the

762
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,400
lipidome of an HDL.

763
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,140
We have just like, you know, I love fire departments.

764
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,160
Fire departments have hoke and ladder trucks.

765
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,400
They have pumper trucks.

766
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,360
They have hazmat trucks.

767
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,040
They got a variety of rescue vehicles nowadays.

768
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,960
They got ambulances, rescue trucks, and they don't all show up at every fire.

769
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,280
The dispatch sends the trucks that are needed to specific types of fires.

770
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,400
Well, your HDL subpopulations show up where they're needed and they know where they're

771
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,440
needed because the cells that need them recognize the proteins or the phospholipids that are

772
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,000
on their surface and pull them in.

773
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,360
So I don't know when it's going to come down to lipidomic or proteomic analysis of these

774
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
particles.

775
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,440
I think that maybe will take us to the next level and wouldn't hold your breath on that

776
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
anytime soon.

777
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,100
All right.

778
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,800
So let's go back to this idea of, because I want to start talking a little bit about

779
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:24,100
some drugs, but rather than start chronologically, which I want to do after we get to this question,

780
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:30,200
but just because while we're on HDL, there are really two drugs that have been discussed

781
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,200
as ways to quote unquote raise HDL, one being niacin, which we'll come to later on, but

782
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,600
the other being these CTEP inhibitors, which are relatively recent.

783
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:46,800
It was 2006 when the first CTEP trial, or at least when the first data became available,

784
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,160
and they weren't promising.

785
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,280
So first of all, why would inhibition of CTEP been thought to be an optimal strategy?

786
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
And two, why do you think it didn't turn out that way?

787
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,560
Because we don't know what we're doing with HDLs and especially using metrics to analyze

788
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,560
them.

789
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,840
And the story starts a lot longer than that in Italy, that little section up on Northeastern

790
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,640
Italy where ApoA1 Milano was discovered, and these were people who had HDL cholesterol

791
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,240
levels of five and 10, and yet had longevity.

792
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,880
And how could that possibly be?

793
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,560
Because Framingham has taught us low HDL cholesterol, you're out of here.

794
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,360
And yet here's where people with longevity.

795
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:31,840
And it turns out they had a very functional ApoA1 that really did the flux system very

796
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,280
quickly or had other properties that didn't matter how much cholesterol was in the HDL.

797
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,600
The HDL was unbelievably functional.

798
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,840
Do you know anything about their ApoBs?

799
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,120
I think even if they have high ApoB, they don't get, I don't know that, they're probably

800
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,960
out there, I can't answer that often.

801
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,600
Maybe we'll look that up if we can.

802
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,920
But their high functioning ApoA seems to protect them.

803
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,600
I doubt if ApoB matters because some of them probably would.

804
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,480
Although their role on that Mediterranean died and stuff, so maybe they don't have that

805
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
for a general part.

806
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,880
So I can't answer that.

807
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:10,920
So that led pharma to, hey, let's just invent either synthesized ApoA1 or a truncated ApoA1

808
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,440
and commercialize that.

809
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,440
At least for people who had acute coronary syndromes, we'll infuse that into them.

810
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,960
It'll de-lipidate their plaque and home free.

811
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,000
Every single trial failed, including a very recent trial.

812
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,080
So there's one where they got a specially protective type of HDL, but they couldn't

813
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,280
reproduce it, whatever it is.

814
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,600
So that failed.

815
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,280
So there were people in the past that Peter talked about, he gave a case where a woman

816
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,120
had very high HDL cholesterol but had coronary atherosclerosis.

817
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,640
But there is a bunch of people out there with very high HDL cholesterol who don't have

818
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,880
coronary, I'm going to theorize in retrospect, maybe ApoE's got something to do with that,

819
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,480
but I don't know that because that would enhance their clearing.

820
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,320
But what is one of the genetic conditions that would give you high HDL cholesterol?

821
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,040
Remember I just taught you what ApoD is, CETP, CETEP.

822
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,120
It takes the cholesterol out of your HDL and gives it to an ApoB particle.

823
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,800
So theoretically that would lower your HDL cholesterol.

824
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,720
But if I inhibited CETEP, your HDL would get the key ball, it's cholesterol.

825
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,720
What would go through the roof?

826
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,720
Your HDL cholesterol.

827
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:21,840
And the genetic model was at least some people with certain CETP variants had very high HDL

828
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,240
cholesterol and they didn't seem to get much heart disease.

829
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:33,400
Although what I'm confused by, Tom, is that in 2011-ish, didn't a Mendelian randomization

830
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,960
look at this and conclude?

831
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,120
Now this was long after these drugs were in the pipeline, but didn't the MR suggest that

832
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,120
those people were not better off?

833
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,080
It's a nature paper and we'll pull it.

834
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,480
CETP and the investigation of these drugs were long before the Mendelian randomization.

835
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,800
Absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,880
So they didn't have that data that Mendelian randomization shows not necessarily so that

837
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,960
with high HDL cholesterol you're protected, whereas nowadays most of that data would show

838
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
it's not.

839
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
Yeah, yeah.

840
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,080
My recollection is that the MR came out in 2010-2011 and it basically validated what

841
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:14,840
had at the time been seen in two trials, which was, wow, inhibit CETEP, things don't get

842
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
better.

843
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Well, yeah.

844
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,840
So I think Mendelian randomization, had they had that data first, they would have never

845
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,960
investigated these drugs, which is why they did chase PCSK9 inhibitors because the genetic

846
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,680
model told them this can't fail unless there's a downside to the drug that we don't know

847
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,680
about.

848
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,680
That's always a problem with a drug that's going to change a gene.

849
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,240
It may do good to a marker and do bad to some other marker you're not smart enough to know

850
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
about yet.

851
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,600
Oh, I can't wait until we're going to talk about PCSK9.

852
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,520
So let's inhibit CETP, the HDLs get to keep all their cholesterol, HDL cholesterol straight

853
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,520
on the roof.

854
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,520
That's good, epidemiologically, right?

855
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,560
Except on first principles, it doesn't even make sense in light of what you just told

856
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,560
us.

857
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,560
No, but they didn't know that then either.

858
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,280
Remember, this whole HDL story has evolved too.

859
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
Oh, wait.

860
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,280
So that's interesting.

861
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280
I don't think I understood that.

862
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,880
And so I should give them more credit.

863
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,320
Are you saying that it absolutely was not known?

864
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,920
No, there was theories on it.

865
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,160
Guys like Dan Rader was always talking about it, but you don't know how much you're interrupting

866
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,600
the system with that and everything.

867
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:20,280
You know, they're so heavily focused on basic lipid biomarkers like LDL cholesterol and

868
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,280
HDL cholesterol.

869
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
And HDL, HDL, good.

870
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,920
And it's the same denisin story.

871
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,920
How could it not work?

872
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,840
It raises HDL cholesterol and turns out nisin doesn't work if you want to take legitimate

873
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,320
trials to show it works.

874
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:36,320
And is there a price for using niacin even if you don't believe the legitimate trials?

875
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,640
So that's another story which we'll probably get into.

876
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,160
We will definitely get into that because this is one area where your peers will argue with

877
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,160
you.

878
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,400
But many will not.

879
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,840
Other than all rights, I've tried everything else.

880
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Nothing else has worked.

881
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,280
Let me, and look, I'm a guy who took niacin myself for a bunch of years.

882
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,840
So before I knew what I knew now, and it didn't unfortunately work for me anyway.

883
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,560
So this CETP, it's going to raise HDL cholesterol.

884
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:06,040
But how much it raises, it really depends on the potency of the CETP inhibitor.

885
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,260
And there are different degrees of CETP inhibition.

886
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,520
We have weak inhibitors and we have super strong inhibitors.

887
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,520
The first one that came out, Pfizer had developed a drug that inhibited, thought it was going

888
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,000
to be a multi-billion dollar drug because it raised HDL cholesterol.

889
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,040
Pfizer and many other companies already proved lowering APL, LDL cholesterol works.

890
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,680
It really works well.

891
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,680
Imagine if we can take those people with residual risk because their HDL cholesterol is still

892
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,760
low and we could raise their HDL cholesterol.

893
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,000
That niacin angiographic trial would really support doing that.

894
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,220
Okay.

895
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,500
So they said, let's inhibit CETP and raise HDL cholesterol.

896
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,240
So Pfizer went to market.

897
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,860
Many people were buying that stock in its infancy, thought they'd make a zillion dollars.

898
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:57,340
I remember where I was standing the moment those results were announced.

899
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:01,240
And it's interesting because I was not at all a lipid guy, but at the time I was working

900
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,300
at McKinsey, I was in San Francisco.

901
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:09,100
It was on a September day, a beautiful September day in San Francisco, 2006.

902
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:15,300
I took it as a fait accompli that this drug would work and Pfizer stock was going to skyrocket.

903
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,380
Look, we all knew the company of Sperion who developed that.

904
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,380
We knew their guys.

905
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,540
We had heard them lecture many times.

906
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,540
Many the top.

907
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,860
Everybody was banking on that.

908
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,860
Boy, this is real.

909
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,740
I mean, you never know in a clinical trial, but it looked like a slam dunk.

910
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,100
It really did.

911
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:35,620
And I remember whenever I found out, I forget the weather that day, but it was late at night.

912
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,140
And I think the internet was even.

913
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,540
And I saw a little thing and was like eleven thirty at night.

914
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,860
I don't even know why I saw it.

915
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,700
That Pfizer terminates Torcetropib trial.

916
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,340
Well, in fairness, you were actually seeing it in real time.

917
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,980
I saw it the next morning.

918
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,980
Right.

919
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,740
So and look, there was no Twitter and I could call up every lipidologist.

920
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,180
I know I emailed a few close buddies.

921
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,420
Look at what I just saw.

922
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:06,240
And so they stopped the trial, not because it was harming people.

923
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,160
And as it turns out, it looks like that drug had some other properties that screwed up

924
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,780
certain electrolytes and other hormonal levels that, OK, no wonder.

925
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:22,980
So we raising H.L. cholesterol, if it's going to bring a downside to the table, goodbye.

926
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,260
So Pfizer lost a lot of money in that.

927
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,860
But that didn't stop research on the drug.

928
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:34,000
As they developed these other toxicities that maybe were specifically related to that CTEP

929
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,360
inhibitor, let's develop better CTEPs inhibitors and go with them.

930
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
So they did.

931
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,120
They came up with a very weak one called Dalcetropib.

932
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
Who made that?

933
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,200
It wasn't Merck because Merck is the third one.

934
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,200
So there's someone in between.

935
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,200
I keep forgetting.

936
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,200
Yeah.

937
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,200
Anyway, OK, so we can figure that out.

938
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,200
I was confused all these things.

939
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:57,360
I was certainly a bit consulting with them back to and then two other companies.

940
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:03,240
Again, it was Merck and Lilly had super potent CTP inhibitors, but they did all the tests

941
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,360
and it didn't have this other toxicity with electrolytes and renin-angiotensin levels

942
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,600
and things like that.

943
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,860
So maybe this would work.

944
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:18,760
And of course, the stronger your CTEP inhibition, the more you would raise HDL cholesterol.

945
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:27,440
So Dalcetropib raised it 20 to 30 percent, whereas the stronger ones raised it 80, 100

946
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,340
percent HDL cholesterol.

947
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:35,460
So the Dalcetropib, they enrolled in acute coronary syndrome, a humongous population,

948
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,540
and were doing a randomized trial.

949
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:41,580
And after a few years, they didn't see any downside.

950
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,900
They weren't telling anybody or.

951
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,060
There was no superiority, no inferiority.

952
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,300
Those are very expensive trials.

953
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,340
So the bean counters said, it's a futile trial.

954
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,540
Forget about it.

955
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,540
So Dalcetropib.

956
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:00,940
I think that those trials combined with the MR have put an end to this approach to lipid

957
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,940
modulation.

958
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,940
They did.

959
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,980
And the two other companies, though, said, well, it's a weak CTEP inhibitor.

960
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,980
We're potent.

961
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,980
So we're going to continue.

962
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,420
Our trials are well on their way, too.

963
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:16,580
So with anacetropib and evacetropib, the remaining things, they did them.

964
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,260
And sooner or later, Lilly just bailed on their trial.

965
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,260
More futility.

966
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,260
They weren't going to take it up.

967
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,780
Merck continued their trial.

968
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:30,980
So Lilly, with a potent evacetropib, was seeing not only drastic raisings in HDL cholesterol

969
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,340
but LDL cholesterol.

970
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,500
But PCSK9 inhibitors are starting to appear.

971
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:42,100
But nobody's going to ever prescribe this drug based on what it does to LDL cholesterol.

972
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:47,060
And we're not so convinced that raising HDL cholesterol matters anymore.

973
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,540
And they're really thinking with some futility.

974
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,580
So they bailed on their trial, too.

975
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,780
People think they should have.

976
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,420
Some people wish they would have continued that trial.

977
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,660
But Merck did continue.

978
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,260
And Merck did hit its endpoint.

979
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,660
It did reduce coronary events.

980
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,260
It did drastically raise HDL cholesterol.

981
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,160
But it dramatically lowered APOB also.

982
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,220
So the theory came to be what a CTEP inhibitor does to the metric HDL cholesterol has nothing

983
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,740
to do with anything.

984
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,900
But if it can lower APOB, it works.

985
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,460
And the trial was, it worked.

986
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:25,180
But they're not going to bring it to market because it stays in the human body for years.

987
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,620
And they just are afraid of that.

988
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,660
They have no idea what might show up before.

989
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,620
Well, especially when there's no upside relative to what you can do anyway.

990
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,860
So we got other things that will give you that type of APOB lowering that seem to be

991
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,900
safe and been around.

992
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,780
So Merck is not going to commercialize that product, even though it has a successful trial.

993
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:47,380
So if you want to definitively say CTEP inhibition doesn't reduce atherosclerosis, well, it did.

994
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,100
But at what price and at what benefit?

995
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:54,740
And we just can do it with some other LDL lowering things coming to the market.

996
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,460
It still seems too crude, is the point.

997
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:02,460
It's not entirely clear why one of those drugs is working and why one is not.

998
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:09,380
Because the inhibition of CTEP is, it's interrupting a transfer, but it doesn't actually tell you

999
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,180
what happens after the transfer.

1000
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,180
And that becomes the problem.

1001
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,660
No, it doesn't tell you.

1002
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,580
I know some of the primitive HDL function studies they did on it didn't look like they

1003
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,220
were screwing up the HDL, but there's immense numbers of HDL function.

1004
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,740
You don't know what you're doing.

1005
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:27,900
And if that protein is going to stay in your body forever, what other consequences might

1006
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,020
there be long term screwing up of other biological systems or something?

1007
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,860
So it couldn't risk that.

1008
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,860
Yeah.

1009
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,980
Well, kudos to Merck because I think the FDA would have approved it, don't you?

1010
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,540
Not with the tissue residual.

1011
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,300
So you think the FDA would have denied it based on the...

1012
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,740
They had that fear.

1013
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:49,180
And even if they thought they could get it by, their lawyers probably told them...

1014
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,900
Well Merck, it's funny, a lot of people don't remember what happened to Merck with the Vioxx.

1015
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,900
Sure.

1016
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,020
The failure of the black box warning.

1017
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,660
And actually, I got to tell you that, that to me is one example of an overreaction too

1018
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,100
late versus an appropriate reaction sooner.

1019
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:06,540
So not that I'm a pharma guy and know much about pharma, but Vioxx was an amazing drug.

1020
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,300
I mean, 10 times better than the Celebrex ever was.

1021
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,860
For the listener who's wondering what we're talking about, Celebrex and Vioxx were the

1022
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:17,900
first two versions of these things called selective COX-2 inhibitors, which were potent

1023
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,300
and much more selective anti-inflammatory drugs.

1024
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:25,780
So for people with orthopedic issues, joint pains, things like that, but they don't have

1025
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:31,100
some of the drawbacks you have with using just non-selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase

1026
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,500
such as Advil or Aleve or things like that.

1027
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,740
Anyway, to make a long story short, it was about 2001 when they saw a small subset of

1028
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,940
patients and turned out those, I think that were hypertensive were having a higher risk

1029
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,340
of MI taking Vioxx.

1030
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,780
The drug got immediately yanked.

1031
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:50,180
I think it was the best anti-inflammatory COX inhibitor ever out there.

1032
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:55,180
And in reality, I think what emerged after the fact was, hey, the guys at Merck sort

1033
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,920
of knew this earlier on.

1034
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,420
There was data that suggested there was something going on and instead they should have partitioned

1035
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,940
it and said, hey, maybe there's a subset of patients in whom we don't let this drug be

1036
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:10,020
taken because I think a lot of patients got deprived of an amazing drug on the basis of

1037
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,020
a few.

1038
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,380
So anyway, my guess is Merck's highly sensitive to that stuff.

1039
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,380
Sure.

1040
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:19,980
In today's medical legal world, that stuff comes back to haunt those companies.

1041
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:26,180
One person goes south and it's a zillion dollar lawsuit, so it is very, very tough.

1042
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,060
And look, it goes back to my young days where we couldn't do anything for MI but suppress

1043
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,900
ventricular arrhythmias with any number of grave and all we did was kill people.

1044
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,260
Yeah, those things were the most toxic drugs imaginable.

1045
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,380
But the VPCs disappeared.

1046
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:47,180
