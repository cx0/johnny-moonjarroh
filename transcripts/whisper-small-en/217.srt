00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:14,680
It is such a pleasure to be at least virtually sitting here with you today. As I was kind of

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,120
alluding to a moment ago, if I were to sort of look at all the people I've had on this podcast

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,720
so far and kind of ask the question, when was the first time I became familiar with their body of

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:33,840
work, you know, you would be pretty far up there in terms of duration. So, you know, growing up,

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,880
you know, endurance sports were always sort of something that meant the world to me. And once I

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,920
even made that decision to go to medical school, a big part of it at least was, you know, kind of

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,920
understanding physiology better. And so, you know, it's been 25 or 30 years that I've been reading

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,280
your studies. So, in some ways, it's a long time coming to finally be sitting down with you and I

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,720
hope to meet you in person one day. Peter, thanks much. And it's been great to be able to visit with

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,800
you today. Thank you for inviting me. And I'm glad somebody's been paying attention to what I've

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,200
been doing for the last 25 or 30 years. So, it's very validating. Thank you. So, let's talk a little

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,240
bit about your background. You're a physician by training. I believe you're an anesthesiologist,

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,320
correct? Correct. So, tell me a little bit about that. So, you know, you decided in medical school,

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,200
you wanted to do anesthesia. Right. But you've always had a lifelong interest in exercise and

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,000
exercise physiology. Did you just view anesthesia as the most logical conduit to better understand

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,600
human physiology? So, Peter, before I went to medical school, I actually volunteered to be a

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,280
subject in a study on the lactate threshold or anaerobic threshold when I was 19 at the University

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,160
of Arizona. And luckily there were excellent physiologists there, but a couple of younger

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,360
physicians came over from the med school and it became clear to me when I was 19 or 20 that if I

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,920
wanted to have a career as a research physiologist doing invasive studies, you know, there was

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,800
pretty catheters in people and humans, it might be wise to go to medical school. So, this was always

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,200
sort of my vision starting at about age 20 or 21. And then what happened is I was thinking of going

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,800
to cardiology or pulmonary medicine. I was working at the Tucson VA at one time doing a

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,440
surgery rotation and I saw what they did in anesthesia, which is a lot like an exercise

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,120
test. You're measuring people's breathing, you're measuring their blood pressure, their heart rate,

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,360
and you're giving them drugs that affect their autonomic nervous system. And I've certainly

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,080
done a lot of that. So, I saw it as the flip side of the same coin. And so, it just sort of happened

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,840
and it is strange though to have pursued this vision for over 40 years now.

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,040
Yeah, I remember having the same thoughts when I did my anesthesia rotation. I can't even remember

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,520
if anesthesia was a required rotation in med school. I don't think it was, but it was positioned

32
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,320
as sort of a very good thing to do and I agree with that. And I had a field that even though I

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,680
think by that point I knew I was going to go into surgery, but I absolutely loved it. I think as a

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,040
physiology geek, anesthesia and critical care for that matter are both two remarkable specialties

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,320
that are the tip of the spear of what physiology is. It's interesting too Peter, because

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,080
when you think about exercise or people climbing mountains or adapting to some unusual environment,

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
the brainstem back there has to do all sorts of incredible things to maintain what we call

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,040
homeostasis or the internal environment in a way that allows you to survive and thrive.

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Well, in anesthesia and critical care, you turn those mechanisms off and the physicians and the

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,400
nurses really become the patient's brainstem as they regulate the breathing of the patient,

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,360
the blood pressure of the patient, the heart rate and so forth. So, again, it's the flip side of the

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,000
same coin. And as soon as I saw what the anesthesiologist did at the Tucson VA, it just sort of

43
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,520
clicked. So, where did you go on to do your residency in anesthesia? So, at the Mayo Clinic,

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,880
and so what happened is I got out of medical school in the spring or early summer of

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,600
87 and I moved here. I've been here ever since. So, 35 years in a couple of weeks. And so,

46
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,160
where did you grow up? Did you grow up in a warm climate? I grew up in Tucson. So, what, I mean,

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
obviously the Mayo Clinic's a great program, but presumably there were other great anesthesia

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,920
programs that were in the middle of a place like Rochester. No offense to those from Rochester.

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,000
So, what drew you to Mayo? Well, I'd read this paper, a review article about skeletal muscle

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
blood flow, the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow. And there were a lot of new ideas

51
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,640
in the middle 80s about the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow. And the world's leading expert

52
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,920
was a man named John Shepherd, who was a very senior member of the faculty here. And I wrote him a

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,640
letter and he, you know, it was before email and stuff. So, he was friends with the head of the

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,200
department of man named Alan Sessler and John took it over to him. And I wanted to be able to

55
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,720
both do my residency and spend time in the lab and I was able to work with Dr. Shepherd. And our

56
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,320
department and our residency program were very research friendly. So, that's really why I decided

57
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,720
to come to Rochester. But I thought I'd stay, you know, three or four years and go back to Tucson.

58
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,840
So, that obviously didn't happen. I don't see that happening. Yeah. So, let's talk about exercise,

59
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,480
you know. Right. People who listen to this podcast know that I'm really passionate about this idea of

60
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,720
longevity. Right. Think about longevity through the lens of five sort of modifiable behaviors.

61
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,280
Exercise, sleep, nutrition, emotional health and all the tools around distress tolerance

62
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,320
and then exogenous molecules. Those are the five things that as far as I can tell, mostly you can

63
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,120
manipulate. Correct. They can both impact your lifespan and your health span. Four of those are

64
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,520
kind of behavioral. Right. All right. The medications aren't really behavioral in the sense that,

65
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,640
you know, compliance is relatively straightforward. The other ones really require a shift in behavior

66
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,040
and in mindset. And of these, I just, again, maybe we all have our biases in our blind spots,

67
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,640
but I just think exercise is in a league of its own in terms of its potential. Both on the lifespan

68
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,000
axis. So, it, you know, its ability to extend life and reduce all cause mortality is well documented.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,600
We'll talk about that. Right. But also on the health span side, it really has no rival. So,

70
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,840
it's for that reason, I think, that we spend a lot of time inside our practice focusing on exercise.

71
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,480
It is really the biggest pillar within what we do because it has the most impact and unfortunately,

72
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,800
or fortunately, it's also the most challenging one, I think, to get people to change their

73
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
existing behaviors around because the time commitment is significant.

74
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,720
So, let's start with some of the basics just for folks who maybe aren't completely up to speed.

75
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,800
What would you say if you're at a party and somebody came up to you and said, Mike, I understand

76
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,080
you're really into this exercise thing. Can you explain to me why it is that exercise helps you

77
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,440
live longer? I think there's a couple of things, Peter, and it's multifactorial. But the first

78
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,280
thing is that, you know, the risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease, all more

79
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,800
cause mortality are all influenced by exercise and physical activity. These would be blood pressure,

80
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,800
diabetes, to some extent, lipids and cholesterol, and also how you deal with stress. So, I think

81
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,000
you get the big three there. There are some other kind of new age or second wave risk factors like

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,560
endothelial function, the lining of the blood vessels in your body that improve with exercise,

83
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,040
the way what's called your autonomic nervous system, and people may have heard of vagal

84
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,320
tone or heart rate variability. That's also influenced positively by exercise. So, I think

85
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,080
there's five or six things, but what's interesting is when you add up each one, you know, the modest

86
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,360
increase in cholesterol, a modest reduction in blood pressure, those sorts of things,

87
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,520
when you add them up, you get X percent improvement in health, span, life expectancy,

88
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,240
any metric you want to use. But when you look at the epidemiology, people who do the sorts of

89
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,720
things you just mentioned have a much bigger benefit than just the simple sum of the other risk

90
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,440
factors. So, there does seem to be some sort of synergy or some sort of X factor that we don't

91
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:39,040
really understand yet. But again, yeah, go ahead. No, no, you go ahead. I was just going to say this

92
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:46,080
collection of lifestyle related factors, which are really critical. And again, the autonomic

93
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,560
nervous system, blood pressure, lipids, the lining of the blood vessels and diabetes would be the big

94
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,480
five. I want to dive into a couple of these in depth. One of the things I would say at the,

95
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,200
before we do so, is, you know, you've thought a lot and you've looked a lot at this literature and

96
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,160
one can say, look, the epidemiology is so overwhelming that it's, I mean, the hazard

97
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,400
ratios are sort of absurd. When we're used to looking at a field like nutrition and looking

98
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,600
at the hazard ratios in nutrition, they're very small. In fact, they're so small and also so

99
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:32,880
inconsistent that it becomes almost impossible to assign a mortality benefit or addition to almost

100
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,720
anything you can eat. I mean, literally jelly beans to bacon to kale. The hazard ratios are

101
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,640
trivial and they flip flop from month to month. Correct. Well, and yeah, let me tell you something.

102
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,240
It's really interesting. It's good you brought this up. So I'm working on a review article on

103
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,840
related topics. And one of the things I'm looking at is all of what you might describe as natural

104
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,280
experiments, where you have two groups of people that are otherwise similar exposed to different

105
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:08,080
things. And that's a long, long, long use tool in epidemiology. And people are now using it in

106
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,120
economics and behavioral sciences. And in fact, these natural experiments, the economists just

107
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,800
got a Nobel prize from a couple of years ago. But the classic one is the London bus driver bus

108
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,880
conductor story led by Jeremy Morris after World War II, where they showed the physically active

109
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,800
conductors who were walking up and down the buses all day, had much lower rates of cardiovascular

110
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,200
disease and the sedentary driver bus drivers. And it was about 50%. And they had similar things

111
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,240
with telephone operators versus people who were out walking around doing things. And what's

112
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:50,240
interesting is you look at that 50%. It's incredibly consistent, incredibly consistent.

113
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,760
Those studies, studies of longshoremen, studies of Harvard alumni, there's one in the last 10 or 15

114
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:06,160
years of 50,000 male and 25,000 female finishers of the Vasa Lopet 90 kilometer cross country ski

115
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,560
race in Sweden. And they compared them to match controls from the Swedish record system. And they

116
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,480
showed again, about a 50% reduction in cardiovascular and all cause mortality. There's data from the

117
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,280
National Cancer Institute showing the same sorts of things and showing, you know, four or five or

118
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,880
six year increase in life expectancy, you know, among the people who got a substantial amount of

119
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,400
physical activity or structured exercise, either one. Yeah. And I think the sort of take home

120
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:45,040
point for the listener is unlike nutritional epidemiology, where the risk increases and risk

121
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,280
reductions are very, very small and they're never consistent, right? I mean, there's some things

122
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,320
that are consistent and consistently small. For example, you know, vegetarians consistently have

123
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,800
a small reduction in mortality, which of course then gets to the next point, which is what are

124
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,920
the confounders? And this is where I want to kind of talk about it with exercise. And this is where

125
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,080
the natural experiments are much better on the exercise front than they are in the nutrition

126
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,240
front. You see, going back to the example you gave, which is a very famous one of the guys running up

127
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,200
and down the buses, the sort of conductor guys versus the drivers. That's a great natural

128
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:32,720
experiment because it's really not amenable to a choice. And you would be less likely to believe

129
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,600
that the bus driver who sits there is also making poor choices relative to the other guy when he's

130
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,040
not at work. In other words, we wouldn't really have a reason to believe that he's more likely to

131
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,040
be a smoker. He's more likely to eat, you know, make poor food choices, etc. Whereas when you look

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,720
at sort of the vegetarian to non-vegetarian dietary pattern in nutrition, it's pretty clear

133
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,360
that a vegetarian diet is very restrictive diet. And therefore, the person who's making that choice

134
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,280
is likely very health conscious in a number of other ways. Correct. Yeah, they have a suite of

135
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,040
behaviors. Yeah, exactly. Some of which are easy to measure and correct for like smoking,

136
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,200
but many of which are not. And that sort of makes the nutritional thing harder.

137
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,320
The exercise thing is pretty profound. So let's explain to people what it means

138
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,800
when you have a hazard ratio of 0.5, which means a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality. What's the

139
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,840
time frame that that's usually looking at and how does that translate to, you know, a five-year

140
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,440
increase in life expectancy? The way you would say it is that, you know, the relative risk of

141
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,040
dying of heart disease in any given period of time, whether it's year, five years, 10 years,

142
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,560
whatever the study is doing is 50% lower. But obviously not everybody dies of cardiovascular

143
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,040
disease. People die of other things. And so then you have to translate that into sort of years of

144
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,320
life gained. And typically the years of life gained are somewhere on the order, if you account

145
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,200
for smoking of three to five years, something like that. And then if you look at the concept

146
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,320
of health span, you know, you may get six or eight years of improved health span. So health

147
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,600
span, as you know, Peter, is how long you can, you know, how disability free you are. And so you

148
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,760
have, you know, four or five-year increase in life expectancy and a four or five-year additional

149
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,800
increase in health span. And the idea, you know, is to live a long time and then die quickly

150
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,720
with minimal disability. So kind of one of the ways we try to get around this idea of the sort

151
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,040
of vagueness of freedom from disease and disability is to make it very, very granular. And we do this

152
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,680
by creating this model we have called the centenarian decathlon, which says, if you go out to your

153
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,000
marginal decade, and we define the marginal decade as the last decade of your life. So again, we don't

154
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,640
know when that is, but let's just make the math easy and say, oh, that's going to be 79 to 89 or

155
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:07,520
81 to 91. You're in your marginal decade. What are sort of the athletic events and the activities

156
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,000
of daily living that you want to be able to do? But we do it by making people cross off things they

157
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,440
do not want to do. So we make this a you have to opt out of things. Right. And they're very

158
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,320
specific, right? So it's like walking three miles in one hour, you know, being able to climb

159
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,680
X number of stairs, you know, 60 stairs that are eight inches in one minute, being able to carry

160
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:43,760
20 pounds of groceries a certain distance, being able to get up off the floor with at most one hand

161
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:51,040
of support. So it's very specific stuff. And I think for most people, the initial reaction is

162
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,120
well, that's really easy. Like I can do most of these things today. But, you know, when you're a

163
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,520
45 year old reading that, I hope that's easy. I don't think they appreciate the precipitous decline

164
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,720
that will occur without deliberate training. And it's for that reason that I think exercise has

165
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,360
more potential to offset all of those things than anything else. Sleep, nutrition, certainly any

166
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,280
medication. And so that to me, that's really what health span comes down to. It's right. It's not

167
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,720
just I'm not disabled, but it's I'm really thriving. Yeah, I'm engaged. I can engage in what

168
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
I want to engage in. Yeah. And I think Peter, you've hit the nail on the head. And I think that

169
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:37,120
what we see in those decades, there's what's really instructive is if you look at the decline

170
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,280
in performance in age group, swimming, running, cycling, rowing, really any sport where there's

171
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:50,000
pretty good record keeping is people can start to decline at age 30 without training. You can push

172
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,640
that back to age 40 with training. In other words, if you work out every day intentionally and

173
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,240
relatively hard. But then something happens to people in their middle seventies where there seems

174
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,520
to be a, you know, kind of a more steeper rise. And what's interesting about that steeper rise is

175
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,600
it seems to shift from sort of a cardiopulmonary limitation to sort of a skeletal muscle strength

176
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,520
slash frailty situation. And what you described in terms of getting up off the floor, it makes

177
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,960
up like 70 year, 70 percent of 70 year olds can't get off the floor, not one hand, two hands just

178
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,400
can't get off the floor. And you start looking at, and we both know from, from being doctors,

179
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
if you look at what happens when a person in that age group falls, it's just no fun.

180
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,560
So, so if you look at it, what really takes people out, it's things like falls, it's inability to,

181
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:47,840
to, to, to do things. And so what happens is, is, is, you know, walking three miles in an hour

182
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,280
takes some cardiopulmonary capability, but not a ton, just some. But whereas being able to go,

183
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,400
you know, the stairs takes more being able to get off the floor takes more.

184
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,440
So I think one of the things that people have to think about, especially as they get into their

185
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,440
40s and 50s is, is adding strength or some sort of circuit training and agility training to their

186
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,880
program. And so I think you've hit the nail on the head. And one of the things I do is, is I'm 63,

187
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm almost 64, is I have the jump rope my mother gave to me when I was 14. She gave me a beautiful

188
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,920
boxer's jump rope, leather with ball bearings in the works, you know, and I carry it with me when

189
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,640
I travel because you can always jump rope, even if it's out in the parking lot of a hotel, you can,

190
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,480
people think you're nuts, but it's a, you know, but it works. It's a terrific, terrific exercise.

191
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,080
It actually is for a number of reasons, including foot reactivity, which is also one of those things

192
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,680
that can control, you know, the lack of foot reactivity is something that can contribute to the

193
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,040
fall. So you're, you're getting the cardio benefit, the coordination benefit, and also this, this,

194
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,720
this gentle foot reactivity without, and it depends if you know how to skip like a boxer,

195
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,720
you don't have to really pound your knees as well. Correct. And the other thing is you do that with

196
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,200
some body weight, you know, some, some things as simple as pushups or, or planks, since there's a

197
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,600
place to do some pull ups, you're good to go. Yeah. There's so many things you said there,

198
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,280
Mike, that I want to go back on and just make sure people really capture, because it's so important.

199
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,560
There's, and I will probably find the study and I'll link to it, but there's an amazing study that

200
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:24,000
demonstrates like muscle mass changes, strength changes, activity changes in men and women as they

201
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,520
age. And it's one of those things where you don't actually need to understand the statistics to be

202
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:37,040
able to see the figure. And it's exactly as you describe it at the age of 75, there is a cliff

203
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,920
that is so violent, you can't believe what you're watching. And it's at that cliff where physical

204
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:54,960
activity level declines like this. It just goes boom. Muscle mass goes boom, strength, boom, same

205
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,840
thing. And, you know, of course it begs the age old question, right? Is the patient losing strength

206
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,000
because they are no longer active or are they no longer active because they have lost strength?

207
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,440
My view is it's both. I think these things feed off each other. Which one's the first insult?

208
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,480
I suspect it's probably the loss of strength that contributes to the loss of activity. But then I

209
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,160
think those feedback and accelerates this thing. You really get into a death spiral. And I think

210
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,080
that's why it becomes important to keep exercising relatively hard as you get over at least a few days

211
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,320
a week to slow this decline. And there are remarkable examples. There are some Swedish

212
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,800
cross-country skiers, men who were world and Olympic champions in the 40s and 50s.

213
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Who remained active as many of them were woodsmen and lived in the countryside. Remained very active

214
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,480
skiing and so forth. They were studied in their 80s. Now you could argue that there was something

215
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,800
special about these guys to begin with or they would not have become champion athletes. But their

216
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:08,960
rates of decline were quite modest. And more importantly, their fitness levels were similar

217
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,000
to what you would see in people in very early middle age. The other interesting thing about

218
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,360
that is the classic studies from the 1960s. These fighter pilots, Navy and Marine and Air Force fighter

219
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,640
pilots were sitting in the outer space. These were incredibly fit guys. They'd go up for a week and

220
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,880
come back completely atrophy. Couldn't stand up. And really in bad shape. And in 66, NASA commissioned

221
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,760
folks at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas to put five college-age

222
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,160
males, two athletes, at bedrest. And they had tremendous reductions in their fitness over just

223
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,200
three weeks of bedrest. And interestingly, Ben Levine and his group in Dallas, along with the

224
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,680
late Jerry Mitchell, brought these same men back 30 years later. So now they were early 50s. And

225
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:05,440
it's incredible, but three weeks of bedrest caused losses of physiological function associated with

226
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,640
30 years of aging. So it's an incredible study. And that's one of the things that is instructive.

227
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,720
Those sorts of small studies. And that's why it's so important to just avoid inactivity

228
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
of any type. And whether it's low grade physical activity, whether it's walking the dog,

229
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,080
whether it's gardening, whether it's taking a flight of stairs once in a while, or intentional

230
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,800
working out, it's really the way to go. And as you point out, really, in those lifestyle factors,

231
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,600
you mentioned really sort of overwhelms things. Over overwhelms almost everything else.

232
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,880
Yeah. You mentioned and alluded to the danger of a fall in later life. And this is something we've

233
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,720
been doing a lot of research on internally, given our concern around bone mineral density and the

234
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:01,760
population. The mortality, when you look at 65 year olds and up who suffer a fall that results

235
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,800
in the fracture of any part of the hip or femur at one year, depending on the study, it can be

236
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:18,880
as low as 25% as high as 60%. Yeah, the magic number is usually around 40, 50. Yeah. Again,

237
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,600
I want people to understand what we just said. You take all the 65 year olds and you look at

238
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,240
those who fall and the fall results in a broken hip or femur. And you ask the question, how many

239
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,320
of those people will be alive in 12 months? The answer is half of them. Correct. Correct. And the

240
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,400
other half, it's not like the other half are... Yeah, they're not back to themselves necessarily.

241
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,440
No, exactly. And that's exactly right. So you want to avoid a major health like that for sure.

242
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,720
The other thing, Peter, there's a couple other things that have really hit me

243
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,760
as we've talked. One is this man named Lester Breslow, who was this very famous epidemiologist

244
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,200
who died in his late 90s, was at UCLA for many years. And he studied people in Oakland in the

245
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,920
late 50s and early 60s who made it to 90. And the sorts of four or five things you talked about,

246
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,160
he identified the people in Oakland who made it to 90 and they were non-smokers. They weren't

247
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,120
obese. They remained physically active. They ate modestly. They stayed engaged in life. And there

248
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,840
were just five or six things that they did. And the same is true in the Honolulu Heart Project,

249
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,960
when they've looked at a huge number of Japanese American males, same exact stuff that you mentioned.

250
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,720
Not so they weren't as focused on the small molecules, but exactly what you've described.

251
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,440
And then I think about, we've talked about natural experiments. At the Cooper Clinic,

252
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,960
they've looked at people's fitness levels. Now that's not exactly the same as physical activity,

253
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,560
but in general, the fittest people are also the most active. And they divided people into three

254
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,960
or four groups of fitness and then had them look at a so-called healthy eating index. So, you know,

255
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,040
were you a junk food junkie to eat okay, or were you really conscious of your diet? And the healthy

256
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,360
eating index in people that weren't particularly fit did have something to do with all cosmortality.

257
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:21,280
But among the fittest people, there was very little impact of diet on the outcomes,

258
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,600
which is sort of interesting. And it always brings me back to the famous quote in a book about

259
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,400
distance running called Once a Runner, where somebody said, yeah, if the furnace is hot

260
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,360
enough, you can burn anything even big max. Now you have to take that with a grain of salt, but,

261
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,480
or I guess we're worried about diet, maybe not a grain of salt, but I think it does kind of give

262
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,960
you the take home message. But just about what a powerful thing exercise is.

263
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,000
I completely agree. And I know it's very, there's a very common mantra that says, oh,

264
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,240
you can't outrun a bad diet. And I would argue that's probably not true. I think you can outrun

265
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,560
a diet, but it's pretty hard to do. And most people don't understand the amount of running

266
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,320
that's needed to do it. That's great because, you know, again, I'm looking up these studies.

267
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,160
So I've looked at these classic studies like that. And so, so there's this incredible study

268
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:15,760
from the fifties of people who worked at a jute plant in India, and they categorize people on

269
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,520
incredibly physically active, you know, doing manual labor, hacking away on jute to make,

270
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,560
I think, linen or rope. They're going to make rope with this stuff all the way to office workers.

271
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,880
And as you got more and more physically active, people got lighter, you got more inactive,

272
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,200
they got heavier. But what was interesting is, is people that were in the middle, middle kind of

273
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,080
rung of occupational physical activity also had slightly lower caloric consumption remain very

274
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,280
trim. So certainly, you know, if people are physically active enough, if you read the old

275
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,440
papers about what lumberjacks were eating, you know, when they were chopping wood all day long,

276
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,840
I mean, it's five, six thousand calories a day. The old order Amish who walk around and do manual

277
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,600
labor all day long and don't have, you know, don't have tractors and stuff like that, they eat an

278
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,080
awfully lot and very few of them are obese. So, so I think you can't outrun a bad diet or can't

279
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,680
out exercise a bad diet in a modern high calorie, low physical activity world, I think is the caveat

280
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,800
that has to go to that one. Yeah. And yet when you look at athletes that are doing insane amounts

281
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,400
of exercise, most of them have a hard time keeping on weight. Well, there's, yeah, there's terrific

282
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,400
study about the Tour de France, you know, where they get done every day and they're just handing

283
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,600
them food. And, you know, these people are eating ad lib, except when they're on the bike and even

284
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,080
when they are on the bike and they have a hard time and they're eating 6,000 calories a day,

285
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,200
they weigh about 150 pounds. Yeah. And they have a hard time keeping their weight. Yeah.

286
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,280
They are catabolic throughout the Tour. Correct. They finish in pretty bad shape.

287
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,400
Correct. They look like, you know, you know, well, not, not death camp survivors, but people who

288
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,200
certainly haven't had a lot to eat for a few weeks. So let's go back to something you said at the

289
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,440
outset, which was the impact of exercise on the autonomic nervous system. Correct. Explain to folks

290
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,080
what the autonomic nervous system is, how it differs from the sympathetic nervous system

291
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,560
and why it plays such an important role in our health. And of course, how exercise impacts it.

292
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,280
When we think about the nervous system, normally we think about our brain, our eyes, our ears,

293
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,320
and in our senses, and also our ability to grab things, move our muscles, that sort of thing.

294
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,320
And, you know, feel pain or feel heat or cold or, or, or, or sense the environment. But your autonomic

295
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,160
nervous system is what controls your internal environment. And, and that's called the, you know,

296
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,920
the Malou internal or whatever is, is from the French a long, long time ago. And it's called

297
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,480
homeostasis. So, so, you know, we can increase our metabolism 10 or 20 fold with exercise,

298
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,840
but our, our body temperature only rises a degree or two. And so this happens due to the actions of

299
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,560
the autonomic nervous system. Now there are two branches of the autonomic nervous system. There's

300
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:17,200
this sympathetic nerves and the parasympathetic nerves. And these used to be kind of categorized

301
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:24,480
as fight or flight. And you would either, you know, activate, especially the sympathetic nerves,

302
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,120
if you needed to fight, fight or fly, run away. And whereas the parasympathetic nerves were seen

303
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,480
as what happened when you were asleep, when you're digesting your food, so on and so forth.

304
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,640
But it turns out there's kind of more of a balance in the yin and yang between the two that happen

305
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,640
all the time. But the parasympathetic nerves, and the most notable one is the vagus, they control

306
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,400
part of your heart rate, make your heart rate slower. They also tend to lower blood pressure

307
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:59,360
and they're critical to digest your food. And that's one side. The other side is the autonomic

308
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,760
nervous system nerves that increase your heart rate, stimulate your blood vessels to constrict,

309
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,360
help your muscles contract harder, and also do things like make you sweat. And so that's,

310
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,520
that's really the difference between the autonomic or the parasympathetic and sympathetic

311
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,240
branches of the autonomic nervous system. And the key thing to remember is that they help you

312
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,520
regulate the internal environment. And that exercise really keeps these things tuned up.

313
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,880
And by having your autonomic nervous system a bit better tuned up, it can do a better job

314
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,920
regulating your internal environment. The classic example being for example, your blood pressure.

315
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,200
Now, of course, what everybody knows, and we're going to talk in a moment about VO2 max testing

316
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,440
and how that's done, because I want to get into the weeds on that. But when we have our patients

317
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,000
tested, you know, we have a protocol, we look at their blood pressure before, and then we look at

318
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,520
their blood pressure throughout. And then we want to look where they are percentile wise,

319
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,560
at the max exertion, what's their blood pressure. And without exception, a person's blood pressure

320
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,840
goes up when we do a VO2 max test. So you take somebody whose blood pressure is 115 over 75,

321
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,200
at the outset, they'll easily be 160 over 95 or 100. And that's completely normal and healthy.

322
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,920
Even higher if you measured it while they're weightlifting.

323
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:29,600
Yeah, exactly. So explain to folks why it is that during exercise, nothing looks good, right? Blood

324
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,760
pressure is high, heart rate is high, heart rate variability is low. What is it about the recovery

325
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,960
phase from exercise that produces a net positive effect, even though in the moment exercise,

326
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,920
presumably is doing things that are not necessarily in our body's best interest in that moment?

327
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,720
I would say they are in their best interest because what happens Peter is the system

328
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,920
shifts a little bit to kind of meet the demands of the skeletal muscle.

329
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,800
You got to be able to contract the muscles to exercise. And again, that's sort of consistent

330
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,760
with the fight or flight thing. If you're going to run away or be in a fight, you want to be able

331
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,800
to contract your muscles. And so to do that, you need to send more blood flow to those muscles.

332
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,280
And one of the ways you do that is by increasing your blood pressure, more blood pressure equals

333
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,760
more flow. And the other thing you got to do is increase the pumping function of your heart.

334
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,920
At rest, people's heart is beating about five liters or a little over a gallon a minute.

335
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,360
During moderate exercise, it can be 10 liters a minute. During heavy exercise, 15 or 20.

336
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,720
And elite athletes who are very trained and have very large hearts, it can be 30 or 40 liters a

337
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,760
minute. So what happens is you're pumping all that blood out against these blood vessels. And so your

338
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:53,040
blood pressure rises. So it's a completely normal thing to think about and to generate that large

339
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,400
cardiac output. Cardiac output is heart rate times stroke volume. That's the amount with each

340
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,160
squeeze of the heart. And so naturally, you're going to want to increase your heart rate.

341
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,520
So that's what happens. But then when you stop, as you mentioned, heart rate falls, blood pressure

342
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,880
falls, and things look probably better than they did in somebody who is untrained and hasn't

343
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,960
exercised. What do we know about the rate of recovery? Like there's something called heart

344
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:26,400
rate recovery, HRR, that is a pretty interesting metric. Tell us what we know about HRR.

345
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,320
So people do a maximum exercise test and their heart rates 150, 160, 180, whatever their age is.

346
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,560
220 minus your age is an interesting number, but there's a lot of patient to patient or person to

347
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,120
person variability. So what happens is how fast does your heart rate go back down to some number?

348
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,920
How fast does it get to under 100? How fast it goes back to baseline? Whatever.

349
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,760
So the faster it goes down, the faster it goes down, the better the action of your

350
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,840
vagal nerve, the nerve that slows your heart rate. The vagus nerve is also responsible mostly for

351
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:10,960
your heart rate variability. And that means that, and this nerve also suppresses funny heartbeats

352
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,000
and is protective when it's in good shape against arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia,

353
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,320
ventricular fibrillation, sudden death, all of those things. And so heart rate recovery,

354
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:32,080
heart rate variability, all of those things are indirect markers of what we call vagal tone or

355
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:39,600
vagal activity. And that's a good thing. Now heart rate variability can be quite genetic, right Mike?

356
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,800
The absolute number in milliseconds between any two individuals can be quite distinct. And it

357
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,320
seems to be not nearly as modifiable as some other factors. Have you found that to be the case?

358
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,200
You know, I would say, again, it depends on what sorts of training people have been doing,

359
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,080
what they've been exposed to. But in general, most people can get a nice training-braided

360
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:09,760
cardia, which again is vagal tone. And most people if they're trained can go from slow

361
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,880
heart rate recovery to faster heart rate recovery and also have more heart rate variability. So I

362
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,760
think worrying about the differences in the initial baseline period while interesting and

363
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,480
what they might be attributable to is probably less important than the fact that they're

364
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,640
modifiable as you mentioned very early, you know, as they say at the top of the show.

365
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,920
Yeah. So let's talk about this VO2 max test because we're going to talk about what it means

366
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:43,360
and, you know, how predictive it might be of an individual's mortality. So let's just start by

367
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,280
explaining to people what you do when a person comes into the lab.

368
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,400
Right. So what you do is you get them on a bike or a treadmill, you put some EKG electrodes on them

369
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,000
and they either run on the treadmill or ride a bike and they have a nose clip on if you're

370
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,200
going to measure it directly and either a face mask or a mouthpiece that they breathe.

371
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,040
And that allows us to measure how much oxygen they breathe in or air they breathe in,

372
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,400
how much air they breathe out. We know that the air has 21% oxygen coming in. If we measure the

373
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,760
amount of oxygen in the expired air, we can make an estimate of how much oxygen has been consumed.

374
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,360
And so what happens is when people start to exercise, they go from using about

375
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:37,920
three and a half mls per kg per minute. So think about, you know, or maybe 250 mls or 300 mls,

376
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,280
so like 10 or 12 ounces of oxygen per minute. Right. And an unfit, you know, person in their

377
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:55,440
30s or 40s can typically increase that about eight or tenfold to say, to say 30 or 35.

378
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,760
Yeah. To 30 or that would be, that would be 30 or 35 or about three liters a minute.

379
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,240
Right. And with training, most people can increase things at least 10 or 20%.

380
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,080
And if you have some ability and or you train very hard, some people can almost double it.

381
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:20,480
And so what happens is that once your VO2 max goes up again, just like physical activity,

382
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,720
it's a measure of physical fitness and it's also linked to all cause mortality. So people,

383
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,560
the fitter you are, the lower your chance of dying in the next year or two years, five years,

384
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,320
ten years. And it's it for many years, they thought that things sort of plateaued at what they call

385
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,280
about 10 or 12 met. So met mean you're resting metabolic rate. So you had to be able to get 10

386
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,600
10 mats and 10 mats is being able to run one mile in about 10 minutes, roughly for the average

387
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,280
person. And now people have shown a group in Henry Ford in Detroit have shown that that continues

388
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:04,240
to rise even up to 1516 met. So people that are quite fit continue to gain, you know, benefit in

389
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,360
terms of all cause mortality. I mentioned the cross country skiers earlier. And while they didn't

390
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,960
do VO2 max tests in those people, the people who had completed the most races and done the races

391
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,840
the fastest. So people who had both been active for the longest period of time and probably were

392
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,280
the fittest also had lower lower all cause mortality than people who had not not compared

393
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,200
to sedentary peers, but compared to people who've done a few races a little bit slower.

394
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,280
So yeah, peak fitness matters. Yeah, when we look at that, that there's a paper in JAMA that I think

395
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,640
is by far the most compelling description of this phenomenon. A couple things are noteworthy about

396
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,800
it. I've talked about this on a previous AMA, because it's it's really one of the I would

397
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,920
consider it one of the 10 most influential papers that I have read in terms of changing how I think

398
00:38:51,920 --> 00:39:00,320
about, you know, health span and lifespan. As you said, the relationship is monotonic,

399
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,680
and it does not plateau. So it's that's that's an important thing to to appreciate, which is,

400
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,960
this is a more is better phenomenon. And very few things in physiology are more is better. Yeah,

401
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,840
usually physiology behaves in use and upside down use or maybe J's and things like that.

402
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,360
Or, or, or, you know, a shake or whatever. Correct. Exactly. Sigmoid curves. But this is not the

403
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,360
case here. This study that we're talking about put people into the bottom 25th percentile,

404
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,280
you know, 25th to 50th percentile, 50th to 75th. And then the last group, it basically divided into,

405
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,160
you know, 75th to 97 and a half. And then they had that little sliver of people that they called

406
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,120
elite that were at the top two and a half percentile. And all cause mortality just went lower and lower

407
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,120
and lower. Correct. And if you looked at the hazard ratio the other way, because we often think about

408
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,760
hazard ratios and risk reduction. But if you look about it in risk increase, when you compared

409
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,200
the people in the top two and a half percent of the VO two max to the bottom 25 percent,

410
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,480
the hazard ratio moving in that direction was five point zero four. My memory serves correctly.

411
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,040
That means there's a five fold increase in all cause mortality between the fittest two and a half

412
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,520
percent and the least correct 25 percent. And even when you took something less extreme, I believe

413
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:33,040
if you looked at the least fit 25 percent to the third quartile. So the 50th to the 75th percentile,

414
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,720
the hazard ratio was still about just just below three. I think it was two point seven five ish,

415
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,760
which was kind of right on par with the increase in mortality that you would see from having end

416
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,720
stage renal disease, which is by the way greater than the hazard ratio associated with smoking.

417
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,960
Yeah. No, no. Being unfit is an incredible risk factor. You know, and people like Frank Booth

418
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,200
have argued that it should be, you know, for lack of a better word, the risk factor. And Jill Barnes,

419
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,720
one of my fellows at the time, she's now at the University of Wisconsin, a faculty member, she and

420
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:16,000
I wrote a editorial for Mayo Clinic Proceedings that maybe five, ten years ago where we said,

421
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,000
look, if people had, you know, twelve, thirteen, fourteen met peak exercise capacity other than

422
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,720
doing cancer screening, you could probably just ignore everything else. You know, I mean, and

423
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,040
that's a little bit I don't think anybody's ready to go there. The sorts of people who do health

424
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,440
screening and that sort of thing. But if you screen people for physical fitness and again,

425
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,840
just did the routine kind of cancer screening and you can even argue that you could probably cut

426
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:50,080
back on the routine cancer screening for most things, except for skin cancers because fit people

427
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,080
tend to be outside of it more. You can make that argument. Yeah. Make it with a straight face and

428
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,560
the data is there to support it. And I would belt and suspenders it and say, but look, I'd still do

429
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,720
the cancer screening. I'd still consider aggressive lipid management and things like that. But

430
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,360
you're absolutely right. I mean, there's really no intervention that we have that's going to rival it.

431
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,480
Well, and I think, I think you mentioned limpets, Peter, and I think there's a couple of things

432
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,040
you got to remember. One, especially for people who pick it up late in life, you know, exercise

433
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,320
is not a vaccine. And one of the most incredible studies ever done, again, we're talking about

434
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,120
these sort of one in of one experiment of nature sorts of things is there was a man named Clarence

435
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,680
DeMar. He won the Boston marathon seven times. He was born, I think in 1888 or 1890. Also won

436
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,880
a medal in the 24 Olympics, got a bronze medal in the marathon. And he really is almost like master

437
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,160
athlete number one. So he kept training his whole life, ended up dying, I think, of stomach cancer

438
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,480
at about age 70. So he didn't live to be a gazillion. But remember, he was born in, in, in

439
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,720
1888 or 1890. Anyways, Paul Dudley White, a famous cardiologist, we know him from something

440
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,360
called the Wolf Parkinson White syndrome, a weird kind of funny heart people get. He did an

441
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:10,560
autopsy on DeMar. And he'd run really until very late in life. And he had some plaque or, you know,

442
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,080
fatty builds up and calcium buildup in his coronary arteries. But his coronary arteries were huge,

443
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,600
were just massive. And subsequent to that, a man named Bill Hasglout at Stanford in the middle 90s

444
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,320
studied a bunch of ultra people who've done ultra marathons and they did the same thing,

445
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,840
except this time they put catheters in injected drugs to make the blood vessels expand. And they

446
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,720
showed the blood vessels were bigger and they expanded more. So, so again, while you could still

447
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,120
have some blockages, even if you exercise, and there are people with horrible lipids who do,

448
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,800
in fact, get heart disease in spite of exercise. So it's not a complete, you know, complete vaccine,

449
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,760
but it's overall protective effect is quite large, both in terms of what it does to people's

450
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,560
lipids, but the fact that the blood vessels get so much bigger and the linings of the blood vessels

451
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:11,120
are healthier. Mike, one of the things that we've looked at a lot internally is the literature that

452
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,680
argues a different point, the literature that argues that in fact, there's a J curve here.

453
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,400
And we all agree that a person who doesn't do anything is at the highest risk. The

454
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,400
literature is so unambiguous there, it doesn't warrant any further discussion. But now let's

455
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,280
now look at the addition of work. Now you and I, I just want to make sure that the listener

456
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,800
understands the way we're going to talk about this. Let's talk about these in met hours per week.

457
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,080
So you've already done a great job explaining. A weird, a weird.

458
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,800
Oh, I've actually had to convert my own training into a met hour per week spreadsheet so that I

459
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,200
can interpret what I do in the context of all the literature. A weird metric for sure. Totally

460
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,080
weird. But let's explain to people what is. So you've told us what a met is. One met is the

461
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,280
metabolic expenditure of sitting at rest, which corresponds to about 3.5 milliliters per minute

462
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:08,240
per kilogram of minute ventilation. So, or actually VO2, so oxygen ventilation, not pulpit

463
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,280
Okay. So then let's talk about how that ramps up, right? So if you, if, how many

464
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,480
Mets is it, Mike, to walk three miles in an hour? That's, that's probably four, five, six,

465
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,120
something like that. I don't know. Okay. I would have guessed. It may, it may be,

466
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,560
because, because remember, remember a 10 minute mile is, is, is 10 Mets. Okay.

467
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,000
Seven mile, six miles in an hour. Yeah. And that's pretty nonlinear. So yeah, yeah,

468
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,960
yeah, you're right. It's probably about three or three to four Mets. I would guess would be

469
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,880
something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then of course, as you noted to run a tent to run a six,

470
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,080
six miles in an hour would be 10 Mets. So let's say you did that. So you, you went out and ran,

471
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,640
you ran six miles in an hour for an energy expenditure of 10 Mets. So that would be 10

472
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,400
Met hours. You did 10 Mets times one hour. And if you did that four times a week,

473
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,040
and that was anything you did, you'd be at 40 Met hours per week. Correct. Of activity.

474
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,560
So I do this for my training. So I, I spend how much time am I on the bike at this many Watts,

475
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,720
at this many Watts and in the room and, you know, carrying my rucksack and, you know, I'm sort of in

476
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,880
the hundred met hours per week category. Correct. So if you look at the literature,

477
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,400
the epidemiology on this, it would say my mortality risk might be higher. That would be the headline

478
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,000
than someone who's doing 40 Met hours per week. In other words, it's a J curve. So it sort of starts

479
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,240
up here highest mortality at nothing mortality comes down sort of naders, depending on the study

480
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,320
between 50 and 75 met hours per week. And then the mortality tends to climb. Now, you know, I won't go

481
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,200
into this in great detail other than we've, we've looked at every one of these papers and we find

482
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,000
significant fault in each of them. What do you see? Not all of them, not all of them say that,

483
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,360
not all of them say that in the sense that some, yeah, the big NCI study was 650,000 patients

484
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:09,280
or subjects didn't say that. And again, you know, what I really like is that, that, that cross

485
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,400
country ski paper that I mentioned from Scandinavia and, and these, you know, if somebody's going to

486
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,800
ski 90 kilometers and if they're going to do it year after year and they're going to do it fast,

487
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,520
they're going to have to be trained a lot. You're going to have to be training a lot. You're going

488
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,440
to be training year around. You almost are certainly getting all sorts of met hours.

489
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,360
And, and, and training pretty hard. Now the one caveat in all this is, is that,

490
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,600
and I agree with you completely. I don't think the evidence for a J curve is particularly good.

491
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,280
The other thing is in many of these studies, the number of people that are way out there is very

492
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,000
small. So even one decimited gets hit by a car or something. It can make a difference. That's

493
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
certainly one of the problems with a study from Mike Copenhagen, as I recall, or Norway,

494
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,920
but one of the Scandinavian capitals. And, and again, so I really think that the dispositive

495
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:05,120
study here is the real world data from, from the Vaselopet story. Now the one thing that does happen

496
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,120
is, is that people do have at least an apparent increase in risk of atrial fibrillation.

497
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,960
And now there's two, there's two, a couple of caveats to that. The first thing is they do not

498
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,680
have any increased risk of fatal arrhythmias. I mean, atrial fib is no fun, but it, but it certainly

499
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,280
can, you know, lead to medical problems, but not typically to kill you. The sorts of things that

500
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:37,120
kill you ventricular arrhythmias, these are not seen in any, to any greater extent in these people

501
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,720
that are, you know, really heavy exercises for their entire life. So then the question becomes,

502
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,960
do these people actually have more atrial fibrillation or is it just that they're exercising

503
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,720
and notice it? And, and that's the controversy. I think, I think you would probably have to say

504
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:59,600
that people who, who train the way you're talking about for, for their entire life have some

505
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:05,600
increased risk of atrial fib compared to people that are just super healthy otherwise and, and

506
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,840
physically active at that 50 to 70 met hour per week thing you're talking about or level you're

507
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,560
talking about, but your risk of atrial fibrillation is still probably lower than people who are

508
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:20,000
sedentary, hypertensive, obese, diabetic, and so forth. And there are good treatments for atrial

509
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,520
fibrillation and you continue to be protected against fatally arrhythmias. So, so I think that,

510
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,560
that that's the one caveat. I think that where there, the evidence is, is, is better than marginal

511
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:37,040
this atrial fib story. And what do you think about sort of myocardial fibrosis? There's,

512
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:42,160
there's been some talk about that. Do we, do we, do we see compelling evidence to suggest?

513
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,080
No, I think in fact, you see, you see the opposite. If you look at people who've been,

514
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,120
if you look at, you get the data from a Ben Levine's group down in Dallas where they've

515
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:55,920
done a bunch of echoes and loaded the heart and done all kinds of things. And they show that,

516
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:03,360
that, that young fit, young people have very flexible, compliant heart muscles. And they

517
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,680
show that that declines with age, but, but doesn't decline nearly so fast in people that are either

518
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,360
habitual exercises or people who remain master athletes or remain highly competitive. So again,

519
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,560
I think that you can, you can talk yourself into these sorts of things through a case report here,

520
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,640
a case report there. But when you look at the sort of data that came from Ben's lab

521
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,960
and, and other things, you see that, that, that this sort of training keeps the ventricles

522
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,440
compliant, flexible, and, and able to handle the, the, the, you know, the increased demands and

523
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,680
pumping demands of exercise. So I think the fibrosis argument's a little spurious. I think

524
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,360
we've, we've talked a little bit earlier about the large coronary arteries in people that are

525
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:53,760
habitually physically active. We've talked that those arteries vasodilate better. They probably

526
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,960
are less likely to generate a clot. And then we've just simply said, and you're protected against

527
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,080
fatal arrhythmias. We've just simply said there may be a subtle increased risk in atrial fibrillation,

528
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:10,000
but again, good treatments for atrial fib. And so, so I think, I think you're in good shape. I think

529
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,840
in that regard, doing as much as you do Peter. And I think then the other thing to remember is that,

530
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,600
that, you know, it's not, it's not a, an absolute vaccine or an absolute, you know, you work out

531
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,080
an hour a day, you're never going to get, have heart disease, but, but I think your risk is going

532
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:33,440
to be dramatically reduced as, as we've discussed throughout the visit so far. The other thing I

533
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:40,640
think that argues in favor of, sorry, argues against the J curve is the VO2 max data that we

534
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,680
just discussed, which is an enormous cohort, probably the largest cohort after Copenhagen

535
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,400
cohort and far more balanced in terms of the number of people in each group. And has been

536
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,600
repeated in other populations. Yeah. And so, so there you have to ask the question, how is it

537
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:03,600
that people in the top 2.3% of the population for VO2 max have the lowest mortality by a wrong shot

538
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,480
if they're not training significantly? Correct. Because I, you know, I, if you, I look at,

539
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,520
I know those numbers very well. I mean, we, we, we put all of our patients up against that template

540
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,080
and we show them where they are and where we want them to be. And we actually hold them to an even

541
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,920
higher standard, Mike, we kind of want our patients to be at the elite level for a decade below where

542
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,440
they are actually are age wise. Correct. And I'll tell you in a moment why we do that. I want to see

543
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:34,000
if you agree with my logic, but I just, you know, having been training my whole life, I can tell you,

544
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,680
I don't see how you're going to get there doing 40 met hours per week. Like you can't achieve a VO2

545
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,400
max of that level, just doing a little bit of, you know, maintenance stuff here and there. I mean,

546
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,240
you have to be training. Yeah, you have to be training. You have to be doing some high intensity

547
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,880
training. So I agree with you. And, and the other thing is if you look at some classic studies by

548
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,680
people like Bob Hickson and more recently, Wisloff's group up in Norway, you know, people who do some

549
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:05,760
longer intervals three or four times a week can get a lot of bang for their buck in terms of VO2 max.

550
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,320
Well, I'm going to, I'm going to come back to that, Mike, because I want to talk very

551
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,800
specifically about the different modalities for training. Before I do, I want to see if you can

552
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,480
check my logic on this. Okay, sure. A big part of where we come up with the reason you want to have

553
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,960
a high VO2 max when you're young is we want to be able to prepare for the inevitability of decline.

554
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,800
So I want to start by just asking you, what is the most up to date understanding of how much

555
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:38,080
peak VO2 declines in, and let's do it in a non-training individual and a training individual.

556
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,720
So, so if you look at, if you look at it this way, so, so in general, people think VO2 max declines

557
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,840
about 10% per decade, starting in the fourth decade. So sometime in your thirties, you know,

558
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,640
some people say nine, some people say 12, some people say eight, but roughly 10%. All right.

559
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,320
A lot of that is driven by a age-related decline in heart rate, but in people that are not training,

560
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,880
it's driven just because their heart can't pump as much blood and their muscles can't use it.

561
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,360
So among people who are training, you start at a higher level. And then if people continue to

562
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:19,440
train, you probably don't see a big decline until your late thirties or early forties. And we see

563
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,240
that among athletes because there are world-class endurance athletes in the early forties. And then

564
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:32,320
you can reduce the rate of decline by about half up to certainly up to your seventies probably.

565
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:40,880
Now, not everybody keeps training hard. And if people stop training, their VO2 max falls

566
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,400
precipitously. Dr. Dave Costell, really one of the founders of exercise physiology in the United

567
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,600
States, studied a lot of elite athletes in the sixties and seventies. He brought them back to

568
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,560
his lab when these guys in the nineties, 1990s, when they were in their late forties and fifties.

569
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,360
And about a third of them had continued to train very hard and had minimal reductions in their VO2

570
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,400
max. A third had become sort of joggers, had some reduction. And there was a third that had just

571
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,560
stopped doing anything and they looked like regular sedentary people. So you do have to stay at it.

572
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:16,240
So I think that, and there's a group of master athletes in, out in the LA area were studied,

573
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:22,320
same sorts of things. People declined and their VO2 max declined. But among the people who, who

574
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,520
continued to train intensely. And in the case of the men do some strength training,

575
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:36,240
their VO2 max declined at a much lower rate. So, so, so you have a situation where it's 10%

576
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,120
if you do nothing, you know, somewhere in, and if you really work at it and stay,

577
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:48,400
stay with it at a really high level, it's, it's, you know, maybe five or 6% per decade.

578
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,040
But most people who've been super competitive can't quite keep doing that their entire life.

579
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,240
So they drop off a little bit. But even if they drop off 10% per decade, they started a much higher

580
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:05,360
baseline. So if your baseline is 60 versus 35 and you lose 10% per decade, you're still going to be

581
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,920
way, way, way ahead, way ahead. And at age 60 or 70, you're going to have a VO2 max value higher,

582
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:21,520
higher than, you know, 30 year old. So the reason we push so hard, Mike, for our patients to have

583
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,840
as high a VO2 max possible as possible when they're in their forties and fifties is based

584
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:33,360
on this inevitability of decline and with the hopes that we're extending life by a decade. So that,

585
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,720
hey, even though actuarially you might only be expected to live to 81, we're kind of hoping

586
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,280
you're going to get to 91. Correct. And if you say you want to be active, then we have to reverse

587
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:56,000
engineer what that means. So what do you think is the VO2 max above which you have absolutely no

588
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,600
limitation on any normal person's activities? In other words, if you said to me, hey, look,

589
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:07,120
when I'm in my eighties, I want to be able to do pretty much anything reasonable. I don't have to

590
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:12,080
run a five minute mile. But what I do want to be able to do is I want to go on a hard hike.

591
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:19,120
And if that means I got to climb 100 feet in half a mile, so be it. Well, Peter, that's a

592
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,800
great question. It goes back to one of your earlier comments about, you know, your scale versus the

593
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,320
traditional kind of anti frailty scale. And what do you want to not be able to do when you're 85 or

594
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:37,760
whatever the magic number is? So if you look at it, 14 Mets, which is which is 14, a VO2 of 14

595
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:44,720
mls per kg per minute or four Mets, four Mets is required from an oxygen consumption sort of

596
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,160
perspective for people to do their activities of daily living, which means an occasional somewhat

597
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,200
brisk walk for a few minutes and be able to kind of get around the house, go to the supermarket and

598
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:01,440
be quote, independent, whatever that means. And now if you want to be able to run, you know,

599
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:10,240
10 a mile in 10 minutes, that would be 35 VO2 max. Yeah. Yeah. 35 or 10 Mets. Now, so somewhere

600
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,200
between those two are the magic numbers. And so so I would say that, you know, if somebody in their

601
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:22,000
80s had a max in their in their 20s or or lower 30s, that'd be terrific. Well, that's so funny

602
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,480
what you say. We have arrived at 30 to 31 as the magic number. That would be a rough guess. And

603
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,240
what's interesting that you mentioned that is those Scandinavian elite skiers I mentioned,

604
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:42,000
had values in the very high 30s or low 40s in their 80s. Now, but remember, they would any

605
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:50,800
any sort of biological gifts or genetic gifts that those men had and or the fact that they started to

606
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:57,200
train, you know, probably be very physically active as youngsters and really were maximally

607
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,160
physically active from age, you know, 13, 14 to probably 30. Yeah, that would account for that.

608
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:08,480
Yeah. So so so I think I think 30 be a terrific goal. But I think the other thing too is is,

609
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,600
you know, how many push ups do you want to be able to do and how many sorts of body weight type of

610
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,240
things do you want to be able to do? You know, what sort of agility maneuvers do you want to

611
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,160
be able to do? And I think, you know, we have to kind of factor in factor in, you know,

612
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,080
orthopedic problems and that sort of thing. But but again, we have good treatment for those now.

613
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:35,600
And orthopedic surgeons can fix a lot of things that other otherwise would have made people very

614
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,800
difficult for them to walk and move around. Well, and we, yeah, we think a lot about those things.

615
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,120
And we think that strength and stability need to be trained in parallel and as hard as we're

616
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:52,160
training from a cardio standpoint. But I do think this idea that, hey, if you're trying to reverse

617
00:59:52,160 --> 01:00:01,120
engineer ending your life with a VO two max in the mid 20s to high 30s, the good news is you are

618
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:06,880
never going to not be able to do something that you want to do. Correct. If you're in the airport

619
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,400
and the escalator isn't working. Yeah, I don't care. Which is which and I think the thing you have

620
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,960
to ask people and this really resonates is, you know, do you want to be able to play with your

621
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,720
grandchildren? That's one question for people. The escalator question, that's a terrific question.

622
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,080
A terrific question. Yeah, I was just in the airport last week, escalator down, you got to

623
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:32,240
be able to care and it's a long one of those really long ones. Yeah, right. You got your carry-on bag

624
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,920
plus your backpack and you got to get up the escalator. Now, I'm sure somewhere out there there

625
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,000
was an elevator. But the point is, do you want to be able to do this stuff? And if you do, then you

626
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:47,360
have to do the math. You have to work to agree. You got to do the math. And what's interesting

627
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:54,560
too is if you see a few people around here in rural Minnesota who, you know, grew up on

628
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,000
less than fully mechanized farms and remain, you know, active milking cows and doing these

629
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,880
sorts of things, doing a whole lot of chores. And it's remarkable the muscle mass that some of these

630
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:14,800
men and women have, you know, that some have. And I think that that is something to keep in mind

631
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:22,160
too, if you look at these people in these, well, if you look at in Japan, for example, in a couple

632
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,720
places, you know, the hilliest parts of Japan and some of the hilliest parts of Italy and Greece are

633
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,040
where the longevity is the highest. And people have argued it's because people have to walk up and down

634
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,360
the hills. And also, and so they keep their balance and keep their glute strength. They don't

635
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,400
fall, that sort of thing, Peter. And also that they're, you know, living a more rustic lifestyle

636
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,400
is probably getting them some de facto strength training on a daily basis. So yeah, so I agree with

637
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,880
you. Let's talk a little bit about VO2 max again in terms of like, what is actually driving it? So

638
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,880
let's go through all the variables, right? So you've got sort of gas exchange,

639
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:04,240
you've got sort of gas exchange in the lung. In the lung, correct. And then you've got gas

640
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,320
exchange in, or sorry, then you have pump efficiency, right? So we went through the mechanics

641
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,920
of that again, but just so people understand what we talk about, you've got stroke volume,

642
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,680
contractility, of course, afterload and preload and all those things that determine basically

643
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:25,120
the efficacy of the pump to move the medium to the capillary bed. And then you have capillary

644
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:29,520
exchange in the muscle bed. Right. So broadly speaking, let's just say those are three

645
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,080
variables, right? You've got the gas exchange at the source, you've got the pump, and then you've

646
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,560
got the gas exchange at the destination. Is that, I know that's overly simplistic. Yeah,

647
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,800
it's a way to look at it. So let's just think you got air to lung, lung to blood,

648
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:52,080
blood from the heart to the tissues and oxygen from the blood to the tissues, right? So there's

649
01:02:52,080 --> 01:03:00,320
four or five steps like that and you enumerated the three big ones. And so in general, oxygen

650
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:07,360
uptake is cardiac output, how much blood you're pumping per minute times arterial venous oxygen

651
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,760
difference, how much blood you're extracting, or oxygen you're extracting out of the blood.

652
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,200
And it turns out that if you look at all the studies and all the people fit, unfit, trained,

653
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:25,360
untrained, in general, the biggest issue is how much blood can you pump? And so what is that heart

654
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,640
rate times stroke volume equation? Where does that leave us? Now, when you train, you get so you can

655
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,040
extract more. And if you're at high altitude or if you've got problems with your lungs, maybe the

656
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:41,200
lungs don't work as well. But in general, I like to tell people you cannot extract what has not been

657
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,880
delivered. So the key is delivery. And that's heart rate times stroke volume. And interestingly,

658
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,440
Peter, as you I'm sure you've seen, is some of your fittest people actually have slightly lower

659
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:58,240
peak heart rates. And one of the reasons is because their stroke volume is so high. One of the really

660
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,600
interesting again, experiment of nature patients is our subjects is a man called Eskeld Ebison,

661
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:11,520
who won gold medals in five Olympics and rowing for Denmark. And they have serial VO2 max date

662
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:17,120
on him from the time he was 18 or 19 till his early 40s. And his VO2 max stayed around, you know,

663
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:22,800
5.6 liters per minute, which is quite high. And he weighed about 70 kilos. I believe he was a

664
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:30,960
lightweight rower. And anyways, but his peak heart rate dropped from about 190 to 150 over that period

665
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,240
of time, which all that means is for he was able to pump the same amount of blood, but he had to do

666
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:42,240
more with each beat. And that's, that's sort of an interesting example. But that's an insane example,

667
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:48,240
actually. Yeah. Yeah. And again, these are the sorts of things you see. So, so that is really the

668
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,920
key. And so in other words, in the individual as they age, we think that the majority of the

669
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:59,360
reduction VO2 max is coming from cardiac output reduction. But right. And the majority is probably

670
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:05,280
coming from a reduction in peak heart rate, which can be buffered to some extent, if you have a nice

671
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:12,320
compliant ventricle, like we talked about. I mean, I'll tell you, I'm not quite yet 50. And I am just

672
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:18,400
saddened by the reduction in my peak heart rate. It is really breaking my heart. I mean, I was never

673
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,560
very high anyway, and I don't worry about it, you know, but I'm 63. So I stopped worrying about it.

674
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:27,680
I just I worry about what my workload is. Yeah, yeah, no, I just, but it is a may, I remember

675
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:34,000
thinking like, there will never be a day where I can't get my heart rate above X. But, but actually,

676
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:41,280
I'll tell you, for me, it fell quite precipitously in my 20s. So as a teenager, when I was training

677
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:48,800
obscenely hard, inappropriately hard, a heart rate of 200 was was an everyday occurrence. There was

678
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:54,160
never a day in high school that my heart rate didn't hit 200 to 205 beats per minute. Right.

679
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:03,760
And then by the time I was in medical school, so 24, 25 years old, all of a sudden it dropped

680
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,640
immediately to about 180. It became very difficult to get over 180, which by the way,

681
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:15,920
was far lower than the 220 minus your age prediction. So Peter, I was in a study, I was in

682
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,720
two famous studies as a subject. One is this lactate threshold study when I was 19. And then

683
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,360
a few years later, I went and worked one summer at Washington University in St. Louis, and I stopped

684
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,720
training. I just run, you know, finished my last year of track and field at the University of Arizona

685
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:36,880
and run 10,000 meters in 3048 and didn't double on the packed ends, which was fast. Well, I was

686
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,800
good enough to get labbed by the world record holders, like what is what I like to tell people.

687
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,760
But anyways, what happened is my peak heart rate was like 185 or 188. I can't remember. And over

688
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:55,680
the period of 12 weeks of detraining, it went up to about 10 beats a minute. Yeah. So which would

689
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:00,800
have been, you know, in the high one nineties, which would have been quote 220 minus by age,

690
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,920
at the time. But but again, and there are all sorts of examples, there's a bunch of data on

691
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:11,680
elite athletes showing that that some of them have peak heart rates similar to 220 minus their age,

692
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,560
but many are lower than that. And they're like Escald Ebesen, there are some people that have

693
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:22,000
been world record holders, Olympic champions that had peak heart rates in the 150s. Yeah, mine's if

694
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,600
I hit 170 today, it's a it's a great, yeah, that's a good, which is about 220 minus my age. But you

695
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:35,360
know, my my guess is I'd be hard, I'd press to get to 140. I was talking with Lance Armstrong on a

696
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,400
had him on the podcast, many actually, but maybe about a little less than a year ago, actually.

697
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,880
And we were talking about back in the in the heyday of his tours, they weren't really looking

698
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,600
at their power meters when they were competing. So they trained with the power meter. But when

699
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:56,080
it was when it was race day for the time trial, yeah, you just went off heart rate. And I was just

700
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:03,920
blown away. I mean, so you got to think Lance was winning the tours between 28 and 35. Right. He was

701
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:12,320
still holding 200 beats per minute for the entire time. Yeah, right. So so 45 minutes at 200 beats

702
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:17,680
per minute when you're 30 plus years old is and on the other example, there'll be a man named Bob

703
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:24,400
Schul, who is an American who won the 5000 in 1964, who did interval training all day and all night.

704
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,960
It was incredible how he trained in his peak area. I have the data someplace was like 154 156. It's

705
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,240
it's was not particularly Jim Ryan's was not the great miler was not particularly high in his 20s.

706
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:43,680
Yeah, so just incredible stroke volume. Correct. Correct, correct, correct. Big heart, big pumps.

707
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:50,960
All right. So let's talk a little bit about the training. So so let's let's start with something

708
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,240
that we haven't talked about, which, you know, when you look at the best, you know, high output

709
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,440
endurance athletes today, you know, it's one thing to talk about their peak engine performance,

710
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,920
but it's easy to overlook what they're doing at the low end. You know, I've had Inigo San

711
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:13,280
Milan on a podcast twice and we've talked at length about Tadeep Pagachar. And it's it's amazing

712
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,760
to talk about high hit how high his FTP is his functional threshold power. We can talk about his

713
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:24,800
VO two max, but equally amazing to that is how much power he can put out while keeping lactate

714
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:30,080
below two millimole. Right, right, right, right. And, you know, I think he's at four. He's over

715
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:37,040
four watts per kilo while keeping lactate before below two millimole. Right. And why that's amazing

716
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,560
for someone who doesn't ride a bike is you if you took an average fit person off the street and said

717
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:48,080
hold four watts per kilo, they could maybe do it for a minute. Most people can do it for a minute.

718
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:56,080
And this guy can do it for four hours. Correct. So so so that low end aerobic efficiency,

719
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,880
I always try to explain to my patients, if your VO two max represents the height or peak of your

720
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,440
pyramid, the wider your base, the higher your your peak. Do you agree with that sentiment?

721
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:10,560
So what I would simply say, Peter, you know, as we think about performance, you think about these

722
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,800
elites, we think obviously about their VO two max and you start thinking about, you know,

723
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,120
whether lactate threshold, which would be sort of the FTP and they're all sort of related anaerobic

724
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:24,240
threshold. There's a lot of terminology here. You can get arguments with people about the details.

725
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:30,160
But what fraction of your VO two max can you perform at for, you know, minutes to hours?

726
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:36,160
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And so, you know, and typically, it's about 60 percent and untrained

727
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,640
kind of young to middle age people lower and people that are really untrained.

728
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:48,400
But just just sort of sedentary people that are very fit. It can be 75, 80, 85, even 90 percent of

729
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:54,560
the two max and some older athletes close to 100. So so that's exactly what you describe.

730
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:00,560
Somebody like that probably has a, you know, a peak work rate that they could sustain for 10

731
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,760
or 20 minutes of six, seven watts per kilo. So the fact that they can do four watts per

732
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,720
kilo forever shouldn't surprise anybody. And that's just like you look at somebody like Mr.

733
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:17,680
Kip Jogi, you know, he's running 440 miles at a pace that doesn't really probably cause much

734
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:23,600
of an increase in his blood, like the data levels at all. Did they ever reveal any of those metrics?

735
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,440
Yeah, that data is that data has been published. Tell me what was his lactate level at the

736
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,080
completion of the two hour of the just under two hour. Well, remember, remember at the end of the

737
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,080
race, you wouldn't have a lot of carbohydrate on board, but I would just simply say he can run

738
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:43,600
440 miles or over 12 miles an hour at at at, you know, at levels that barely nudges, lactic acid

739
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:50,160
levels barely nudged. But but remember, too, but his video. But what's interesting is is when I

740
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:55,280
first started thinking about this and making models of performance, I thought the the highest

741
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:02,000
number was 85 percent of max. And it's probably closer to 90 for somebody like him. But but but

742
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,440
the other interests. So the one you were talking about FDP for one minute. The other interesting

743
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:14,000
thing about that, Peter, is, you know, the Kip Jogi challenge, people have gone and, you know,

744
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,120
put treadmills at 12 and a half miles an hour to see how long somebody can last on the treadmill.

745
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,920
They're getting spit off in 30 seconds back. Yeah, less than that, you know, so. So yeah,

746
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,720
so same sort of thing. So so so I think that that sort of training, you know,

747
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:34,400
and these people are training two, three, four hours a day. If you look in terms of the runners,

748
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,400
running is limited to some extent because of the there's almost, you know, orthopedic

749
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:46,400
issues become becomes a problem impact, right. And so it's really difficult for people to run

750
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:53,600
more than about 120 or 130 miles a week and ever run do hard training for prolonged periods of time.

751
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,760
Now, there are a few people who can do it. And if you look at what Kip Jogi does, it's almost

752
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:03,120
identical, even day for day, what Bill Rogers and Frank Shorter did, does it at altitude. But but

753
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:11,120
there's a lot of medium eight and 10 and 12 miles of runs, a couple of hard interval sessions per week

754
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:17,680
and, you know, long run. And that's so, you know, that gets them to 120 miles a week, you know,

755
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:23,360
week in and week out. Now, the cyclists can do more because you don't have that issue. But

756
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:29,360
remember, though, with cycling, you know, you're going up and you're going down and you have always

757
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:35,360
a chance to take a break here and there. The swimmers do a ton as well, you know, and again,

758
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:41,360
because swimming is very forgiving in terms of not beating people up, provided your shoulders,

759
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,480
you know, don't get a bunch of tendonitis. So so but what's amazing is, is that if you look at what

760
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,680
the elite of the elite are doing, does not really change that much for 50 or 60 years.

761
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,520
You have better equipment, you have better races, you got better this, better that. But in terms of

762
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:04,400
if you look at the data on the elite of the elite from the late 60s and early 70s, it's not like

763
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:12,640
Kip Jogi's VO2 Max was 90. It was high 70s, just as what you'd anticipate and so forth. So so I

764
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:18,960
think a lot of what's happened in terms of at the very edge of things has been better races,

765
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,640
people that have longer careers, they don't stop when they're 25 or 26.

766
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,240
Sports medicine is better. So if they get injured, they can recover. We saw this in last night with

767
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:33,760
Clay Thompson. He had two injuries at 3040 years ago would have been, you know, basically career

768
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:40,160
engine, and he's come back from a combination of an ACL issue and Achilles, especially used to just

769
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:45,280
destroy people. He's playing very well. So I think those sorts of things, the races are much

770
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,160
better, you know, and they used to run the Boston Marathon at noon whenever so often you'd get a,

771
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,960
you know, a really hot day. So I think that's what's happened. So most of the improved performance

772
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:01,200
can be equipment, these sort of social factors. Unfortunately, in the case of Mr. Armstrong,

773
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,040
people, you know, bending the rules and so forth and so on. But yeah.

774
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:10,640
So let's talk about kind of the intensity levels that needs to be training at. So again, let's,

775
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:17,600
I mean, we could pick the most extreme example and talk about Kipchoge. So how many hours per week

776
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,920
is Kipchoge running? Because I know he also does a ton of other strength training and body weight

777
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:30,160
training. My guess is that the total amount of time he's running is somewhere between 14 and 18

778
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:36,320
or 20 hours a week. Okay. But remember, he can, you know, he's covering a much greater ground,

779
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:42,480
of course. Right. So he can do that. And my, again, you know, if you looked at it in terms

780
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:49,040
of the lactate threshold or the equivalent of critical power on the bike, probably 60, 70% of

781
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:55,520
that is, is, you know, fast, but not that fast. They typically start off their group run sort of

782
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,800
jogging and then they pick it up over time. Also remember that he's doing this at, you know,

783
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,160
seven, 8,000 feet. And then my understanding in reading his training program is that, you know,

784
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:12,560
a couple of days a week, he goes to a track and they run, you know, multiple 400 meters,

785
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:18,640
let's say 200 meter jog or multiple kilometers with a 200 or 400 meter jog,

786
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,800
like 10 times a kilometer very fast. So the total amount of time he's running faster than race pace

787
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:31,280
might just be 10 miles per week. So he's probably running about 60 or 70% of his stuff,

788
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,520
some of it quite slow, but most of it, you know, medium fast, but certainly not, you know, where

789
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:41,200
he's can't talk to you where he's short of breath. Then he's probably spending about 20% of his time

790
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,600
where, where, you know, he can still talk to you, but he's pushing it a little bit and probably 10%

791
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,640
of his time where he's pushing it a lot. Yeah. I mean, that's exactly my impression. And it's

792
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,280
the same impression I have of elite cyclists and elite swimmers. Yeah. No. And, and, and that

793
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,120
would be true for that, that, that, that those sorts of breakdowns, kind of the,

794
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:08,480
you know, 60, 70, 20, 30, 10 are pretty typical. Now what's interesting is that's really emerged,

795
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:15,120
the last say 20 years. If you look at people who've looked at the history of training and they have

796
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,280
gotten training logs from people. And I told you, we have lab data on people. That's quite good,

797
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,440
starting in the 19 some even in the 1930s, but certainly by the fifties and sixties,

798
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,800
we've got plenty of good data. And if you look at what these individuals who have tremendous

799
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:35,040
treadmill values, tremendous DO2 max values, ran very fast times on like dirt tracks and muddy

800
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,360
conditions, that sort of thing, or, or, you know, kind of what we'd describe as a kind of a

801
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,080
kludgy bike now, it's certainly no aero bars or, you know, look at the swimsuits people were

802
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,160
racing. So if you look at what those people were doing, they were doing all kinds of things.

803
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:53,120
There are people, uh, runners in the sixties, there were, there were people like, again,

804
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:59,440
like Bob Shule, a fancy, a fascinating man who's still alive, who his morning workout would be 40

805
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:05,040
times a hundred meters with a short jog in between. And his afternoon workout might be 20

806
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:12,080
times 400 meters. And he rarely ran continuously at all except in races, you know, and, and, and it

807
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:18,080
would be a fast interval slow. And there are other people who, who ran, you know, up to 200

808
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,880
miles a week and hardly ever ran fast again, except in races and some strides. And then, then

809
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,840
there were already people doing the sort of mixed training I described a minute ago. So what is

810
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:34,640
interesting is the extent to which things have sort of converged on this 60, 70, 20, 30, 10 sort of

811
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,200
model. Yeah. And it really, I mean, it, it makes sense if you've ever done it yourself, right? I can,

812
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,920
I can understand why there is a benefit to just the mitochondrial efficiency that comes from,

813
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,600
Yeah, right. You made more money. Sure.

814
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,440
That you'd miss out on if you were just doing the short bursts. And similarly,

815
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,800
Unless you do a whole lot of them.

816
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,160
Yeah. Well, it depends what short is. I mean, again, if you're moving to 400s into 800s,

817
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,280
And the recovery is a jog. Yeah. That's, that's, yeah. Because these guys aren't walking.

818
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:07,840
That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, so do you think there's a, a sort of training benefit? I know

819
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,600
there's a health benefit, but a training benefit in the lowest zone. So, so we kind of think about

820
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:19,760
zone two as where Kipchoge is probably spending 60 to 70% of his time. He can still talk.

821
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,160
Yeah. Probably right, right at the edge of two or three.

822
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:28,320
Yep. And then, um, and then obviously he's in zone three, four for, you know, kind of race pace.

823
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:33,840
Yeah. And then, and then he's like four, five, 10% of his mileage, which is really stretching himself.

824
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:39,120
Now is Kipchoge or other athletes deliberately putting time into zone one,

825
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:44,000
which is truly a recovery pace or. Yeah. They do that when they're recovering,

826
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,600
you know, between intervals. And, and you would be amazed at how, uh, I mean,

827
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,400
cause I did it many, many years ago, you know, getting started. So the first mile or two can be

828
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:00,320
very slow. I mean, it can be just almost a walk jog, and then they kind of drift into it. Uh,

829
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,560
and I think, but, but thinking about the listeners who are just trying to improve their health,

830
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,040
that where you, that's where you come back to physical activity versus intentional training.

831
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,400
So, you know, you start looking at the health benefits of just kind of, uh,

832
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:19,120
less than brisk walking, you know, purposeful, but not really brisk walking. They're substantial.

833
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:24,400
Yeah. So, so I think, you know, people at zone one, two, you know, you know, parking your car,

834
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:30,400
uh, farther out in the parking lot and strolling in, I think, you know, walking the dog.

835
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,320
And that can mean all sorts of things, depending on what kind of talk you have

836
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:40,560
and who's in the neighborhood, uh, you know, can, can help. I mean, the data on gardening,

837
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:47,200
uh, you know, and again, you could be out there, uh, hacking away weeds with a, with a machete or,

838
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:52,000
but most of us think about gardening as relatively light exercise. So the, the health benefits of,

839
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,800
of light physical activity, light exercise, I mean, are substantial. And remember,

840
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,160
you're, you're correct in the sense that it, that at least from our perspective, there is no J curve

841
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:08,960
and things, you know, things are, are go up, but it's not completely linear. And, and, you know,

842
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,720
the biggest benefit people get health wise is the first 10 or 15 minutes a day.

843
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,880
And why do you think that is?

844
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,440
Well, I think that if you, if you, if you look at what 10 or 15 minutes does, I mean,

845
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:26,640
I think it begins to do things in your scalable muscle that improve your insulin sensitivity and

846
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,760
help you fight against diabetes. I think just a tiny bit of additional physical activities,

847
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:38,000
at least some buffer against weight gain. I think that there's some, uh, improvement in your,

848
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,720
the lining of your blood vessels and, and probably some improvement in your autonomic function.

849
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,840
Is your, is your heart going to get bigger? Are you going to get a more efficient cardiac pump?

850
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:54,240
Probably not, but are you going to begin to do some of the things, uh, and the answer is yes.

851
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:00,400
So Mike, should those of us who really kind of care about this and care about using as many metrics

852
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,800
as we can to understand this and, you know, should we be looking at heart rate recovery and adding

853
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,520
that to our kind of repertoire of something we track in ourselves as we train?

854
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,080
So, you know, I think that, that, that, and you see it more among the cyclists and you do it again

855
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:19,520
among the runners. Uh, and, and, and is, is, I think that there are people that are, you know,

856
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,440
really into tech and monitoring and then they're sort of tech nudies. I'm a, I'm a tech nudie. And,

857
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,800
and part of the reason is, is, is there wasn't as much around him when I started.

858
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,800
And I mean, we just were getting digital watches and they weren't even stop watches.

859
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:38,080
And, and the other reason is, is that, that at the time, one of the big innovations was rating of

860
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:43,440
perceived exertion, uh, you know, the six to 20 scale or some people use a one to 10 scale

861
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,200
about how hard you're working. And I think that what's been shown is cause you know,

862
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:51,840
you can have a good day and a bad day in terms of the metrics. So I think what's been shown is,

863
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:57,840
is that, that they're all sort of parallel. And if you learn to read your own body via the,

864
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,720
via, you know, the rating of perceived exertion and, or, or metrics, you know, find one you like,

865
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:08,560
and then just focus on sort of big picture things. So I would not get too hung up on heart rate

866
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:14,960
recovery and too hung up on, on, um, on, uh, heart rate variability. I would just more say,

867
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:20,080
are you, how much are you doing? You know, uh, 30, 40, 60, a hundred, you know,

868
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:26,240
180 minutes a week. Are you also doing other forms or not a week a day? Are you also doing

869
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:32,880
other forms of, of activity, you know, like taking the stairs, as you mentioned, and what sort of

870
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,360
combination are you doing? How much time are you spending where you're really short of breath?

871
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,680
How much time are you spending where you're a little bit short of breath and how much time

872
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:47,520
is it, you know, kind of a pleasant sort of pace. So I think that that sort of information can get

873
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,760
you as, as much as you need. And I think the main thing then Peter is to make sure that, that, um,

874
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,440
you have some accountability, whether it's, you know, with a training partner,

875
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:05,360
maybe with a device or a diary, maybe, you know, with just how far did I run today?

876
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,080
That sort of thing. So, so what is your current exercise regimen? I mean,

877
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,840
you sort of downplayed it a minute, but 30 minutes and 40 seconds for a 10 K.

878
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:20,320
So here's what I do is, I don't think people understand how fast that is. I mean,

879
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:25,120
yeah, no, and I once ran a 225 marathon, but, but you know, the older I get the better I was,

880
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,120
right? So here's what I do. Here's what I do, Peter. And is, is it that

881
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,440
like, I'm a big believer in what's called hard easy, hard day, easy day. And, and I think that,

882
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:40,480
that, that, and so what, what I, what I'll do, uh, like tomorrow will be a hard day.

883
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:47,200
So I'll get on, on, uh, uh, you know, a stationary bike in my, in my, uh, workout room and, and,

884
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:52,160
and on the bike and the rowing machine, do some sort of warm up for 10 to 15 minutes.

885
01:24:52,720 --> 01:25:00,000
Then I will do a circuit that starts with, um, uh, 15, uh, or really kind of 25 squat

886
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,840
thrust, a minute of jumping rope, static wall set to failure. And then some drop sets where you go

887
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:12,240
down, you know, where you, you go down the weight stack drop set, then, then, then drop sets with,

888
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:19,360
with, uh, incline flies, then drop sets with leg extensions and drop sets with a combination of,

889
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:26,560
of, uh, pull ups and lat pull downs and military press. Then some additional stuff for my legs.

890
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:33,840
Then some, uh, uh, pushups, bar dips in upright rows, followed by something else for my legs. So

891
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,240
I alternate arms and legs and I work my way through this with no rest drop sets on each

892
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:43,440
thing for all large major, major muscle masses. And that takes about 22 minutes. And it's, it's,

893
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,400
it's, it's, uh, 22 minutes for one circuit, one circuit. Then, then I'll do a,

894
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:55,520
then, then I get on the bike, right. And, and I'll do, uh, like eight times, uh,

895
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:02,000
three minutes of a ladder where you start, you know, unloaded, go up a notch, go up a notch,

896
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,800
go up a notch. And I get to maybe about 350 Watts for the last 30 seconds, come back down to about

897
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:12,160
a hundred Watts, 350 Watts, do that times eight. And sorry, how long do you take to ladder? Three

898
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:17,360
minutes, three minutes. So, so you go like a hundred Watts for something like a hundred

899
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:26,400
Watts for 30 seconds, 150 for 30, 200 for 200 for 30, 250 for 30, 300 for 30, 350 for 30,

900
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:32,320
come back down times eight. And that, you know, and that takes about an hour in between your

901
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:36,800
three minute sets. No, you just go up and come right back down. Okay. So you're right. So the

902
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:41,760
recovery is exactly. And, and that takes about, that takes about an hour and that'll fix your

903
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,040
wagon for a while. So you'll do, that'll be your hard day tomorrow. That'll be my hard day. And,

904
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:52,480
and I'll do that basically every other day or every third day. My easy days will be something

905
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:57,760
like, you know, like this morning, I, and I gotta, I want to go do 20 more minutes, not because I

906
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:03,360
need to do 20 minutes. I want to, because I wanted to watch the first bit of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

907
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:13,920
So my easy days are built around what, what documentary or, or, you know, how many times

908
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,360
can you watch the Mandalorian? How many Clint Eastwood movies can you watch that? And this

909
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:23,600
started during lockdown, right? So my easy days are 30 to 40 minutes of, of light cycling,

910
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:29,360
transitioning to rowing back and forth of around 30 to 40 minutes. Sometimes I do one, sometimes if

911
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:35,280
I come home from work and I do another one, but the goal there is, is, is an old concept called

912
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:40,880
active rest. So I'm not trying to get a real training effect. I'm trying to loosen up from

913
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,400
the day before it's worked out. Cause I'm sore that, you know, if you do what I describe,

914
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,520
you know, you warm up for 10 or 15 minutes, do, do 20 minutes of drop sets and,

915
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:55,120
and that type of intervals at the end, you will be sore, right? And so then, then what happens is,

916
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,760
is, is, you know, so you have to recover the next day. Now I'll do this for about six months and

917
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:04,480
then probably when it gets, starts getting dark again, I'll do what I did like last year, where,

918
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:09,520
where I start just doing kind of maintenance circuits in terms of the strength. So not,

919
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:15,200
not quite as, it may be only twice a week and I'll start doing longer rides. We have a Peloton and,

920
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,960
and I don't do any of the classes, but, but I started doing this hour of truth

921
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,720
to see how many Watts I could average for an hour.

922
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,400
Okay. What are you at?

923
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,960
It's who my best is. And I think, I think my best during lockdown last year was 360 average,

924
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,880
360 Watts for an hour.

925
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,320
Wow. Do you, do you think, do you, I mean, that's, that's obscenely high.

926
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:42,320
Well, and the things are calibrated pretty well. So, and I have, I have a Wattbike,

927
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,520
I got a lot of equipment. I got a Wattbike and I think they're pretty close. And if you,

928
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,000
if you look online, they claim they're close, right? And, and, and I know how, and I think

929
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,640
that, I think it's consistent with what I think my, I haven't measured my VO2 max in a while.

930
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,200
So I want to see if I get like 320 Watts next year.

931
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,480
What do you, what do you, what do you think your VO2 max is right now?

932
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,360
You know, well, I'll tell you, back when I was quite young, it was 5.4 liters a minute,

933
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:11,600
right? My guess is it's, my, my weight then was probably between 75, close to 80 kilos.

934
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,080
Okay.

935
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,680
So I was right at under 70.

936
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:18,640
I think my weight is now is probably about 95 kilos. Because I've actually made an effort

937
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:25,040
to gain some weight. And I think my max is probably 4.5 liters a minute would be my guess.

938
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,680
Something like that.

939
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:32,480
Yeah. I mean, that's still an amazing wattage under any circumstance.

940
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,760
Well, yeah, assuming the machine is okay. But I think it is because,

941
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,680
and remember when I'm doing those ladders that I was telling you about, those pyramids,

942
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,680
that's after I've done a heavy leg workout, you know, so my legs are pretty fatigued. I've done that.

943
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:53,040
But remember, I have some ability to because, you know, I'm a pretty good,

944
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,320
yeah, I became a pretty good, I didn't really start running until my senior high school.

945
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:03,760
So I started late. And I'm 6'4". And I tell people if, you know, if I come back in the

946
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,440
next life, I'll be a swimmer or rower because I used to show up with these tidy people.

947
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:07,840
Yeah.

948
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,600
So I was, I was, I'm the world's largest relatively good distance runner.

949
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,440
What's on your easy recovery day, Mike? Are you just paying attention to RPE?

950
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,360
Or are you looking at a split time on the rowing machine or as a low-rodded?

951
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:27,600
It's just all RPE. It's really just active rest, which is a lost concept.

952
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,200
Do you have a sense of what your heart rate is as a percentage of your max body?

953
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:37,040
No, I don't even measure it. No, I have no, and I get, I think it's probably based on the,

954
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,760
on the, you know, the hour of truth ride. And my wife got me a Peloton shirt that she had

955
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:49,680
printed hour of truth on it, which was kind of cool. But anyways, I think, I think Peter, my,

956
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:57,360
it's probably about 140 is my peak heart rate. That would be my guess. But, but again, I go with RPE,

957
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:05,600
I go to life suffer. And, and it's, but remember, it's unusual and, and, and, you know, it's unusual

958
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,240
to be able to do intervals on your own and really push it. Not everybody can do it. And that's why

959
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:16,320
you need a class or you need a coach or you need a group and so forth. But, but I'm lucky enough to

960
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:23,200
be able, able to do it in, in, yeah. So my training is really polarized. I mean, like really polarized.

961
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:30,160
So let's talk about folks who are listening to this who want to boost their VO2 max. Let's talk

962
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:36,640
about the different protocols that exist. I'll tell you what we typically tell patients to do,

963
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:42,080
which is kind of in my experience, one of the most efficient ways that you can do it,

964
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:46,240
but I'm curious as to what other ways. So we typically talk about a four by four, four on four.

965
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:52,240
Yeah, no, you're right there. So, so we'll tell people, and again, the easiest way that I

966
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:57,520
personally can do this is on a bike, on an incline. And it can't be a very steep incline. It's got to

967
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:03,360
be like 6% grade. I want to stay in the saddle and, but I never want the resistance to go away.

968
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:10,240
And I basically want to be in the saddle climbing against resistance for four minutes. And I use a

969
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:15,440
power meter and a heart rate. So I just want to keep the power as steady as I can. Invariably,

970
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:20,800
it dips in about the third minute, and then I can recover it in the fourth minute psychologically.

971
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,760
And then the recovery is four minutes of literally doing nothing, but rolling back to the starting

972
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:30,800
line. And then it's basically just repeat that. So, so, yeah, no, no, I'm with you. What I tell

973
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,160
people, for example, that have come and say, I want to run a faster marathon. I want to do this.

974
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,920
I want to do that, you know, and they're running a lot of miles. They need to get their VO2 max up.

975
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,160
And I tell them exactly what you've described. Sometimes I tell them five minutes and three

976
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:46,160
minutes rest, sometimes whatever. And people that are fitter sometimes only take, like I would only

977
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:52,400
take two minutes of rest. And that's just, but four times four is terrific. So you would do

978
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:58,160
something if you were thinking about running, I would tell people to do something that would be

979
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:04,720
right at their sort of 5k race pace, maybe a little faster, or, or you would do the first one

980
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,360
a little slower than your 5k race pace. The next one, you know, a little faster than that,

981
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,760
the next one, a little faster than the next one faster than your 5k race pace. And depending on

982
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,320
how fast you're running, if you're going pretty fast, then you would just jog in between. And if

983
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:23,600
you were, were not going so fast, you walked in between. So that would be the sort of thing that,

984
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:30,800
that I would describe to people. And the classic training, you know, among elite runners is,

985
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:37,920
is mile repeats, you know, people doing, you know, four or five times one mile. And then they

986
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,280
jog at a quarter mile or half mile in between. And I personally have seen really good runners.

987
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:50,320
I mean, it's, I've seen people's, you know, do, you know, four 30, four 25, four 20, four 15,

988
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:54,880
four 10, four Oh five, which is, but I mean, these were people getting ready for the Olympics, you

989
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:00,640
know? So, so, so, but, but those sorts of things, but sort of for the average person, right?

990
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:05,520
You know, the, the hard part that I think requires a little bit of coaching upfront is it's,

991
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,280
you know, you and I have done this our whole lives. So we sort of know what four minutes all

992
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:16,400
out feels like. Yeah, right. Exactly. And 30 seconds in, you shouldn't be hurting too much.

993
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:22,960
If you've gone out too hard. So it's, it takes a little bit of work to understand what, what

994
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:28,320
you're going for is a constant four minutes, but the, but the suffering is disproportionately in

995
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:33,440
the last 90 seconds. And Peter, you're, you're, you're exactly right. So I describe it as you,

996
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:37,920
when you're done, when you get done with the last one, the fourth one, you do not want to be bending

997
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:42,720
over you. If you'd gone a little bit of faster, you'd want to be bending over. So I call it the

998
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:48,240
no bend over rule. Interesting. And then what people have to recognize both for the four times

999
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:53,760
four minutes and within the four minutes is a good interval workout. And this sounds, you know,

1000
01:34:53,760 --> 01:35:00,880
completely masochistic is like putting your hand in warm water and then slowly increasing the

1001
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,840
temperature in the water to where you can barely stand it anymore and then leave it in for a while.

1002
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:13,840
And then you turn it down and let your hand cool off and do it again. And that's really

1003
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:19,680
what you described. And, and, you know, one of the things I think we've learned from the

1004
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:25,760
Cyclist is a terrific phrase called manage your suffering. You know, you need to learn to manage

1005
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:31,040
your suffering. And, and, and, and I think that's the other interesting thing about this type of

1006
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:37,440
training in, in, is, is to the extent, you know, people can have these sort of religious experiences

1007
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:43,680
exercising, this sort of interval training is one way to get them. That's what I would tell you.

1008
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:47,680
No, I completely agree. I mean, obviously we're cut from the same cloth in this way, but, but I think

1009
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:54,800
that there really is something wonderful about experiencing your limits and understanding that

1010
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:00,240
level of discomfort. And if you're able to maintain your rhythm and tempo, Peter, while you do it,

1011
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:06,640
that's when you can have these sorts of experiences. And, and, you know, I mean, one of the most

1012
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:10,960
beautiful things ever, and it wasn't a total endurance athlete, you know, even it was a little

1013
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,440
bit shorter, a couple of minutes, but to watch Michael Phelps win the butterfly and watch his

1014
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,920
stroke. He was a tree. He was good at everything, but he was especially good at the butterfly.

1015
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,480
And to watch, you know, most people stroke has fallen apart and they end up taking more

1016
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:30,560
strokes the last 50 of a 200 meter butterfly. And, you know, his stroke count, the second,

1017
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,680
third, and fourth lap didn't change because he had that rhythm, that tempo. And if you listen

1018
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:40,880
to the old school coaches talk about interval training, they're constantly talking about tempo.

1019
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:46,400
What is your rhythm? What is your tempo? And, and why you're doing it, why you're suffering,

1020
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,760
Peter, why you're pushing it while, while, while it's hurting, while it's burning.

1021
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,520
The goal was to not lose your form and not lose your tempo.

1022
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:59,120
You know, it's funny, I used to, I used to watch Michael Phelps train because before he kind of

1023
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:05,120
broke out in the early 2000s, I lived in Baltimore because I did my residency at Hopkins and he used

1024
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:11,600
to train at a place called North Baltimore Aquatic. Yeah, right. So, so watching now,

1025
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,480
Michael, of course, within the swimming world was already an unbelievable prodigy because he,

1026
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:22,000
he had gone to the Olympics in Sydney, placed 15 or something, which is quite young for a man.

1027
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,840
That's right. He was actually the youngest, he became the youngest male to ever set a world

1028
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:34,080
record in a time sport in early 01. Correct. When he set the record for the 15. Yeah.

1029
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:40,800
Set the record for the 200 fly. So, so watching this 16 year old swimming at North Baltimore

1030
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:47,600
Aquatic and BAC, which his signature event of course was the 200 fly. Now it's 200 long course

1031
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:54,960
butterfly. I would put that up there with the 200 breast and the 400 IM as the three worst races in

1032
01:37:54,960 --> 01:38:00,080
all of swimming. To me, it's like doing an 800 meteor intermediate hurdles on the track that

1033
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:04,640
event doesn't exist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, it's just, it's pure, it's insane suffer.

1034
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:12,640
But here's the thing, Mike, his training was almost never, you never once saw him do a 200

1035
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:23,040
fly. It was lots of 75s, lots of 75s. And his coach, Bob Bowman was really adamant about perfect

1036
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:27,600
form because if I were correct, Michael had an unusual rhythm, which is that he breathed on

1037
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,480
every stroke. And usually like when I swam butterfly, when most people swam butterfly,

1038
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,800
it was every other you would, you were head underwater for one stroke, head up for one,

1039
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:42,800
down for one. And, and Michael, I'm pretty sure he would breathe every stroke. But as you pointed out,

1040
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:48,960
no one's form could rival his. And that's why he, he was usually the last guy to hit the wall at the

1041
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:54,880
50 and, and, and yet would come back and just devour everybody. Well, and you see that with

1042
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,840
Edwin Moses, 13 steps between hurdles and the 400 hurdles in the late seventies with that innovation.

1043
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:05,040
And again, you see these people, you sell with Kim Chok, you're doing it for two hours,

1044
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:10,960
their ability to maintain this form and tempo. And as you watch it, as you watch it, Peter, you,

1045
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:17,120
you are awed by this sense of great effort and simultaneous relaxation. It's really,

1046
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:22,400
it's a real paradox. And, and, and when, and you, again, you see that, you see that in other sports

1047
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:28,160
too, you see it when the golfers get hot, how far they hit the ball, but it's, it's both violent and

1048
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:33,280
relaxed at the same time. You, you certainly, you know, you sit there and watch Steph Curry

1049
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:39,120
or Clay Thompson start launching balls. And, and, and, and it's just incredible, the tempo, the rhythm,

1050
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:47,520
the form, and, and, and, but, and the effort, but again, just how relaxed they are. It's just wild

1051
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:53,200
to think about even. Now, going back to our very, very recreational person who's never trained in

1052
01:39:53,200 --> 01:40:00,000
their life. We, we don't even, we don't use lactate testing on people at that level. We basically do

1053
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,080
the whole thing off RPE and we try to get 80% of their time, which might start out at two to three

1054
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:12,320
hours per week as we want you to be able to talk, but not enjoy it. Right. I don't want you to be any,

1055
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:17,440
I don't want you to be any higher than that. Right. And then once we build up a bit of a reserve

1056
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:21,920
in that, after maybe six months of that kind of training, we're sort of ready to move them to that

1057
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:32,080
next phase of, Hey, once a week, I want you to do kind of four on four off four rounds. Do you think

1058
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:38,480
that once a week doing those four hard intervals is sufficient to boost VO two max? It will increase

1059
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:42,880
it for sure. Yeah. In that vast majority of people, especially if they're doing the other stuff you're

1060
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,840
talking about. And I think that, that what I really liked about what you describe and what people

1061
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:52,800
don't realize, especially when you're going to advocate relatively hard training for citizens,

1062
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,880
is that sometimes you have to train before you can really train. Yeah. That's right. You got to train

1063
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:03,600
to train. Yeah. Yeah. You got to get, and you certainly have seen that in some, some studies

1064
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,320
with older people that are really, you know, 60, 70 years old is that they almost have to do three

1065
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:13,520
or four or six months of sort of pre-training before they are fit enough to train hard. So I think

1066
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,160
you're spot on there. And I, my guess is after they they've been able to do it for, you know,

1067
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:22,400
once a week for a while, you build them up to two times per week. I think the one thing that

1068
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:27,200
people need to recognize, and this comes from a man named Stan James, who I think is still

1069
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:31,440
practicing medicine. He's in his nineties was a, one of the pioneers of sports medicine,

1070
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:35,840
orthopedic surgery, and he's not operating anymore, but he, the last I checked, he was alive

1071
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:41,040
and well out in Eugene, Oregon. And he, he worked with coach Bill Bowerman, you know, the, the

1072
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,240
great organ coach, found one of the founders of Nike, the waffle shoe guy, you know, and they got

1073
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:52,160
into this hard, easy thing, which is, is sort of what I do. And I, and, and, uh, you know, Dr.

1074
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:56,960
James would tell you that once people start doing more than about five or six hard, hard sessions

1075
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:02,080
every two weeks, you're beginning to ask for some sort of load management issue, whether it's

1076
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:06,880
orthopedics, whether it's just your fatigue, whether it's this, whether it's that. So I do think

1077
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:13,680
that, that, um, you know, you want to do something literally. I mean, I can't remember the last day

1078
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:21,040
I didn't do anything. It's probably been, you know, years, but, but, but my guess is the,

1079
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:27,680
the number of times I do something hard is, you know, 120, 130 times per year. And I, and my

1080
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:34,480
guess is I never go more than a week without doing something relatively intense. When you think about,

1081
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:39,840
about these sort of exceptional elite athletes, the Chokis of the world, do you believe they have

1082
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:46,400
a finite number of exceptional performances in them? You know, I, I think people used to sort

1083
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:53,840
of think that, but I think what's happened now is that, um, uh, you know, people used to drift into

1084
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,960
the, into the, into the world rankings and they'd last, you know, maybe, uh, two Olympics. So they'd

1085
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:04,560
last, uh, you know, uh, six, seven years. So they'd come in, kind of emerge right before one Olympiad,

1086
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,760
do well, do well on the next one and kind of fade. But I think there's, there's, there's, uh,

1087
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:15,680
two, two things that have really changed. The first is, is that, that again, sports medicine is better.

1088
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,560
So people do get injured. They can do things about it. I think the second thing is just,

1089
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:25,600
it's been, it's become so professionalized is, is people can, that are really, really good can

1090
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:32,400
now make enough money to make it worth their while to continue. And, and, you know, you see this in

1091
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:38,320
terms of the age of Olympians where, where, you know, you used to have, uh, you know, used to be

1092
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:43,520
very unusual to have women over age 20 and swimming. There was no college swimming. There was none of

1093
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:47,680
this. There was none of that. So it was a lot of teenagers. Now you see that drifting up and you

1094
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:54,800
see people like Katie O'Deckie having extended careers, you know, uh, Phelps going 2000, 2004,

1095
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:01,120
eight, 12, and going to five Olympics. Yeah. That would have been inconceivable previously for

1096
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:07,280
swimmers, you know, because people, you know, people hung around and, and maybe stayed for one

1097
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,760
additional Olympics. And when they got done after college, sometimes too, but, but eventually they,

1098
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:16,960
they had to go do get a job. But, but again, among the most elite who can now monetize this

1099
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,440
people can last longer. And you see it also in, in quote, the major unquote professional sports,

1100
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,880
you know, before orthopedic surgery was good and, and so forth. And, and every knee surgery was an

1101
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:35,280
adventure. You know, somebody like Tom Brady, Brady, his career would have been over in 2009

1102
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:40,080
and, and why keep, or, or it would have been attenuated. And, and the other thing, Peter,

1103
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:43,920
is why keep, you know, if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year, why keep playing?

1104
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:48,720
If you're making, you know, 20, 30 million or whatever, 30, whatever the number is,

1105
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:54,880
you know, why not keep playing? And you look at, you look at, at, you know, again, uh,

1106
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:00,480
in, in sports like running, swimming, cycling, you know, there, there's less of a kind of a

1107
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:05,120
journeyman group. But if you look at, at, at, you know, the NBA, the NFL, major league baseball,

1108
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,680
the salary scales are pretty good. And if, if people can play another couple of years,

1109
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:13,520
you know, this can be millions of dollars, millions of dollars for them. So they're very

1110
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:20,160
motivated in, uh, uh, to do this, you know, so if you can be the eighth man on an NBA team and

1111
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:25,120
give people 15, 20 quality minutes a game, you know, you're going to have a job for a long time.

1112
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:29,200
And again, if you're LeBron, you know, who apparently spent some huge amount of money on

1113
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:36,560
training and, uh, cook and all that other stuff is, is, uh, is, you know, I mean, if you start

1114
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:44,080
thinking about spending X per year for a, you know, a 40 X paycheck, why not? Why stop?

1115
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:52,240
So where do you think we are today, Mike, in, um, performance enhancing drugs in sports? So,

1116
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:57,680
so cycling is probably the sport I would follow the closest of the major sports. I mean, I guess

1117
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:04,720
I follow swimming, uh, as well, though not nearly as much as I did for sort of 15 years prior. Um,

1118
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:11,680
but, but you know, I think when you go back and look at the cycling data, and I love the way Lance

1119
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:16,240
talks about this, right? You know, I think he's very open, right? To say, look, as long as there

1120
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:21,440
has been a tour de France, there has been a graying of the line, right? But there is a difference

1121
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:27,040
between the kind of high octane cheating that was done in Lance's era and sort of the low octane

1122
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:32,240
cheating that was done in Eddie Merck's era when they were, you know, using a little bit of upset.

1123
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:37,840
Here's what I would say about where we are with doping. So the testing has gotten better,

1124
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:43,440
both in terms of the frequency of testing and the, uh, you know, the actual chemistry of the

1125
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:50,480
testing of the machines, the analytics. Yeah. The ability to detect. Yeah. Yeah. Um, if you

1126
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:54,960
look at the way, what's called an abnormal test is called, it's not like what we call

1127
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:01,520
an abnormal test or an out of range test in clinical medicine. There, there are typically

1128
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,720
many standard deviations above average for these things. And they're typically designed. So there's

1129
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:11,200
not a lot of false, false positives. They don't want to have any false positives. So that gives

1130
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:17,920
people a room, some room to micro dose. And that's why you have relatively few positive tests,

1131
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:23,680
but occasionally they'll be people, you know, caught through investigations, judicial mechanisms,

1132
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:29,680
the police, and historically many of the biggest busts have been the police. So I think what I

1133
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:35,200
would simply say is that the era of industrial strength doping is over, you know, people,

1134
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:39,520
people doing like the East Germans did and androgenizing females to the extent that they

1135
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:44,800
really look like men. So I think that that is, is done. So I think there is still.

1136
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,200
But sorry, Mike, you say that even in light of what the Russians did as recently as less than

1137
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,680
a decade ago. And I think, I think what the Russians did was again, relatively low dose

1138
01:47:54,640 --> 01:48:01,040
by comparison. So I think there's plenty of room for microdosing and plenty of room for the kinds

1139
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:06,880
of manipulation, systemic manipulation, if there's a motivated government to do it. And there's plenty

1140
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,680
of room, you know, for other forms of corruption. So, so, but I do think that the industrial strength

1141
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:17,920
doping has largely been quote, stop permitted. I think there are probably a bunch of novel compounds

1142
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:24,080
that are out there, you know, small peptides that cause this to be released or that to be released,

1143
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:29,760
which would be very, very difficult to detect. They'd have vanishingly short half-lives and so

1144
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,960
forth. And they would just boost your endogenous production of hormone X, Y or Z, you know,

1145
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:40,000
something like a growth hormone releasing factor or, or some sort of, you know, something that

1146
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:46,720
caused testosterone levels to go up or so forth. So, so I think that, that, that it's a cat and

1147
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:53,040
mouse game. And you're always going to, I think, I think for the kind of the big three amphetamines,

1148
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:59,920
EPO slash blood doping in anabolic steroids slash growth hormone, I think that, that the testing has

1149
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:06,320
gotten better and industrial strength doping is over. I think we, we don't know what we don't know

1150
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:11,840
about these novel compounds. And I think what we learned from the ball code situation is that

1151
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:17,120
there are all sorts of, you know, clever bathtub chemists who can make all sorts of things,

1152
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:22,960
you know, at home in the garage, wherever it is in, in, in, in a very unregulated environment.

1153
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:28,080
And the barrier to entry for that kind of a do it yourself sort of stuff is quite low.

1154
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,920
You can buy, you know, all sorts of laboratory equipment and reagents

1155
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:36,000
and all sorts of things. So you don't have to be, you know, a big pharma house to make,

1156
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,920
make interesting things. Like that's why I'd say we are with doping.

1157
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,640
How familiar are you with, with Balco and the, and the agency?

1158
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:43,920
Balco and Patrick Arnold.

1159
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,680
You know Patrick?

1160
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:49,920
I don't know Patrick, but I know who he is. And the tragedy of Patrick Arnold, this tremendous,

1161
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,160
you know, kind of a guy with a master's degree, I believe in organic chemistry,

1162
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:59,040
you know, tragic tragedy of Patrick Arnold, he wasn't working for, wasn't working for

1163
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:04,880
one of the big pharma companies making anti aging and isochromania compounds. That's the,

1164
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:10,880
you know, where he had, he had been, was making, you know, unusual,

1165
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,720
you know, chemical chemically modified androgens.

1166
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:20,560
Yeah. I actually, I've met Patrick a number of times, I've spent a lot of time speaking with him

1167
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:28,400
and in a very unemotional way and just a very frank way he can explain in great detail exactly

1168
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,000
how he modified these androgens.

1169
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:35,840
No. And the guy has encyclopedic knowledge, apparently, of everything that's ever been

1170
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:41,120
synthesized in the androgen field and what it does in terms of half-life and that metabolism

1171
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:47,360
and that sort of thing. And then I think if you think about Victor Conte Jr., you know, a refugee

1172
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:54,320
from the tower of power, junior college educated rock slash jazz musician, who's one of the great

1173
01:50:54,320 --> 01:51:02,000
auto didex ever out there. And, you know, so I think with both of these individuals, step back

1174
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:09,520
from the legal ethical ramifications and say, what do they know? And try to be a little bit

1175
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:15,200
objective about that. And then, you know, with doping, you get into all sorts of other sort of

1176
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:23,600
areas, you know, you know, what was in the in the in the in the cultures those people were operating

1177
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:30,640
in, what was considered the cultural norm? I mean, you know, and Lance was not the only person doing

1178
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:35,760
industrial strength doping. Was he doing it better than other people if there were six ways to dope

1179
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,200
and and person X was doing two and you were doing three, was Lance doing all six, that sort of thing.

1180
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:47,840
And so I think that that the other thing people have to recognize about doping

1181
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:55,120
is that you're always going to in these incredibly competitive situations with these

1182
01:51:55,120 --> 01:52:01,360
incredibly competitive people with competitive organizations or people that have, you know,

1183
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:05,760
foreign policy, you know, our country is better than yours because we want more medals,

1184
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:11,280
is that there's always going to be some sort of arms race mentality. And you see it with training,

1185
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,560
you know, if you're in there lifting an hour a day, I'm going to go lift an hour and 10 minutes a day.

1186
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:20,080
And so where does it stop? Do you still think that growth hormone, human growth hormone,

1187
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:24,640
which is, of course, not something that can readily be tested for, is still one of the more

1188
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:30,320
utilized agents, probably even today for performance enhancement? You know, I think there's

1189
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,160
probably some of it going on. You know, I think that my guess is people are probably have drifted

1190
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:42,080
back to more short acting androgens, low dose, short acting androgens and hope for the best.

1191
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:51,280
And that would be my guess. The same would be true with low dose EPO and or, and or, you know,

1192
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:57,840
sort of related compounds or other factors. You know, but again, when you when you when you learn

1193
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:03,680
about growth hormone is typically because person X says that they're sending FedEx package, you

1194
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:11,280
know, trainer X or source exit has been sending FedEx packages to athlete Y, you know, that kind

1195
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:16,160
of thing. Yeah. So as opposed to. Yeah. And I think that's that's really the bottom line is it's so

1196
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:24,160
much of this is is, you know, and again, again, like the Russian, so much of this has a judicial,

1197
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:31,040
judicial slash, you know, investigatory element to it when you when you get to the big scandals.

1198
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:35,120
Why do you think some sports seem more effective than others? So, for example,

1199
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:42,800
swimming as a general rule seems less impacted than than than, say, cycling or even running,

1200
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:49,280
even though the demands are still pretty high. Hard to know. And how cultures had one way or the

1201
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:58,160
next is is, you know, I lead, you know, is I feel like that's bones, Dr. Bones in Star Trek.

1202
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:03,120
I'm a doctor, not a, you know what I mean? I'm a doctor, not a sociologist, Peter. And I think,

1203
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:08,560
you know, in groups, out groups and the things that those folks, a sociologist and tribalism,

1204
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:12,800
the people who think about, you know, tribalistic behaviors, what's normal, what's not normal,

1205
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:22,000
and so forth. I think that that's really, really, really, really key to understanding that sort of

1206
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,120
thing. Key to understanding that sort of thing. So we started this discussion, Mike, by talking

1207
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:32,560
about the miracles of exercise. Correct. We went through all of these things that exercise is doing

1208
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:40,480
physiologically, and how the net impact of these things is so profound. Correct. On the length of

1209
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:46,480
your life and the quality of your life. There's no shortage of pharma companies out there that are

1210
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:54,000
trying to understand how can those benefits be put into a pill? Exercise pill, sure. Exactly.

1211
01:54:55,120 --> 01:55:02,960
What is your level of optimism around the idea that some of the benefits of exercise could be

1212
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:10,080
basically captured by a pharmaceutical strategy? So there's a couple things there,

1213
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:18,400
Peter. One is the efforts for exercise mimetics so far have been primarily things that increase

1214
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:26,400
mitochondrial biosynthesis. And that appears like it at least works in animal models. And then you

1215
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:30,800
always, how do you translate it from one to the next? But as I pointed out, exercise, sure, it

1216
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:36,080
makes your mitochondria better or makes more of them. But making your mitochondria better isn't

1217
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:40,000
going to make your autonomic nervous system better, isn't going to make your blood pressure better.

1218
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:44,960
Isn't going to necessarily make the lining of your blood vessels better, so on and so forth. So it's

1219
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:50,160
not going to make your heart bigger, so on and so forth. So I think at least so far, at least so far,

1220
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:59,440
these have been sort of one trick ponies. And while you might be able to get some benefits

1221
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:05,360
for people that are wheelchair bound or whatever, although even those folks, I mean people that are

1222
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:12,880
quadriplegics, let's put it that way, wheelchair bound or can exercise for some of the reasons that

1223
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:18,880
may be helpful. I think the jury is really still out. And I think that I'm not particularly

1224
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,920
enthusiastic about it. I don't think you're ever going to get one that does any more than a little

1225
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:29,360
bit. I think more interestingly, I like to tell people at some level there's already an exercise

1226
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:35,040
medic out there. It's called the poly pill. If you look at the data on people who get

1227
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:42,880
a combination one pill a day of low dose statins, low dose blood pressure meds, and maybe one or two

1228
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:49,200
other other components, it causes pretty nice reductions in risk factors in most people.

1229
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:58,640
Because the doses are low, the side effects tend to be low and so forth. But again, none of this

1230
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:06,000
is patentable. There's no market for it. But if people don't want to exercise, can exercise,

1231
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:13,760
or whatever, I think a better choice than trying to find some mythical exercise of a medic is to

1232
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:18,480
use a poly pill, which would do the same thing. You give them a statin, their cholesterol goes

1233
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,440
down. And maybe their endothelial function gets better. You do a tiny bit of metformin,

1234
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:28,480
maybe their glucose tolerance gets better. You do a bit of beta blockers, their heart rate is lower.

1235
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:36,320
So again, I'm not advocating this. But there's all sorts of data out there that a poly pill

1236
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:50,320
is a legitimate, whatever that means, potential public health strategy for lifestyle diseases.

1237
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:55,520
I would encourage people to exercise and do the sorts of things you're talking about.

1238
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,680
But I think poly pills have been understudied.

1239
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:05,120
So, Mike, what is it you're most excited about right now? What is the question you're most

1240
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:06,800
interested in trying to answer?

1241
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:10,240
I'm excited about a lot of things. So we've got some interesting data with Sarah Baker

1242
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:16,480
on sex differences in blood pressure regulation. I'm quite interested in human performance.

1243
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:20,960
As you know, Peter, the first thing they teach in medical school is that a right shift in the

1244
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:26,400
oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve is good for you at altitude. Well, all animals that are

1245
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:32,560
genetically adapted over centuries, millennia, to high altitude, llamas, the birds that fly

1246
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,200
over Mount Everest and so forth, are left shifted. We've been doing some really cool hypoxia studies

1247
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:42,160
and people with rare left shifted hemoglobin. I'm super interested in that just as sort of

1248
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,520
a physiological question.

1249
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:47,760
Can you explain to folks what the right and left shift looks like on the hemoglobin dissociation

1250
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:48,320
curve?

1251
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:53,040
A right shift, you know, think of a curvilinear situation or an S-shaped curve,

1252
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:59,680
kind of an italicized curve. And so the idea is that if you shift it to the right,

1253
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:06,480
the red stuff, the hemoglobin in your blood doesn't hold on to the oxygen. So it releases it and can

1254
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:11,920
give the oxygen to the tissue. And that's great if it's hypoxic. Now, the problem with that

1255
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:15,280
is it's harder for that kind of hemoglobin to get the oxygen out of the lung.

1256
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:23,040
And animals like llamas and like these incredible athletes called the bar-headed goose that fly

1257
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:29,600
over Mount Everest. Yeah. And without acclimation, they're living in the plains of Mongolia. One day

1258
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:34,880
they just fly over Mount Everest and go to India. They're left shifted because they prefer to make

1259
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:39,360
sure that they can pick up the oxygen out of the air in their lungs at very high altitude.

1260
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:45,680
So we have a family of people and some other subjects that we've studied that are left

1261
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:52,880
shifted. And it's very interesting. Meaning there is a family of people who genetically shift left

1262
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:57,920
instead of shift right. Right. Correct. And there's all sorts of rare hemoglobin variants.

1263
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:01,680
And these just are not, you know, they're not like sickle cell or anything like that.

1264
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:05,920
So what's interesting, it's very interesting Peter to be sitting in the lab, having somebody

1265
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:12,800
breathing 10% oxygen talking to you. These left shifted people do that. It's crazy. It's just wild.

1266
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,560
What is the FiO2 at the top of Everest, by the way, just for comparison.

1267
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:23,360
The FiO2 at the top of Everest is well, the barometric pressure is about 250. So the 21%

1268
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:32,000
of 250. So roughly about 50. So once you get into your lung, I think arterial is about in the 30s.

1269
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:33,440
Wow.

1270
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:41,680
Yeah. And so 10% would be, and certainly at 15%, which is 3000 meters, these people exercise like,

1271
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:46,720
like, no, you know, they do fine. So I'm very interested in that. And then as I mentioned,

1272
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:55,040
you know, before we went on is through a weird collection of events. When the pandemic struck

1273
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:01,520
in March and early April of 2020, I somehow became the principal investigator of the US

1274
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:08,160
convalescent plasma program, a program that was initially designed to facilitate in 5,000 patients

1275
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:14,560
compassionate use of convalescent plasma plasma from recovered antibody rich plasma from recovered

1276
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:20,480
COVID patients that we would give to give to people who had disease and hopefully the

1277
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:24,400
antibodies would help them. And they're through all sorts of twists and turns. We ended up doing

1278
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:29,760
over a hundred thousand people. We found evidence. If we gave people a whole lot of antibody early

1279
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:34,400
in the course of disease, we made them better. We also found some evidence that it was probably very

1280
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:40,000
helpful in people that were immune suppressed. And that has been the gift that keeps giving. So at age

1281
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:47,440
60, you know, one 62 63, I kept kind of a new career in immunology and infectious disease.

1282
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:53,200
And so we're pursuing that and we're especially interested in that Peter, because whenever

1283
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:59,840
COVID sort of finally winds down, about two to 3% of the population is what we call B cell

1284
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:04,800
deficient. So B cells are the cells in your body that make antibodies help you respond to fight

1285
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:10,800
the virus or respond to the vaccine. And about two or 3% of the people don't have any or don't have

1286
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:16,640
very many. And those people continue will continue to get COVID and other forms of infectious disease.

1287
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:21,920
And antibody therapy is essential to help those folks. And I was telling you,

1288
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,160
you know, I'm very happy that we've published papers in high profile journals. But

1289
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:31,760
we just learned yesterday from People magazine of all places that the actor Jeff Bridges,

1290
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:38,720
you know, the dude from the big Lebowski he, dude himself, the dude himself had gotten lymphoma,

1291
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:44,240
gotten drugs that that depleted his B cells, which is typical for lymphoma patients,

1292
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,960
got COVID, he could not clear the COVID and responded to convalescent plasma.

1293
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,880
What's the total volume of plasma you need to give a patient in that setting?

1294
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:56,080
If you get really high, tighter stuff, two to 400 mls.

1295
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:57,760
That's a one time treatment?

1296
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:02,080
Yeah, typically. Sometimes we give people more. And what's been helpful Peter is that

1297
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,120
we now have people that have been both vaccinated and they've had a breakthrough infection,

1298
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:11,520
or they've had an infection and been vaccinated, right? So they have hybrid immunity. And those

1299
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:19,120
people make, you know, really, really, their plasma has a whole, whole lot of antibodies in them.

1300
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:25,600
And they're broad spectrum. So they cover all the variants. And they almost anticipate future

1301
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:32,240
variants because of the way the immune system works. And as a sort of a sloppy replicator.

1302
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,360
And so they cover a lot of the variants that cover potential future variants and as monoclonal

1303
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:43,360
antibodies, which have been super helpful during the pandemic, as those get less effective due to

1304
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:50,000
escape variants, this very high, tighter plasma is still available. So, so we're back doing exercise

1305
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,120
studies. We're back writing papers about exercise and doing our regular physiology. But I think,

1306
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:00,240
yeah, this antibody therapy has really got, you know, took a bite out of me. And it's, it's,

1307
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,800
it's like what Jim Bowden said, the great pitcher, you know, you spend your life

1308
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:09,360
gripping the ball and thinking about your grip on the ball. And in reality,

1309
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:12,960
it was the other way around the ball had a grip on you. So, you know, I've been thinking a lot

1310
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,800
about antibodies and maybe antibodies have been thinking about me because it's really hard to

1311
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:24,480
stop thinking about it because it's so interesting. And, and we get reports back to us from, you know,

1312
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:28,480
not famous patients that are very similar to what we've heard of Mr. Bridges. So we're

1313
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:34,640
quite excited to pursue these solutions for our immune suppressed patients. And I'm especially,

1314
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:39,600
you know, when I started medical school in 1982, those sorts of patients, you know,

1315
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:44,000
their life expectancy was quite low. And now our patients with hemolygmacy, multiple myeloma,

1316
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,160
lymphoma, leukemias, a lot of those people live a long, long time.

1317
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:54,560
And so how long after a person is infected and recovers from infection,

1318
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:58,320
are they a suitable plasma donor? Within about two to three weeks.

1319
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:01,760
And how long? And then like, when does that window close?

1320
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:08,240
Certainly, it goes on for three or four months, you know, probably up to six months.

1321
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:11,120
And it would probably reopen if they got boosted, that sort of thing.

1322
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,720
But it only, you only get sufficient antibodies from people who have had the actual infection,

1323
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:22,240
not from people who just go get a booster. What's happened is, is that that's been initially

1324
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:27,200
because there were no vaccines, we only had people that had the normal normal infection.

1325
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:33,120
Since the vaccines have become widely available in the last almost 18 months now, or 15, 16 months,

1326
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:36,640
we've now been able to get people who've had both. And those people, the people that have had both

1327
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:43,760
are really the super donors, you know, and we can work with those people to come back in and get

1328
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:48,320
multiple units. We collect our own blood at Mayo. We have a terrific blood bank here locally, but

1329
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,320
but they're using it at Hopkins, they're using it at Harvard, using it at Einstein,

1330
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:56,960
a lot of other big places. We're working with the societies, the Food and Drug Administration,

1331
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:03,360
and others like the Lymphoma and Leukemia Lymphoma Society, the CLL Group, Infectious Disease,

1332
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:08,560
or excuse me, Immune Deficiency Foundation, to make sure that we have this available for their,

1333
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:13,840
for those sorts of patients. They're doing this at scale in France to about 50 patients a week,

1334
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:20,560
which would be about 300 a week in the US if you account for, you know, population differences.

1335
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,640
So that's one of the things we're quite interested in. This is something people can donate. It's a

1336
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:29,360
way for people to give back. Are you able to find sufficient donors? Are there enough donors?

1337
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:33,600
Yeah, yeah, there's sufficient there. Again, because there's so many people who've been

1338
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:38,400
both infected and broken through, there's a, you know, there's always logistical issues

1339
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:41,840
in terms of getting a person to the blood collecting center, getting it here, getting it

1340
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:47,840
there, but availability should be pretty high. So, and with plasma, do you still have to do a type

1341
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:53,040
and cross? Yeah, you still got, it's got to still be typed and crossed and people are subject to,

1342
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:58,000
they have to be eligible to otherwise donate blood. Yeah. Okay. But during that, during the

1343
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,520
peak of plasma use prior to the vaccines and prior to the monofamals, you know, 20, 30, 40,000 units

1344
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:08,960
a week were being used in the country. And in the weeks when more plasma was being used, the death

1345
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:13,680
rate two weeks later was lower. So there's a pretty nice correlation between that. So that's

1346
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:18,080
been, but, but again, I think, you know, we've talked about training, we've talked about, you

1347
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:21,840
know, a little bit about coaching, we've talked about, you know, participation in support and so

1348
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:29,360
forth. But I think one of the things that really helped me, you know, work with the government and

1349
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:35,680
work with our team to, to instead of do a 5,000 person demonstration project, do a, do a, really

1350
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:40,880
a treatment registry and over a hundred thousand or a hundred thousand patients was the organizational

1351
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:47,360
skills I learned from my coaches who, and I, and I used to joke with the, uh, higher ups in the food

1352
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:50,800
and drug administration. They'd say, well, how did you do that? I'd say I'm a recovering physical

1353
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:55,920
educator. And that was always, uh, always got, I was always good for a laughter and at least a few

1354
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:04,720
dark hours. Last, last question, Mike, given your long standing history in athletics, both personally

1355
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:11,520
and professionally, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Americans based

1356
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:19,920
on the level of physical activity that we, we see? Uh, we need to do something. We need to do

1357
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:25,440
something. And I think it really reflects our society in general. I think that you have,

1358
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:32,720
you know, for lack of a better word, upper middle-class kids who have access to superb coaching,

1359
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:39,920
to superb facilities and to programmatic things. I think we've got a tremendous problem with play

1360
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:46,720
and unstructured play. And I think we've got a whole lot of people that are, are things that,

1361
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:50,080
when I was growing up in the sixties and seventies that were done through the park,

1362
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:55,040
park district and the school school district, I think a lot of those opportunities are, uh,

1363
02:08:56,400 --> 02:09:00,880
are, uh, have followed by the wayside. I mean, we used to have, you know, the kids who were

1364
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:07,040
college athletes used to come back and have open gym all over Tucson when I was a kid. And there's

1365
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:12,800
no open gym at the high schools in Rochester, Minnesota, a rich community in the summer. And,

1366
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,960
and I mean, the, and the advantage of open gym was, Hey, you know, you got people off the street and

1367
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:24,560
they were doing things and, and, um, you got better athletes and, and, and, uh, and, and, you know,

1368
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:31,120
even the, and the police knew where we were, uh, which, which, which they're always very pleased

1369
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,520
about, you know, if they know that they, if they know that all the high energy boys are in one place,

1370
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:41,040
it makes their life a little easier as well. So, so I think, uh, yeah, I think it's a real problem.

1371
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:46,080
So, so I think we'll have these incredible performances by the kids who have access,

1372
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:53,280
but I think that, that what we're doing in the rest of the world is, is, is problematic. And,

1373
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:59,760
and, and, you know, if I could, I guess if I could do anything, uh, I'd start a national open gym

1374
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:05,920
movement, uh, you know, uh, winter, summer, whatever. Cause a lot of, we have a lot of

1375
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:09,040
nice facilities that are used just to, you know, a limited number of times per day.

1376
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:13,920
Yeah. Could you imagine if you were Czar and you could sort of do anything and you just said,

1377
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:18,560
no matter what it, no matter what your lot is in life, right? If you're a school child, if you're

1378
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:22,320
correct, a person who works in an office, if you're a person who works in,

1379
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:28,880
we somehow rearrange the day such that every person has a mandatory one hour activity.

1380
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:33,520
Right. You, you could make it exercise, right? You could make it, you, you, you can go to the gym for

1381
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:38,080
an hour, but, but it could also be, look at a minimum, you got to go out and walk.

1382
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:41,600
Well, you know, it's interesting you mentioned that because, uh, in our department, uh,

1383
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:47,120
with, with, uh, remote work and so forth, this has broken element, but we had a number of

1384
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:51,600
secretaries, uh, uh, terrific, you know, all of them, they were all women, middle aged women.

1385
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:58,160
And we have this huge sort of, uh, you know, deep bunker system with the bowels of the hospital

1386
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:02,720
with these huge hallways. And it's about a mile around the place. And, and these, uh, these,

1387
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:06,560
these folks would go down and walk at lunch and they're literally, you know, they'd bring,

1388
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:10,320
bring their tennis shoes to work and they, they would meet up with their pals and, uh,

1389
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:16,880
you know, they'd go do 30, 40 minutes a day of, of laps at lunchtime, uh, with the secretaries

1390
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:22,560
all over the hospital. And it was, uh, I think terrific for them. Uh, yeah, I think it was a

1391
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:27,680
social event for them. And, and I think that they solved a lot of problems too. And they actually

1392
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:34,560
made them way more productive. I believe it. Well, like, as I said at the outset, I've enjoyed reading

1393
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:40,160
the papers for, yeah, for more than two decades and I'll continue to do so. And it's

1394
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:46,960
it's been great to chat and hopefully we can meet in person at some point and do a workout together.

1395
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:51,680
What do you live now? Austin or someplace? Yeah, I live in Austin. Yeah. Now Eddie Coyle at the

1396
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:56,080
University of Texas is a good friend of mine. So yeah, I look forward to it. Yeah. Well, it's funny.

1397
02:11:56,080 --> 02:12:00,400
I, I have been meaning to, to get ahold of him and I'd like to have him on the podcast as well.

1398
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:05,840
Because Eddie's quite a guy. Yep. Eddie's quite a guy. Yeah, exactly. All right, Peter. Thanks

1399
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:18,080
much. Yep. All right. Thanks. Bye-bye.
