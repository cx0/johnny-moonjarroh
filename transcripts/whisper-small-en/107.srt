Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast, my

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,400
website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level,

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,560
at the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,440
today's episode. Welcome back to another special COVID-19 episode of the Drive. Joining me on this

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
episode is author and historian John Berry. John is the author of arguably one of the most

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,080
important books I've ever read in my life, The Transformed Cell. And we talk about that very

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,720
briefly at the outset, but that's not the reason we speak today. Rather today, we were discussing

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,280
a book that John wrote in 2004, The New York Times bestseller, The Great Influenza, the story

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,760
of the deadliest pandemic in history. We talk about a lot of things here, obviously related

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,240
to the Spanish flu. Many of you have probably heard about this somewhat in the previous couple

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,240
of months. Obviously, this was on a per population basis, probably the greatest pandemic in human

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,200
history, perhaps comparable only to the Black Plague. But of course, it has many parallels to

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,840
the pandemic we are in now. I think history will show that the current pandemic is not a fraction

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,440
of the Spanish flu, but nevertheless, there are parallels that can be drawn. This is a discussion

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,200
that goes into many of the details of the pandemic, which is complicated because it really had three

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,640
separate waves and we get into some of the history of what may have accounted for that. The other

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,160
thing I found interesting about this discussion is that there were a number of things that John had

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,840
changed his mind on from when he wrote the book. And that to me is always the marker of a great

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,160
thinker is someone who can go where the data go and not necessarily be wed to something that they

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,560
put in print. And I think anybody who's ever tried to write something down and put something out

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,560
there, it does become a little bit harder to go back and look at that and realize that maybe you

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,280
didn't look at it correctly. But certainly when it comes to, for example, the origin of the Spanish

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,400
flu, John's thinking has changed and we do get into that. Again, I'll keep the intro brief. I think

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,280
the discussion will speak for itself. And so without further delay, please enjoy my conversation

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,080
with John Berry.

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:49,320
John, it is such an honor to be sitting here talking with you because as I alluded to in the

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,680
email when I randomly reached out to you last week, you are someone whose work I've been familiar

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,640
with for a very long time because a book that you wrote with my mentor, Steve Rosenberg, has

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,240
arguably been one of the most influential books in my life, The Transformed Cell.

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,240
Kind of you to say, I give Steve full credit for that book. He didn't need me. It's the only thing

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,640
I've ever collaborated on in my life. He was very generous in giving me credit for that. But I did

37
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,320
learn for those of you who don't know Steve, we're talking about Steve Rosenberg, who is at the

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,320
National Cancer Institute and was one of the leading pioneers in immunotherapy, developed,

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,880
I guess, the first immunotherapy that actually worked for cancer. He also was the lead

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,480
investigator on the first approved gene therapy experiments in the United States.

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,440
I guess the world too, in terms of approval, there were a couple of disapproved experiments

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:55,960
prior to that. Yeah. And so that book was published in one or 92, right? Yeah. Yes.

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,160
So I didn't come across it until 1997. It was in my first year of medical school.

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,320
I read it and it's just one of those moments that I think people have once in a while in life. And

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,280
it just sort of changed everything for me. It gave me a complete sense of how I wanted to think about

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,720
the world and problem solving and all these sorts of things. And I read it probably five times. When

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,720
we're done with the podcast, I'm going to show you my original copy because three years later,

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,240
I would actually get a copy from Steve signed. I have since purchased a dozen copies whenever

49
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,280
I find one on eBay or Amazon. This is an embarrassing thing to admit. I would insist

50
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,760
anyone I dated read the book. I just felt like they needed to understand that degree of obsession.

51
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,720
And that definitely minimized the number of dates I had to go on, but it was incredible. And then,

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,920
and then as I mentioned to you earlier, I went and spent time with Steve in my third year of medical

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,080
school and then went there for two years later. And it's, I still view my time at NIH as one of

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,360
the most blissful periods of my life because it's a period where you could be completely immersed in

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,600
trying to solve a problem. And when you're at that age and you have no other responsibilities,

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,640
it's magical. It is. I haven't talked to Steve lately, as you probably know, he and Tony Fauci,

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,880
very close friends. They arrived, I think on the same day. I didn't realize it was that close.

58
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,120
That's interesting. Oh yeah, they're quite tight. Let's talk a little bit about how that, you

59
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,560
basically got a doctorate level course in immunology in the late 80s, early 90s. And then

60
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,960
a little over a decade later, you would go on to write arguably the greatest account of the

61
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,560
forgotten pandemic. How did you get interested in the Spanish flu? Well, first, I don't think

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,880
that's a high bar. There aren't that many books about the pandemic. So I would hope that you'd

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,040
say the greatest on the pandemic, considering the paucity of competition. It's a funny thing.

64
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,840
I wanted to write a book and go into this and move one of the acknowledgments, but there were

65
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,120
four different acknowledgments as things developed. The first was what initially came up, then there

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:06,440
was one to update it for H5N1. Then there was one to update it for 2009's pandemic, which was barely

67
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,640
registered. And then there was one at the 100th anniversary in 2018. So this story may have been

68
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:20,440
erased for space in the interim. But initially, I wanted to write a book on the home front, World War

69
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,800
One, culminating in the events in 1919, which I consider one of the most interesting years in

70
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,240
American history. I knew exactly how I wanted to approach that subject. It was a very, very big

71
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,880
book. And as a writer, I live on my advanced, my prior book, Rising Tide was a best seller, but

72
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:44,200
best sellers are not necessarily as lucrative as some people think. I was living on an advance,

73
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,720
and I didn't think I could get an advance. The book, the way I conceived it, would have been taken

74
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,600
in seven years, at least, maybe a little longer. You just figure how much it costs to live decently

75
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,800
for seven years, plus pay your research expenses. And you're talking about a lot of money. I didn't

76
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,760
think I could get an advance that large for that book. But I thought I could write a book on the

77
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,000
pandemic, which interested me, in probably two years, and no more than two and a half years.

78
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,520
I drafted a proposal and gave it to my agent. Then I changed my mind, told him I didn't want

79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:27,240
to write the book. But an editor approached him after a story in the New Yorker appeared about

80
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,840
digging up bodies to try to reconstruct the virus or find the virus. Anyway, they made an offer,

81
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,240
which I didn't accept. If I'd wanted to write the book, it would have been enough. I got mad at my

82
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,480
agent. I told him I didn't want to write the book. Then another editor came along and offered

83
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,600
more money. I thought, well, it's too much money for a book I can write in two years that will help

84
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,600
me support the other ones I accept. The problem was it took me seven years, a little over that.

85
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,480
The same advance divided by seven is a lot less than the advance divided by two.

86
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,680
So at the end, I was looking at life as a graduate student. For the first five and a half years that

87
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,720
I was working on the book, I wanted to throw the whole thing out the window. Oswald Avery,

88
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,840
one of the characters in the book, kept me going. Avery came up with one of the most

89
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,920
consequential discoveries in any science of the 20th century, arguably the single most important

90
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,800
one. He discovered that DNA carried the genetic code. Solving that problem, which actually grew

91
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:37,000
out of his research on influenza and pneumonia, put him through hell for 25 years, had a nervous

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,680
breakdown, didn't publish for more than a decade. Thinking of what he went through made what I was

93
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,440
going through almost trivial. I would think of him almost every day. Finally, after five and a half

94
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,560
years, books came together. I was obviously happy with what I produced at the end and the reception

95
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,000
it got. It is a beautiful book. I probably read it in 2007, so that would have been probably

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,200
about three years, I guess, after it came out. Truthfully, this is another very embarrassing

97
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,800
story. About six months ago, I realized I just had too many books and I needed to start just

98
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,960
getting rid of them, giving them away. I'm going to tell me you threw mine out or gave it away.

99
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:27,000
I did. I donated it to a library. I got rid of literally 80% of the books I had. I remember

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,320
doing this like six months ago, kind of flipping through books. It's like a trip down memory lane.

101
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,440
I don't know if you've ever done this, but you go through and if you're one of these guys like me

102
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,320
who hoards books, you go through and you think, God, I remember I read. Sometimes for me, it's

103
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,760
like I have a photographic memory. I can say that, or photograph's the wrong word, but sort of a

104
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,800
temporal memory where I can say, I remember reading this in November of 2006 and I remember

105
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,600
what I was doing and I read this on a vacation here and blah, blah, blah. It was actually a very

106
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,000
cool experience going through and doing that. The irony of it is about six months ago, I'm

107
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,000
thumbing through my paperback copy of your book. I was like, yeah, this is a great one, but you

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,800
know what? If I read it again, I'll just do it on Audible. Maybe I'll have to go back and buy

109
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,200
another copy so I can... I think the events of the last couple of months have reminded us of

110
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,760
the importance of that. I thought a lot about how much I want to... There's so much I want to talk

111
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,040
with you on this topic, John. It's something that I think is relevant to where we are today, which

112
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,720
is I guess April 15th, but it's going to be an equally relevant discussion a year from now. It

113
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,840
would have been a very relevant discussion a year ago if we'd had it and if we'd known how important

114
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,600
it would have been to have learned from it. Let's assume for a moment that most of the people

115
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,280
listening to this either aren't familiar with the story or maybe haven't read your book.

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,480
Let's start at the beginning because we're talking about a virus, a swine flu virus. It's different

117
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,880
from the virus that's on everybody's mind today, which is a coronavirus. This is a different class

118
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,280
of virus, but a comparable idea in that it's a virus that originates in a pig in this case.

119
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,640
Well, actually I kind of dispute that. Well, I was about to say, actually, I was going to say,

120
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,880
I actually do want to touch on today the difference between what you thought at the time, which is

121
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,080
where this originated in Haskell County in Kansas. I know that in the previous couple of years,

122
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,400
you've actually come to another point of potential view on that. I want to touch on that, but

123
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,440
does that go to places I need to start? Sure. Okay. Sure. Well, I guess we could provide

124
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:28,040
some more background. The 1918 pandemic virus, respiratory virus, jumped from animals to people.

125
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,560
We don't know what animal to jump from. The influenza virus has eight separate gene segments

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,600
as of the most viruses, most organisms have a genetic code carried on a continuous single

127
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,600
strand, whether it's RNA for a lot of viruses or DNA for some viruses and more advanced organism.

128
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,320
But we know seven of those eight gene segments are avian. One looks like it was mammalian,

129
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,920
not necessarily a pig. So we don't really know what mammal it passed through. And we're not certain

130
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,120
that it passed through a mammal at all. So to designate it as swine flu, I'm not sure I'd agree.

131
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,680
In fact, there's very good evidence that people gave the 1918 virus to swine rather than the other

132
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:22,280
way around. But having said that, the pandemic killed between 50 and a hundred million people.

133
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:28,760
You adjust for population, that's 220 to 440 million people today. It killed two-thirds of

134
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,320
them in a remarkably short period of time, generally 14 or 15 weeks from late September

135
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:42,360
through December 1918. It was a very mild, spotty first wave in the spring of 1918, which

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,840
did not spread worldwide and was very hit or miss. And the countries that did hit. Then there was a

137
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:57,080
third wave in 1919 began in February, yes, extended through the spring. And that's basically

138
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,800
the story of the pandemic in very, very short order. So let's go back to the Haskell County,

139
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,480
Kansas. We're in the final year of World War I. So we're kind of latter part of the winter,

140
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,720
early part of the spring in 2018. And some doctors there kind of noticed something, right?

141
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,600
Right. The first report anywhere in the world, any language that I could find of a lethal form

142
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,640
of influenza was actually in Haskell County, Kansas, southwestern, western part of the state

143
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,200
near the Texas border. There was a very astute physician in that county named Laurie Nina,

144
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,920
who reported this lethal form of influenza to the US Public Health Service. Although that

145
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:50,840
account was not actually published until April. I found the record, since it was the only report

146
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,600
in the spring in public health reports, I decided to check out the weekly newspapers, figuring there

147
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,840
would be some delay in publishing the report and found out there was a several month delay.

148
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:12,040
Anyway, you could trace by name people whose families had someone suffering from pneumonia,

149
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,680
who went from there to Fort Riley for training as soldiers or visiting somebody there.

150
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,120
Several people by name and they arrived in early March and like clockwork right after their

151
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,040
arrival, a couple of days, the first reports of influence in that camp. So I thought that might be

152
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:39,400
the site of origin, rural Kansas, and actually published a scientific article in the journal

153
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,440
Translational Medicine, which was run by Franco Marincola, whom you may know.

154
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,800
I know Franco very well.

155
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,280
Close friend of mine still is. That actually got some attention and had some credibility.

156
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Since the book was published and since that article was published, there's been a lot of

157
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:07,320
research on influenza. We found out that China actually did not have a grievous experience

158
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:16,840
in 1918. So based on the fact that they did not suffer huge numbers of deaths, it strongly suggests

159
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:23,400
that there was prior exposure to that virus. So I think it's more likely that it started in China.

160
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,360
There are other hypotheses out there, including Vietnam and France, for that matter, France in

161
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:36,200
1915. We will never know where it actually did start. At any rate, roughly half the army camps

162
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,440
in the US were infected in the spring, even though not very many civilian communities were,

163
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,560
although New York City and Chicago were. Los Angeles didn't suffer a single influenza death

164
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,280
in the spring. The studies that were contemporary, there are several numerous ones, both in the

165
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,000
United States and Britain by a Nobel laureate named Macfarlane Burnett in Australia. These

166
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,080
studies all concluded that it was most likely that influenza was carried to Europe by American

167
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:12,040
soldiers in the spring of 1918. That happened to be a pretty mild wave, where not a lot of deaths

168
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,360
wasn't noticed at all in any civilian community in the United States at the time.

169
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,480
Retrospectively, there have been some that have been identified. And over the course of the summer,

170
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:34,440
my speculation is that the virus mutated, became much more virulent. And in mid-September,

171
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:43,000
it's simultaneously in lethal form, hit Africa and Boston. But actually the first lethal wave

172
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,840
of the influenza occurred in Switzerland. That was noted in July. There was a US military

173
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,760
intelligence report from Switzerland, which said this disease is being called influenza,

174
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,720
but it's actually the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Can we pause there for a second, John,

175
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:07,400
and put this in some context? So we talk about the pandemics to end all pandemics. And I just

176
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,920
want to kind of put this in context. Is it safe to say that the bubonic plague of the 14th century,

177
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:22,680
if my memory recalls, is the greatest pandemic of them all? Yeah, easily. In terms of proportion of

178
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,200
the population who were killed, an estimated quarter to a third in Europe, the subtitle of my

179
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,960
book is The Deadliest Pandemic in History. And that's true in the sense of the numbers of people

180
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,960
killed. But as a percentage of the population, there's no doubt the plague of the middle ages

181
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:48,040
killed many, many more than influenza did. So do you think that the same virus that killed

182
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,120
a reasonable number of people starting in Haskell County is the same? And by the way,

183
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,920
that's the same virus that probably went to France with the soldiers. Do you think that

184
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,960
is the same virus that came back in October of 2018? And as you pointed out, basically knocked

185
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,920
out two thirds of its victims. Or do you think it was a totally different virus? Well, I think the

186
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,120
evidence is overwhelming that it's the same virus. It's a staggering mutation between these two.

187
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,920
Right. There are people I respect, or at least one word. It's not so much that they think it's

188
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:28,440
different virus. They're yet to accept the fact that it's the same virus. I can go into detail as

189
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,120
to why I'm convinced it's the same virus, if you like. I would love that. Okay. Number one,

190
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,080
in New York City, there was a careful study of the spring outbreak, even though relatively few

191
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:49,560
people died. It was exactly the same signature of demographics, which is very unusual for influenza.

192
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,480
1918, the peak age for death was 28. It's a so-called W curve, usually influenza kills the

193
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,520
very young and the elderly. That was not the case in the spring. And it was not the case in the

194
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,640
fall. And both of those patterns are highly unusual. That's number one. Number two, in fact,

195
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,640
I actually did write an article for Journal of Infectious Disease on this. The first wave

196
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:23,000
exposure was very protective. Again, second wave illness, a couple of NIH epidemiologists helped me

197
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,120
write that paper. Lorna Simonson and Cecile de Blube, very good epidemiologist on influenza.

198
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,680
The first wave provided between 59% and 89% protection against illness. That compares to

199
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:44,360
a vaccine today, which in the last 20 years has ranged from 10% to 62% protection. So it's much

200
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,520
better than a modern vaccine. Number three, when they reconstructed the virus and stuck it in

201
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,520
ferrets, it was highly lethal, much more so than any other influenza virus.

202
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,280
Sorry, John, that's from the first batch, meaning the first wave.

203
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:08,040
No, they reconstructed the genome. Jeff Taubenberger sequenced the genome by extracting it from slides

204
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,720
from lung tissue at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. He's now at NIH.

205
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,320
Taken from patients who died in the first wave or the second wave?

206
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,600
Actually, he's now found, that's another reason, he's now found a sample as early as May,

207
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,880
which is the same virus. Well, that would be the most compelling of all of these things, correct?

208
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,720
Well, I mean, just the, perhaps. I think the epidemiology, demographics, I think the immune

209
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,600
protection that afforded is pretty compelling evidence, particularly the immune protection.

210
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,320
But certainly the fact that they've got a sample from May, which is the same virus,

211
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,040
that's pretty good evidence as well. Interestingly, in terms of immune protection,

212
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,840
the first wave protected against the second wave, but neither first nor second wave

213
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,520
exposure protected against the third wave, which started in February, 1919.

214
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,240
We're going to include a bunch of figures to accompany this podcast, John, because I think

215
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,520
that as you describe these things, I mean, those of us who have spent time reading about it can

216
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,240
picture what you're describing, which are these three peaks. You've got this first little peak in

217
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,240
the spring of 18. And then it's, if you just saw it by itself, it would look devastating just based

218
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,560
on the absolute numbers, but then it is so dwarfed in a relative sense by what comes about in September

219
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,040
to December of that same year, which I mean, basically is like Everest next to Kilimanjaro.

220
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,240
And then you do have a third peak, which is even bigger than the first peak, probably by 3X,

221
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,960
that takes into 2019. So I want to come back to sort of implications of that as we go forward. But

222
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,120
one of the things about this that is interesting when we look back is we don't think of the world

223
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,840
as being very connected in 1918. There were no airplanes, you had to cross by ship and do all

224
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,160
of these things. You just wouldn't think that this thing could go as much as it did. And yet there

225
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,080
are some really nice videos out there that show you a temporal view of where infections popped up

226
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:20,840
over time. And it's kind of amazing how quickly that second wave grows. What is your sense of the

227
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,880
movement of the second wave of that? How did it, and maybe we can just for simplicity,

228
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,960
focus on the United States, but I do want to come back and understand places like India that were

229
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:39,880
just decimated. First, you don't need steam power to move a pandemic in the 1600s. Influenza managed

230
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,800
across the Atlantic Ocean and devastate Virginia and Massachusetts, not to mention the Native

231
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,840
American population. Guns, germs and steel is sort of a great example of this. Right. Or better than

232
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,480
guns, germs and steel. You've got McNeil, and then you've got one of my favorite books of all time,

233
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,440
which I highly recommend to everyone by McFarland Burnett. I mentioned him earlier,

234
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,760
Nobel Laureate, called The Natural History of Infectious Disease, which is just an incredibly

235
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,480
good book and quite accessible to a lay person. So we were talking about timing. My guess is the

236
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:23,000
virus seeded itself largely around the world and then erupted. Takes a while to get a pandemic

237
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,240
started, but once it got going, it was moving pretty fast. Although the army, which has very

238
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,400
good data and had great epidemiologists in their study, which wasn't published until the 1930s,

239
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,160
they had tremendous amounts of data. It took a while to assemble it all and publish it. They said

240
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:51,800
that in their army camps, beginning in late July and early August, in retrospect, they could identify

241
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,000
a steadily increasing uptick in pneumonia in the camps, which if they put it on a graph,

242
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,400
was essentially a log advance, whatever the appropriate terminology is, to describe that

243
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,800
increase and then it erupted, of course. And this was noticed in their camps, independent

244
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:20,520
of the return of the virus to the United States, which first occurred in Boston and the

245
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,560
naval facility or essentially naval barracks, and then spread to Camp Devens, which is about,

246
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,320
I guess, 30 miles northwest of Boston, maybe a little more than that, where that was the

247
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,120
first army camp that really exploded with the deadly form of the disease.

248
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,080
How much was the transition of the first of the second wave and the propagation of the second wave

249
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:53,160
made worse by the war? I'll start on pointing out the two issues. One is just the proximity and

250
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,920
physical nature of war and the fact that soldiers could become such effective conduits and vectors,

251
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,160
but also in terms of the media's response to this or the government response to this.

252
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,560
Well, in terms of the government response, it was major. I'll talk about that in a second.

253
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:14,760
In terms of the war spreading the pandemic, I think it accelerated a little bit, maybe by a

254
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,840
few weeks or something like that. The outbreak in New York City, for example, preceded any outbreak

255
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:28,360
in army camps. It's also another reason why I backed off my Haskell hypothesis. Haskell did

256
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,720
precede New York City by a couple of weeks, but it's hard to figure out how it would have gotten

257
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,840
from Haskell to New York City, although it certainly could have happened. Anyway, with New

258
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:45,160
York having a well-defined spring outbreak and Chicago also, it's pretty clear it would have

259
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:51,560
gotten anywhere everywhere eventually and sooner rather than later. Whether you have 10 people

260
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:59,720
getting off a ship from New York to England or France or whether you have a few thousand

261
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,240
soldiers getting off a ship really doesn't make that much difference in spreading the pandemic.

262
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:13,320
Just difference in timing, but with an reproductive number close to two, you catch up pretty fast,

263
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,400
even if you start with one index case, much less 10 or 20. So I think the war accelerated the spread,

264
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,840
but I don't think it's responsible for the spread. It just happened a little bit faster.

265
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:32,840
In terms of the other question about the response, that was a major factor in, I think,

266
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:39,480
the death toll possibly, certainly in the fear and in some cases chaos that was generated.

267
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:47,320
The government had created this infrastructure because of the war. The federal government,

268
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,520
I believe, more than any other time in its history, including the McCarthy period or the Civil War,

269
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:01,400
was determined to control the thought of Americans. They had a law that made it punishable by 20 years

270
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,960
in jail. If you, to quote, utter right, print or publish any disloyal, scarless, or profane

271
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,640
language about the government of the United States. So you could curse the government,

272
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,520
you just broke the law. They weren't kidding about this. They actually sent a congressman

273
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,880
to jail for 15 years under the law. This was upheld by the Supreme Court. It's where the line

274
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,440
came about. You can't shout for fire in a crowded theater. That came from that Supreme Court decision

275
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,600
upholding that law. They also had a propaganda arm called the Committee for Public Information,

276
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,600
which was determined to quote, keep morale up, unquote. The architect of that committee

277
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,400
said truth and falsehood are arbitrary terms. There's nothing in experience to tell us that one

278
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,080
is superior to the other. Went on to say all that mattered was the impact of what if you're saying.

279
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:04,200
So that propaganda arm was going to minimize anything that might depress the American public

280
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,680
because they feared that would affect the war effort. So the pandemic fitted into this construct.

281
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,760
By the way, that makes me feel not so bad about the world we live in today. It suggests that

282
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,000
history can repeat itself and maybe the pendulum can swing back a bit. I go around quoting Hegel.

283
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,760
Everybody quotes Santa Ana. I like Hegel. Hegel said what we learned from history is we learn

284
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:37,400
nothing from history. Just contrarian. Anyway, as a result of this approach to maintaining morale,

285
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:44,360
unquote, the national public health leader said this is ordinary influenza by another name. It

286
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,240
was referred to as Spanish influenza, even though it didn't start in Spain. Another national public

287
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:56,040
health leader said if you have nothing to fear, if proper precautions are taken. But people

288
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,560
pretty soon and throughout the country and most localities, the local public health commissioner

289
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,320
echoed these approaches. The press was complicit. It was fake news because they were not reporting

290
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,160
the truth because they were only saying nice things. But everybody knew it wasn't influenza

291
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,200
by another name, ordinary influenza by another name. There were deaths in less than 24 hours

292
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:27,000
after first symptoms. That was unusual, but it certainly happened. What was the typical course?

293
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,280
I mean, you mentioned that the R0 reproductive number approached two, which made it more

294
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,120
contagious even than garden variety influenza. But its real superpower was not that it was a more

295
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,480
aggressive spreader. It's the actual pathology of the disease that's probably its superpower.

296
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,240
And I use that term horribly because evolutionarily, that's not a superpower for a virus. A

297
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,960
superpower virus would kill nobody, would have an R0 of infinity and kill no one. That would be the

298
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,880
best virus if you were thinking about it from Darwin's point of view. But this was a deadly

299
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,280
virus. What was the typical clinical course? The typical course was ordinary influenza,

300
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,240
but in the West, the case mortality was about 2%, much worse than that in the

301
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,600
less developed world. Not because Western medicine was any better, but because in the West,

302
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,360
people had some cross protection from having been exposed to other influenza viruses.

303
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,880
And in the less developed world, that was not the case. They were,

304
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:35,000
quote, virgin populations, unquote, naive immune systems. But the 1918 virus, like coronavirus,

305
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,040
but unlike most influenza viruses, could bind to cells in the upper respiratory tract,

306
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,120
which made it easily transmissible. But it also could bind directly to cells deep in the lung,

307
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,080
which meant you were starting out essentially with viral pneumonia.

308
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:59,720
Those were the awful pathologies where some of the symptoms in the book, I quote, one physician

309
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,800
writing a colleague that people were turning so dark blue from lack of oxygen that he couldn't

310
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,600
distinguish colored soldiers from white soldiers, African-American, I'm quoting him.

311
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,960
That, of course, spread rumors of the black plague when people's pallor turned so in that color.

312
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,760
And that virus also, unlike most influenza viruses, could pretty much attack any organ.

313
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:31,960
It was initially misdiagnosed as typhoid, as dengue, as cholera. Nosebleed was quite common

314
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,480
in some army camps. They reported 15% of the soldiers had nosebleed. It was also possible

315
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,400
for people to bleed from their mouths and from even their eyes and ears, which are, of course,

316
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:51,400
other mucosal membranes. So that's pretty scary, particularly for a layperson. So to be told this

317
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,960
is ordinary influenza by another name, when you're seeing symptoms like that and you're

318
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,600
seeing people die rapidly, it gets your attention. And what it means is you stop trusting anything

319
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,520
that you're being told by anyone in authority. I think society is based on trust. When trust

320
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,880
evaporates, society begins to fray. And in some places, it got pretty bad. There were reports of

321
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:23,240
people starving to death, not because of lack of food, but because no one had the courage to

322
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,120
bring them food. This happened in cities like Philadelphia, which I focused on in the book,

323
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,560
but also according to the Red Cross, reports of that, things like that happening in rural

324
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,880
communities occurred as well. The story of Philadelphia is an interesting one. And I

325
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,160
really want to come back to it as a case study and then contrast it with other cities. Obviously,

326
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,160
you contrast it quite eloquently with St. Louis, but also San Francisco and others. I want to talk

327
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,160
about that. But going back to the pathology of this illness, it really seems like typical influenza,

328
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,480
you get a little bit of a... I think of it as sort of a... You stun the immune system. You get this

329
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,840
immune paralysis that can often result in a superimposed bacterial infection and all of

330
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,440
these other things that come to bear and anybody therefore who's susceptible to super infection,

331
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,920
meaning people who are hospitalized already in a nosocomial environment. I mean, those things

332
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,160
sort of become problematic. But as you pointed out, there was something really distinct about

333
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:25,240
this pattern of victim here, especially in 1918 in that second cohort, which is this was

334
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,720
knocking off people in their 30s, the way we would normally see people dying in their 70s and 80s.

335
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,960
And the idea being here that it was... P-gauge for death was 28.

336
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,360
Suggesting that the stronger your immune system was, the worse you are.

337
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Exactly. The same thing people are dying of today, acute respiratory distress syndrome.

338
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:53,080
Your immune system releases, as you know, cytokines, which the immune system has some very lethal

339
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,440
weapons. The virus, when it was in the lung, the immune system attacked it with everything it had.

340
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,760
And the battlefield was along, which was being essentially wiped out in the effort to destroy

341
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:12,200
the virus. Exactly the same thing is happening today in those people who are dying of coronavirus.

342
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:19,000
Now, I will say probably a majority of people in 1918 died of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

343
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,080
There are some people who think that 95% of the deaths were bacterial pneumonia. I think that is

344
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:35,800
mistaken. It's difficult to quantify how much was bacterial pneumonia and how much was directly

345
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,560
because of the virus. My guess would be a third to 40% would be directly virus, but that's a guess.

346
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:51,320
I certainly think it's a lot more than 5% as some have hypothesized. And just the anecdotal reports

347
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:59,480
from very good pathologists suggest that that was not the case. And even today, bacterial pneumonia

348
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,480
following influenza has an 8% case fatality rate with all the antibiotics we have. Back then,

349
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,280
it was 35%. That's actually unbelievable. I didn't realize it was that high today, by the way. 8%

350
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,080
today seems a pretty high number, but to your point, these people are already incredibly

351
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,640
compromised based on what they've been through to get there. So let's go to Labor Day 2018,

352
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,640
set the stage again, just to remind people where we are. You had this awful virus that ripped

353
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:37,560
through the United States in some pockets in the spring. It killed what may be 25,000, 50,000

354
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,640
Americans by that point. I've never put a number on that or seen a number on that. It's really

355
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,560
hard to say. Yeah. I mean, directionally, it's like less than a 10th of the total population

356
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:57,080
that would ultimately die, which was about 650,000 Americans, correct? Roughly, yeah. 650, 675 were

357
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:03,240
the numbers that I've seen, yeah. So now fast forward, we've just enjoyed a summer of relatively

358
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,640
low mortality domestically. The virus, of course, has been doing something else abroad. I don't

359
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,760
think people realize it at the time, but the war is about two months from being over. Right. That

360
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:22,840
was not common knowledge. No. People were gearing up for spring offensive in 1919 to end the war.

361
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,160
In Philadelphia, they need to raise money. There's a bond that basically the government has to borrow

362
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,600
money, and there's no better way to sort of do this than to kind of showcase what the money is

363
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,240
going to buy you and have a parade, right? Correct. And the fact that it wasn't just

364
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Philadelphia, it was around the country, September 28th, it was a Liberty loan parade, a lot of cities.

365
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:52,520
But in Philadelphia, by then the virus had already established itself. And the medical community was

366
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,920
unanimous that the parade should be canceled. They were telling reporters this, reporters were

367
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,400
writing stories about it. Editors were killing the stories. As I'd said earlier, the press was

368
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,360
largely complicit with the morale boosting approach that the government took. The local public health

369
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,760
commissioner was part of a corrupt political machine. He's a perfectly good person, but didn't

370
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,360
have the backbone to stand up to it and tell you how corrupt that machine was. It elected a United

371
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:29,720
States Senator a few years later, and the Senate controlled by the same party refused to seat the

372
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,920
guy. That's pretty corrupt. When the US Senate won't seat somebody wins an election when it's a

373
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:43,000
member of the party that controls the Senate. Anyway, the parade went forward and pretty much

374
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
like clockwork, 48, 72 hours later, influenza exploded in Philadelphia, became one of the

375
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,080
hardest hit cities in the country. Within three weeks, 4,500 are dead. Something like that. In

376
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:01,640
total about 14,500 over the course of the pandemic. And getting back to the press to tell you how

377
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,320
complicit they were. So when they finally closed schools, banned public gatherings, closed

378
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,840
saloons, theaters, no church services, stuff like that. One of the local papers actually said,

379
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,200
this is not a public health measure. You have no cause for alarm. I mean, how stupid did they

380
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:29,640
think people were? But that contributed to the breakdown of society, contributed to the fear

381
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,560
and the terror. When you can't believe anything you're being told, and obviously by then,

382
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,440
everybody knew perfectly well that was a public health measure. People were dying all around them.

383
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,760
How did that information get around? Because obviously we take for granted today how

384
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,920
electronic information basically, I mean, it creates so much noise that it's hard to know

385
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,400
the signal. But back then you had a very different problem, which is if you lived in Los Angeles at

386
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:05,640
that time, what would be telling you that people are dying like flies in Philadelphia? If the formal

387
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,640
media is not doing anything about it? Well, you wouldn't necessarily know what was happening in

388
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,560
Philadelphia, particularly back then, because it's funny, I didn't write a lot about Phoenix in the

389
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,520
book, but it was too redundant with what had happened in Philadelphia, a little bit different.

390
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:28,600
But I did a lot of research in Phoenix. And interestingly, when the disease first hit Boston,

391
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,840
they were writing about it. When it was in New Orleans, they were writing less about it.

392
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,520
When the disease was actually in Phoenix, you could not find a word about it in the Phoenix paper.

393
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,920
On page 14, they had a death notice of somebody, that was about it. There was not in the headlines,

394
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:55,000
hardly ever. So it was strictly rumor. And again, that contributed to the level of fear.

395
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,280
You didn't know what was going on, which gets into maybe to jump ahead or not. When the Bush

396
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:09,240
administration started the pandemic preparedness planning, and the Bush administration launched a

397
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,720
major initiative, $7 billion bill that did all sorts of things, vaccine technology, investment,

398
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,280
research, create vaccine manufacturing, began the national stockpile. Anyway, I was asked to

399
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:29,400
participate in some of the early groups, which were coming up with so-called non-pharmaceutical

400
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,240
interventions, what are you doing? You don't have drugs. And my message in these groups

401
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,120
was always that the step one is to tell the truth, that people can deal with reality.

402
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,720
They can't deal with when you let their imaginations run loose. That's when you really

403
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:50,600
get into trouble. If you give them the straight facts, that it's much easier to handle. In a

404
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,000
monster movie, it's always scarier before the monster appears on the screen. Imagination is

405
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,040
very powerful things. Let's go back to Philadelphia. I've seen video footage of what can only be

406
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:08,040
described as horrifying because as terrifying as an uncertain, I guess, as the last couple of months

407
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:15,800
have been with respect to the unknowns around the coronavirus. When you look at morgues that can't

408
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:23,240
accommodate corpses, and when you also understand how little people understood about microbiology

409
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,440
at the time. And so they know enough to know that this is contagious. They know enough to know this is

410
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,160
respiratory contagious. But as you pointed out, there's a breakdown in society from not knowing

411
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,120
how and when and if you can help someone else. And what do you do when someone dies? I mean,

412
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,520
there are these stories of bodies that just were left out on the street because the risk of

413
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,960
actually having to go out and take care of a body and dispose of it could potentially expose you to

414
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:56,840
more. And I mean, to me, that's again, 14,000 deaths doesn't sound like an enormous number. I

415
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,240
mean, New York will likely eclipse that. New York City obviously adjusted for population.

416
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,280
Philadelphia would have been more in that time. But it's in part the speed with which it happened

417
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:14,520
and also just the fear of who's next. And I think the other thing is seeing these young people

418
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,960
dying in a way that you just you aren't used to. I guess if I'm going to play devil's advocate for

419
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,720
a moment, without the benefit of hindsight, is there an argument that one could make that says,

420
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,400
look, the public health officials or the people who should have been doing the right thing

421
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,960
didn't want to create an unnecessary panic in the other direction without knowing more? I'm sure

422
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,840
this is an argument that you've heard 100 times. What is the counterpoint to that if there is one?

423
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,480
As you say, that's the counter argument. But I think I already articulated the argument in favor

424
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,440
of the truth. Number one, the imagination is more powerful. And number two, if you ever expect the

425
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,480
public to do something you want the public to do, you better have credibility. And once you lose

426
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,800
credibility, you can't regain it. If you start out telling the truth, even by the way, when the truth

427
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,560
is, we don't know. I mean, to me, that's the biggest challenge the government has, right?

428
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:17,000
Well, that's okay, too. If you say we don't know, but we'll know when this test is performed,

429
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,120
and we have the results, you can go down the line as to why you don't know. And you can then say,

430
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:31,960
when we will know. So you provide information, and you can retain your credibility, even if you

431
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:39,400
don't know. I think that's the only way to go. My standard line is, I don't like the phrase risk

432
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,680
communication, because it implies managing the truth. You don't manage the truth, you tell the

433
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:52,040
truth. I would be in these working groups, and I mentioned DA Henderson earlier, DA, and I became

434
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:59,480
friends, because we were always in agreement, it seems, in these groups, sometimes opposed by others.

435
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,360
But on that one point of telling the truth, I never got any pushback from any of these groups

436
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:14,440
I participated in. The national pandemic plan, which was the outgrowth of those working groups,

437
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:21,160
certainly incorporates the idea of transparency, as does every state plan. The problem is,

438
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:28,440
someone has to go out and execute that pandemic plan. Someone has to go out, face the camera,

439
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,160
and tell the truth. Obviously, that has not happened. There are other countries where it

440
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:41,000
has happened, including Germany, which has done light years ahead of us in ending coronavirus,

441
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,520
or Singapore, and no doubt other countries, just not in the United States.

442
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,560
Going back to the Philadelphia story, how would you contrast that with what happened in St. Louis,

443
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:59,160
which you use as a counterpoint? Well, St. Louis intervened very early in terms of what we call

444
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:07,160
social distancing now. At least partly as a result of that, they had a much more benign experience

445
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:14,360
than most other cities on a per capita basis. It's not clear to me that 100% of that is attributable

446
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:20,680
to social distancing. We don't know. Nobody's ever looked. The information's ascertainable,

447
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,000
but I didn't have time to do the research whether or not they had a spring wave, for example,

448
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,680
which I am convinced, I think, have demonstrated did provide protection against the fall wave.

449
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,160
New York City, for example, didn't do anything. They did less than any other city. They didn't

450
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,840
close schools. They didn't close saloons. They didn't close theaters. They didn't do anything.

451
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:46,040
And yet, New York City had a relatively benign experience, I think, because of its spring wave.

452
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,720
Same thing in Chicago. Now, whether that was true in St. Louis, I don't know.

453
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,000
But St. Louis did act early and aggressively in terms of social distancing measures.

454
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:01,320
They were less extreme than what we're doing now, but they were imposed early. And

455
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:10,760
early action's very important. If you do it before the virus is widely disseminated in the community,

456
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,480
it can be effective. If you wait until people start dying all around you, by then the virus

457
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:21,160
is everywhere. And those measures are not going to be nearly as effective if they're effective at

458
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:27,160
all. San Francisco had some interesting policies, right? Weren't they so strict on how they enforced

459
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,000
masks that the police had authority to shoot a person in public who is not wearing a mask?

460
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:39,000
I miss that. I'm not saying you're wrong. They did require, by law, people wear masks. There were

461
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,400
several cities that did that. The thing that makes San Francisco interesting, they were the only

462
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,440
place I know of that really did tell the truth. I'm sure there must have been at least some other

463
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:56,440
places. Certainly, I didn't study every wall of 100 biggest cities in the country. But in San

464
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:04,280
Francisco, the mayor, labor leaders, business leaders, medical community all made a joint

465
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:10,040
statement. Huge, tight, full page in the newspaper, wear a mask and save your life.

466
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,760
Now, that is a very different message than this is ordinary influenza by another name.

467
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,920
You have nothing to fear. Proper precautions are taken. So wear a mask and save your life. This is

468
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,840
a life-threatening disease and you better take action. They honestly believe the masks were the

469
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:35,480
effect of they did next to nothing or probably nothing. San Francisco actually suffered,

470
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,760
forgot the exact number, but they were fourth or fifth highest excess mortality in the country.

471
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:51,800
But what that message did do was secure the community. The community did trust what the

472
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,440
leaders were telling them. And the community, instead of fraying as a society, in some cases,

473
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,640
almost breaking down. In San Francisco, that city functioned better than any other place that I know

474
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,880
of, in the sense that, for example, when schools were closed, teachers volunteered as ambulance

475
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:16,920
drivers, whatever was needed, as opposed to running and hiding, which was happening in other cities

476
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:25,080
where the leadership lied. And as a result, people felt it was everybody for himself or herself or

477
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:31,400
their families in the hell with the community. So after the pandemic, despite the fact that San

478
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:39,480
Francisco had a very high death toll, The Chronicle wrote an editorial saying that in our long history

479
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,160
of the city, despite the tragedy, this will be one of the most glorious episodes in our history

480
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,560
because of the way the community came together and functioned. I don't know of another city

481
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:57,000
anywhere that could have made a claim like that. Which is really a counterintuitive claim when you

482
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,680
think about both the general statement one would make about pandemics, which is unlike natural

483
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:08,680
disasters, acts of war and terrorism, pandemics tend to divide people, not unite them due to the

484
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,440
isolation and fear. And then secondly, this pandemic happens to be the worst of the bunch. You'd think

485
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,800
that if anything, this would have decimated communities. And yet you have this counter example.

486
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:27,560
Do you think it is this culture of abject honesty from the outset that played the main role in that?

487
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,760
I think that was a factor. I think in most disasters, people do come together. I live in

488
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,200
New Orleans. And that's what I'm saying. Most disasters, yes, I'm saying, but there's something

489
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,600
unique about these pandemics that people talk about saying, no, actually, these do more harm

490
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:46,200
than good in terms of social cohesion. Well, you know, if you look back at the plague and so forth

491
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,560
in the Middle Ages, the terror that was out there, a quarter to a third of the population being killed.

492
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:58,840
Yeah, I would say that's true. Plus the unknown factor. So you had everything working against you

493
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:07,960
in the Black Death. I think it's almost like a controlled experiment supporting my hypothesis

494
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:14,360
that telling the truth is the best way to go and that it can pull people together and make

495
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,800
even a pandemic, even in a pandemic, people function as they do in other disasters,

496
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:27,400
trying to help each other. The reality is I can't prove it quantitatively. But in terms of

497
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:33,800
anecdotally, I'm in the French Quarter, which is deserted. There are not a heck of a lot of full

498
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:40,200
time residents in the French Quarter. There are some, but people around here, neighbors whom I

499
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,440
don't really know a few blocks away, asking me if my wife and I go for walks. They're asking if

500
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,240
there's anything they can do for me. I have a couple of people who are younger. I'm over 70,

501
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:57,800
so is my wife. They volunteered to get groceries for us. I have a neighbor next door who's a dentist

502
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:04,840
who immediately went to his office and donated all his masks and gloves to a local hospital.

503
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:12,600
He's unusual in the sense that he did a medical rotation with interns in addition to his dental

504
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:18,600
school. So he's volunteered to go to hospitals and perform procedures that he's capable of doing

505
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,880
and take some of the stress off healthcare workers, which of course exposes himself to a lot of risk.

506
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:30,840
I get the sense around here that people are coming together. Again, it's anecdotal and it's

507
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:37,960
very localized even if I'm right, but that's the attitude nationally. That's a pretty big plus.

508
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,080
I want to pivot for a second and talk about two things we can do in either order you prefer. One

509
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:49,160
is I want to visit India a little bit because I was kind of astonished at the mortality in India.

510
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,680
It's almost hard to fathom. Then the second unrelated thread is really the, I don't know

511
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:01,000
much or I don't recall much about the factors between the second and the third wave. So in

512
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,720
either order you want to talk about those as we continue through this journey. Well, we can go in

513
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:11,560
either order you want because it may be a short discussion. Let's stay on the domestic thread and

514
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:18,280
talk about how much of the dying down of the second wave before the resurgence of the third,

515
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,080
because it doesn't appear to have been just seasonal or do you think that the seasonality

516
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:29,720
was the main driver of that? No, I very definitely do not think of seasonality. I think the virus

517
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:36,040
changed. As I said earlier, either first or second wave exposure seemed to protect against the third

518
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:43,720
wave. So that suggests a reasonably dramatic shift in the virus and what is referred to as you well

519
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:51,240
know, antigen drift. I should have said drift instead of shift in the the elder influenza.

520
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:57,480
That's actually a meaningful term of art. I can't prove that. Come to think of it, I don't believe

521
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,800
that Jeff Tobenberger who's the one who's done all the sequencing of old viruses. I don't know

522
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,840
that he's got a viral sample from 1919. Maybe he does. I should ask him. It'd be very interesting.

523
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:15,000
By then, most of the samples, not all of them, but most of the samples came out of the army.

524
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,560
By the spring of 1919, there probably weren't that many soldiers.

525
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:26,040
By the influenza, they would have been discharged. So they may not have samples. So I think the

526
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:33,640
the virus drifted enough to escape the immune system. It was lethal by any standard. 1919 was

527
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:41,000
lethal by any standard except the fall wave in 1918. It was the second worst year of the century

528
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
or that we know of in terms of influenza deaths. What was the morale of the country like at that

529
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,080
point when you have no reason to believe this isn't going to continue indefinitely? I sometimes

530
00:53:53,080 --> 00:54:01,480
find it interesting to try to imagine going back in time, not knowing how the story ends and thinking

531
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,920
how could you concoct a story here that is really frightening? And to me, it would be

532
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,840
as you're in the midst of the third killing wave, this is the new norm.

533
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,640
Probably most Americans were relatively unaware of the first wave at all. So to them, it probably

534
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,800
was the second killing wave. That doesn't take away from the point you're making. And honestly,

535
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,640
I don't know. In the book, I was trying to focus. If you ask me what I write about,

536
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,280
I will tell you I write about power. I may be the only person who sees it that way.

537
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,280
The influenza book in terms of characters that I was trying to focus on the scientists because

538
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,480
they were the ones who had power to confront pandemic. And to a lesser extent, actually,

539
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:49,320
I focused on the politicians because they affected the course of the pandemic by lying

540
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:54,600
to the public and so forth. So I did not spend much time. Well, particularly, I didn't look

541
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:01,400
at newspapers and things like that for sources because that was fake news back then because

542
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,440
they were working with the government to minimize things. The war ended. There were so many other

543
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,800
things going on. I don't really know the answer to your question. Certainly, there was concern.

544
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,960
I don't get the sense from the little research that I did in the area that there was a kind of

545
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:23,800
terror erupting that accompanied the second wave. But I really don't know.

546
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,360
And what to make of India? About 20 million fatalities in India, correct?

547
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:36,600
At least. In fact, the original estimate of the death toll, which was in 1927,

548
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,960
studied by the American Medical Association, a guy named Edward Chorden, an infectious disease

549
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,360
expert, looked at the entire world and they originally estimated 21.7 million people died.

550
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:54,280
That was largely because they extrapolated the case mortality rate from the West where they had

551
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,720
semi-good data to the rest of the world, which turned out to be wrong.

552
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:05,560
My speculation is clearly those populations that had not seen immune influenza viruses before had

553
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:12,600
terrible mortality. Forget about case mortality and isolated island in the Pacific, Western Samoa,

554
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:19,240
22% of the entire population died. Not case mortality, 22% of the entire population.

555
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,920
And that's a very good number. We know exactly how many people died there.

556
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:30,680
In India, it's hard to imagine that that country had not been exposed to influenza viruses throughout

557
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:36,680
the country. And yet, I can't think of another possible explanation for their tremendous death

558
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:45,560
toll. And you can look at British Army, you've got Indian troops in the same camp as Caucasian

559
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:53,400
British troops. And the case mortality for the Caucasians is 9%. And the case mortality

560
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:01,640
for the Indians at the same place at the same time is over 20%. And it's not because medical

561
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,480
care was any different, because medical care didn't make any difference. All they could do

562
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,200
was support of care and keep you hydrated. That was about it. Maybe ice you down if you had a fever.

563
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,400
There could have just been genetic differences. There could have been certain things about the

564
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,400
way this virus binds. Maybe this was a virus that could have disproportionately affected

565
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:27,320
Southeast Asians, potentially more than Caucasians, just based on properties of how the virus worked.

566
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,600
Or to your point, which I think is seemingly the more logical, or the Occam's razor here would be

567
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:39,800
just a difference in immune preparedness. Exactly, the naive immune system. But we don't

568
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,960
really know. I've seen epidemiological studies, which range as high as 30 million in India.

569
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:53,000
But I haven't really seen a good hypothesis explaining why. All told, about 4% to 5% of the

570
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,440
world's population died? Does that sound about right? Well, you can do the math. It's pretty

571
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:08,600
simple, 1.8 billion people. So 50 million dead would be about 2.5%, roughly. 100 million would

572
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:17,800
be about 5%. The thing is, two-thirds of the dead were aged 18 to 45. So when you look at that

573
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:24,040
demographic... Yeah, that's a staggering impact on life expectancy. Yeah. Unaggregate life expectancy.

574
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:31,480
Yeah. And particularly when you throw in the short period of a few months during which most

575
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:37,560
of those people died. And then you go into other narrower demographics. And according to

576
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:46,840
Metropolitan Life, over 3% of all the factory workers in that age group died, not case mortality.

577
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:53,000
3% of the entire population of factory workers in that age group died in a period of weeks.

578
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Pregnant women, there are a whole series of studies, which range from 21% to 71% case mortality.

579
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:07,400
Miners, according to Metropolitan Life, over 6% of all minors in that age group died, again,

580
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,600
in a very narrow period. And it's even shorter than that 14 or 15 weeks because influenza

581
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:19,720
would pass through a particular community anywhere from six to 10 weeks. So the time frame is very

582
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:25,640
compressed when people are dying. So it was a pretty horrific period to live through.

583
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,040
This is a question that might be a little bit outside of your area of expertise, but...

584
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,600
Oh, great. I pontificate. Happy to pontificate something. I know nothing about it.

585
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:42,520
Well, you might. Why did we roll into the 1920s with an enormous economic tailwind and not hit

586
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:48,200
a depression until a decade after this pandemic, when you would think that something that knocks

587
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:55,240
out that much of a country's population would have actually precipitated the economic downturn

588
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:02,120
immediately following this? Why is it that by the time this thing rolls to an end in late 19, 19, 20,

589
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:09,080
the country managed to resolve itself economically? Was that more on account of the war being over?

590
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:14,120
What do you attribute this to, if any thoughts? There actually was a recession that was fairly

591
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:21,000
deep, but very short-lived right after the war. And indeed, after World War II, there was a lot

592
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,760
of planning and anticipation of the same thing happening after World War II. It didn't happen

593
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,800
after World War II. It did happen after World War I, but again, it was brief. You're talking about

594
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:40,600
four million soldiers or more, plus however many were in the Navy, suddenly thrown back into the

595
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:47,640
workforce. So there was great dislocation and unemployment, but it was pretty brief. You had

596
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:53,400
pent-up demand, you had an adjustment as factories went back to making civilian products instead of

597
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:00,280
tanks or ships. So there was a dislocation, but then it did pick up. In terms of the attitude,

598
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:07,720
culture, people usually ask me what impact I thought the pandemic had. Again, it's very

599
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:15,640
difficult to quantify or be precise about my own senses. People understood it was there.

600
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:21,240
It was part of their consciousness. I think it may have contributed to the sense of ennui

601
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:28,040
in the 20s that party today, because who knows what's happening tomorrow. In 1933, when the Nazis

602
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:33,800
rolled into Germany, into Berlin, Christopher Isherwood wrote Berlin stories from which a great

603
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:41,880
movie, Cabaret, came. He said you could feel it like influenza in the bones. So he expected his

604
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:49,640
readers to understand that sense of dread deep within you that you get just from seeing the Nazis

605
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:56,680
show up. I think that analogy, the fact that he made it, is a powerful statement. By the same token,

606
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:02,200
there's very little that was written about it. John Dos Passos, one of my favorite writers,

607
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:08,200
got influence on a troop ship. It was a pretty bad place to get it. He hardly mentioned it in

608
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,480
any of his novels. There's just not that much written about it, which is a puzzlement, not only

609
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:21,960
to me, but to a lot of other people. In 2009, when H1N1 was coming, I'm guessing your phone

610
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:29,240
was ringing a lot. Yes. What was the fundamental difference from a virology standpoint between the

611
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:37,800
2009 H1N1 swine flu and let's just think about the second wave version of that same virus?

612
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:44,760
Well, the reality is that 2009 was very, very strange because it was almost two entirely

613
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:52,280
different diseases. The overwhelming majority of people who got sick had a relatively mild case

614
01:02:52,280 --> 01:03:01,960
of influenza. But for those who were seriously ill, it was 1918. That virus, H1N1, well, 1918 was

615
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:09,240
H1N1 virus also. But the 2009 virus could bind directly to cells deep in the lung. What was the

616
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:14,920
genetic similarity between those two, do we know? Well, I write about science, but I'm not a

617
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,760
scientist. I know that it's referred to as you probably know, a triple reassortment of viruses,

618
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:28,440
meaning that there were three different influenza viruses that were involved in making up the genome

619
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:37,480
of the 2009 virus. Some of it probably went back, it did go back to 1918, but most of viruses

620
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:42,440
circulate, if not all of the human viruses circulating today have some of 1918 floating

621
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,720
around in them. So I can't really answer your question. Clearly, there had to have been a lot

622
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:53,960
of cross protection from other circulating viruses. Do you think the vaccination or the

623
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,000
frequency with which people had influenza vaccines and continued exposure to influenza

624
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:06,760
and perhaps greater medical care? No, I think it was simply the virus primarily. One thing that's

625
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:14,360
also interesting about 2009, the peak deaths, the age of the dead was very similar to 1918. I forgot

626
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:21,000
the exact number, whether it was 27, 28, or 29, or maybe even 30, but the average age of the people

627
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,440
who did die was very, very young, much different from ordinary influenza and very similar in 1918,

628
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:33,720
though most of them did have comorbidities. Let's head forward now to where we are. It's

629
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:38,360
a different type of virus. It's a coronavirus, not an influenza virus. They have things that

630
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:44,840
are common. They have things that are different. What have been your observations so far? I'm sure

631
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,880
you have assimilated a great deal of information. And though you're not a virologist, you're

632
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:57,000
obviously incredibly erudite with respect to your understanding of not just the biology of these

633
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,440
things, but also the epidemiology of them and the role that government's media, et cetera, play.

634
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:07,720
Let's just start with biology. Let's say it's kind of you to say, I don't know how much I,

635
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:13,560
it's nice of you to say that. I appreciate that. I hope what I say is correct. I know I believe it.

636
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:21,160
I do sort of cross-reference my thoughts with other people who are very involved in

637
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,360
pandemic preparedness, vaccine production, and so forth, who I became friendly with

638
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:34,200
back in the Bush administration and since then, Obama administration as well. So if I have an

639
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:41,640
idea, I will send them an email and ask them if I'm going to embarrass myself if I say it.

640
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:53,880
But to answer your question, as I said earlier, coronavirus like 1918 can bind directly to the

641
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:00,520
lung cells in the lung. Obviously it's different binding sites, but still it's deep in the lung as

642
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:06,760
well as upper respiratory. That's the main similarity. The main difference is the incubation

643
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:13,720
period, which creates a nightmare for managing this virus. Then we have questions about immunity.

644
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:21,560
We don't know the answers to sort of presume that I guess the work that I've seen recently suggests

645
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:29,560
that you can more or less semi-safely assume you're going to have immunity for a year and

646
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:37,000
maybe longer if you've survived the disease. In fact, I won't use Instacart because I think it's

647
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,280
unethical to expose people to the virus. The person who is getting groceries for me now

648
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:49,880
actually did have the disease and did recover. So she's kind enough to get groceries for me and I

649
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:56,440
don't feel an ethical problem asking her to help me because I think she probably does have immunity

650
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:02,200
for recent recovery. But in terms of the time, you know, the incubation period for influenza is

651
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:07,240
generally two days. It might run as long as four, but it's usually shorter. This is two to fourteen

652
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:13,400
days. The average incubation period is five and a half to six days. Triple the length of time for

653
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:18,520
the average incubation period for influenza. So that makes each generation is going to be that

654
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:25,160
much longer. The disease itself takes much longer to develop in the body. It takes much longer to

655
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:31,000
pass through the body. So the whole length of time, the duration, is much, much longer than

656
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,960
influenza. I said earlier in 1918, or for that matter, seasonal influenza, it'll pass through

657
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:43,880
a community normally six to ten weeks and then, you know, hear about it until the next season or

658
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:51,160
in 1918 until the next wave came. And this is not going to be like that. Also, the social distancing

659
01:07:52,120 --> 01:08:00,120
to the extent that it works and it is working is going to add further duration to that. The whole

660
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:06,600
process of coming out of this is just tremendously complicated. Do you think that the response to

661
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:13,480
this has been appropriate, has been overly aggressive, has been not aggressive enough in

662
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,520
certain areas, potentially New York? I mean, what's your overall take on this, on the response?

663
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:29,960
Of course, Trump is a disaster. Incomprehensible is failure to respond, his failure to lead. He said

664
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,520
the federal government is a backup. I always thought leadership meant you are in front.

665
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:42,920
Failure to mobilize resources. Incredible that FEMA and 50 states compete for the same

666
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,600
resources instead of FEMA taking over and allocating it to the states.

667
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:54,840
The obviously trivialization of the threat for two months, all these things are almost off the

668
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:00,520
scale. And then, Cudi is saying he's withholding $500 million from the World Health Organization

669
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:07,720
in the middle of a pandemic. Stephen King would not be believed if he wrote these things in a novel.

670
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:15,000
So, what else can you say about this guy? States have varied. I'm in Louisiana, I think,

671
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,720
Governor here, John Bell Edwards, has done pretty well.

672
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,080
Recently, early, I think the mayor of New Orleans also acted pretty early. I know there's

673
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:30,200
Mardi Gras' blame for Louisiana being, and New Orleans being a hot spot, which may be the case.

674
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:36,920
But if you look at the timing, when Mardi Gras appeared and when the February, I guess 25th,

675
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:42,360
was Mardi Gras, it was not a single case in the state of Louisiana at that time that we knew of.

676
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:48,280
There were probably cases. Obviously, there were Mardi Gras spread in it. But all that goes back to

677
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:57,480
the testing debacle, which unfortunately, I think partly is a result of CDC. And I have high respect,

678
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:05,320
high regard for CDC. But on that one, not great than FDA and the bureaucracy, but also Trump and

679
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:11,640
the failure to take this seriously, the failure to develop an infrastructure going forward.

680
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,800
I've seen a number that says we're going to need 300,000 people for testing and contact tracing and

681
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:23,720
so forth. When we come out of that, this, I don't think one person's been hired for that at this

682
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:28,840
point. We should be building that infrastructure up even while we're waiting for the testing

683
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:33,400
capacity to develop. That should be done simultaneously. There are countries who've

684
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:39,960
got this pretty right. And again, not just the Asian countries like Korean, Singapore, and Taiwan,

685
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:47,000
and Hong Kong, but Germany, very much like our country, except for the leadership.

686
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,720
What Sweden is doing now, it's too soon to perhaps tell, but what's your take on the,

687
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,840
for lack of a better word, the natural experiment going on in Sweden?

688
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,480
Right.

689
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:00,360
They're basically saying, look, we're going to pursue this through the landscape of herd immunity.

690
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,520
While protecting the vulnerable.

691
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,600
Yeah, we're going to take a selective approach to taking those people who are most at risk. Now,

692
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,680
we've had the luxury of watching how that's played out in the rest of the world, but we're

693
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,720
not going to shut our economy down. And they're what they're basically saying without saying it

694
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,560
explicitly. I don't know if they know that this is what they're saying. They're basically saying,

695
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:25,800
we completely disagree that the case fatality rate is one to 2%. We think that the infection

696
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:33,240
fatality rate is probably closer to that of influenza 0.1 to 0.2, 0.3%, because we believe

697
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:38,600
that there are far more asymptomatic people out there than we appreciate, therefore creating a

698
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,760
much larger denominator. And that's synonymous with saying you're going to get to herd immunity

699
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,080
quicker.

700
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,840
Number one, they will get to herd immunity quicker if herd immunity-

701
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,000
Well, without catastrophic findings, yeah.

702
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,040
The thing is the infection mortality rate and the case mortality rate or fatality rate

703
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,040
are often used interchangeably, but they're not at all the same.

704
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,560
They're not. That's right.

705
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:05,400
If you did a serological study to find out how many people were infected with influenza,

706
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:14,360
the numbers that influenza case mortality, I'm convinced would drop from 0.1% way off the scale,

707
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,440
way below that, because there are people who are exposed to the virus. I mean, serological study

708
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:29,240
infection rate, anybody who's immune system responds to a virus, which you can find serologically.

709
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:35,880
So there are certainly people who are infected by influenza or any other pathogen who never

710
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:41,800
develop the slightest symptom or the slightest illness of any kind. And normally a case fatality

711
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:50,040
rate is just that. It's a case, meaning somebody has to be ill enough to present to a physician.

712
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,040
So you can't really compare the infection fatality rate with the case fatality rate.

713
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,080
Yeah, that's a very good point, John, is if you're going to do this apples to apples,

714
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:09,720
you need serologic IFRs for both. Going forward, where can we bend the arc of history? Where do we,

715
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:15,560
five years from now, look back and say, on April 15th, had we gone down this path,

716
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:19,240
it would have been a better outcome than if we'd gone down this path. What does that look like?

717
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:27,000
Well, I mean, it's sort of the same thing. We still have an administration that has demonstrated

718
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:35,160
no leadership and is foundry. In reality, it's not going to happen if Trump got out of the way and

719
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:44,600
left it to Tony Fauci. In those working groups I mentioned earlier about what planning for a

720
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:52,120
pandemic, what he do, we discussed who should be a spokesperson. And we were unanimous that it

721
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:58,040
should not be any politician, because any politician, healthy human services secretary,

722
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:04,120
or president, or anyone else, a substantial portion of the public, no matter how popular

723
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:11,480
the politician was, was not going to believe him or was going to have some kind of inherent

724
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:17,560
negative response to anything that person said. So we sat around and we figured the perfect

725
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:24,360
spokesperson would have been Edward Coupe, but he was already dead. I think it was at the time.

726
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,600
And the second best would have been Tony Fauci. So we now have Tony Fauci. I think

727
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:37,480
were he allowed to be the spokesperson, that would go a long way toward figuring out what to do.

728
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:44,200
I think controlling expectations is important. I think by trying to promise that we're coming out

729
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:50,920
on this date or the next date, whatever it is, and then you don't do it, that makes compliance

730
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,760
that much more difficult. It is what it is, as the saying goes. Trump's not going to change.

731
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:03,160
He's not going to get out of the way. The economic concerns are real. The management

732
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:10,680
of those concerns is extraordinarily difficult. Obviously, we can't stay locked down month after

733
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:17,000
month after month, but we do need to get that infrastructure in place for testing and monitoring

734
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:22,200
if we have enough social distancing to get ahead of the virus in the way that,

735
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:27,000
well, we'll never get ahead the way South Korea and so forth have because we started so far behind.

736
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,920
But we might get a little bit ahead of it. And of course, as you know, the Asian countries and

737
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:39,000
elsewhere where they have been successful, the virus is surging again. Still nothing like the

738
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,040
numbers that we're seeing in the United States, but the virus is going to be with us probably

739
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:51,080
forever. It will be a new human disease. Hopefully, natural immunity will provide significant

740
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:57,240
protection in the future to everybody. The second time around the human system sees the virus,

741
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:01,720
it should be much more efficient in dealing with it. And then of course, the hope for a vaccine.

742
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,120
People seem to be pretty optimistic about that. So I didn't really answer your question.

743
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,600
No, actually, I think you actually did. And then some, I think you provided

744
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:15,320
kind of a greater insight around it. I guess the last question I'll ask you is,

745
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:22,200
are you optimistic, is there a silver lining here that this has been a large enough jolt

746
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:30,200
to our systems that we will now not only go back and remember the forgotten pandemic,

747
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:35,400
but perhaps put into place more of the pandemic preparedness stuff that people like you and

748
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,200
others for whom you're not just new to this have talked about for many years?

749
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,120
I don't know if I call it a silver lining. People don't have to remember 1918 anymore. All I have

750
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:52,440
to remember is 2020. Clearly, there will be a significant investment monitoring emerging

751
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:58,440
diseases much more so than there used to be. In fact, West Nile, which I guess technically was

752
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:03,640
an emerging disease, but it never killed more than 300 Americans a year. If you understood the

753
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,960
natural history of that disease, it was never going to be a serious threat to human health.

754
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,600
If you were a horse, you might be in trouble, but for humans, not so bad. And yet West Nile

755
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:20,440
was getting more research money than influenza was when West Nile surfaced.

756
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,720
That's a remarkable statistic.

757
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:30,120
Influenza just didn't get the respect to quote Rodney Dangerfield, didn't get no respect.

758
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:38,920
H5N1 surfaced and things changed. Suddenly, nations around the world took it seriously.

759
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:45,640
As I said, the Bush administration passed a $7 billion bill to invest in pandemic preparedness.

760
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:54,440
Had we had the investment over time that has come in the last 15 years, we probably have a universal

761
01:17:54,440 --> 01:18:01,320
influenza vaccine by now. But we didn't. Going forward, obviously, there'll be a lot of work

762
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:08,040
on coronaviruses. Thankfully, SARS and MERS did emerge, or we wouldn't have the knowledge base

763
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:17,560
we have now, which has given us a huge head start on drugs and vaccines for this. And probably

764
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:25,560
there'll be some serious money spent on preparing for any emerging pathogen, which would probably

765
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:31,640
be a virus. It might conceivably be something else, most likely a virus, as I'm sure you know.

766
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:39,160
There are plenty of animal viruses out there. As development encroaches more and more upon what

767
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:44,840
used to be the wild, we will encounter more of those viruses. And they're all threats.

768
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:50,360
John, I want to thank you for not just the work you've done leading up to this, but also just for

769
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,480
taking the time today to talk about this. I know you're probably sought after at this time,

770
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,840
and you're probably tired of talking about this. And there's probably other things you'd rather be

771
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:02,680
doing to take your mind off this. But I enjoy, very much enjoy talking to you and a former

772
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:08,600
fellow of C. Rosenberg. It's great. Well, again, be well, John, and I look forward to speaking again.

773
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:14,680
Okay, thanks. Take care. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're

01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:39,480
show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode.

779
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:45,240
The word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me

780
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:49,960
anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast

781
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,200
feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this.

782
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:59,720
The Qwallys, which are a super short podcast, typically less than five minutes that we release

783
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,120
every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

784
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:09,480
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having

785
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:15,000
to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in,

786
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,640
but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue

787
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:24,200
to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member only benefits,
