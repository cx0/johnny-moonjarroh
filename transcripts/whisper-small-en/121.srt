00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,480
today's episode. I guess this week is Dr. Azra Raza. Dr. Raza is a professor of medicine and

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,640
the director of the MDS Center at Columbia University in New York. She is a practicing

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,240
oncologist and a cancer researcher who has been published in over 300 peer review manuscripts.

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,440
She grew up in the attended medical school in Pakistan before moving to the United States

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,240
for her clinical training, which we discuss briefly. She's an expert in myelodysplastic

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,880
syndrome, which is a form of pre-leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia AML. She's a recipient

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,600
of a number of awards, including the 2012 Hope Award in Cancer Research, which she shared with

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,240
Nobel Laureate, Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn. Dr. Raza is an outspoken advocate for completely

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,880
reconfiguring the current model of research in cancer. And the purpose of this discussion is

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,480
really to dive into her beautiful book, The First Cell, which really is a completely critical look

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:55,800
at how medical research is using the wrong types of models. My words, not hers, the ROI on spending

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,600
is completely out of line with what anybody would consider reasonable if they were to consider it

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,880
from an objective lens. And frankly, we end with what I think is a very thoughtful discussion

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
around what the way forward looks like, because you could easily get through this. I always love

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,600
to speak with a person a little bit before and a little bit after. And at the end, she said,

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,760
you know, gosh, I really, I hope we didn't get too much onto a down note. And I said,

25
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,720
no, I don't think we did. I think that there's enough sort of hype around cancer research that

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,680
it's okay to lift the sheets a little bit and show this side of things. A couple things I'd

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,040
say about this episode. First of all, Azra goes out of her way both in the book and if you hear

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,840
her in other interviews to say, look, this is not someone who considers herself a writer, this is a

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,440
person who considers herself both a physician and a scientist. And in many ways sort of wrote this

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,160
book because she just really needed to talk about this stuff, to which I would say one,

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,120
it's very beautifully written, but two, I was blown away at the literary sprinklings that made

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,760
their way into this. I mean, and you have to remember we're doing this by Zoom basically,

33
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,200
or a comparable platform. So we can look at each other on video. And just as sure as I'm

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,280
looking at another person across from the table, I would ask her a question and she would respond

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,960
by quoting Emily Dickinson. And not just quote it like I've memorized this, but quote it in the most

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,400
lyrical way. So I think if you're a fan of literature, science, you have an interest in

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,040
oncology, there are a lot of things you'll get out of this episode. So I'll leave it at that.

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,680
And I hope that you do enjoy my conversation with Dr. Azra Rouser.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Azra, thank you so much for not just making time to be here today. But as you told me before,

40
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,800
we started setting aside a lot of time. It's an honor to sit with you. I've known a little bit

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,880
about you before your book was published, because one of my colleagues knew about you and said,

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,120
hey, this is an amazing woman who's in the process of writing an amazing book. And you're

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,080
definitely going to want to not only read it, but more importantly, I think, speak with her and be

44
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,160
able to interview her and talk more broadly about this subject matter. And it's hard to believe that

45
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,560
was probably a year ago, if not more. You're an oncologist by training. And I've seen a couple of

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,760
your short interviews, though I've gone out of my way to not listen to you on previous podcasts,

47
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,960
who is not color how I want to talk with you. But the two times I've seen you on very short clips on

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,520
YouTube, you've made it very clear that you are not a writer, which I find ironic, given how well

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:33,760
you write. So at what point did you decide that a book was an appropriate tool to communicate the

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,880
amazing ideas that we're going to spend a lot of time getting into? Thank you, Peter, for having me

51
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:50,360
on your podcast. I have been an admirer of your work and of the kind of wellness philosophy that

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,880
you propose, you belong to, you practice, you propagate, you promote, I love it all. And the

53
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,600
number of things you do is very admirable. So it's really a pleasure to be on your podcast. I have to

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,000
tell you that Dorothy Parker once said that if one of your friends come to you, and they say they

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,200
want to write a book, the second biggest favor you can do them is give them a copy of the elements of

56
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:27,880
style by Strunk and White. And of course, the first favor is kill them immediately. So I knew all

57
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,880
along that I'm never going to write a book because I'm going to I'm a big admirer of Dorothy Parker.

58
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,000
And then what happened, Peter, is that one of my dear friends in New York who happens to be a

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,360
literary agent, and John Brockman, and his wife Katinka would often talk to me and say, Ezra,

60
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,280
how about writing a book? And I would say, no, I'm not a writer. And they would say, well, you're

61
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,120
wringing us with the same things for 10 years. All that is wrong. You want to do something, you want

62
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,320
to change the field, write a book. I will get it published. And I would keep saying no, until I had

63
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:12,760
course as an oncologist, number one, after 30 years of being in the field, I had a little bit to say.

64
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,920
But then the second thing is that I'm also being a basic science researcher. I've had a very active

65
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:28,280
lab all along. And my third credential is that I'm a cancer widow. So I have experienced oncology

66
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,520
from all three perspectives as an oncologist who sees 30 to 40 patients a week for the last 30 plus

67
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:44,200
years as a basic researcher who's had a well-funded lab for 35 years, and as someone who

68
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,760
stood on both sides of the bed at the same time of a cancer patient who was the love of my life. So

69
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:59,080
even these credentials, Peter, were not sufficient to motivate me to write the book. What did it was

70
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,600
my daughter, Scheherzad's best friend since 15 years of age, not her boyfriend, her best friend

71
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:14,040
who was gay, Andrew, at 22 years of age finds the field's weakness in his arm and taken to the

72
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,240
emergency room. He's quadriplegic within hours, and he's found to have a nine centimeter

73
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,440
large brain tumor, which was unresectable. And pathology showed that it is one of the most

74
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,600
malignant tumors ever known to mankind, glioblastoma multiforme. When this boy opened his eyes and he

75
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,000
told his diagnosis, the first thing he told his mother, Peter, was, mom, don't worry, just call

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Ezra. She's on the cutting edge. She will cure me. So here I am. It slapped me in the face physically

77
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,080
that on the one hand, the ferociousness and violence of his tumor, and on the other hand,

78
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:05,320
the utter helplessness of all of us, his oncologists, to do anything about it, our complete

79
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:14,360
failure in front of Andrew. How is it possible that we are so spectacularly failing a 22 year old boy?

80
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,200
That's what forced me to write the book. Someone once said, and I'm sure it's been paraphrased,

81
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,040
and so I won't attribute it because I don't know where it came from. But the only reason to write

82
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,440
a book is if you absolutely can't not write it. And it sounds like that's sort of where you were

83
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,320
after all of the things that you've described, which is not only losing Harvey, which I think

84
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:44,120
he died in 2002, is that correct? Correct. And then the story about Andrew, who obviously was

85
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,240
about 60, 70 years too young to die from anything, let alone a GBM, which is a tumor I've certainly

86
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,320
spoken about on this podcast before, and I think we'll talk a little bit more about it.

87
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,840
Also, the other things we're going to talk about, which are the sort of the structural failings of

88
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,920
the system that you felt were, if I were going to sort of try to describe your book, a big part of

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,840
it is the return on investment has been very poor. That's sort of one way to summarize it. There are

90
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,560
many ways to sort of summarize it, but an overarching theme has been it hasn't been that

91
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,400
we haven't spent a lot of money. It hasn't been that we haven't made some progress. It hasn't

92
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:29,400
been for a lack of trying, but by any objective metric that we would apply to any standard of

93
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:36,200
anything else, the return on that investment has been so paltry that if we are not smart enough to

94
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,720
at least consider doing something totally different, we're completely diluted. And again,

95
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,040
I think that's one tiny piece of it, and that's probably that burning piece that I think your

96
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,800
agent was ultimately saying, this is either going to erode a hole through the gastric lining of your

97
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,920
stomach or you better put it on paper. Yes, I agree. So let's start with oncology. What drove

98
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,240
you to oncology? Why did you choose to become an oncologist in an era when women could have chosen

99
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,480
far less demanding fields in medicine? Not that any field in medicine is more or less demanding,

100
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,560
but oncology is about as demanding as it gets. What was the thinking for you?

101
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,040
That's an astute observation actually, because when I was going into oncology,

102
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:29,400
it was the least popular field. In fact, most people when I said I'm going into oncology thought,

103
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,200
okay, she couldn't get into any other fellowship. That's why because only Indians and Pakistanis

104
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,000
go into oncology. Who else would in their right minds would want to go? Except for me,

105
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,720
it was a deliberate choice. So Peter, I was born and raised in Pakistan. But since I was a little

106
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,440
girl, since as far back as four years old, that is my first memory, I was very interested in the

107
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,040
natural world around me. I would be at four years, I'd be following ants around and imagining all

108
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,240
kinds of things and started reading about science for as far back as I remember really. And as I

109
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,680
was growing up, I got more and more interested in different fields. Embryology at one point became

110
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,320
an obsession. By the time I was 16, I had read all about evolution and evolutionary biology. I

111
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,880
had become a big Darwinian fan. Everything I was looking at was through the prism of evolution for

112
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:31,320
a long time. But then had I grown up in a country where choices were available to me, I'm confident

113
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:38,600
that I would have gone into molecular biology as a pure science or some of the one to study one of

114
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:46,600
the natural things like marine biology, maybe you're probably more mycology and but in Pakistan

115
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,600
where I grew up, there was no possibility of entering science except through medicine. So

116
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,000
very cleverly, I thought I'm going to go join medical school as soon as I complete, I will

117
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,880
proceed to the west and there I will start my PhD in real scientific training. But the problem

118
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,840
that happened with me was in third year of medical school when I saw my first patient,

119
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:19,800
one look was all it took. And I realized from that moment on that all of my life would be devoted to

120
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:29,880
somehow use the best that science has to offer to reduce human suffering. And I have stuck to that.

121
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,320
The second thing that happened was so I knew that I will do research in science, but it would be

122
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,000
therapy driven and the patient would be front and center for me always. Second thing that happened

123
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,320
was that I was in Karachi, Pakistan. Karachi is the largest city in the country. And people who get

124
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,960
sick around Karachi in the suburban areas have no access really to medical care. It's a very

125
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,880
impoverished third world country with a very overcrowded city where I grew up. So cancer

126
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,200
patients, when they came, Peter, they would travel long distances on their donkey carts and on

127
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,200
foot. By the time they came, they would have hugely advanced tumors that I've never seen since.

128
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,920
Even in Pakistan, we don't see them now. But back then in the early 70s, the kind of end stage

129
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,120
malignancies sprouting through breasts or like huge lumps just breaking out of people's heads and

130
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:38,520
arms and sarcomas that I saw. So it was the malevolence of the tumor, the violence of the disease,

131
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,600
on the one hand, on the other hand, the intellectual challenge of trying to figure out how this whole

132
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:52,360
thing began in a single cell and how that cell goes rogue. What journeys has it undertaken to

133
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:01,240
reach this level of malignancy? So it was the dual emotional as well as intellectual grip

134
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:10,200
that basically caught me at a young age. And I'm confident that if I'm given 70 more lives,

135
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:17,640
I will do exactly the same thing 70 more times. Do you still remember that first patient you saw

136
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,640
as a third year medical student? Do you remember anything about them? What condition they had?

137
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,720
Anything about them the way they looked? Actually, thank you for asking. Absolutely.

138
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,320
The patient was a young woman with acute myeloid leukemia. And she was very strange because she

139
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,800
presented with a very large spleen as well. So we knew that she must have had a prior myeloproliferative

140
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,840
myelodysplastic, some sort of a preter cell that led up to the acute leukemia. So right there,

141
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:55,320
and then I started having discussions with my teachers that how much easier it would be to

142
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,480
study a liquid tumor because cells are already in suspension and you can go in and sample them so

143
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,640
many times instead of trying to study a solid tumor, which is a mass that you can only remove

144
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,040
once next time it appears it wouldn't even be the same tumor. And you don't have the luxury of

145
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,200
accessing the tumor before, during, and after treatment. So that patient is etched on my brain

146
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,760
as if it was yesterday's breakfast. Yeah, I find that phenomenon to be interesting amongst many

147
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:33,800
physicians, both oncologists and not oncologists. Steve Rosenberg, who is my mentor, talks often

148
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,560
about a patient that changed the course of his life when he was early in his residency. A patient

149
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,760
that had metastatic gastric cancer to the liver five years earlier was basically sent home to die,

150
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,840
shows up in the ER to have his gallbladder taken out, should have been dead five years less six

151
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,680
months earlier. He's completely free of tumor, which ultimately after double, triple, quadruple

152
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,440
checking led Steve to conclude the only way this is possible, this is back in 1968, is if his immune

153
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,280
system eradicated that cancer. And Steve became one of the people who has pursued that to incredible

154
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,560
ends. And though I've done nothing special, I still remember the first patient I saw in the

155
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,720
hospital. And so though it wouldn't become the catalyst for anything particularly unique,

156
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,760
we send first year medical students on day one into clinic. They can't do anything. They are

157
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,680
literally there to just watch and try not to get in the way. But I selected oncology and I went to

158
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,640
the medical oncology clinic and I remember that very first patient on that very first day. And

159
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,880
I still remember strange details like what the color was of the clothing of different people in

160
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,200
the room that day. He had stage four colorectal cancer. There was my probably one of the first

161
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,800
times I'd ever seen a CT scan and certainly seen it with such a clinical emphasis on, okay, look,

162
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,920
these are now tumors that have spread to both sides of his liver. The primary tumor was here.

163
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,320
You can see all of these places. I would go on to become very close friends with that patient

164
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,520
who ultimately died two years later. His widow would come to my medical school graduation

165
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,760
two years after that. So yeah, there is something really special about medical education and it can

166
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,840
totally derail the best laid plans of becoming the world's expert on ants. Yes. And by the way,

167
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,000
I do teach a course that is foundation of clinical medicine where first year medical students at

168
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,600
Columbia University are exposed to being clinic. And I'm mindful of this experience. What are,

169
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,800
how is this going to change the rest of their lives? The experience has to be somehow we can't

170
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:48,440
take away the pain. It's like Emily Dickinson said, tell all the truth, but tell it slant.

171
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:57,640
Success in circuit lies. Too bright for our infirm delight, the truth superb surprise.

172
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:07,160
As lightning to the children eased with explanation kind, the truth must dazzle

173
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:16,040
gradually or every man be blind. I'm very mindful of that when first year students come to me.

174
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:23,640
Asra, you're the only person who's going to not just quote Emily in the midst of discussion,

175
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,600
but do so eloquently and to think that there was any doubt you were a writer is only comical to me,

176
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,480
but we'll come back to that. So when you finished medical school, not only did you realize you

177
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,960
wanted to be a clinician, but I think the hook of oncology was already well into you. Yes, absolutely.

178
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,800
Now let's pivot for a moment to allow you to explain to the listener what the state of

179
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:59,240
oncology looked like at that time. Specifically, when you consider what it meant to have metastatic

180
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,320
cancer and let's for a moment, posit that we're going to talk about solid organ tumors separately

181
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,920
from liquid tumors. If a woman had breast cancer and either at presentation or later, it had spread

182
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,840
to her lungs, to her brain, to her bones. If a man had prostate cancer that had spread to his bones,

183
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,440
if a person had colon cancer that had spread to their liver, what was the prognosis and how long

184
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,000
would they be expected to survive? I think to start with Peter, the important thing is that

185
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:40,360
when I started in oncology, it was almost a stigma to have cancer. The kind of causes of cancer we

186
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,680
were taught were basically either there's a genetic or hereditary component where you have a predisposition

187
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:53,880
for high risk of some sorts of cancers or is it some environmental exposure, some kind of toxins

188
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:02,760
that you've been facing or pathogens. Pathogens were considered a very exciting new avenue for

189
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,240
research at the time that maybe it's a viral disease of some sort, especially retroviruses

190
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:17,080
and clearly there was already a very strong component of association with things like smoking.

191
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:25,480
So while there were these kinds of positive factors for cancer, most people who presented

192
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:33,480
already had rather advanced diseases and very little screening measures were being performed

193
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:42,680
at the time. So they would come with in Pakistan especially with the kind of textbook pictures of

194
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:52,680
fungating masses coming, breaking through breasts in women or men suddenly showing up with complete

195
00:20:52,680 --> 00:21:01,160
urinary blockage, unable to urinate and we would have to do emergency kinds of things. It would be

196
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,600
quite devastating and of course there were people who, women who felt a lump and came in and so I

197
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,200
remember how many times I was assisting in mastectomies and considered for a long time to

198
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,560
go into surgical oncology because that seemed to be the cleanest treatment at the time. Cut it out,

199
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,240
you don't have to start chasing the last cancer cell with these poisonous things we were giving.

200
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:35,560
Even radiation was quite primitive at the time and quite terrible to patients. So it was all in all,

201
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:41,640
it was a stigma to begin with, people didn't want to talk about it, many people hid it, the tumors

202
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,560
from themselves even would delude themselves into thinking that this is some kind of infection,

203
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:54,040
it will go away. So most people presented with advanced cancers. The problem that I see though

204
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:04,440
before I end this answer is that today in 2020, if you want to measure the success of treatment

205
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:12,120
in cancer then the thing you need to look at Peter is what is the age-adjusted mortality

206
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:19,800
of cancer today. In 2020, you know what it is? It is the same as it was in 1930.

207
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,680
So that's interesting. I usually make the statement, it's the same as 1970. I didn't realize it was

208
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,280
still the same as, you go back even further, I usually just make the point that in 50 years

209
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,840
it hasn't changed. You're saying in 90 years it hasn't changed. Yes, I'm saying that because the

210
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:47,880
30% or 27% decline in mortality we are seeing in the last 30 years is following a 30 years increase

211
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,680
in mortality in cancer. You see what happened was that with all the smoking anyone who watches

212
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,280
Mad Men is shocked to see it like my daughter saw it and she was, mommy is that what people used to

213
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:08,040
be like everywhere they were just smoking, everybody was smoking. This led to such an increase in the

214
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:16,200
incidence of cancer so that the decline in mortality basically parallels the decline in smoking.

215
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:24,360
That is all that has happened. Otherwise, we are really at square one and that is the embarrassment

216
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,240
that nobody wants to recognize. In fact, somebody asked me the other day, what exactly is your point

217
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:38,760
in saying, I said look, Nietzsche's Thus Bakes Zarathustra opens with this man running around with

218
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:45,800
a lamp at noon in the middle of the market saying I'm looking for God. For me, it's like I'm running

219
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,040
around looking for an adult in the room. Yeah, so let's explain to people, let's explain some of the

220
00:23:52,040 --> 00:24:00,200
nuance here because most people are confused by what an extension in disease-free survival means.

221
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Not that the average person knows what the difference is between a PR and a CR but you and

222
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,120
I both know this world well because we've been on the inside of how these clinical trials are run.

223
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,440
So we understand that, hey, this drug got approved because X number of people met the

224
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,240
criteria for a PR which has a kind of a funky arbitrary definition if you're going to be

225
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,440
brutally honest of what a partial response is defined as. A complete response is a little easier

226
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,720
to define but then we don't talk about what durability means in all of these things. So

227
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,280
I could give an entire soliloquy and lecture on this but I'd much rather listen to you do it

228
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,000
eloquently because the chance that you're going to quote more poetry is reasonably high. So can

229
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,240
you explain for folks what it means to have a partial response, a complete response? And the

230
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,360
reason I think it's important to do this even though it sounds a little dry, you're saying

231
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,600
things that seem completely at odds with what the propaganda machine is saying. Now I know you're

232
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:05,560
right because I know how the sausage is made. I've been inside the belly of the sausage. I understand

233
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:12,280
how to read the literature. That is actually asking a lot for someone who maybe just wants

234
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,800
to better understand oncology but they haven't had the luxury of training in oncology or even

235
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,280
more importantly I think doing research in oncology. So can you go through some of the

236
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,480
fundamentals of what these semantics are that are used, how these terms get thrown around

237
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,800
and how ultimately it can lead to some statements like the one you just made frankly which is as

238
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,360
extreme as extreme could be with respect to saying, hey look in 90 years we really haven't

239
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:46,840
gotten better at extending life in people with cancer once they have cancer. So let's unpack

240
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,960
some of these definitions a bit. I think that's a good place to start. So let me begin by a little

241
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,520
bit of just history because before we get into nuances why not just talk about the very gross

242
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,840
facts. Cancer is a very bad disease. Everybody knows it. The only good news you can give to a

243
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:14,040
cancer patient is that oh we caught it early so we can get rid of it. So we know that cancer itself

244
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,480
may not kill. It's the delay in treatment that really kills. So the earlier we pick it up the

245
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,200
better. How have we treated cancer which has been found even in mummies so we know cancer has

246
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,920
existed all along but the incidence probably it is a disease of modernity associated with many

247
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:41,080
many of our lifestyle changes from hunter-gatherer society to modern human. Nonetheless cancer was

248
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:48,760
identified in mummies and has been there all along in human history. How have we treated it? Well the

249
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,480
first treatment of cancer even though it wasn't even called cancer then was in 500 BC when the

250
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:03,000
Persian queen Atossa had felt a lump in her breast. She tried to hide it by covering it with

251
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,400
sheets and things and eventually asked her Greek slave who took out his sword and simply slashed

252
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:18,280
off her breast. She survived it. She was the wife of Darius and she survives it and this is the first

253
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:26,360
known surgery. We were slashing women's breasts in 500 BC. What is the primary treatment for

254
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:33,240
breast cancer today? Same slash. And we typically give Halstead credit for that. So this is my point

255
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,840
that for 2500 years what has exactly changed? Slight better scallopals and giving anesthesia

256
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:48,920
while doing it. Okay yes. Then second is that when you couldn't so whatever cancer was detected

257
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,080
early enough as a solid tumor was cut out and the liquid tumors you couldn't cut out so you needed

258
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:02,920
to poison them somehow. Now how do you poison these things? There was really nothing could be done

259
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,200
about it until in the first world war. Of course it wasn't called the first world war because we

260
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,200
didn't know there's going to be a second. So it was called the great war. Part of development of

261
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,440
weapons against each other was use of chemicals. And so when these vats of chemicals were sitting

262
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:28,360
around that were dropped on humanity people noted that one of the side effects that people died from

263
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:36,120
was low blood counts. So Goodman and Gilman, two pharmacologists sitting around in Yale decided

264
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,040
that this could be used to treat cancer then these chemicals. So do you know the first three

265
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,240
chemical weapons that were used to treat cancer? Cytoxone, chlorambucil and melphalan. We still use

266
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:57,080
at least two of those. I gave all three with my own hands to my own husband Harvey. So we are

267
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,800
slashing. We are poisoning the same way and then burning with radiation therapy the same way. So

268
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:12,840
I wanted the audience to understand the kind of dramatic statements or melodramatic statements

269
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:21,320
that I'm making are not baseless. People just have to stop deluding themselves, open their eyes and

270
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:29,160
see what is in front of them. So to just finish this part with a quotation of statistics.

271
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:39,160
In this day and age today, 68% of cancers that we diagnose new cases, 68% are cured.

272
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:50,120
Cured with wattpeter, poison burn, surgery, radiation and chemo. Except for a few cancers

273
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:59,080
where there are targeted therapies or antibodies available, really not much has happened. The 32

274
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:06,200
who present with advanced disease that we can't use slash poison burn. So imagine the same

275
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,600
treatments that were working in earlier stages are not working in later stages. This is the best

276
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,440
proof that the only thing we can do right now is to find the cancer earlier. And even some of the

277
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:26,280
therapies not working like targeted therapies may work better if we don't give them to stage four.

278
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:33,000
Flit 3 mutations quarterly may respond much better to Flit 3 inhibitors. This is the point

279
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,480
I will keep making over and over. I want to stop you for a second there, Ezra, because honestly

280
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:47,640
that is something that I have only in the last few years come to share your zeal for.

281
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,120
And I can't emphasize it enough. So there was a day when I believed, incorrectly now,

282
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:01,080
I believe I was incorrect, that burden of tumor was not the primary determinant factor. Stage four

283
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,680
cancer was stage four cancer, whether the burden was high or low. And it was really a property of

284
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,960
the biology of the cancer that was the issue. So in other words, if you took a whole bunch of women

285
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:19,080
with stage one breast cancer, you took 100 women that had sub centimeter lymph node negative breast

286
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:27,080
cancer, and you had a machine that could tell you which ones had the potential to go on to

287
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,040
have metastatic cancer versus those ones that did not. And let's maybe breast cancer wasn't a great

288
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,640
example because of the hormone complexity of it, that whether you acted then or acted later,

289
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,360
it wasn't going to matter. Well, I no longer believe that is true for reasons I could expand

290
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,520
upon. I want to emphasize the point you're making, which is, I mean, it's the contra-positive of your

291
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:55,960
point, which is we don't really have therapy that works for systemic disease. So metastatic breast

292
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,520
cancer, metastatic colon cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, metastatic, you fill in the

293
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:10,840
blank, you are no better off today than you were 50 years ago. And that is a very sobering, if not

294
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:18,120
outright depressing statistic. It's very difficult for the average person to comprehend that for all

295
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:25,960
our advances, once colon cancer has gone to your liver in 2020, you are almost as hopeless as you

296
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,320
were in 1970. And in fact, you can probably put more color around it and say, well, technically,

297
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,120
Peter, you might live four and a half more months. And I don't want to discount that. I want to talk

298
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,320
about what the cost of that is. But I mean, do you agree with, am I also being a little too dramatic

299
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,080
or would you agree with my assessment? I think you're using meiosis, meaning understated.

300
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,280
Seriously, how do you tell a 22 year old, Andrew, that we will add four months to your life, you

301
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:02,280
should go and celebrate and proclaim from the rooftops. What kind of nonsense is this? Four

302
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,040
months of improvement in survival. And that is the lucky one to get it. You know what it is,

303
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,160
why people will be shocked. Why should they be shocked? They'll be shocked because they are

304
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:21,000
listening. Poor things have been subjected to the ultra hype of all this self promotion of scientists

305
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,680
and oncologists patting themselves on the back for game changers that they have. Allow me to expand

306
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:37,960
on what has, in my opinion, put the field back by decades. And that is the treatments that are most

307
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:47,240
celebrated in cancer are treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. This is a disease which is a disease

308
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,240
of the myeloid cells in the bone marrow, which undergoes a chronic phase where nothing much is

309
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,240
happening, except one fine day something mutates, something happens, the disease takes off into an

310
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,960
accelerated phase and then becomes acute leukemia and it is universally fatal. And all of us who are

311
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,360
older like me have taken care of dozens of these patients who died in our own hands, young people,

312
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:21,320
as well as old. Well, it turned out that chronic myeloid leukemia is caused by one genetic change

313
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,360
that can be targeted with one magic bullet. And that magic bullet is Gliwack and that was FDA

314
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:34,680
approved in 2000. And now these people are being cured with one drug. And this is a fantastic

315
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:40,840
success. But Peter, the same drug doesn't work when the disease starts to accelerate.

316
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,920
So chronic myeloid leukemia, think of the word chronic hair. It's not really a malignancy. It's

317
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:57,400
like a pre leukemia right now. You caught it early. At that stage, there was only one problem and you

318
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,600
could fix it with one bullet, right? Can we put that in perspective for people? Because I want

319
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,200
to make sure we're not. I don't want the naysayer to have too much wiggle room to say, well, you've

320
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,040
discounted the success stories, Gliwack. We're going to probably talk about some of the checkpoint

321
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,240
inhibitors as well, which have probably been the single biggest victory in the past five years.

322
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,320
Do we have a sense of what percentage cancer mortality has come down on the back of Gliwack,

323
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,920
not just from CML, but let's also look at GI stromal tumors, which have at least for some period

324
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,120
of time responded to Gliwack, though it might not be the most durable remission ever. I mean,

325
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:41,080
what type of numbers are we talking about? Has that put a 1% dent in cancer mortality in the

326
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:49,080
past 20 years? If that, it's a very rare disease. Yeah, exactly. Very rare, but it did prove a point,

327
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:55,320
which is that targeted therapy can work. This is the point I'm making that it's not even really

328
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:02,520
a cancer yet in all its malignant manifestations that other cancers are. The second thing we

329
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,040
celebrate is again in hematologic malignancies, which is acute pro-myelocytic leukemia,

330
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:16,120
which is cured with arsenic or with vitamin A analog, vitamin A, let's say, ATRA. It cures

331
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,240
acute pro-myelocytic leukemia, one of the deadliest acute leukemia. But do you know,

332
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:27,560
it wasn't as if scientists sat down, studied this disease, found the lesion of retinoic acid

333
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:34,040
receptor, and started to reverse it. Poor Chinese were saying for years that we are curing acute

334
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:42,040
pro-myelocytic leukemia with vitamins, and the West didn't believe them. Finally, they sent

335
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,640
somebody over and they saw all the patients and were convinced and came back and did a trial of

336
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,880
ATRA here and then were convinced and then worked backwards to find the molecular lesion.

337
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,280
So, please, scientists, do not take credit in front of me for acute pro-myelocytic

338
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,040
leukemia. You did not work it out. You only worked it out in retrospect. So, those are the

339
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:13,160
two biggest advances. Now, lymphomas absolutely agree that throwing cocktails of chemotherapy

340
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,680
together, testing this one and that one, they worked as because of the biology of the disease

341
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,280
that was responsive to those chemotherapies. That's what I'm telling you that some of the things that

342
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,440
have retarded progress in a way is because we become convinced of a paradigm that, oh, if

343
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,520
Hodgkin's disease can be cured with these four drugs, we just have to find the right four drugs

344
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,880
for pancreatic cancer or ovarian cancer and we'll fix it. And that's how we kept working.

345
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:49,640
Throwing crazy combinations of drugs together to follow the paradigms, the few successes that we

346
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,680
had seen, Hodgkin's disease, a few non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or acute pro-myelocytic leukemia,

347
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:03,160
chronic myeloid leukemia, I mean, multiple myeloma now has been very successfully treated,

348
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:10,600
but at that time it wasn't. But now it is definitely a night and day difference. But these

349
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:17,960
are again rare types of cancers, melanoma, dramatic differences in survival today.

350
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:26,040
But again, all of these together would account for less than 10% of cancers together. Still,

351
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,920
we have to go back to whatever we can slash, poison and burn. And successfully, we are able

352
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:39,640
to do that for 68% cancers either because their disease is responsive like in Hodgkin's lymphoma,

353
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:47,000
even if it's advanced or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or CLL or because it is amenable to surgery.

354
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:54,440
That's it. So where a counter argument here is, look, this is going to be a game of inches.

355
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,120
And the 10% that you just described, you basically gave the tour de force explanation of

356
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,720
oncology's greatest hits in the last three decades. And again, we didn't pay a lot of,

357
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,360
spend a lot of time on it, but I think the checkpoint inhibitors also have this huge impact

358
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:18,040
beyond just melanoma because anybody who shows up with a checkpoint mutation, even if you have

359
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,920
Lynch syndrome and you go on to get pancreatic adenocarcinoma, you're probably going to respond.

360
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,960
Let's just say that adds up to 8% or 9% of the 68%. So the skeptic would say, but look,

361
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:37,480
Azra, that's amazing progress. Give us another 40 years, give us another 30 years and cancer is

362
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:44,120
eradicated. That would be the optimistic view of this. How would you counter that view?

363
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,360
I don't want to counter anything. I mean, that's the way the field has been. I've been hearing the

364
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:58,440
same self satisfied voices saying the same thing, how wonderful they are, how they will understand

365
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,280
every intracellular signaling pathway in the cancer cell and reverse it, how they will understand

366
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,440
the metabolism. Don't even get me started on that because it's as if the last 100 years haven't

367
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,160
existed and people haven't had any ideas until these new investigators came around to, on their

368
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,560
white horses with their overconfidence and contempt for the past, armed with new things. We are going

369
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:31,160
to reverse all these. I mean, clearly, whatever advances there are, and I don't want to argue with

370
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:37,960
anyone about advances. You are saying there are a lot of advances. Great. Do they really reflect

371
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,760
the quarter of a trillion dollars we have invested in research? Is this all we have to show? A few

372
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,680
checkpoint inhibitors? Fine. I agree with you. Even if I agree with you. So let's just talk about

373
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,720
immune therapy for a minute. You say checkpoint inhibitors. There are many different kinds of

374
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,360
immune therapies, 14, 15 different kinds. The two most popular we talk about when we talk about

375
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:09,640
immune therapy these days is either the cell therapies that are given where you train the

376
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:17,320
lab that is the pioneer of all of this work with cell and cytokine, IL therapies combined with T

377
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,040
cells, et cetera, or the checkpoint inhibitors because normal cells will have signals on themselves

378
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,800
saying, eat me or don't eat me, and these can be masked, and these signals are the checkpoints.

379
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:37,720
And by using drugs, you can unmask the signal, which has been covered up by the cancer cell. Very

380
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:45,240
simple explanation for checkpoint. So the two main ideas in immunology that came along were how to

381
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:52,520
target these checkpoints so that the body's own immune cells can recognize the cancer as being

382
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:59,880
alien to the normal functioning of the body and must be eliminated. And the second is,

383
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:07,880
can you take the body's own immune cells and engineer them in such a way that they can

384
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:17,560
selectively kill cancer? And CAR T cells have been proclaimed once again as revolutionary.

385
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:26,360
Of course, the science behind it is beautiful. It's very sophisticated. It's one of those things

386
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,440
that make you want to celebrate humanity's accomplishments. It is just a gorgeous thing.

387
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,160
But the problem is that it has done very little for patients. Why? Because what all the oncologists

388
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:47,640
talking about CAR T never mention in any of their talks. And by the way, every morning,

389
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:55,800
I run every morning. And after I run, I jump on a small trampoline for 20 to 30 minutes every day,

390
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,080
because that's one way to stimulate your lymphatic system. And the trampoline is small,

391
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,640
rebounder, I should say, not a trampoline. It's one of the best exercises you can have. I've been

392
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:13,400
doing it for 25 plus years. So during that time, I listened to YouTube lectures to all of you

393
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,280
cancer researchers out there understand that there is one person who listens to your YouTube lectures

394
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,760
every single day. And the kinds of things people confess to in public forums very different than

395
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:35,240
the scientific papers they're writing in all of those talks. I have never heard any serious

396
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:43,320
scientist oncologist or immunologist say that their CAR T cells cannot distinguish between

397
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:51,000
normal and cancer cells. They just ignore that. It's like they just don't want to acknowledge it.

398
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,800
Why don't you say that basically CAR T cells are just another form of killing machine

399
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,760
indiscriminately. So what CAR T cells do is whatever antigen you put on it and whatever

400
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:12,200
organ expresses that antigen, it will go destroy the whole organ, taking down every normal cell of

401
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,640
that organ also. So basically, the only thing CAR T is working for right now is B cells because

402
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:25,560
you can replace B cell function after you kill every single last B cell in the body. But you

403
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,480
can't do that to pancreatic cancer because it will kill the whole pancreas and then you can't

404
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,720
replace the function. But how many times have you heard people say this? Well, I mean, do you hold

405
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,320
out hope that some of the case studies, because we've seen the case studies, the calangiocarcinoma

406
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,040
here, the pancreatic cancer there, the colon cancer, the breast cancer there, where they are

407
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,640
able to identify the unique antigen of the cancer. And by unique, I mean, distinguishing

408
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:00,360
antigen of the cancer such that you can send the T cell loose and it can eradicate not the entire

409
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:07,240
biliary system, but just the cancerous piece. And to be clear, I'm not speaking one way or the other,

410
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:14,280
other than to sort of help me think through the, is this a sufficient proof of principle that we

411
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,840
believe that adaptive cell therapy of which cars are the most far and away the most prominent

412
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,440
and checkpoint inhibitors are really going to be the way of the future. You didn't allude to it.

413
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,040
You and I know this as well as Tuesday follows Monday. There are also very nasty side effects

414
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,920
of checkpoint inhibitors. And for every patient we see who has a response to them, some of the

415
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,320
autoimmunity can be quite devastating. And in fact, vitiligo for a patient with melanoma might

416
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,920
not be such a fatal form of autoimmunity, but certainly when people have life-threatening

417
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,920
enterocolitis, yes, they're cancer free, but they die from bowel disease that follows. So certainly

418
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:59,400
not to suggest these are benign. I guess the point is, do they represent a demonstrable step function

419
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:07,320
forward that now puts us in a new era of, okay, we've found a new beast that goes beyond surgery,

420
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:13,960
radiation, and indiscriminately killing chemicals. How do we figure out how to tame this new beast?

421
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,480
Does that resonate? No, not particularly because

422
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,360
Steve Rosenberg has found this ages ago that this is the right way to go. But yes,

423
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,840
we are making advances and I do think that all of these need to continue. I'm not saying we should

424
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:34,440
stop any of this. I'm just pointing out where the field is right now. I think these are fantastic.

425
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:42,280
They should continue what needs to stop. Here's the problem. 95% of experimental

426
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:51,720
agents that we bring to the bedside today, 95% in cancer fail completely. The 5% that succeed

427
00:46:51,720 --> 00:47:00,040
should have failed because they are only prolonging survival for 20 to 30% of patients

428
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,320
by a few months. And you began by asking me, what is progression-free survival? I mean,

429
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:15,160
we don't even talk about survival anymore. We just talk about progression-free survival because

430
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:22,840
survival has become too big of an obstacle to overcome. So as long as you don't see the tumor,

431
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,840
but the patient dies within the same four months or five months, it doesn't matter,

432
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,120
but you didn't see the tumor for two and a half months, that's progression-free survival.

433
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,640
So this drug should be approved and the sponsors of the drug will make billions of dollars.

434
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:46,200
Let's stop on that because it is just so darn important. Let's use a tangible example. Avastin.

435
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,960
Okay. I don't want to put you on the spot because I don't remember the numbers of Avastin,

436
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,840
but the only reason I bring it up, is that an okay? Do you know enough of the examples

437
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:58,840
that I could use Avastin? I mean, I don't use it myself, but I do know that it's one of the more

438
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,960
successful. We could pick another one that you know. I'll explain. So Avastin was a blockbuster

439
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,560
in the sense that it was the first of its kind and it explored a brand new idea. So Judah Folkman

440
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,840
had this idea that many others followed in the footsteps of, which is, look, if a tumor can't

441
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,400
make new blood vessels, it can't get very big. Therefore, the ability to make new blood vessels

442
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:28,440
must be of paramount importance to metastases. And therefore, this concept of neovascularization

443
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,920
became key. And so this was a beautiful story of science and pursuing this thesis and doing all of

444
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,240
these experiments. And one step leads to another. And before you know it, you have a whole class

445
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:46,520
of drugs called anti-veg F drugs of which this drug, and I assume it was Genentech's drug. I can't

446
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,240
even remember at this point, but I think it was Genentech that was the first in line. They have

447
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,880
this drug Avastin and I believe colorectal cancer was one of the first places they looked. Again,

448
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,760
in the show notes, we'll have the story more accurately laid out. But the gist of what I

449
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:09,080
remember, Ezra, is the following. You took a patient that had metastatic colorectal cancer,

450
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:14,840
which again means this is a patient who had a colon cancer that has left the colon, left the

451
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:21,000
lymph nodes. It is now somewhere else, usually in the liver. This is a patient who is absolutely

452
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,040
not going to live. And if 1% of those people live five years, that would be very generous.

453
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:32,120
And this is asking the question, if you use all of the standard therapies we have today,

454
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:39,400
the entire cocktail of chemotherapies, and then you do the same thing, but you also use Avastin,

455
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,080
how much do you change the median survival? Notice we don't use mean because that can be

456
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:52,120
very impacted by outliers. We use median. And I believe the answer with Avastin was on the order

457
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,960
of four months. With Avastin, which cost at the time in the neighborhood of $100,000,

458
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:05,640
it was going to extend median survival for those patients by four months. And what I remember most

459
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:12,040
about the discussion, Ezra, is it prompted a discussion about what is the value of a life.

460
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,200
And different countries around the world, especially countries without private insurance,

461
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,960
but instead those with public insurance, had to put something called a QALY at the front of that

462
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:31,080
discussion, a quality adjusted life year, which says, do we believe that the cost of a life is

463
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:38,280
worth X hundred thousand dollars, such that a publicly funded insurance for health would be

464
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,280
accountable to spend that money. And if you don't like that example, because I might not have the

465
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:48,760
details right, that you can use a thought experiment, which is if I told you, Ezra, you have a condition

466
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,400
that is going to allow you to die, but I could extend your life by a month and it's going to

467
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:00,440
cost a billion dollars, do we as a society think that that's a reasonable cost for society to bear

468
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:06,040
on your account, despite how wonderful you are and how much amazing stuff you could do with an extra

469
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:12,680
month. So it started to get into this discussion of the cost benefit analysis, which gets to that

470
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,880
return on investment. Do you want to use a better example, a more recent example than Avastin, to

471
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:26,600
illustrate how relatively small changes in median survival or disease free progression, and maybe

472
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,840
you can explain the difference between those two, because you and I will go back and forth between

473
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,320
them. But I think the listener could be confused. And then again, just talk about the literal

474
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:41,800
economics of that, because I do think people will be staggered by what the actual numbers are.

475
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You know, John Dunn said something very beautiful. So when you said give a literal example, I'm going

476
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:00,680
to give a literary example. No man is an island, entire of itself, each a part of a piece of the

477
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:08,760
continent, part of the main. Any man's death diminishes me. That's what you said. What is a

478
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:19,000
human life worth? John Dunn says any man's death diminishes me because I am for mankind and

479
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,160
therefore never sent to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee. Of course, every human

480
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:34,520
life is important. And of course, every oncologist is working to try and save every human life. I'm

481
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:41,240
not saying we are deliberately not doing enough. In fact, in all of my career in this country in

482
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:48,200
the last 43 years, I have yet to meet an oncologist who didn't care for their patients. Never. They're

483
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:56,440
all trying their hardest. But it's like trying to use a map to find your way in London, but you're

484
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:04,040
using a map of Paris. It's not going to work. So how have we become so misdirected?

485
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:11,320
You asked me to give a more recent example or something I'm familiar with. I started,

486
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:18,600
landed in this country in 1977 as a fresh medical graduate. Before my residency could start,

487
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,720
I had six months and I'm not someone who can sit around at home doing nothing.

488
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:31,960
So I asked my sister, my older sister, who had just finished a rotation. She was a pediatric

489
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,560
resident in Buffalo, New York. I was staying with her and she just finished a rotation at

490
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:44,040
Roswell Park Cancer Institute. And I said to her that, you know, all the oncologists there,

491
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,040
can you get me in there and I'll just work for six months that I have. So she went and spoke to

492
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,120
her boss, Arne Freeman, and he said, well, if she's half as good as you, we'll take her.

493
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:02,120
So I joined pediatric oncology at Roswell Park. But within a couple of months, it was very clear

494
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,320
I couldn't handle it. I couldn't last because I was crying the whole time. I just can't handle

495
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:14,440
children being sick. So my sister's friend who happened to be my boss at the time, Judy Oaks,

496
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,320
one day just took me by hand because I was hiding in a room crying the way I had lost a

497
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:26,280
four-year-old that day and took me to the adult oncology unit where I met Harvey Priceler,

498
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,800
who was later to become my husband. And Harvey was heading the leukemia program at the time

499
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:40,360
at Roswell Park. And he took me on. I started working on the wards immediately. At that time,

500
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:47,720
we used to have 20, 30 AML patients, acute myeloid leukemia patients on the floor. And I started

501
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:55,480
seeing and working completely as a fellow. I was hired as a fellow. We were using two drugs to treat

502
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:04,680
AML back then in 1977, a combination of Aracy and Donomycin. They were popularly known as

503
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,960
seven and three because you give seven days of one and three days of another. By the way, Harvey

504
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:17,320
and I started to use this seven and three as a kind of a code word between us. We would be sitting

505
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,200
in a meeting and Harvey would suddenly leave nowhere and say to me, as that person is doing

506
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,800
seven and three. And for us, that seven and three meant somebody is using seven words when three

507
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:37,080
would suffice. Another mark of a great writer. So we were using seven and three in 1977. Guess

508
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:46,920
what we are using in 2020, seven and three. All these years, imagine the thousands of patients

509
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:56,840
I personally have had to see and describe the same side effects and the same potential benefits

510
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:06,600
they will have. Now, when I started the survival was 10% five-year survival with seven and three.

511
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:12,840
Today with the same drug, it's about 26%. Why has it increased? Because the supportive care

512
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:20,680
measures are better. We have better antibiotics. We can give more platelets and red cell transfusions

513
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:26,280
are easier to give. We have learned to manage better. That's it. The supportive care is better,

514
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:33,960
but the backbone of treatment is the same seven and three. So now a company comes up with combining

515
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:41,720
these two drugs, seven and three, in a fatty envelope. So they come up with this new drug now

516
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:49,960
and it's the same seven and three, but it gets approved in this country and this approved form,

517
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:56,120
which is, I believe, for a little older patients like 60 to 75 years, if you have acute myeloid

518
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:03,240
eukemia, you can get this combination of seven and three, which is inside this fatty capsule.

519
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:11,480
Now the regular seven and three costs $5,000. $5,000 for how long? For the seven days and three.

520
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:18,520
For the seven plus the three days for one cycle. Okay. $5,000. This fancy version, seven and three

521
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:27,480
costs $45,000. And do you know what is the improvement in survival under the best conditions

522
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:36,600
when they ran the study where you select patients, the eligibility criteria are so stringent.

523
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:42,440
Their kidneys have to be working. Their liver has to be working. Their lungs have to be at capacity,

524
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,920
et cetera, et cetera. You know how we choose and select patients for clinical trials. They are the

525
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,800
best of the best. Right. They have to be cherry picked. They represent the upper limit of what

526
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:01,160
you expect in the real world. Yes. And even in those cherry pick patients, the basis on which

527
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:08,840
this $45,000 combination is approved is an improvement in survival by 3.7 months. That

528
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,680
is a median improvement in survival, which means a fraction of the patients, like maybe 30%

529
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:22,840
experience 3.7 months improvement in survival. What does that mean? Median survival. So even

530
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:30,040
out of those 30%, half of them didn't even experience that, but we are paying $45,000.

531
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:38,360
Now, if I don't prescribe that drug and continue to give seven and three, then I can go to jail

532
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:45,000
because tomorrow if the patient dies, which they eventually do because it's an older age group,

533
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:52,440
then the family will sue me. Dr. Raza, this drug was available. It could have given 3.7 more months.

534
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,520
So now the decisions that we are making as individual oncologists are not being made by us.

535
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:07,080
They are made just by key opinion leaders or the very institutions like FDA, which are supposed

536
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:15,240
to protect the patients, have fallen a victim to this kind of propaganda where under the pressure

537
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:23,480
of advocacy groups who are demanding more drugs for cancer patients at any cost. Just to be able

538
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:30,360
to say that we have 72 new drugs being approved this year for cancer. Look at the fantastic

539
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:38,040
advances we have made. So under pressure from advocacy groups, from patients, the FDA has

540
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:45,720
lowered its bar of approving drugs to laughable criteria. It would be laughable if it wasn't so

541
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:53,400
tragic. Here you have 3.7 months median improvement in survival for a fraction of the patients for

542
00:59:54,280 --> 01:00:04,280
$45,000 instead of $5,000. Are you surprised then that 42% of cancer patients who are diagnosed today

543
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:13,240
will be completely financially ruined by the second year of their diagnosis? 50% of breast cancer

544
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:20,600
women are being hounded by collection agencies with stage four cancer. Your friend Marty McCary

545
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:27,160
has written a fabulous book, The Price We Pay. People should read that book and see the obscenity

546
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:35,240
we have reached. The vulgarity of it all, completely not thinking about patients at all,

547
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:42,280
talking in terms of, well, Ezra, 3.7 months meant a lot to my patient who could go and attend his

548
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:48,600
son's graduation or grandson's bar mitzvah. Yes, of course, like I said, John Dunn said,

549
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:54,600
every human life is important, but you asked the question earlier, at what cost to the others?

550
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:01,320
I mean, I think Marty's work does a great job of explaining this. And the only way I can sort of

551
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:07,880
explain it is I think the United States has basically become the one that has to subsidize

552
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,080
the rest of the world in terms of medical research. I mean, that's the only way I can sort of make

553
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,040
sense of how outrageous these costs are. By the way, that's not a justification. So I could

554
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:24,600
go on for days as to how frustrating it is, but it has basically become a form of subsidy. And I've

555
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:31,320
been trying to get my head around what are the biggest drivers of spending in the United States,

556
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:38,600
because overall as a country, we don't get a lot in exchange for what we give. That's going to be

557
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:44,520
a very polarizing comment I just made. So let me clarify it. If you take someone in the top income

558
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:51,320
tax bracket in Canada, by all estimates, a socialized country, you compare them to someone

559
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,880
in the top income tax bracket in the United States, especially in a high tax state, they're paying

560
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,320
about the same amount. The difference, however, in what they get is fundamentally quite different. In

561
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:06,120
Canada, everybody gets health insurance, no ifs, ands, or buts. Everybody basically gets

562
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,720
exceptional education at a fraction of the cost, homelessness, mental health. A lot of these issues

563
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:16,680
are just so much better. I still think, I would still make the case, by the way, that the extremes

564
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,240
of health care are better in the United States. I would much rather receive my medical care in the

565
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,440
United States than in Canada. But ultimately it points to a gross inefficiency in terms of how

566
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,240
those dollars that are collected are then turned around and spent. And I could probably point to

567
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,640
three things that the United States is disproportionately spending money on,

568
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:40,520
that other countries are not spending money on. And it's those three things that are creating the

569
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:46,040
biggest gap, and one of them is health care. There's simply no way to avoid it. And within

570
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:53,000
the morass of health care, drugs might be one of the most egregious examples. There are others that

571
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,120
are less sexy to point your finger at. But as you note, I mean, Marty makes a very good point that

572
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:04,360
the drug story is a revolting one, actually. After Harvey died with a five-year-long battle

573
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:11,320
with leukemia. You were in your early 40s at this point in time, basically, when you're widowed?

574
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:18,520
When he was diagnosed, yes. And we had a four-year-old daughter when he was diagnosed. So after he died,

575
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:23,680
my younger sister, who's now the head of women's radiology at the Brigham, she said,

576
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:29,600
well, I have to get you out of Chicago because this five years of thinking of nothing,

577
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,680
concentrating continuously on this one thought only, which was Harvey and his illness.

578
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:46,640
So we went to England because, well, London is one of my favorite cities. And I wanted to take my

579
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:54,640
daughter to see Reading jail because I'm a big Oscar Wilde fan. And we went to Reading. And

580
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,480
the reason I'm telling you this is one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written,

581
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:08,160
the ballad of Reading jail, the refrain is very beautiful. Yet all men kill the things they love

582
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:17,520
by each let this be heard. Some do it with a bitter look and some with a flattering word.

583
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:26,000
The coward does it with a kiss, the brave man with the sword, but each man kills the thing they love.

584
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:34,160
Let my each let this be heard. So Wilde wrote this poem when he was in this ballad, when he was

585
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:40,160
incarcerated in jail. And when he came out, his boyfriend, Lord Alfred Douglas asked him,

586
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,200
what do you mean by this refrain? All men kill the things they love. What does that even mean?

587
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,800
All men kill the things they love. And while tried to just diss him and said, well, nothing,

588
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:56,880
you know, it's just whatever. But Bozy, Alfred Douglas kept insisting, no, you have to tell me

589
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:03,600
what this means. So you know what Wilde said? He said, look, it's like this. When we meet someone

590
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:11,040
or we have an idea, we make immediately an impression in our mind. We meet them the next

591
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:18,400
time and they don't correspond with the impression we had. So instead of correcting

592
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:25,120
our impression, we start trying to change the person. And this is how we enter this cycle of

593
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:32,000
self-delusion and kill the thing that we love. Why am I telling you all this is because

594
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,600
we started with good intentions, Peter. But somehow, remember in the beginning, I said,

595
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:46,960
I'm looking for an adult. Why aren't we taking stock of the situation? Why is it that scientists

596
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:55,200
who are going to now, let's say, attack the metabolic pathway of cancer cells to improve

597
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:05,200
the efficiency of chemotherapy by simultaneously changing the dietary patterns for the patient?

598
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:14,320
For the patient, a very good target to think about. But before even a phase one trial has started,

599
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:20,320
they are monetizing it, making companies out of it. I mean, yes, this is a capitalist system.

600
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:27,360
Everything is legal. Everything is allowed. But then it somehow leaves such a bad taste in my

601
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:35,440
mouth all the time. All the time, it's all about think about it. You are never going to be able to

602
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:44,320
cure an advanced cancer of the kind that Andrew had by a diet of any sort, or even by supplementing

603
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:50,960
chemotherapy he's getting with a diet of any sort. All you are aiming for is improving their survival

604
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:59,200
by a few months. But more important is to make companies. Why? Why have we come to this?

605
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,080
I mean, I think in defense of that type of idea, which I don't really know about specifically,

606
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:11,440
they would probably argue changing nutrition, if a change in nutrition could have a comparable

607
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:17,360
benefit to a change to the use of a drug, it's a fraction of the cost and presumably without the

608
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,720
destruction of the quality of life. I mean, one of the things I'd like you to come back to,

609
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:26,000
Asra, is- Can you try and question the idea, Peter? Sorry, I'm not questioning the idea at all.

610
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,280
I'm questioning why do you have to monetize everything, is what I'm questioning.

611
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:41,040
Yeah. I mean, I was going to ask you the same question, which is, how do we think about the

612
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:49,360
role of pharma in this entire landscape? I mean, it can't be denied, which is progress has to be

613
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:55,440
funded by somebody. You have different animals, so you have public funding, which has been the

614
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:02,560
majority of it through NIH via NCI, which is by far the largest of the institutes within NIH,

615
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:07,680
and has done the lion's share of the cancer funding. So I actually did the analysis five

616
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:13,760
years ago, which means it's probably dated, but directionally correct. But if you went back to

617
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:22,320
the declaration by Richard Nixon of the war on cancer, so circa 7172, more than half of the

618
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:29,600
total research dollars in the world into oncology funneled through NCI, slightly over half was my

619
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,480
recollection. Again, I could be a little wrong on that, but that's a big piece of it. Of course,

620
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:41,520
pharma, as you know, has really outsourced R&D. They just don't do R&D anymore the way they used

621
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:50,080
to. So they basically now acquire R&D products. And so smaller and smaller companies, which means

622
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:56,480
it's shifting more to venture type investing and biotech investing, is taking that early stage one,

623
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:03,840
early stage two risk, at which point pharma brings in for the huge capital allocation required for

624
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,240
late stage two and stage three approval that gets the drug approval, which then gets to the point

625
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:15,840
you raised, which is you've got these two drugs that have been off patent for since Moses was

626
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:20,000
throwing tablets at people. What are you going to do with it? Well, you could keep selling them for

627
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:28,960
$5,000 or you could repurpose them and increase by nearly 10 X. And I know that it sounds egregious.

628
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,680
I don't have an answer, though, because I don't really like this is almost to me a question of

629
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:40,160
economics is the answer that all of this stuff has to be done publicly so that shareholder value is no

630
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:46,000
longer the thing that's being optimized for, because as long as these companies have to answer

631
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,400
to shareholders, I don't think they'll ever figure out a way to put the woman with breast cancer

632
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:57,200
who's going to go bankrupt ahead of their shareholder as awful as that sounds. I think

633
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,840
they're always going to say I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholder and that is to

634
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,280
maximize the price. And I do think the government is doing a better job at catching the most

635
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:14,400
egregious examples of company that are grossly exploiting this. But in the end, is Kaitruta

636
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:20,080
really worth what it's being charged today? I don't know how to answer that question. I really

637
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:26,080
have no clue how to answer that question. And you've more eloquently than me said, every life

638
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:31,200
is valuable. And that includes the lives that remain, which I think is a very important point.

639
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,160
That's the counterpoint that's never made. It's not just the life of the individual that we're

640
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:42,800
debating extending by 3.1 months at some unbelievable sum. It's the lives of everybody that

641
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,840
remains and what it says about their social security check and what it says about their

642
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:54,240
schools and what it says about their health care. Wait, I want to answer this. If you take a

643
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:01,280
living frog and you throw it in boiling water, it will jump out. But if you put it in cold water

644
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:08,960
and start heating it slowly, it will die in that because it has been desensitized so slowly.

645
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,800
We began all these things with good intention. That's what I keep saying to you over and over.

646
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:22,880
Some of the saddest things to me are this. 95% drugs we bring to the website fail. Why? Because

647
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:31,040
the pre-testing platform we are using are so artificial. We are taking a very complex disease

648
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:38,880
like cancer and we are trying to reduce it by reductionist approaches into trying to replicate

649
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:46,480
this complexity in mouse models, in tissue culture cell lines. And if those don't work, we add layers

650
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:53,840
upon layers of complexity to it by genetic engineering, immune compromising of the animal.

651
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:01,840
You know, after reading my book, the first cell, a young woman wrote to me saying, Dr. Raza, I'm a

652
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:11,040
PhD student. I'm working on this cell line model of breast cancer, testing drugs against it, but

653
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:21,200
using a two and three dimensional in vitro system. And once this is successful, that the drugs work

654
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:26,480
against the cell lines, then I will go to the mouse model. And if that works, then I have to go to

655
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:32,800
humans. But reading your book, I realize that it's all a waste of time. What should I do? Is this even

656
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:41,520
something I should spend the next 10 years of my life doing? But 90% of research is still funding

657
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,880
things, research dollars. You are talking about NCI dollars. What are the funding for God's sake?

658
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:55,120
The same old, same old ancient platforms which have shown a 95% failure rate and the 5% success

659
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:01,440
is ludicrous. Secondly. Before you go, can you say more about that? Actually, I'm glad you brought

660
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:06,240
this up because I sometimes forget that I know a lot of the things you're talking about and I take

661
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:11,360
them for granted. But I think this is worth a bit of a detour if you don't mind. Explain to people

662
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,920
what that PhD student was doing. What is a day in the life for her or what is she going to spend

663
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:25,760
years doing and how does that sort of model fall short? I think you can explain it better than me

664
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,600
because you have spent so much time in Dr. Rosenberg's lab but very simply stated when we

665
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:38,400
want to try and find new drugs for cancer, we can't give drugs directly to humans. So we try to first

666
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:44,800
give them to something in our lab. What should that something be? Well, it started by taking

667
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:51,680
patients tumor cells but they don't last very long in our cultures in the lab. So then that becomes a

668
01:13:51,680 --> 01:14:00,240
problem. How should we perpetuate these cells in culture? By serendipity, some cancer cells began

669
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:07,680
to grow in the labs and one of the first was the famous hala cells from a patient with cervical

670
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:14,640
cancer and these cells grew so well that they became immortalized. They self-perpetuated. They

671
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:21,760
can be grown from flask to flask, transferred from lab to lab. They can be put into mice and grow.

672
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:29,040
And so all this reproducible system that became available is called a tissue culture cell line

673
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:35,520
and we learned with time to make more and more of these. So you make a pancreatic cancer now just

674
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:41,840
like the hala cell with cervical cancer. You take a ovarian cancer, a pancreatic cancer, you grow them

675
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:48,000
and one of them will by chance mutate enough to become immortalized and then become the tissue

676
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,320
culture line. Now you can test drugs against it. But one of the first things that I have written

677
01:14:54,320 --> 01:15:02,640
in my book in the first chapter is that by using these cell lines, when it was tested to see what

678
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:10,720
kind of genes are they expressing, it turns out that instead of expressing genes that were faithful

679
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:17,040
to the tissue of origin from which they came, for example, an ovarian cancer cell line should be

680
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:22,720
expressing genes that are expressed in ovarian cancer. Pancreatic cancer cell lines should be

681
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:30,240
expressing pancreatic genes. Instead, it turned out that there has been a transcriptomic drift

682
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:39,200
that basically all the cell lines, irrespective of their tissue of origin, express similar genes

683
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:46,880
that make them survivable under adverse in vitro conditions. So let me explain one other thing

684
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,240
for the listener here, which kind of ties in another theme of yours, which is because when you

685
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:58,240
go back to what we learned in the Great War, killing cancer cells is easy. I've had guests

686
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:03,040
on this podcast before who have eloquently stated there's no one sitting in a home right now that

687
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:09,680
doesn't already have 30 chemicals under their sink that will kill every cancer, including the

688
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:16,000
most devastating cancer like the one that killed Andrew. The challenge is killing cancer and not

689
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:23,280
killing everything else. And so now when you fast forward to what you just said, when you have

690
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:32,160
immortalized in vitro cultures that have become so genetically skewed that they no longer actually

691
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:39,920
represent a human cancer, you will learn a lot about what it takes to kill them and not kill them.

692
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:46,480
It just won't be relevant to the species of interest, which is a human being. This is why I

693
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,240
read the Oscar Wilde thing to you that all men kill the things they love. We started with a good thing

694
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:58,800
when it didn't correspond to what we were hypothesizing. Instead of changing our concept,

695
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:06,000
we keep tinkering with trying to change the other thing. This is exactly how you kill whatever you

696
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:15,280
started out with. And you know what's worse, Peter, is that 90 percent, nine zero, I want the audience

697
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:23,120
to hear this clearly, 90 percent of the papers published in the highest profile journals of

698
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:31,760
science are irreducible. I didn't know it was that high. It's still that high. Up to 90 percent.

699
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:38,640
Different studies, some show 30 percent, some 80 percent, some 90 percent. It is unconscionable

700
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:46,160
what we are doing. Why are they not reproducible? Because for the same reason, one set of mice don't

701
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:53,280
correspond to another set of mice in another lab. So the point I'm making is 95 percent of your drugs

702
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:59,760
are failing until now, after a quarter of a trillion dollars in research, like you said,

703
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:07,280
that is between six billion dollars a year right now and NCI funding and another six billion from

704
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:13,600
philanthropic funding. Where is all this 12 billion dollars going? And then breast cancer alone raises

705
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:20,480
six billion dollars in funding. And what are they doing? Studying breast cancer cell lines against

706
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:27,280
drugs. Yes, it will get that young lady a PhD eventually, and then she will try to get grants.

707
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:33,920
Eventually she'll get fed up and go to industry. And I must take exception with you condemning the

708
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:41,360
industry. They are the easy target, pharma companies. They are the easiest target. But the system of

709
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:48,320
research and development in America is that somebody like me, who is an academic researcher,

710
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:55,920
will write a grant to NCI. They will fund me for 250,000 dollars a year for three to five years,

711
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:03,040
if I'm lucky. Let's put that in perspective, by the way. By NCI standards, that's a lot. An RO1

712
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:09,440
at this point. What is an RO1 down to now? Is it down to 450,000 a year for four to five years?

713
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:15,760
Yeah. That's almost as big a grant as someone's going to get. Yes. And with that, all you can do

714
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,480
is study one gene, one signaling pathway. But let's say I luck out and I find something which I think

715
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:29,120
is looking very encouraging and is a potential target. The next step is obviously to take it to

716
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,440
the bedside. But to do that, I have to now test this in mouse models first, in two mammals, in fact,

717
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,440
and then to take it to the bedside for a phase one trial, a loan will cost 30 million dollars. And by

718
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:47,840
the time this drug will get approved, will be two and a half billion dollars. Nobody can fund that

719
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:54,160
kind of work except industry. It's a very strange kind of thing where we are strange bedfellows,

720
01:19:54,160 --> 01:20:00,800
academics and industry. Academics will develop the biologic insights which are needed to identify

721
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,640
targets, but we don't have the bandwidth to take it to the patient. So industry comes in, takes that,

722
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,680
but then they have to bring it back to academics because that's where the universities will help

723
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:21,120
accrue patients. So do you today the criterion for recruiting young faculty, the young faculty is

724
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:28,160
complaining to me that Dr. Raza, all the universities where we are applying ask us for is how many

725
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:34,080
clinical trials are you going to open when you can? Yeah, look, it's a symptom of a broader issue,

726
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:40,400
which is the incentives have come out of line. I don't know how to fix that, by the way,

727
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:45,600
but even taking it one step further, look, just the entire system of publishing in academics has

728
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:53,120
become so skewed because you took a good idea, which was wouldn't it be great if scientists would

729
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:58,480
do work, would publish them in journals, would have them peer reviewed, would share knowledge

730
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:03,600
broadly so that others might see it, learn from it and not make the same mistakes and build on

731
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,880
the work of others, right? A beautiful idea, you can't disagree with any of it. And by the way,

732
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,880
recheck things that have been done to make sure they were done correctly because under different

733
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:18,320
conditions we want to make sure they're reproducible. Okay, understandably then that idea gets extended

734
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:25,200
into this should be a criteria for promotion within the academic system, which invariably turns

735
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:32,800
into an entire cottage industry of garbage journals and garbage study and garbage publications,

736
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:39,920
which are driving up the fraction of studies which can't be reproduced and by the way, the fraction of

737
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:46,560
studies that can't even get cited, they're so insignificant. And so you sort of think, my god,

738
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:55,120
if something as pure and ideal as scientific research and publishing has become so difficult

739
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:02,400
to do, and I don't have a great solution for that, the process you're describing is a logarithmic

740
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:09,280
order in front of that, which is taking research from the so-called bench to the bedside.

741
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:16,800
That's the thing that I still don't, even after reading about this topic, and not just your book,

742
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:22,880
but other books, I still don't have a great sense of what the future looks like. I don't disagree

743
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,560
that the water is starting to get uncomfortably warm here as a little frog, and I don't disagree

744
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:35,040
that we need to get out of this bath of water and into a cooler bath of water. But boy, I have to be

745
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:41,120
honest with you. I'm discouraged. No, no, don't be. I have a solution for us and a very important

746
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:50,080
solution. Peter Derise is a writer who wrote a book in 1961. He wrote a novel because his own

747
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:59,360
daughter who was 10 or 11 died of leukemia in his arms and after a horrible battle. In 1961, Peter

748
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:10,160
Derise says, so the treatment for leukemia today is a local rather than an express train.

749
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:19,680
Same run, a few more stops. But that's how medicine functions, perfecting the art of

750
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:29,360
prolonging disease. This was in 1961. How is this different? The run for leukemia is still a local.

751
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:37,520
What I want to say is I feel like I'm living in a theater of the absurd. Why aren't other people

752
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:45,520
seeing the spectacular failures we are dealing with? And why do we keep mollycoddling the public?

753
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:52,160
Why do we keep promoting the two, three months or five months advantage in survival?

754
01:23:52,720 --> 01:24:00,960
Why aren't we going for bigger goals and better things? We can do it. You know how we can do it is

755
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:09,360
very simple. What has worked in cancer until now? Early detection. How is it that we are living in

756
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:17,840
an era of the most sophisticated technological advances possible? And yet the treatment of cancer

757
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:26,160
is paleolithic. It belongs in the Stone Age in the caves. Giving the kind of disfiguring,

758
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:34,400
horrible treatments we give is like beating someone said this, beating the dog with a baseball bat to

759
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:40,640
get rid of its fleas. Have you ever seen somebody being treated with CAR T therapy? My God, there are

760
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:48,080
whole industries sprouting up to control the side effects. Why are we even developing such

761
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:53,840
terrible therapies? Yes, we should develop them, but they should be used when the tumor burden is

762
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,120
not that high. So once again, I want to be very clear about a couple of things before I give you

763
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:08,400
my solution. Number one, I'm not against animal research at all. For biology, it is very important

764
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:16,800
to use the animal model. All I'm against is drug development in animals because what you learn in

765
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:25,600
animals by using drugs is only correct for animals. It does not automatically extrapolate to humans.

766
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,800
So just to be clear, you're saying you would still use animals for safety, but you would

767
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:37,120
disregard them for efficacy? I would not use them for safety either. Why should it give me any level

768
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:42,960
of confidence that the drug didn't kill mouse, it wouldn't kill a human? It is very little to do with

769
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:48,640
each other. We don't have to go into it now, but I guess do you know from sort of even back of the

770
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:55,120
envelope how that would change the regulatory landscape if we now had to go to a much earlier

771
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:01,520
phase one in humans, obviously probably using a milder dose escalation or would you be talking

772
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:09,280
about doing primates instead? What is the actual model? None of those. In fact, the FDA has a system

773
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:16,800
which is called phase zero in which you don't just bypass any animals. You use one five hundredth of

774
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:24,240
the dose starting dose in humans and work your way up that. So basically it's homeopathic all the way

775
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:30,400
up. Yeah, so that's how you do it with a phase zero trial. What I'm saying is look, the only thing

776
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:36,960
that has worked is early detection. We have great technology available. We shouldn't be talking about

777
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,240
early detection doesn't work because mammograms have not been helpful or PSA have led to over

778
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:49,840
diagnosis and men undergoing very macabre surgeries and things. No, all I'm saying is that we should

779
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:57,440
definitely take advantage of the cutting edge genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics,

780
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:03,680
the scanning and imaging devices that have been developed and use artificial intelligence to put

781
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:11,040
all this together, develop 50 tests if we have to identify biomarkers which are based on all these

782
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:19,920
things and combine them with the latest technology to try and start monitoring the human body not

783
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:26,800
once a year but continuously like a machine. And how do you do that? Well, you see this chip, you can

784
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:33,920
see it. The audience cannot. It's a small chip, the M chip. You can look it up because it is FDA-approved.

785
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:39,840
It is based on microfluidics. You put one drop of blood here which goes through microfluidics and

786
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:46,720
interacts with the biomarker put here. The biomarker in M chip's case which is FDA-approved is PSA.

787
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:54,960
So, men who have been diagnosed with a high PSA can use this chip. It can slide into a small device

788
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,640
and very soon into your cell phone and give you your PSA four times a day if you want to see it.

789
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:07,040
And if you're diagnosed with having a high PSA, you do have to go in and have a complete abdominal

790
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:14,960
resection with the removal of every lymph node and be eviscerated. No, you follow this at home

791
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,360
if you have to as often as you want. I'm saying that if we develop a biomarker that is

792
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:28,000
identifying the earliest footprints of pancreatic cancer, we put that next in the next lane.

793
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,600
And for ovarian cancer in the next door, for each cancer, we develop like a bar code

794
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:40,240
and with one drop of blood. So, Koshiba, a company, just announced that they can detect

795
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:45,600
13 different cancers from one drop of blood in four hours for $180.

796
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:51,680
There's a company in the Bay Area that I follow very closely called Grail and they're doing

797
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:58,720
something very similar. At this point, they're in phase two with probably almost 30 different

798
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:05,120
cancers. I agree with you completely. I mean, my view of cancer is rule number one is don't get it.

799
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,640
I mean, that sounds glib, but I don't think enough attention is paid to the don't get it rule,

800
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:16,160
which is why aren't we trying to better understand what the environmental triggers of cancer are?

801
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,800
Because while, as you point out, it has always been with us, I think there is

802
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,800
reasonable enough evidence to suggest that its incidence is higher in a modern world than in a

803
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:32,400
non-modern world. And therefore, what is it about a modern world? For example, what is it about our

804
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:39,200
diet or about our stress or our lack of exercise that could be amplifying our risk? And if you

805
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:45,600
think about it, if changing factors of our lifestyle could reduce your risk of cancer by 30 to 50%,

806
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:54,080
which my reading of the literature says is absolutely the case, how could we not make that

807
01:29:54,080 --> 01:30:00,960
a high priority to understand? And when you pair the rule number one, don't get cancer, with rule

808
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:08,400
number two, very smart screening for cancer, you then get into rule number three, which is if you

809
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:16,080
get cancer, treat it so early, treat it when it is basically in the millions rather than the billions

810
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:22,080
of cells. And for someone who might not have the familiarity with cells, a million cancer cells is

811
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:27,680
not even detectable to the naked eye, a billion is. And so there's a very big difference between

812
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:32,720
when you can catch a million cancer cells versus a billion. And I agree with you, by the way,

813
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:39,680
completely that most people who are critics of early screening are unfortunately lacking the

814
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:46,960
nuance to appreciate the accepted failures of things like PSA and mammography, which I won't

815
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:52,640
go into here, I've covered them in great detail in some other podcasts. Two in particular, I'll

816
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:58,800
just direct the listener to, I think the failures of PSA standalone as a failure has been covered

817
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,720
very well in the podcast with Ted Schafer. And Ted talks very eloquently about how if you are

818
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:12,160
wed to PSA using PSA volume, where you take PSA normalized to prostate volume and PSA velocity,

819
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:18,880
which Ezra you would get out of what you propose, which is the rate of change of PSA over time.

820
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:25,600
So PSA is a rate of change called PSA velocity. PSA volume become much better indicators of

821
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:32,640
prostate cancer risk than just PSA. But also you go far beyond PSA to things like 4K and other types

822
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:38,720
of tests that add more nuance to this. I think the story becomes much more clear that this type

823
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:44,400
of early detection matters. And I think as it pertains to the limitations of mammography,

824
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:51,840
I would direct people to the podcast I did with Raj Atarawala, where we talked about cancer

825
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:57,520
screening. And we actually very specifically address some of the limitations of the literature

826
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:03,760
on these isolated techniques like mammography. So you're not going to get any disagreement out of me

827
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:12,240
on both of those fronts. So I guess the question is, do we really believe that by taking those types

828
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:20,800
of steps, we will reduce the need for the cancers for which we have just not had the big breakthroughs,

829
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:30,080
which is basically lung, pancreas, prostate, breast, colon, and GBM. Those are basically the

830
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:35,040
most lethal cancers outside of GBM. It's the metastatic versions of the others. Obviously,

831
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:40,640
GBM doesn't leave the brain. It kills locally. That's got to be two thirds of cancer deaths.

832
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:47,600
And you're basically saying we have to catch these things long before they're ever in a position to

833
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:55,600
leave the primary organ and not try to reinvent the onc drug discovery wheel coming up with

834
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,920
another cocktail that's going to be as lucky as we were with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

835
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,960
I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is that your view?

836
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:11,200
Yeah, well, sort of. But let me restate what specifically I feel. First of all, about the

837
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:16,800
lifestyle you're talking about. Of course, lifestyle is it's only common sense that if you smoke,

838
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:22,240
it's not going to be good for you. Your likelihood of getting not just lung cancer,

839
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:29,680
but many diseases will be high. So yes, lifestyle changes have we have to continuously drill into

840
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:35,040
our consciousness. What is good for us and what is bad for us and try not to get it.

841
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:42,160
The problem is that with cancer, as I began by telling you, heredity and pathogens and

842
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:48,160
environmental exposure like smoking, etc., do account for a certain percentage. The vast

843
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:54,720
majority. There is no reason why they get cancer. We at least a reason that we can identify yet.

844
01:33:54,720 --> 01:34:01,200
I think that's the challenge is that with smoking, the difference between the people who smoked and

845
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:07,680
the people who didn't smoked was so great that it was appreciable. But you're right with most other

846
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:14,800
environmental contributors, with maybe the only other exception being obesity, it's very difficult

847
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:21,520
to tease out what else could be contributing. For example, I don't know if you're running

848
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:28,160
or the trampoline is making enough of a difference because it's very difficult to study that

849
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:33,520
longitudinally and prospectively. And secondly, I don't know that enough people are doing it and

850
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,880
it would create a big enough signal that we can measure it. Well, that's what I was going to say.

851
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,360
We don't even know whether eggs are good or bad for you to this day. So those are the kinds of

852
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:49,120
issues with lifestyle, large studies. Now, the point I'm trying to make, though, is slightly

853
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:55,520
different. A lot of people smoke. Not all of them get cancer. So there are other co-factors that

854
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,320
exist. All these things have to be worked out. Haven't we been trying for a hundred years? For

855
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:05,840
God's sake, don't the investigators who act like this is something they have discovered today to

856
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:11,520
be looked at? No, this is what we have been trying to do forever. It's not that simple.

857
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:18,560
What we are finding is that for the vast majority of cancers, they're random mutations account for

858
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:26,640
it, which means that cancer is most common with age, increasing age. Why? Because with age, many

859
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:31,440
more of the cells in our body have undergone several divisions. And with each division,

860
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,440
we pick up some DNA copying errors, two to three on an average. So by the time I sell is now from

861
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:46,080
birth to like 60 years of age, every cell has undergone multiple cycles of proliferation.

862
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:52,080
Therefore, multiple gene generic mutations have collected. And these are making the cell

863
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:59,120
susceptible that now it's like dropping grains of sand and they will form a pile and at one

864
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:04,320
grain of sand, which is no different than millions before that had gone before it will suddenly

865
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:10,800
cause an avalanche and the pile will collapse. Not because the glass grain of sand was different,

866
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,800
but the pile had become unstable. So with age, the body becomes unstable because all the cells

867
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:23,120
have these kinds of mutations. So, and not only that metabolism can go wrong. And sometimes,

868
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:29,120
as shown by whole genome sequencing of over 2000 tumors, that there are a few cancers where no

869
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:37,360
mutations were found in advanced cancers. So how did that happen? Well, because sometimes it is the

870
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:44,880
disturbed metabolism that then leads to production of reduced oxygen species or free radicals,

871
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,600
for example, that go and chop up and cause mutations and that generic mutations are a

872
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:55,840
secondary event. The primary event is a metabolic disturbance. So, I mean, all this needs to be done,

873
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:02,720
all this needs to be studied and it isn't like it hasn't been studied since 1921. Poor Otto

874
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:09,680
Warburg made the first observation of anaerobic metabolism. And since I was doing ketogenic type

875
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:17,760
diets in the 1980s, so please don't think that any of these things are new. But the question that I

876
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:25,440
am asking as someone who's been in this field for 43 years now, is this, if I'm still using

877
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:32,880
seven and three to treat AML and for most common cancers, we are still using slash poison and burn.

878
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:38,720
It is not for lack of resources. It is not for lack of very, very smart people, hundreds of

879
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:46,640
thousands of them who are working 16 hours a day to try and find the answer. But the answer is very

880
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:54,000
complicated. It has too many aspects to it. So the only thing we should do is I am beseeching

881
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:02,400
everybody in cancer related fields. Let's just spend a little more effort, a little more resources

882
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:08,320
in earlier detection. Yes, keep trying to understand metabolic pathways and intracellular

883
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:13,920
signaling and checkpoints and CAR T's and everything else. But instead of spending

884
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:20,320
five percent in prevention, let's spend 50 percent in prevention and early detection. That is all

885
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:28,160
I'm asking for. So a lot of people have asked me, Peter, because I've been completely uncompromising

886
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:34,320
in my criticism, as you've heard now. I am completely merciless. You know why? Because I

887
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:39,920
have brought the patient back front and center and everything I look at is through patients,

888
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:47,200
human anguish. Our problem is that 90 percent of our researchers never see a cancer patient

889
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:53,440
because they are basic scientists and they study tumors that they grow in on their own in their

890
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:59,520
labs. So they don't see a disease they are trying to develop treatment for and they are using

891
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:06,880
animals who don't get these diseases spontaneously. How can you become, for God's sake?

892
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:13,600
So my thing is, while you're doing all that, at least let's employ all of this sophisticated

893
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:20,320
technology and a lot of the intellectual resources to developing biomarkers for early detection.

894
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,880
Why not look at every compartment, whether it's blood, sweat, tears, saliva, urine,

895
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:33,840
microbiome, study everything but human. Stop studying animals, for God's sake. Study human tissue.

896
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,320
You're making so much sense to me that I'm struggling to come up with a counter argument

897
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:44,880
to that point you're making. I mean, should 50 percent of our resources be put into prevention

898
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:53,200
and early detection rather than 4 percent, if that? Absolutly. Should we also shift this to

899
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:58,080
study disproportionately in the study of interest? I couldn't agree with you more.

900
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:06,160
You made a point a moment ago about the nature of contact. I wanted to use that as a point to

901
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:12,880
come back to Omar. Why did you include the story of Omar in your book? He's not unique, right? I

902
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:19,200
mean, you've treated a million Omars. What was it about him that spoke to you so much? It had to be

903
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:25,040
more than just his ethnicity, but I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't assume that. Well, first of all,

904
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:33,600
he's my best friend's son. Here is a 38-year-old young man, a graduate of Oxford and Columbia.

905
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:40,800
His teaching has finally fallen in love, calls his parents to come and get him engaged, and when

906
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:48,800
they arrive, the young couple, he has a little osteogenic sarcoma. So the thing that has forced,

907
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:56,240
that made me put Omar into the book, is the utter helplessness of oncologists, because from

908
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:03,600
day one, when you have not resected that solid tumor completely, you were a surgeon, you were a

909
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:10,400
surgical oncologist, you are a surgeon. You know this, Peter. If you leave behind 10 percent of

910
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:17,600
the tumor or even your microscopic pathology shows that cancer cells have entered blood vessels,

911
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:24,560
as was the case with Omar. Now you know that his chances of survival beyond a few couple of years

912
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:32,160
at most are 0.00. What are your choices you are going to give to Omar? Either you die of cancer or

913
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:37,600
you die of the treatment we are going to give you, because the problem is if we don't give treatment,

914
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:45,200
then death from cancer is horrendous in itself. It's one of the most painful deaths. So are we at

915
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:52,480
least doing some palliation? And Omar's case was really huge. It's a good question you asked.

916
01:41:53,040 --> 01:42:00,080
It was emotionally soul destroying to see this young man who was already just embarking on his

917
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:06,800
career, finally after years and years of hard work, has met the woman. He gets married a couple of

918
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:14,320
months after the diagnosis actually, and knowing that he's going to die. And I had to live through

919
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:20,400
every single day, not just in the hospital, but also at home, because we are seeing him.

920
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:25,680
And by the way, if I recall, this was only about five years after your husband died, yes?

921
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:30,480
No longer. Harvey died in 2002. Omar dies in 2009.

922
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,160
Okay, okay, sorry. But yeah.

923
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:38,880
Yes, yeah, not that far. So I think also in the book, I tried to balance it out by presenting

924
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:46,880
some elderly people like Lady N, Kitty C, Harvey was older, whereas JC, Andrew and Omar,

925
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:53,280
the three are younger people. And different types of cancers I also wanted to show. So brain tumor,

926
01:42:53,280 --> 01:43:00,400
osteogenic sarcoma, and a liquid tumor. Then Harvey had a lymphoma. Many people asked me because I

927
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:07,520
have been so brutal in my criticism of everybody. And that's why I began telling you that please,

928
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,800
let's not just blame pharma companies. The hospitals who are supposed to be non-profit

929
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:18,000
hospitals are making so many hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. What should they do? They

930
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:24,800
have no shareholders to distribute it to. So they give large raises to their bureaucracy,

931
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:31,200
the executive business people running the hospital, and then they start buying other hospitals and

932
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:37,360
start investing in brick and mortar. This is what's happening. I in fact think about health

933
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:42,480
care very much. I was talking to Perry Marshall the other day who was talking about a higher

934
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:48,960
education that in the post COVID world, one of the things that will be completely redone is higher

935
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:55,760
education because the two variables who have skin in the game in higher education are students and

936
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:02,640
teachers. And students are embroiled in horrible loans by the time they graduate. And teachers are

937
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:07,920
not even hired in permanent positions anymore. There are adjunct professors that are hired.

938
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:12,960
So you don't have to give them any kinds of benefits. And those two people who have skin in

939
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:18,320
the game suffer whereas universities are developing endowments in billions of dollars.

940
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:24,080
These are academic institutions. But I compare that same thing to health care. The two people

941
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:29,840
with skin in the game in health care are patients and doctors. Patients are fleeced for every last

942
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:35,840
penny. And doctors are overworked all the time. So we have no time to spend. And businessmen are

943
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:42,000
running the whole show. So I think the system is like that frog analogy over and over again.

944
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:48,320
No one is going to give up what they're doing willingly at all. I believe exactly what Thomas

945
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:53,840
Kuhn said. If you want to change the paradigm, you have to show a better one. That's it. So how do we

946
01:44:53,840 --> 01:45:00,640
show a better paradigm? Well, at least I'm pointing to the only successful strategy in cancer is early

947
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:08,400
detection. Why not use the latest technology to go for early detection? We can financially incentivize

948
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:14,320
it. And with the one success, the whole field can turn around because they will see that that's where

949
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:21,280
it's a better thing to invest rather than in a venture that has a 95 percent rate of failure.

950
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:29,680
And mark my words, the coming decade of 2020 to 2030 will see this shift from treating the disease

951
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:34,800
to trying to detect early and prevent the disease from becoming established.

952
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:41,200
I agree with you. I really do agree with you. I don't know that I can speak convincingly to

953
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:47,600
the time frame, but I am actually very optimistic with the potential of liquid biopsies. And it's

954
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:54,320
something we have been very eager. It's been a big part of our practice, frankly, inside of our

955
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:59,600
practice. And I look forward to having a more rigorous discussion about this that's dedicated

956
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:04,960
on the podcast once some of the technologies get through certain stages of FDA. Ezra, I want to

957
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:11,600
close with a question about the loss of your husband. At any point during that ordeal, when he

958
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:18,000
was struggling and you were right there with him and you had this young daughter, was there any

959
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:24,400
point of view that was thinking, this is so unfair, the disease that you've devoted your life to,

960
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:29,680
the disease that he has devoted his life to is ultimately the disease that's going to take him,

961
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:35,200
and not just take him, but take him decades too soon. Or were you able to sort of come to this

962
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:41,120
place of what some might call radical acceptance of just saying, I accept what I can change,

963
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:46,880
I have the courage to fight the things that I can, and I have the courage to know the distinction,

964
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:50,720
you know, so-called serenity prayer. How did you go through that at such a young age?

965
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:59,280
It's very hard to describe what one goes through. Of course, I kick doors all the time, and I had

966
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:05,760
crying fits all the time. And I remember calling my mother so often on weekends we used to talk,

967
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:10,320
she was in Karachi, of course, and I would say so many of my friends hate their husbands.

968
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:17,520
And they're doing fine. And look at me, I'm one who's crazy about Harvey, and he's dying in front

969
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:24,080
of my eyes. I went through every human emotion that a wife would go through, especially because

970
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:30,000
our daughter was so little. And Harvey is the one who actually had reached the point of acceptance,

971
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,200
and when I would lose it every now and then in front of him, he would very calmly tell me not

972
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:41,360
to worry about it. It's just the luck of the drawers. Don't worry. And he would one time, he said,

973
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:48,800
look, when he was diagnosed, he was initially told his diagnosis, his reaction was so quintessential

974
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:57,760
Harvey. He said, well, I'm glad it's me and not you or Sheharzad. This I can handle, that I couldn't.

975
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:06,240
And so when you're going through something like caring for someone who you love, but who has made

976
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:13,600
you responsible for every decision as well, I'll also end by quoting my favorite Dickinson again,

977
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:23,680
which is what one has to do. I had no time to hate because the grave would hinder me.

978
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:31,760
And life was not so ample. I could finish and meti. Nor had I time to love.

979
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:43,360
But since some industry must be this little toil of love, I thought was large enough for me.

980
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:51,520
Oh, that's a treat. I don't get often. And the listeners, I think, will agree that it's not

981
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:57,520
every day you tune into a podcast where you get treated to both the sort of the literary

982
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:03,680
sprinklings of greatness, coupled with a, you know, a difficult, but a very important discussion

983
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:09,280
about a disease that is going to touch anybody listening to this, because if we're fortunate

984
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:14,960
enough to not be the ones who get it, we are going to know somebody who does it is tragically that

985
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:21,120
ubiquitous a disease. I want to thank you for your time today. And I want to thank you for

986
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:27,920
the work you've put into this. And finally, your patience. It has taken far too long to get this

987
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,760
interview on the books. And I hope that the listeners will at least agree it was worth the

988
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:42,160
wait. Well, before we end, Peter, I do want to say that since 1984, as a result of my experience

989
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:50,080
with the patient, I started saving samples on them. So blood and bone marrow biopsies and

990
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:57,920
aspirates and two germline controls, T cells and buccal smears, seven different types of cells like

991
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:05,040
CD34 separation, neutrophil separated, mononuclear cell separated, all kinds of elaborate things.

992
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:12,080
And today, this tissue repository has over 60,000 samples from thousands of patients who have

993
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:21,440
been serially followed for years, some of them. And not a single cell comes from a second oncologist.

994
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:28,320
To this day, I do all the bone marrow with my own hands. So this tissue repository, which contains

995
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:36,000
samples of all sorts, following the natural history of diseases in patients as they progress

996
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:43,600
from a pre-leukemia to acute leukemia, is a national treasure. It's a repository which can

997
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:52,880
really unravel so much and trace back to the cell of origin. Be first cell. Find the biomarkers

998
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:59,760
that are associated with a pre-leukemia that spiraled out of control into acute leukemia

999
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:07,120
within months compared to one that took 15 years to become one. I think that I want to end by

1000
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:14,960
saying in a very positive way that I am extremely optimistic about the future, even though we spent

1001
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:22,560
most of our time in talking about very negative and very depressing pessimistic review of what

1002
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:30,160
the field has been. The future looks extremely bright, and I am so happy that I have collected

1003
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:36,240
all this tissue, which can now be used in the service of our patients who went through severe

1004
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:43,760
pain and anguish while donating these samples. We have now the technology has developed, and

1005
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:50,480
hopefully the resources will be there to finally study the whole tissue repository properly and

1006
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:55,840
find that first cell. Thank you so much for the time you have given me to go through.

1007
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:01,440
I wish you the best as you remain in quarantine. I wish you a safe reentry in New York when the

1008
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:07,680
time comes. Thank you. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're

1009
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:12,320
interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that

1010
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:17,440
allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our

1011
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,560
goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of this subscription. To that end,

1012
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,440
membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast

1013
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:32,480
show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode.

1014
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:37,920
The word on the street is, nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or

1015
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:43,200
Ask Me Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast feed

1016
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:48,640
that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiels like this. The Qwallys,

1017
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:53,440
which are a super short podcast, typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday

1018
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:58,080
through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes

1019
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:03,040
of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and

1020
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:08,800
necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not

1021
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:13,520
getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in

1022
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:17,600
as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits, you can head
