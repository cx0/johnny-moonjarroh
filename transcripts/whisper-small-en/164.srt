00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,860
Hey, Amanda. Thank you so much for making time to chat with me today. From the first

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,960
time I heard you speak, I knew I wanted to have you on the podcast. You probably don't

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,760
even remember when that was, do you?

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,560
Well, I think it was that Zoom thing for HFC, right?

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,320
That's right. That's right. It was hilarity for charity. Somehow, I was considered an

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,280
expert. You clearly are an expert. You and me and Richard Isaacson were a part of a discussion

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,280
in the days when we no longer do physical panel discussions. I just thought, wow, I

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,080
was really blown away by a lot of your insights because they went beyond just the obvious

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,000
topics we discussed, which are the research around what's the cause of Alzheimer's disease,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,520
how do you prevent it, what are the treatment? All those things are relevant and all those

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,820
things are things that you speak to. I think what impressed me was the attention you brought

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,360
to the impact that Alzheimer's disease has on the family just as much as it does the

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,160
patient. Certainly, that's something I want to talk about today. Before we get to that,

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,340
tell us a little bit about your background. You specialize in geriatric psychiatry, which

16
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,620
are not often things you think about, right? People think about psychiatry, they think about

17
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,420
forensic psychiatry, they think about more of the DSM-5 type of psychiatry. How did you

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:38,980
get interested in that? I grew up in Philadelphia and I had very active grandparents. They owned

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,960
a nursing home. A lot of people think grandparents in a nursing home, my own and operated in

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:53,160
a nursing home. Just from a young age, being around them and their friends and seeing the

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:03,800
vibrant lives they led even into their 70s and 80s, that to me was normal aging. I never thought

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:11,400
of anything different until I was in medical school and I really saw the pathologic side of

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,120
aging and the things that can go wrong as we get older, as well as I want to say an attitude of

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,160
ageism among a lot of the attending physicians that we trained under. There was this sort of

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:33,400
epiphany I had one day. I remember I was in Bryn Mawr Hospital in the emergency room and the

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
attending sent me in to talk to a woman who had come in from a nursing home with chest pain. That

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,920
was all I knew. So I went in and I talked to her and I got the history and I went and I

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,360
presented the case to the attending in rounds and he just laughed at me and he was like,

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
you went in the wrong room. He's like, the lady I'm talking about doesn't make any sense. And I

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,760
was like, actually she does. She just doesn't have her dentures in because the EMTs forgot to bring

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:12,280
them. But if you actually sat there and took the time to listen to her, she told a very normal

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,200
coherent story about how she was eating lunch and she felt pain and went to her shoulder. So she

33
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,800
called the nurse. And so that for me was so enlightening because I realized how quick

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:33,880
people are to brush off the elderly and it kind of lit a fire in me, so to speak, so that that

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,000
became my passion. So for the rest of medical school, I made sure that my elective rotations

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,960
were geriatrics and working with older people in different aspects of it. And one of my favorite

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,960
experiences was on the geriatric psychiatry unit where I got to work with dementia patients and

38
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:02,680
psychotic patients. And I just found that personally I had more patients for them because

39
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,080
of their life stories and the things that they've been through. And it just sort of led me down this

40
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:17,320
path to where I am now. And there are lots of ways as you experienced, I suppose, to interact

41
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,040
with patients in a geriatric setting. Obviously internal medicine, you could go down that path

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,760
through cardiology. You could certainly go down that path through other subspecialties.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,240
When you were doing the psychiatric work, was it understood at the time that a part of dementia

44
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:46,520
is behavioral changes and other things like that? Or how was, I guess I'm struggling with my question

45
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,920
because I know what it is and I can't make it come out. How much was it understood that Alzheimer's

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,400
disease had a behavioral component that would be under the purview of psychiatric care? I guess

47
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,880
I think it was fairly well established. The part that was the bigger problem was that there wasn't

48
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,920
much that we could do about the cognitive side of things. And fortunately that's changed some in

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:18,200
the time that I've been doing this. So I graduated from med school in 1997, which was actually the

50
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,760
year that denepazil or Airecept was first approved. So kind of witnessed the evolution

51
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,480
of Alzheimer's treatments in that time. But certainly from the behavioral standpoint,

52
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:40,040
the behavior problems that can occur in people with dementia have always been treatable.

53
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,240
Anxiety, depression, psychosis, those have frequently been reasons for hospitalization

54
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,520
and often were the reason that we saw people on the geriatric psychiatry unit because they were

55
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:03,480
imagining things that weren't there or acting out on delusions that they had, that people were spying

56
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:11,320
on them and they were taking apart the stealing tiles in their apartment to find these wires that

57
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,200
weren't really there and all that kind of thing. So we've always been able to treat that and

58
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,800
fortunately there's also been improvement in some of the options there. Not ideally, but to the

59
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,200
point where we can control some of those behaviors so people can have a better quality of life and

60
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,360
so that caregivers can have a little more peace of mind as well.

61
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,080
Is it common that a patient is known to have dementia and we'll get to how that's diagnosed

62
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,360
in such a moment, but a patient is known to have this diagnosis of dementia, either Alzheimer's

63
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,440
dementia or some non-Alzheimer's form and then they begin to exhibit some of the symptoms you've

64
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,200
described so that when they're coming in for evaluation, you're not going to be able to

65
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,480
evaluate the diagnosis of dementia. You're not going to be able to evaluate the evaluation.

66
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,560
You're not going through a lengthy differential diagnosis to rule out schizophrenia or other forms

67
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,880
of psychosis. Or is it sometimes the case that actually the presenting feature of the dementia

68
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,600
can be some of these psychotic symptoms you describe where they feel, hey someone's talking

69
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:30,760
the answer is both. Sometimes people will have a course of dementia that after a few years they'll

70
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,200
start to develop some of these behavioral symptoms. Some people never get them and some people do

71
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:45,160
actually present with them. Often with the latter, what will usually happen is they'll go be seen by

72
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:53,160
a community psychiatrist or somebody else and get diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar illness

73
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:01,480
or something that does not have an onset in the mid-70s. And so usually they'll be misdiagnosed for

74
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:08,360
a couple of years until it becomes really apparent that that's not the primary problem,

75
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,680
that there is an underlying neurodegenerative process. I can't sort of imagine, because I

76
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,080
haven't been close enough to it, what it's like for a patient in the early stages of dementia.

77
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:31,160
I've seen patients in the later stages where at least on the outside it seems that they're

78
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:38,440
quite removed from what's happening and paradoxically they don't appear to be suffering very much.

79
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,360
But is it safe to assume that it's quite unnerving in the early stages and that that might actually

80
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,440
be what's driving some of this behavior? Is there a legitimate and understandable fear of something

81
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,720
is wrong but I don't understand what it is? Yeah, I mean sometimes. So some people are always

82
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,480
blissfully unaware throughout the entire course of their illness. You know, I can't tell you how

83
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,200
many times I see a patient and they sit down in my office and I'm like, so what brings you in today?

84
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,200
And they're like, my wife? Because there's nothing wrong with me, I'm fine. They have no idea why

85
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:26,280
they're there, even in the very mild stages. Whereas some people are so acutely aware that

86
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:33,000
something's not right and sometimes they know for two or three years before we can even find

87
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,960
any discernible changes on their testing. You know, they're like, I know something's wrong with me.

88
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,200
And a lot of times they're right. You know, sometimes they're just anxious because a family

89
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,440
member had it or they're worried, but a lot of times, you know, they're very in tune to what's

90
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,680
happening. And I think you're right. Usually those are the people that suffer the most because they

91
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,080
know what's happening to them and they don't like it and they know what they're facing. You know,

92
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:11,880
some patients are extremely insightful and really are aware of what's happening, aware that they're

93
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,920
losing things that they used to be able to do or that things aren't coming as quickly. Even yesterday,

94
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,800
weirdly, I had two patients with Lewy body dementia, which is a type of dementia that has

95
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:34,200
sort of parts of Alzheimer's, parts of Parkinson's and some very prominent visual hallucinations.

96
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,400
And whereas oftentimes when people have hallucinations or false beliefs to them,

97
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,640
they're real and they don't know that they're not real. Both of these patients were like,

98
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,960
I see things that aren't there and it drives me crazy. Like they knew, you know, this one woman

99
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,920
has people all over her living room and she can't find a piece of furniture to sit down on because

100
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,160
these people are sitting there and she knows they're not real. But yet she feels like she

101
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,520
has to ask them to move in order to sit on her own furniture. But she was insightful enough to

102
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,360
be able to say, I know they're not there and I know my family members don't see them. So

103
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,560
it's really variable. Let's talk a little bit about how one makes the clinical diagnosis

104
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:30,680
first of dementia and then how one starts to separate out Alzheimer's from Lewy body from

105
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,600
presumably an unspecified form of dementia. So starting with the former, what is the clinical

106
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,440
definition in the diagnosis of dementia? So dementia is an umbrella term that just sort

107
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,120
of describes changes in memory and other areas of cognition and it represents a change from how you

108
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,240
used to be so you weren't born with it and it interferes with your day-to-day function. So there

109
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:05,000
are many causes of dementia. Alzheimer's far and away the most common. So although there have been

110
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,400
advancements in many of our tests and more sophisticated imaging techniques and blood

111
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:23,000
biomarkers that are coming along, the real crux of diagnosis is a good clinical interview with a

112
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,880
patient and with an observer. So usually it's a spouse or an adult child or a loved one who has

113
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:40,040
observed changes over time. In interviewing them separately, that's key separately because otherwise

114
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,320
the most important information is left out, you know, because they don't want to hurt the loved

115
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:52,120
one's feelings or whatever. So getting a good clinical interview from the patient,

116
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,520
informant, doing some cognitive testing to look for patterns that support one diagnosis over another

117
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:07,160
and then doing some brain imaging to look for certain things like strokes or shrinking in

118
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,800
certain parts of the brain as well as some lab tests to rule out reversible causes of memory loss,

119
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:22,440
thyroid disturbance, vitamin deficiencies, things like that, syphilis, although frankly I've stopped

120
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,080
really testing for that because it's just tertiary syphilis is so uncommon these days.

121
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,760
And once we do all that, generally speaking, you know, we have a pretty accurate diagnostic,

122
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:43,480
you know, chance of getting the right, you know, label for them. Sometimes we need formal neuropsych

123
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,680
testing with a neuropsychologist. Sometimes we do need PET scanning to look at certain patterns.

124
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:59,240
For example, frontotemporal dementia is one where people often present with relatively

125
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:08,600
preserved memory but significant changes in language or behavior. And usually, you know,

126
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,000
within a minute I can diagnose them because the loved one will say, well, his memory is not so

127
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,720
bad but and it's either, you know, he can't really talk anymore, which can also happen in

128
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,600
Alzheimer's fairly early in some people. Or, you know, I'm embarrassed to take him to church

129
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:34,040
because he'll get up and take the microphone from the pastor and, you know, you almost know, okay,

130
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,120
this is FTD. Those are often the people that erroneously get diagnosed with bipolar illness

131
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:48,520
because of these sudden and really profound behavior changes. Problems with judgment,

132
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,440
where they get labeled as being manic because they're spending lots of money or they're,

133
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,800
you know, responding to every publisher's clearinghouse thing that comes in the mail.

134
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,200
You know, so there's these typical sort of stories and behaviors that we see that kind of

135
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,480
support one diagnosis over another. So Amanda, there's a lot in there and I kind of want to

136
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,080
go over that in a bit more detail. So to make sure I'm understanding this and obviously the

137
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,200
listener as well, the first thing I heard you really say there was the absolute importance of

138
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:30,200
the clinical story. So unlike cancer where the diagnosis is made typically off imaging

139
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,560
and then ultimately through a tissue sample, right, the gold standard is a histological

140
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,320
diagnosis. That's not the case in Alzheimer's disease. We don't do biopsies of the brain.

141
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,040
I also didn't hear you talk about CSF sampling,

142
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:51,160
sampling the cerebrospinal fluid to look for amyloid beta or tau. Anything you want to say

143
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,720
about that before we continue down this rabbit hole? Well, yeah, I mean, there are a few things

144
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,360
I can say about that. First of all, you know, certainly it is extremely helpful in the diagnostic

145
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:14,680
process to have, you know, formal tests like CSF or amyloid PET in terms of confirming a diagnosis,

146
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:22,040
you know, although we certainly don't do brain biopsies. Unlike when I graduated when you

147
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:29,160
literally could only see amyloid at autopsy under a microscope, we now do have the ability to image

148
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,600
amyloid in living patients, which has, you know, and I know we're going to talk about research later,

149
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,040
allowed us to really go much earlier in the process and design some prevention trials

150
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,920
based on targeting people who have brain amyloid but don't yet have memory symptoms. So it's been

151
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:04,040
a really amazing revolution as far as that goes. However, from a cost standpoint, although it's a

152
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:11,800
test I can order, it's not covered by any insurance and would cost a patient about $4,000 out of pocket.

153
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,080
So other than doing it, you know, in the context of a clinical trial, it's really not realistic

154
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:25,560
for many of the patients. As far as CSF goes, you know, there is a good correlation between

155
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:32,200
the PET and CSF findings. Because I am a geriatric psychiatrist and not a neurologist,

156
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm not typically doing lumbar punctures as part of my practice. Generally speaking, between the

157
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:49,240
other markers such as, you know, MRI imaging and PET, FDG PET, which measures how well the brain

158
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,320
is using glucose as its fuel and has different patterns supporting one diagnosis over another,

159
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:03,000
and that is usually covered by some insurance, we're able to make a diagnosis without the additional

160
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,200
markers such as CSF. But there are times when it is helpful and when we do refer people

161
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,920
to neurology specifically for that. So this clinical diagnosis is so important in a way that

162
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,880
it's not really as important in the other major chronic diseases, right? When a patient comes in

163
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,520
and they're being diagnosed with diabetes or NAFLD, nobody's really taking a great clinical history.

164
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,440
You're sort of assuming you know how they got there. But here you're having that discussion,

165
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,320
as you described, both with the patient and with someone who can give some of these details you're

166
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,880
looking for. So I kind of want to identify some of these patterns. Now, I guess the textbook cases are

167
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,160
first thing is a loss of short-term memory, I'm assuming. Is that the textbook version of

168
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:02,920
Alzheimer's dementia? Yes, I mean in Alzheimer's disease usually people start to complain of

169
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,320
forgetfulness repeating. So a loved one might say, well he you know he asked me

170
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:17,880
what time this appointment was four times since yesterday kind of thing. But he can remember you

171
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,920
know all the names of his high school football teammates. That's very classic. So the preservation

172
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:32,200
of long-term memory with difficulty with short-term memory. Now, Amanda, how do you differentiate

173
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,080
distraction from the path to dementia? Because if there's one thing I've heard so often from

174
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,760
patients, it's I you know I just got introduced to this person and I can't remember their name and it

175
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,720
used to be so easy for me to remember names or you know my wife told me to do this thing and I

176
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,560
just completely spaced on it. And you know my in my practice most of those patients when they're

177
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,880
saying that tend to be distracted. There tends to be something else going on. It's really not the

178
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,160
prodrom to sort of dementia. But obviously in your practice specifically that's one can't assume that.

179
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,600
Do you have a way that you try to differentiate that? Well, I think it has to be taken in context

180
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:19,480
with all of the other information. I mean quite frankly it happens to me too. You know literally

181
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:28,040
yesterday I thought it was Friday because I knew I was normally on Friday I wear sweatpants and a

182
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,200
USF thing and I knew I wanted to not wear that for this podcast today. And so I was in my Friday

183
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,040
outfit yesterday and so at one point I literally was like oh it's Friday. And then I was like oh

184
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,880
no it's not Friday. But I'm not worried that I have dementia. I was distracted. I'm busy. I have a lot

185
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:53,960
of things going on. And so you know all those kinds of things happen to all of us. So it has to be

186
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,440
looked at in the context of you know A the fact that some of this does happen with normal aging.

187
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:09,960
The fact that you know stress, a bad night's sleep, all that kind of stuff can affect it.

188
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,360
And the other part of it is the frequency and intensity of it. You know if it's the exception

189
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:23,560
rather than the rule it's probably not dementia. But when that becomes sort of how you are and

190
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:33,320
what happens every day then it's more concerning. You alluded to, I think you alluded to MRI and

191
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,880
although you didn't state it explicitly, were you talking about hippocampal volume or other

192
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,560
brain matter loss? Was that kind of what you were getting at?

193
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:51,400
Yeah the typical things that we look for in an MRI when evaluating for dementia. A is

194
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,160
ruling out vascular disease or quantifying the amount of it. So we all get with aging

195
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:06,680
some amount of tiny little strokes. And I know that sounds scary. But as we get older you know

196
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,320
for various reasons high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and even just

197
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,400
normal aging there can be blocking of blood vessels, changes in circulation that cause us to

198
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,800
have these tiny little infarcts. These are not anything you would notice. You would never

199
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,640
have symptoms. You wouldn't go to the hospital. But there can be an accumulation of them. And

200
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,520
there's a certain amount that's sort of normal and it's extremely mild or scattered. But then

201
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:43,960
when they start to coalesce or they start to extend into cortical areas,

202
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,040
parts of the brain that sort of matter more in terms of critical thinking,

203
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,560
then they can be symptomatic. So that's one of the things that we look at is how much vascular

204
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:01,800
disease. Another thing that we look at is how much shrinking there is both globally and then

205
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:08,920
as you mentioned in the hippocampus which is where short-term memories are kind of formed and

206
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:16,840
before they go off elsewhere. And so there is, you know, it is known that that shrinking in

207
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,800
the hippocampus particularly disproportionately to shrinking elsewhere can be a biomarker of

208
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:30,520
Alzheimer's disease. Now there are sometimes people who have hippocampal atrophy and turn out to be

209
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:40,600
amyloid negative. So there are these other pathologies that could be considered, they call

210
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,800
it hippocampal sclerosis. Some people have that from a stroke. Some people have it potentially

211
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:56,440
from chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other buildup of other abnormal proteins beside amyloid

212
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,880
in the brain that kind of affect memory as well. I want to come back to the amyloid negative case

213
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:13,800
in a second. Is hippocampal volume a reliable marker to check progress? So for example,

214
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,040
if you had a patient that was high risk theoretically, so I don't know if you're

215
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,080
seeing people who are high risk but don't have symptoms yet, but if you had a patient who is high

216
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,640
risk, you did an MRI, you got a baseline so to speak, you had their hippocampal volume, would

217
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:34,520
tracking that over time for changes, reductions presumably, would that provide any meaningful

218
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:42,280
insight? Sometimes but not always. So other things can affect hippocampal volume. For example,

219
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,960
people who are chronically exposed to elevated levels of cortisol or stress hormone,

220
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,400
people who have post-traumatic stress disorder, we know they have smaller

221
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:06,920
hippocampi than people who don't have that. And so there are times when we can track hippocampal

222
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:14,280
volume over the course of progression of Alzheimer's and the shrinking sort of correlates

223
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,520
with the amount of cognitive impairment, but sometimes not. Sometimes we have people who

224
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,480
are very impaired and their brain doesn't really look that bad. And sometimes we have people who

225
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,800
look like they shouldn't be able to put on their own pants based on what the brain looks like,

226
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,200
but they seem fine. So it's again, one of those things that really has to be taken

227
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,200
in context with all of the other information and part of the reason why the clinical

228
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,760
evaluation and interview and the intangible stuff is so important.

229
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:57,560
And just to be clear, the diagnosis is, it requires the clinical story with or without amyloid.

230
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,320
And so when you look at the Venn diagram of people with amyloid and people with clinical

231
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,680
symptoms suggestive of dementia and you line them up, there's an overlap, but it's not a perfect

232
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:15,880
union. And what that tells us is that amyloid is neither necessary nor sufficient for Alzheimer's

233
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,680
disease, correct? Well, amyloid is necessary for Alzheimer's disease. It's not necessary

234
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:29,000
for dementia, but if you look at the definition pathologically of what Alzheimer's is,

235
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:38,040
it is the plaques, the amyloid plaques and the tau tangles in the brain. So that was what's

236
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,040
required pathologically to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

237
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,440
But that diagnosis will only be made post-mortem technically?

238
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:55,320
Technically, yeah. But that's why the advent of amyloid imaging has been so helpful in terms of

239
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,840
making that formal diagnosis in living people, which is obviously more helpful for them.

240
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:14,840
You know, the correlation, I believe in one of the studies with Amivid,

241
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,880
Flurbetapyr, which was one of the first amyloid imaging ligands that came out, the correlation

242
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:28,440
between the PET and their... These were people who were kind enough to donate their brains

243
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,000
after they passed to compare to what their PET scan looked like. And it was a correlation of about

244
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,720
97%. So meaning when they were alive, they had an amyloid PET scan. Yes. And an amyloid PET scan,

245
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,960
unlike FDG PET, where you're putting radio labeled glucose, here you're putting an antibody to amyloid

246
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:59,160
as their tracer, correct? Yes. And so they had this scan while they were alive, and you then had

247
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:05,480
a distribution of people that had this much amyloid, that much amyloid, et cetera. But all

248
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,800
of them, to be clear, had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based clinically, correct?

249
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,680
Right. They had a suspected diagnosis of Alzheimer's, and then they underwent the PET, and then

250
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,120
they donated their brains. And then on exam... The correlation between...

251
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,720
So what we're missing there, of course, is the control of people who had amyloid in their brains

252
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,320
that would go on to have amyloid on autopsy, but didn't have Alzheimer's disease. Do we have a rough

253
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,560
sense of how big a population that is? I've had a hard time finding this, by the way. What percentage

254
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:45,640
of people on autopsy have amyloid in their brain, but did not have dementia during their life?

255
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:55,800
I don't know, honestly. But I think more than you would expect, because... So what we know about

256
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,160
amyloid, and one of the reasons that amyloid imaging has been so helpful, is because it's

257
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:09,480
helped us understand that amyloid starts to build up 10, 15, 20 years before you start to have

258
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:17,960
symptoms of forgetfulness and other cognitive symptoms. And so it's this process where

259
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,840
it's occurring, and then it reaches a critical mass. And there's a lot of debate scientifically

260
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:32,840
about what that critical mass is, or what the downstream effects of amyloid build up. There's

261
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,440
some people who think that you can have as much amyloid as you want, and it's not until you start

262
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:47,080
to have tau. We're understanding more that tau... Whereas amyloid is sort of widespread,

263
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:54,440
kind of from the beginning, and builds up all these years beforehand. And so the

264
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,000
tracking amyloid doesn't correlate to symptoms. Tau, on the other hand, is very different and has

265
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
a very specific pattern in which it spreads that does indeed correlate with symptoms. So some

266
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,680
people feel like it's really the tau that kind of stages where things are, whether you're going to be

267
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:21,080
symptomatic or not. So to answer your question, I think there are a lot of people who start to

268
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,720
build up amyloid maybe in their 70s or whatever, and then die of something else.

269
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,080
So a way to think about it is it's sort of like saying, and this is a bad example,

270
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,920
but I think it's the best one I can think of on the spot, it's like coronary calcification,

271
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,600
where if somebody dies of cancer and you see calcification in their coronary arteries,

272
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,400
you knew they have atherosclerosis, but it may have never clinically manifested itself. And

273
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,640
if they had not died of cancer, they may have died of an MI 10 years later.

274
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:59,000
That's exactly right. And that's frankly the analogy we most often like to use.

275
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:15,160
So before 2011, the FDA, the definition of Alzheimer's was dementia. So there was no place

276
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,760
in research for these prodromal patients or testing these interventions in people before

277
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,520
they had full-blown dementia. And that was very much like waiting until someone had a heart attack

278
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,200
to say that they had coronary artery disease. Well, it's like, no, you knew that because they

279
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,000
have high cholesterol and they're building up and you could see on an angioplasty or whatever

280
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,440
this was happening. And so in 2011, with the advent of amyloid imaging,

281
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,760
Pittsburgh compound was the first thing that came out that allowed us to see that,

282
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,680
although its half-life is so terribly short that it really is not clinically

283
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:07,480
useful because it has to be made and used within minutes. But that really allowed us to redefine

284
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,360
what Alzheimer's is so that we could see this amyloid building up in patients before they

285
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:22,360
started to have symptoms. And it allowed some redefinition and there were white papers that

286
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:29,720
came out kind of dividing. And I know on a previous podcast, Richard Isaacson did go into

287
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,040
this in some detail, but the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's, then mild cognitive impairment,

288
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:44,840
and then dementia. So it really has allowed us to then kind of take a step back and see if we can

289
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:53,400
intervene before people have these symptoms that we may not be able to reverse. Yeah, to me, Amanda,

290
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:01,400
that is probably the most exciting part of this field, which is effectively taking from the

291
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,680
playbook of the chronic disease we understand most. I talk about this with patients, which is

292
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:13,160
like there's basically these three main chronic diseases, which is Alzheimer's disease, cancer,

293
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,800
even though of course that's not one disease, and the atherosclerotic diseases, both cerebrovascular

294
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,640
and cardiovascular. And those three legs stand on a platform, which is metabolic disease,

295
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,160
which is then basically the distribution from hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance,

296
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,360
naphyl D, and type 2 diabetes. So that becomes the table and you have these legs that stand on it.

297
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,440
Of these, I think we have the best understanding of atherosclerosis, where lesion by lesion,

298
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,680
we can stage them. We understand what a fatty streak is, we understand what a foam cell is,

299
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:54,360
we understand what leads to calcification, how we go from soft plaque to vulnerable plaque to a

300
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:03,960
ruptured plaque to an MI. And we clearly understand, as your point is made, to sit there

301
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,600
and wait until someone has a major adverse cardiac event to say, oh, this guy's got heart disease,

302
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:16,600
is nonsensical. I would go one step further and say, waiting until a person's 10-year risk exceeds

303
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,880
5% to intervene is equally nonsensical, yet that is still largely the standard.

304
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,880
Because we know from autopsy studies of teenagers, that the process begins then. I mean, it probably

305
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,840
begins even younger, but we don't have too many autopsies of people below the teen years. But

306
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,000
certainly autopsies of people in their late teens and early 20s who have died for other reasons

307
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:47,560
already show foam cells, fatty streaks in some cases. So if I'm understanding you correctly,

308
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,680
by definition now, based on everything we understand, anyone who clinically classifies

309
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:05,160
as having dementia with amyloid has Alzheimer's disease. Is tau necessarily preceded by amyloid,

310
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,360
or are there scenarios in which tau arrives with minimal to no amyloid beta?

311
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,720
So the answer to that question is yes, but I want to kind of go back for a second.

312
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:25,720
So anyone that has dementia and has amyloid does have Alzheimer's, but they may also have

313
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:32,760
other pathology too, right? So you could have a mixed dementia where you have Alzheimer's and

314
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,000
vascular disease, or you could have a mixed Lewy body in Alzheimer's. And we know from

315
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:48,920
the autopsy studies certainly that are done by Dennis Dixon up in Mayo and Jacksonville,

316
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,680
most pathology is actually mixed. I don't have the numbers, and I don't remember them quite

317
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:04,520
frankly offhand, but I know that the number of pure Alzheimer's is actually lower than the number

318
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:13,640
of mixed cases. So most people have something else too. And is vascular the most common

319
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,800
additional diagnosis? Yes. And so what does that mean? Let's think about that for a second.

320
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,360
You may recall I interviewed Francesco Gonzalez Lima probably two or three years ago.

321
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:36,280
He's here actually in UT Austin, works with Jack De La Torre and they really have a strong point

322
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,320
of view that says, look, it's this microvascular disease that is really a big driver here. And

323
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,880
there's a very compelling rationale for that. You mentioned it earlier. It's very hard to make it

324
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,400
into your seventh, eighth, ninth decade without unbelievable amounts of microvascular damage.

325
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,600
And to your point, if a critical mass of that is reached, it's quite likely that that's going to

326
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,120
result in the cognitive impairment and ultimately even higher levels of impairment beyond memory,

327
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:13,320
such as executive function. And if, as you said, amyloid is accumulating along the way, it makes

328
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,640
sense that you could have this mixed picture where you have the clinical side. So you meet the

329
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,560
criteria for dementia, you have amyloid beta and you have a heavy enough burden of vascular disease.

330
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,760
I guess it begs the question, if you had a time machine and you could go back in time

331
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:38,520
for that particular patient and you correct the vascular insult. So let's just say in one patient,

332
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,400
they were aggressively, you aggressively manage their hypertension. In another patient, you

333
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,760
kick the smoking cessation in 20 years sooner. In another patient, you manage the dyslipidemia.

334
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,000
You're going to impact the vascular stuff. Do you think that has an impact on the amyloid side of

335
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,200
the equation? And more importantly, does it impact clinically their development of dementia?

336
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,440
I think definitely, yes. I mean, I know, again, when you had your conversation with Richard

337
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:15,400
Isaacson, he stressed the importance of those cardiovascular risk factors and the development

338
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,280
of Alzheimer's. The other thing that we know is, and again, it's not exactly the same

339
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:28,120
protein, but it's so closely related, amyloid is a component of blood vessel walls.

340
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:38,680
So to what extent, I think there's still room for more understanding in that and what the

341
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,080
exact relationship is between normal amyloid and pathologic amyloid. So it's important to say in

342
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:51,960
Alzheimer's, the buildup of amyloid is this abnormal length amyloid that's not the usual

343
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:59,160
thing that we find in our bodies. So it's changed a little bit. But there is normally amyloid that's

344
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:06,760
part of our being. And so because it is part and parcel of blood vessel walls, it's only natural

345
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:14,440
to assume there must be this interplay between the vasculature and the Alzheimer's side of things.

346
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,480
I would be lying if I said I knew what that was. I think that still needs to be elucidated.

347
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,200
That's why we have floors of people smarter than me upstairs doing experiments.

348
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,440
Does amyloid beta exist outside of the blood-brain barrier? Does it exist on the other

349
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,560
side of the blood-brain barrier? Honestly, I don't know.

350
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,880
That's interesting. I never actually thought of what, until you said what you said

351
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,640
about the relationship to the endothelium. I never thought about that. I'm guessing somebody

352
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,080
has looked into that. And the answer is probably not enough to matter or else we would simply be

353
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,320
doing a blood test to look for enough amyloid, right? Right. Well, that's coming though. Yeah.

354
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,000
So there are some really exciting, I don't want to forget about your tau question.

355
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah. Yeah. We'll come back to that. So I have that over here.

356
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:19,240
There are some really exciting developments in terms of looking at blood biomarkers,

357
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:29,160
including plasma amyloid, in terms of potentially having a blood-based test for Alzheimer's.

358
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,760
So there has been progress there. And I think that as time goes on, we're going to be able to

359
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:48,280
do these less invasive tests and really have a better sense of both risk for people who aren't

360
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:55,240
maybe symptomatic yet, as well as diagnosis. One blood-based test. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

361
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,800
Let's go back to tau. And then I want to ask another blood-based question.

362
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,680
Okay. So you had asked about whether you could have other things like tau without amyloid. And

363
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:12,440
the answer is definitely yes. So frontotemporal dementias, some of them are characterized by

364
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,080
abnormal tau buildup in the absence of amyloid. There are some familial genetic

365
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:28,680
frontotemporal brain diseases that are characterized by tau burden, chronic traumatic encephalopathy

366
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:37,800
that we see in football and other boxing. And things also have abnormal tau often in the

367
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,680
absence of amyloid. So yes, that definitely has a role in the development of dementia

368
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,600
in other types of dementia too. We sort of glossed over it, but maybe it is worth

369
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,480
explaining what it is that amyloid beta is doing to neurons and what it is that tau

370
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,920
is doing to neurons to actually injure them. Do you want to spend just a second

371
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:09,640
kind of outlining those things? To the extent that my blonde self can, I will.

372
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,960
To a first order approximation. No, but I mean, I focus on the patient part of things. I let the

373
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:28,600
scientists do their, the neuroscientists do their part. But it is this sort of cascade of damage.

374
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:39,240
There is activation of glial cells, which sort of help protect our brain against intruders.

375
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,520
They can release toxins. They can sort of eat, it's called autophagy, eating up our own tissue.

376
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:59,160
And so there is damage both inside the neurons and then outside, plaques and tangles. And

377
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,800
it creates a cascade that eventually leads to cell death.

378
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:14,040
And so is it more the death of the neuron itself or would the injury to the glial cells alone be

379
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,360
sufficient to lead to these symptoms? Because the glial cells, of course, when I was in medical

380
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,320
school, which was not that long after you, I don't remember that we talked that much about

381
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,440
glial cells in our neuroscience classes. I feel like we talked more about the neurons,

382
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,920
but I know that in more recent discussions I've had with neuroscientists, they really place almost

383
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,480
an equal emphasis on the glial cells. So I'm curious as to whether or not injuring the glial

384
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:50,040
cells in this particular pathology is equally responsible or at least to a first-order

385
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:56,360
approximation equally responsible for the damage. I think they're more responsible for the damage.

386
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:03,000
I think that they're part of the cascade that leads to the death of the neurons because they're

387
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:12,120
trying to protect the neurons and in doing so injure them. I want to go back to a biomarker

388
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,960
question. We're going to talk about the ApoE genotype at some point, but of course one can

389
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,280
actually measure ApoE in the plasma. Just like you can measure Apo lipoprotein B,

390
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,760
which we use obviously extensively in cardiovascular risk stratification. To my

391
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,400
knowledge, there's not a commercial assay for measuring ApoE though it can be done.

392
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,040
Do you are you aware of any utility to that? Would looking at ApoE levels, I read a paper

393
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,480
seven or eight years ago, I think suggesting that the lower the level of ApoE, the higher the risk,

394
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,120
but I could entirely have that backwards and I could entirely be wrong. Is that something

395
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:02,200
you're aware of at all? Not really. I mean it's really more about the genotyping than the

396
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,760
quantification of it. Obviously, and again you've talked about it on prior podcasts,

397
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:19,880
the risk that E4 genotype carries compared to the others and the fact that E4 homozygotes

398
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:27,000
have higher risk and also different responses to cardiovascular meds, different

399
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:38,360
risks for other diseases besides dementia. It is typically not something that we check for in the

400
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:46,680
routine day-to-day clinical care for a couple of reasons. One is it's not diagnostic, right? So you

401
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:53,160
can have E4, E4 not have Alzheimer's or you can have E2, E3 which might be protective and still

402
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,680
have Alzheimer's. So it really just makes people worry. It does have a lot more utility in the

403
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:07,640
research setting in terms of looking at how carriers versus non-carriers respond to certain

404
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:18,280
treatments and helping us understand that carriers may respond differently to different lifestyle

405
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:25,640
interventions, may have an earlier onset compared to people who don't have it but ultimately end up

406
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:33,800
with the same disease. Yeah. So when people come to see you in clinic, there's not a lot of utility

407
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:40,600
added by looking at it. I mean my view is APO E4 is great to help people identify risk early on,

408
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:46,200
but at the same time nobody gets off the hook and you used a great example. The 2-3 shows up a lot

409
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:52,360
and I tell my patients with the 2-3, they're not off the hook. You've got about a 10 percent risk

410
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:59,320
reduction relative to the 3-3 but the 3-3 is clearly not at risk and on the flip side, the 3-4

411
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,840
patients or even the 4-4 patients, I say look it's certainly not a fait accompli but I would take this

412
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:10,360
a lot more seriously than maybe you otherwise would in terms of preventative measures. So

413
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,520
let's go back to the patient that shows up in clinic. Oh actually there's one other thing I

414
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,360
wanted to clarify. I'm sorry. Let's go back to Lewy body dementia. Most people have heard of this.

415
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,440
There have been some notable examples in the public sphere about folks that have

416
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,600
died from this. Is it still the case that that's a diagnosis that can be made only post-mortem?

417
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:42,040
I mean again, yes, but there's this sort of classic clinical picture that is so compelling

418
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:51,880
that it can be made fairly accurately in the clinic without diagnostic testing.

419
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,640
And so the clinical distinction between, I hate to use this term, the clinical distinction between

420
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:04,200
classic Alzheimer's dementia and classic Lewy body, so let's exclude the mixed variants of that.

421
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:10,920
How would you differentiate those patients? So classic Alzheimer's would begin with

422
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:20,760
short-term memory loss and slowly but surely over time progress to having difficulty paying

423
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:28,280
bills and then eventually needing supervision, needing assistance with activities of daily living,

424
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:36,760
cooking, bathing, the classic sort of decline. May or may not have behavior issues.

425
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:44,520
May or may not have some changes in walking. Lewy body disease on the other hand presents with a

426
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,160
fairly classic triad of symptoms that occur within two years of one another. One is

427
00:48:52,520 --> 00:49:00,680
an Alzheimer's-like cognitive impairment that can notably fluctuate so that some days people seem

428
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:09,000
really good and some days they seem really, really bad. There is a Parkinsonism component

429
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,920
where they will often be stiff, have trouble rising from a chair, shuffle. They may decrease

430
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,080
arm swing when they walk so that they walk and, you know, normally when we walk our arms move,

431
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:28,440
but their arms don't move. They may have more or I should say less expression on their face.

432
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:36,520
They don't necessarily have a tremor. So true Parkinson's disease proper often begins with a

433
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:47,560
tremor, a slow writhing kind of tremor at rest on one side. And often we don't see that in Lewy body

434
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:54,200
disease, but they have these other elements of Parkinsonism. And so we've got the cognitive

435
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,080
impairment, the Parkinsonism, and very often prominent visual hallucinations.

436
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:08,680
Seeing things that aren't there, fairly elaborate, often delusions that go along with it.

437
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,160
You know, there's this family living in my house. There's people and bears living in the trees.

438
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,440
You know, people will close their blinds because they don't want these people seeing them and all

439
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:28,760
that kind of stuff. So that classic triad of symptoms with some additional supportive features,

440
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:40,440
including restless leg syndrome, even many years leading up to it, as well as REM sleep behavior

441
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,840
disturbances. So people who often act out in their dreams or a spouse who says, I have to sleep in the

442
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:55,400
other room because he punches me. You know, that's sort of a classic Lewy body picture. And

443
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:01,880
furthermore, they fluctuate. Both the motor and the cognitive symptoms fluctuate. So today we

444
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,680
might be able to go to the mall and walk all around and tomorrow they might have trouble

445
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,920
walking across the room. And from the time of diagnosis, Amanda, until those patients are

446
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:19,400
either in hospice or incapacitated or dead is typically how long? Is that a quicker disease?

447
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:27,640
Sometimes. I mean, it's usually about eight years. But for some, you know, my experience,

448
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:34,520
I've had a lot of Lewy body patients who have sort of this precipitous decline and then kind of hit

449
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:44,520
a plateau for a while and then really drop off. You know, this is not this is anecdotal. This is

450
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,520
not based on any data. But it's just my experience with them and having seen enough of them to see

451
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:57,320
that that's frequently kind of how it goes. But it's usually about an eight to 10 year process.

452
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:04,120
And there it's less often as protracted as Alzheimer's can be, even though the average

453
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:10,600
for Alzheimer's is still also eight to 10 years. It can be significantly longer.

454
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:18,040
How hereditary is Lewy body dementia either with respect to Lewy body itself or being

455
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,560
predictive of the next generation's risk for Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's for that matter?

456
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:31,000
I honestly don't know. I don't think it's terribly genetic. You know, we don't have well established,

457
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,560
you know, as with early onset Alzheimer's, which does have some specific mutations that cause it.

458
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:46,600
I don't know that we know of specific mutations for Lewy body disease, but I may be just not

459
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,880
informed. I mean, that makes in some ways, Lewy body a bit more of a mystery because, as you said,

460
00:52:51,880 --> 00:53:00,680
for Alzheimer's disease on the very early onset side, we have the PSEN1 to APP mutations, which

461
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:07,160
are about as close to deterministic as you get. And then you have the APO-E4 gene, which is not

462
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:13,560
deterministic, but is highly suggestive for the more typical variant. And we also have known risk

463
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:19,480
factors, diabetes, you know, microvascular disease, dyslipidemia. I mean, these things are

464
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,560
absolutely known risk factors. We seem to have none of that on the side of Lewy body, correct?

465
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,440
As far as I know, yeah.

466
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,960
What's the relative incidence of Alzheimer's versus Lewy body dementia?

467
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,560
Is it like eight, 10 to one, or how much more prominent is Alzheimer's?

468
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:49,400
Well, it depends, I guess, if you're looking at, you know, the autopsy confirmed versus

469
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:56,360
sort of what we see in the clinic. You know, I think that I honestly don't have the numbers

470
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:04,920
specifically for you, but I do know that, you know, it's diagnosed less, but found more on autopsy,

471
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,440
that people do have Lewy bodies that we may not have expected.

472
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:15,240
I got it. And just in your experience in your clinic, what's the approximate distribution of those?

473
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:25,880
The, it's about, I would say, you know, 50 to 60 plus percent Alzheimer's, about 20 percent

474
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:35,480
true vascular, about 20 percent Lewy body. And then the rest is FTD and some of these Parkinson's

475
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,640
plus syndromes, progressive supranuclear palsy, and some of these other less common things that

476
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,920
we only see once in a while.

477
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,200
So back to kind of the way your practice works,

478
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,760
presumably people are coming to you at the referral of a neurologist, correct?

479
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:58,520
Not necessarily, no. We get people referred from their primary doctors. We get people that are

480
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:05,560
self-referred. We get people that are referred by neurology. It varies widely.

481
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,760
That in and of itself is actually quite interesting, right? If you think about the different paths

482
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,360
that a person gets to you, they can say, hey, there's something wrong with me. Oh, Dr. Smith,

483
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:22,600
that's a so-and-so psychiatrist specializing in geriatrics. I'm going to go see her. And then

484
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,880
the primary care doctor can say, look, I have a high enough degree of suspicion that my patient

485
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,600
has Alzheimer's. They're going to come to you, presumably when the neurologist is sending to you.

486
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,320
It's not to make the diagnosis. They've made it. I assume it's then to treat some of the

487
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:43,640
behavioral components. Sometimes, yes. I mean, well, first let me say that I would say

488
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:51,640
fully half of my patients think I'm a neurologist. They don't even sort of differentiate or they'll

489
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:59,160
refer to me as their neurologist and it just is what it is. They assume and it's fine. Or maybe

490
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:05,400
they don't want to say they're going to a psychiatrist. I don't know. Sometimes

491
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:13,560
I think it varies from place to place. There are a few neurologists here in town that do

492
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:19,080
specialize in Alzheimer's and treating dementia and focus on that, but a lot of them don't.

493
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:29,640
A lot of them prefer specializing in stroke or headache or MS or seizures. And so

494
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,040
when it turns out to be dementia, they just say, well, go to the Alzheimer's Center.

495
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:42,440
So I don't think it's a question of necessarily psychiatry versus neurology. It's just go to the

496
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:50,360
memory place. But yes, there are definitely a subset of

497
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:57,160
referring providers who do so specifically so that we can manage the behavioral aspect of things.

498
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,200
How long have you been in your current practice in Tampa?

499
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:15,640
Yeah, since 2002. In this building since 2008. So what happened is I came down to USF in 1997

500
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,480
as an intern to do my residency here. So I did my residency in psychiatry and then

501
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,800
a fellowship in geriatric psychiatry. And part of my fellowship time was spent with the Suncoast

502
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:37,720
Gerontology Center working under Eric Pfeiffer, who had founded that here in 1980 and really was

503
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,560
a leader in the field of geriatric psychiatry and Alzheimer's disease. He was the first president,

504
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:51,400
I think, of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. And it was actually one of the reasons

505
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:58,440
I chose USF because I knew Suncoast was here and I was interested in geriatrics and Alzheimer's

506
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:06,120
at that point. So when I finished my fellowship on a Friday, I started working for him on the

507
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:15,080
following Monday. And that was in 2002. And then in 2008, he retired and I kind of stepped in and

508
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,840
took on his role as principal investigator for a lot of the clinical trials he had been doing and

509
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:27,960
kind of directing the center. So I'm curious as to how your practice has evolved in nearly 20 years.

510
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:35,480
What is different and what is the same about people showing up with dementia today? Are they

511
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:42,200
older? Are they younger? Are they more metabolically ill? Are they on a faster track? Are

512
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,600
they progressing quicker? I mean, what are all the differences that you see?

513
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:56,280
So that's a really great question. And the thing that's the same, I would say, is the fear.

514
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:05,160
People are terrified of losing their minds and losing their memories. And so that continues

515
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:14,520
to be sort of the biggest motivator in terms of people seeking help. I will say that we are seeing

516
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:23,160
people that are both older and younger. I think that there's more of an awareness of Alzheimer's

517
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:31,720
as a disease, as well as an awareness of the fact that there are things that we can do about it.

518
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:37,560
Because when I first started, there wasn't a whole lot that we could do. And furthermore,

519
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:46,440
there was sort of this assumption that it was a normal consequence of aging. There has been a lot

520
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:53,880
of effort put into really educating the public that this is a disease and that this is not

521
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,760
something that you have to live with. And this is not a normal consequence of getting older.

522
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:06,040
And because of that, I think there's been success in kind of getting that message across and getting

523
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:17,080
people into the clinic. I think that there's definitely more of a shift towards people seeking

524
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:27,960
baseline, people looking at prevention, people wanting an evaluation and tips on brain health.

525
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:33,800
And I know, again, you spoke with Richard Isaacson because he runs a prevention clinic at Cornell

526
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:41,800
in terms of the lifestyle modifications and things that people can do earlier. We often see people

527
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:48,040
who have a parent who have Alzheimer's and want to come in and have an evaluation for themselves

528
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:55,320
or get involved in prevention research so that they don't go down the same path. So I think

529
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:01,640
that's the biggest area where things have shifted. I think there's also a better understanding that

530
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:11,320
people realize that there's more that we can do and that early intervention is key. People often

531
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:18,840
used to be embarrassed by this problem or isolated by it or not want to tell family members or

532
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,640
neighbors. And now they understand that if they come and they seek help and we start them on

533
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:30,680
medication, even though our medications are not miracle drugs by any stretch, the ones that are

534
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:37,560
FDA approved, but they can slow down decline. And then in some people, they can even subjectively

535
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:45,640
and objectively help for a period of time. And so knowing that you can preserve your function and

536
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:54,120
stay better longer or stay at home longer, there was one old study way back with denepazil showing

537
01:01:54,120 --> 01:02:00,440
that it delayed nursing home placement by an average of 24 months. That's huge. If you're

538
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:05,480
someone that wants to be at home versus being in a skilled nursing facility, or if you're a spouse

539
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,160
who wants to keep your loved one home, that makes a difference, even though the drugs not...

540
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,240
people are still going to get worse on the medication. So anyway, that was a lot of big

541
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:25,320
mouthful just to say that. I think there is this better awareness of the things that we are able

542
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:32,680
to do and the help that we're able to provide so that people seek help sooner. We talked about it

543
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:39,080
at the very outset that so many of the things that the patients are experiencing when they show up

544
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:45,240
are, quote unquote, the garden variety things that a psychiatrist would see anxiety and depression,

545
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:51,800
for example. What percentage of the patients that you're taking care of are you prescribing

546
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:58,680
antidepressants and anxiolytics? And is that standard of care? Is that something that you

547
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,680
have the ability to be more bespoke in because you have a greater understanding of how those

548
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:10,520
drugs work and how effective are they? So the answer is quite a few. I would say the majority

549
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:16,680
of our patients do have some mood or behavioral issue that does require treatment.

550
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:23,880
90% of people will have some behavioral issue at some point in their illness. It may not be a

551
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:33,160
terribly problematic psychotic type behavior issue. It may be something simple, but nevertheless,

552
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:44,440
they're very common in all types of dementia. The key is understanding that they are equally

553
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:53,000
treatable. Depression in a dependent person is just as treatable as depression in a healthy 25-year-old.

554
01:03:53,160 --> 01:04:06,040
So there are obviously some adjustments that have to be made for age and renal function and other

555
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:13,400
medications and drug interactions, but we very frequently prescribe the SSRIs,

556
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:20,600
the type of antidepressants, because they treat anxiety very well in this population. They're

557
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:29,480
pretty well tolerated. They generally don't make people fall, which is a big issue in this group

558
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:39,560
as well. We try to stay away from the benzodiazepine type drugs, Alprazolam and Lorazepam and

559
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:48,600
all the PAMs, particularly diazepam and the longer-acting ones, because they can really

560
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:55,000
increase confusion and have a dramatically high incidence of hip fracture with those drugs

561
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:06,840
and be used chronically. So a lot of it is identifying the specific problem, treating with

562
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:14,040
the least sort of offensive drug that's going to cause the least amount of collateral damage.

563
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:25,320
Stopping them at times when they may no longer be necessary. Old people sort of,

564
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:33,000
they collect meds like they collect other things. And sometimes you'll see someone who's on 15,

565
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:40,920
17, 18 meds, and you're like, why are you even on this? People who had hypertension when they

566
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:47,320
were 50 and needed three meds to manage it, but now are 90 and they're falling all the time

567
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,480
because their blood pressure is so low, but nobody bothered to say, hey, you don't need three

568
01:05:51,480 --> 01:06:03,080
meds for your blood pressure anymore. So we do have to be vigilant and really target symptoms

569
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:11,800
with the safest, lowest dose, and the shortest treatment period that we can. But in doing so,

570
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,680
can be very effective in treating these symptoms. You might not know the answer to this, but

571
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,360
do you have a sense of how many patients in the United States or what fraction of patients in the

572
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:29,000
US with Alzheimer's disease are getting that type of complimentary care for the psychiatric component,

573
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,320
specifically the depression and the anxiety? Do you think it's the majority or the minority?

574
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,960
I would probably say it's the majority. I mean, a lot of them do get treated by their primary

575
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,760
doctors for depression. I see a lot of people who come to me already on medication for that.

576
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:53,160
I think doctors are prescribing and people are sharing those. And certainly from the standpoint

577
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:59,720
of some of the more problematic behaviors, people don't want to live with them. They're

578
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:05,720
difficult. They're difficult for the patient and they can also be problematic and troublesome for

579
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:13,800
the caregivers. So they often will seek help for that more acutely than they will for

580
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:22,520
the underlying condition. How much are you providing? I mean, you're not necessarily treating

581
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:29,800
the family members medically, but after all, you are a psychiatrist, which means you have more tools

582
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,880
in your toolkit than simply your prescription pad. How much are you treating the spouse,

583
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,920
for example, as you are the patient, the spouse without dementia?

584
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:45,640
Well, in a way, I think we all sort of give free therapy, if you want to call it that.

585
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:54,360
I do occasionally medicate caregivers if they register as a patient. I'll say, hey,

586
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:01,960
you really have a severe depression. We need to treat this, but I won't do it under the patients.

587
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,880
You know, once we're dealing with meds, it's a whole other story. But

588
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:15,960
obviously, there is a lot of support and education. Sometimes, I mean, especially with the pandemic,

589
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:23,240
sometimes I'm the only other person that they will see or talk to, even if it's on telehealth like

590
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:31,560
this. Oftentimes, it's just that opportunity to vent, to talk to somebody who can understand

591
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:39,160
what they're going through. Although I have had some experience with family members having

592
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:47,320
dementia lead in life, I was not a primary caregiver. Most of what I know comes from

593
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:54,120
the village of patients and caregivers that have shared very personal things with me. So

594
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:02,360
I have the opportunity to share their insights with others. But I would say quite a lot of,

595
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:12,200
if you want to call it free therapy or whatever, just that opportunity to listen, to

596
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:19,800
make them understand that what they're going through is valid and real,

597
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:29,960
and give them pointers and tools and things that they may not have thought of in terms of handling

598
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:37,240
a certain behavior. Just that one little pearl that might make their day easier. The other day,

599
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:42,840
I was talking to someone who just simply cannot get their loved ones to take a shower. And I'm

600
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:48,040
like, well, what's their favorite snack? And they kind of looked at me funny. And I said,

601
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:54,920
they're like Cheetos. So I'm like, okay, tell them after they get out of the shower,

602
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:01,240
you'll give them some Cheetos. You'll go to the store, you'll get some Cheetos. And they're like,

603
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,160
they don't think of it that way because they're just sort of trying and fighting. Like, you need

604
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,760
to take a bath, you need to take a bath, get in the shower. And I want to take a shower. And there's

605
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:17,800
not that sort of stepping back and like, okay, how can I do this differently? So sometimes just

606
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:27,000
kind of giving them a little reality check and a break from the constant stress cycle that they're

607
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,800
in to kind of look at things through different eyes really can make a big difference, I think,

608
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:42,600
in their the way that they approach things. You know, the other thing that's sometimes really

609
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,200
difficult for caregivers is, you know, a lot of times they'll think that some of these behaviors

610
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:55,320
that their loved ones are showing are intentional, you know, or he's just doing it to annoy me.

611
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:03,400
It's like, well, no, he's not. He's really not. If he knew the answer, he wouldn't ask you again.

612
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:09,400
So instead of saying, don't you remember, just say, answer the question like it's the first time,

613
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:19,160
you know, and take out that sort of personal attack side of it, you know, and not look at it as

614
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:24,200
they're intentionally trying to irritate you, but, you know, they have a disease that's making them

615
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:30,120
do this. And often, you know, that is something that people really need to hear, and it really

616
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,040
makes their days better. I mean, it's easy for me to sit here at my desk and tell them it's a lot

617
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:43,000
harder to do, but at least kind of having that reality check can change the way that they

618
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,320
approach caregiving.

619
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:52,120
I'm sure people listening are familiar with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross and how she goes through

620
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:59,880
these sort of five stages of grief and how people go through, you know, denial and anger, etc. on

621
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:06,760
their way to acceptance. And that model has always sort of been helpful when thinking about

622
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:16,280
something like cancer. And I got to see that a lot firsthand. Is it similar here with Alzheimer's

623
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:23,160
disease, both for the patient and the caregiver that they that there's this, you know, in some

624
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,440
combination or in some order they go through those?

625
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:34,120
Oh, absolutely. I mean, you know, other, you know, I can't take credit for the phrase,

626
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,920
but it's, you know, it's like grieving for someone while they're still alive. You know, it's the,

627
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,000
you know, this can't really be happening and then being angry that it's happening. And, you know,

628
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,960
sort of, well, maybe if we do this and maybe do that. In fact, I re listened to your podcast with

629
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:59,080
Lauren Miller Rogan and Richard Isaacson last evening, just kind of in preparation for today.

630
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:05,640
And just to make sure we didn't sort of duplicate everything that we talked about. But, you know,

631
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:13,160
Lauren in that podcast really gives a very compelling journey right through those stages,

632
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:20,200
you know, in terms of dealing with her mother who was my patient, which is how I got to know them in

633
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:28,280
the first place. But, you know, it's really a very distinct journey while her mother was

634
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:41,000
was still very alive and, you know, going through those stages of grief in losing her hopes for what

635
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:47,080
her relationship with her mother would be like as she got older. You know, and it's really

636
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:54,360
terribly sad. And it's also something that naturally happens as we grieve. You know,

637
01:13:54,360 --> 01:14:00,360
I think those stages of grief apply to almost everything. You know, they're sort of part and

638
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:07,400
parcel of our, you know, existence as human beings is that's kind of going to happen. We don't always

639
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:14,760
go through all of them or we don't always resolve all of them or make it through all of them.

640
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:22,840
But it's a very, very real and major part of dealing with this diagnosis.

641
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:32,200
In my experience with oncology patients, once they've progressed through denial and anger and

642
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:39,160
bargaining, etc., and they sort of get to acceptance, the usually the biggest concern,

643
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:46,760
the residual concern is the amount of suffering at the end. So it actually becomes,

644
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:54,760
at least one of the concerns becomes around the mechanism of death. And that's not something a lot

645
01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:00,120
of people think about. Most people walking around, if they're level-headed, know that they're going

646
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,120
to die at some point. There aren't too many people walking around believing that they're immortal.

647
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:08,600
So most people understand in an abstract way, I'm not going to be able to do that. But I think

648
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:16,360
I'm not going to be alive at a point in time. But it's kind of a vague, fuzzy, foggy thing,

649
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,120
which is, I'll have a heart attack at some point, then I won't be alive. But to the patient with

650
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:27,480
metastatic cancer, who's again accepted that and understands that they've progressed through all

651
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:32,760
standard treatments. So even now we can even take a subset of patients with stage four cancer who

652
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:38,840
are in hospice care. All of a sudden, a big priority is the actual mechanism of death.

653
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:48,120
And certainly for the palliative care physician, and in my opinion, also for the good oncologist,

654
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:52,520
the one who doesn't just sort of abandon the patient when there's no more oncologic care.

655
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:58,440
I think a big part of that is explaining, no, actually, we might not be able to save your life,

656
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:04,760
but we can absolutely prevent discomfort. What is that discussion like for you,

657
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:11,880
once the patient and their family have progressed through all the stages and really understand

658
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:17,960
that this is an irreversible disease, and it will result in the end of their life? How do you

659
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:25,640
address the specific fears that remain? That's a great question. I do get asked about it fairly

660
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:37,000
frequently, but yet at the same time, we often don't get into it too much because what I try to

661
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:45,400
do is really help people focus on the now. That being said, what I share with them is that a lot

662
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:54,360
of times, as they progress, they're going to have more difficulty doing more simple things and more

663
01:16:54,440 --> 01:17:02,600
basic things. They will have trouble swallowing. They will need assistance. They will perhaps

664
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:13,320
aspirate on food and get pneumonia. They may lose mobility and be bedridden. We go through

665
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:21,640
that conversation when they ask, well, how do you die of Alzheimer's? But the truth is,

666
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:28,840
a lot of people don't ever get to that stage. Many people die of something else. They die of

667
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,320
old age. They die of their heart disease. They die because they fell in a parking lot

668
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:46,920
before they ever reach such a terminal stage of dementia. We have the conversation, but we also

669
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:59,160
try not to focus on the end game because that's just miserable. I know a little bit later,

670
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:06,440
we're going to be talking about healthy aging and stuff like that. That's one of the biggest

671
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:14,600
things that I see is not focusing on the end, but focusing on the now. The truth is, with Alzheimer's,

672
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:22,920
that's all people have. They have today. They have because they may not remember tomorrow what

673
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:32,840
happened today. They're really living in the moment. We try not to spend too much time dwelling

674
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:40,520
on ... I'm obviously extremely honest in terms of what can and will happen if they inquire,

675
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:47,400
and also in terms of letting them know that support is there through hospice and other things

676
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,600
when the time comes, that they don't have to go through that alone.

677
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:02,120
We try to reroute that thought process into focusing on making each day better.

678
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:09,400
Let's shift gears a little bit and talk about the clinical trial landscape because that's a very big

679
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:15,000
part of what you do. You're a clinical psychiatrist who deals with patients on an individual basis,

680
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,960
as we've discussed, but you also are heavily involved in another part of this, which is

681
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,080
how to do clinical trials. This is obviously a very important part of this work.

682
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:32,040
Alzheimer's disease and drugs don't have a great marriage. They don't have a great track record the

683
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:39,480
way cardiovascular disease does. Even though oncology is not great, far from perfect,

684
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,760
oncology even has a better track record than Alzheimer's disease. I think you could make the

685
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:50,520
case without being hyperbolic that there is no disease that has a worse track record relative

686
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:56,760
to the inputs on the output side. In other words, there are orphan diseases for which we have no

687
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:04,280
drugs, but there have been few shots on goal. The ratio of shots on goal to goals is lower in

688
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:11,880
Alzheimer's disease than unquestionably any other disease. On the one level that undoubtedly speaks

689
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:18,840
to the complexity of the disease, some might argue that on another level that speaks to

690
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:25,960
the wrong goal or shooting too late in the game, shooting from too bad an angle at the wrong goal.

691
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:33,080
You could take this metaphor 10 different ways. As it stands today, there are about 120 drugs

692
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:41,320
in the pipeline. If my number crunching has it right, about 27 of them, if we extracted this

693
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:47,320
correctly off clinicaltrials.gov, are in phase one. For the listener, meaning these are drugs

694
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:52,120
that are really just being evaluated for safety at this point. We have some animal data that

695
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:57,720
suggests this is a good idea. We have no idea if it works in humans, but in a very small way with

696
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:03,560
dose escalation, we want to make sure it's safe. About 65 are in phase two, so that means they've

697
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:09,560
passed that bar of being safe or at least safe enough to proceed to phase two, where now we're

698
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:16,200
looking for some efficacy and will of course continue to monitor safety. Then 29 are in phase

699
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:23,160
three, which means at a small scale, they've shown efficacy typically against a placebo. Now we want

700
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:30,120
to see if there's efficacy again, either versus a placebo or ideally against a current standard in

701
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:35,640
a larger trial where again, we're always going to continue to monitor safety, but it's really this

702
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:42,600
third stage that is required for FDA approval. Another way to slice the data is to look at it

703
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:48,680
by category of drug. I found this to be the most interesting. 12 of these are in the space of

704
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:54,440
cognitive enhancement, 12 are in the space of neuropsychiatric and behavioral improvement,

705
01:21:54,440 --> 01:22:00,760
and 97 are in the space of disease modification. Can you explain a little bit what the differences

706
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:06,120
of those three categories mean? Knowing that the next question I'm going to ask you is,

707
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,240
how has that evolved over the last 20 years? That to me has been the biggest, that was the thing I

708
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:21,960
was most surprised by. The symptomatic treatments are ones that can help slow cognitive decline

709
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:27,560
or help improve memory and thinking, but are not targeting the underlying disease process.

710
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:35,160
All the drugs that we currently have on the market are ones that are symptomatic treatments,

711
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:41,320
because they're just helping those neurons communicate in the case of dinephazil and

712
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:46,600
galantamine and ribostigmine, they're colonasterase inhibitors, and then there's

713
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:53,880
memantine, which is an NMDA receptor antagonist that normalizes levels of glutamate. They're

714
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:03,160
helping with neurotransmitters and they're not targeting the underlying pathology of amyloid and

715
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:11,640
tau. Then obviously the behavioral drugs are ones that are being targeted for specific behavior

716
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:17,640
problems in Alzheimer's and other dementia patients, things like apathy, agitation,

717
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:25,960
psychosis, sometimes sleep issues, sometimes even appetite and eating problems. So those all kind

718
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:31,880
of fall under the behavioral umbrella. And then these disease modifying treatments are ones that

719
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:41,160
actually target the underlying pathology in the case of sort of the biggest group of those that

720
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:49,080
are in trials right now are really monoclonal antibodies against primarily amyloid, but also

721
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:57,560
if you look targeting tau and removing them from the brain in the hopes that then there will be

722
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:05,800
cognitive improvement or at least halting cognitive decline. Can I interject for a second

723
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:13,400
mechanistically? Is it known exactly where amyloid beta is made? Is it understood

724
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,760
where the transcription takes place or is this all post-translational modification?

725
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:32,600
Well so there's a whole science dedicated to that, and it actually is different points

726
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:40,600
along the cascade. So there's the amyloid precursor protein which is on chromosome 21,

727
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:48,040
which is why people with Down syndrome who have three copies of chromosome 21 almost inevitably

728
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:53,320
will get Alzheimer's if they live long enough because they're making a third more amyloid than

729
01:24:53,320 --> 01:25:04,120
the rest of us. So anywhere from the very beginning of our DNA all the way through some of the enzymes

730
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:11,240
that cleave amyloid, so part of the problem is that the amyloid gets cleaved at a length of 40

731
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:17,400
or 42 amino acids rather than whatever it's supposed to be, which I don't remember.

732
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:29,880
Then the abnormal amyloid kind of folds and there's fibrils and there's

733
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:39,160
plaque. The plaque itself is a conglomeration of a series of folds in the protein,

734
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:49,160
and so there are even differences among the antibodies as to what part of that cascade

735
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:54,920
they target. Amyloid is not necessary. In other words, if you could wave a magic wand

736
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:01,960
and pull amyloid out of a person, is there any ill consequence? Well like I said it is

737
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:11,160
part of blood vessel walls normally, so this pathologic amyloid, these abnormal lengths of

738
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:18,760
A beta 40 and 42, yeah I mean those could be pulled out without consequence because they

739
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:24,520
shouldn't be there in the first place. So if you wanted to target the system you would not target

740
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:29,720
the creation of amyloid, you would probably target the enzymes that abnormally cleave.

741
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:39,400
Well that is one area that has been studied. The gamma secretase inhibitors for example

742
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:50,680
are ones that have been studied. There's the base inhibitors, these are things that are being

743
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:59,000
looked at because these are responsible for cleaving, but a lot of times those have had

744
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:04,840
side effects that we didn't really want. Yeah I wonder if has anybody looked at

745
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:09,480
something like an antisense oligonucleotide that goes straight after the enzyme in a laser

746
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:14,760
precision basically says you can't make this enzyme and you don't have to carpet bomb the

747
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:21,080
enzyme and everything around it, you're literally going after the transcription of the enzyme.

748
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:26,760
Yeah I honestly don't know, that's for the scientists.

749
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,320
I mean I'm sure somebody has thought of it and declined, I'm sure there's a reason that hasn't

750
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:35,800
been there. Yeah I mean the thing is sometimes they have thought of it or they've tried it but

751
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:44,040
then they don't realize what the downstream effects of doing so may be. And that's been a problem

752
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:50,760
with several of these medications, you know, where it's a great idea, you know, they've identified a

753
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:58,680
target, they've identified compounds that seek out that target but they cause liver toxicity

754
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:06,920
or they cause, you know, some other significant medical issue or they cause cardiac arrhythmias or

755
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:16,440
things that medically are not safe to continue. So the thing that surprised me Amanda when I

756
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:21,800
looked at the distribution of drugs, just again this is available on clinicaltrials.gov, is that

757
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:27,800
80% of the drugs are disease modifying drugs, which is a good sign of course because the other 20%,

758
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:33,800
as you said, are symptomatic. Now that's not the way the drugs are currently represented,

759
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:39,080
are there how many drugs, six approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease right now?

760
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:48,120
Well there's technically five, well yes there's six but one of them is a combination of two.

761
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:54,680
Two existing, right, right, okay. All of these are symptomatic drugs, right? We don't have a disease

762
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:59,560
modifying agent out there, we're going to obviously talk about Biogen in a moment

763
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:07,880
which is an important almost watershed moment in the field. So I assume that it's from your

764
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:14,280
standpoint a great sign that 80% of the pipeline is actually focusing on the underlying cause as

765
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:20,360
opposed to just the symptoms. Right and a lot of that has to do with what I mentioned earlier

766
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:28,680
with regard to that 2011 sort of major moment where we were allowed to redefine what Alzheimer's

767
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:36,920
is and our understanding that the amyloid pathology building up for many years is was

768
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:43,720
a key factor, you know I'm not saying it's a B factor, but it's a key factor in the development

769
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:52,680
of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. Now some of the disease modifying drugs that were initially tested

770
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:59,960
were tested in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and were negative, you know,

771
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:08,040
they did not seem to work or help and it may have been because targeting amyloid at that stage of

772
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:18,360
the disease may be too late to help people who already are significantly impaired. But that 2011

773
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:25,560
shift into understanding that there's MCI and that even before that preclinical Alzheimer's

774
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:33,240
allowed us to then design trials that are currently ongoing looking at both prevention

775
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:40,440
by amyloid removal before cognitive symptoms start and then also treating people with mild

776
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:46,760
cognitive impairment who do have some symptoms of memory loss but are not yet demented because

777
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:53,800
they're still functional on their day to day. What was the typical duration of those failed

778
01:30:53,800 --> 01:31:01,320
studies? So if you look at the earlier studies that were trying to remove amyloid late in the

779
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:06,280
game that failed, do you recall on average with the duration, are these like four year studies,

780
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:12,280
three year, five year studies? No, they were usually about 18 months. Wow, so really short. So

781
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:16,520
yeah, you could definitely make the case that that's again, just going back to the disease I

782
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:24,200
understand best. That's like saying we're going to take patients who, you know, have the most

783
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:32,440
aggressive form of cardiovascular disease. They've got multi vessel disease, huge stenosis,

784
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:40,280
you know, vulnerable plaque everywhere. And for 18 months, let's see what happens if we

785
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:46,440
employ lipid lowering therapy and we see that it has kind of a minor impact and you can make the

786
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:53,160
case. Well, you probably should have done it earlier and for longer. Right. And well, I mean,

787
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:59,400
the earlier is definitely key. I mean, I don't know that. So well, yes, for longer,

788
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,600
but not in that particular group, you know, there would not have been any

789
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,640
benefit, I don't think, to doing a three or four year study of that moderate, you know,

790
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:17,320
moderately demented group with these therapies because they were just going to keep getting worse.

791
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:23,000
You know, that's the thing they kept getting. They were their disease had was progressing. The

792
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:31,480
train had left the station and it was going to do what it was going to do. So, you know, traditionally

793
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:38,120
18 months has been a standard length for Alzheimer's trials because it's the amount of time,

794
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:50,040
you know, you have to remember these trials cost lots of money. You know, people often complain

795
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:55,800
and rightfully so that certain drugs are extremely expensive. And, you know, obviously you coming from

796
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:04,280
Canada have a whole different perspective on that than, you know, the American side of it,

797
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:11,000
you know, where it's just all about money all the time. That being said, you know,

798
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:19,160
there is some validity to the price of some of these drugs because of the vast amount of resources

799
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:24,680
that have been spent. You know, it takes on average, I read a statistic that, you know,

800
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:36,680
10 to 15 years and a billion dollars for any one drug to get from development and discovery to

801
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:42,840
FDA approval. That's right. It's probably it's probably higher today. Actually, it's probably

802
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:49,400
higher today. Actually, it's probably closer to about 1.3, 1.4 billion. And you're absolutely

803
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:58,760
correct. So if you look at that pipeline of 120 odd drugs, again, it's not going to be 120 billion

804
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:04,120
because some of them will get, you know, weeded out in phase one. But there's no question that

805
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:13,080
the United States subsidizes the rest of the world in drug pricing. So what if there's basically

806
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:20,040
an understanding quid pro quo in my mind that says, look, in exchange for having the best drugs

807
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:26,520
available first, you will pay a premium for the development of the drug. That's effectively what's

808
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,960
happening in the U.S. Yeah. And then it's also important to point out, though, that for every

809
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:40,520
one drug that makes it all the way through, there's literally four or five thousand that don't,

810
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:47,880
you know, some get squashed in the very beginning and some make it to animal models, you know, but,

811
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:57,880
you know, so so it's a very, very, very expensive process for the drug companies. And so

812
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:05,800
by going back to my point, you know, they have to find that sweet spot in terms of length of a trial

813
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:14,360
that will sort of be worth their investment, but at the same time not spend extra resources,

814
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:19,000
but also give the information that they need. And so knowing how Alzheimer's progresses,

815
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:25,000
particularly in that group, you know, 18 months is a spot where you're going to see, OK, so in 18

816
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:31,800
months, if they're better, well, that's crazy because that doesn't happen. If they're stable,

817
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:37,320
well, that's good because it's usually there's some drop off in that period of time. And if

818
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:43,160
they're worse, then clearly it's not working. Yeah. And if you if you look at the oncology

819
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:50,840
playbook here, you understand the challenge of this space, which is you have the same economics,

820
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:56,520
right, which is a billion to a billion and a half to get a drug from inception into a clinic.

821
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:05,720
And truthfully, you have kind of a gray area of utility, right? There are drugs that are

822
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:14,840
getting approved that make very little sense. So they extend median survival by two months

823
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:22,120
without extending overall survival. And they're going to cost one hundred thousand dollars and

824
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:25,880
we can debate the merits of that. And that's where you'll see differences between the U.S.,

825
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:31,800
the U.K., Canada, et cetera. Right. But you see, one of the issues here that I find most interesting

826
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,040
and I'm not familiar, I'm not as familiar with it in Alzheimer's disease, but I'm intimately

827
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:41,400
familiar with it in cardiovascular disease and in oncology is the importance of patient

828
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:48,440
selection and study design. It's everything. Right. So to me, let's use cardiovascular disease

829
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:54,760
in an example. I always found the Fourier trial and the Odyssey trial, which were the two major

830
01:36:54,760 --> 01:37:03,400
trials used to test the PCSK9 inhibitors. I found them to be very elegant and very complimentary.

831
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:08,440
So the Fourier trial took patients who were maximally statinized. These are patients that

832
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:13,640
had an LDL cholesterol that was typically south of 70 milligrams per deciliter or in about that

833
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:20,840
neighborhood. So these are people at the fifth percentile of LDL cholesterol and then added a

834
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:27,240
PCSK9 inhibitor to them. The study was stopped after two to three years. I believe it was

835
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:32,520
intended for four or five and it demonstrated an improvement. And again, in cardiovascular disease,

836
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:37,640
what are your outcomes? It's usually MACE, a major adverse cardiac event. So heart attack,

837
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:43,720
stroke, revascularization, death. So you have heart outcomes. That's an important thing,

838
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:48,440
right? They're not tracking. Nobody cares how much it lowers your cholesterol. The biomarker

839
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:54,200
means nothing anymore. It's only, does it prevent an outcome? You had a complimentary study in

840
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:59,080
Odyssey, which did not take heavily statinized patients, but patients who were, if I recall,

841
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:04,200
equally at risk. And again, it was major adverse cardiac event. And there's all, they usually

842
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:11,000
include all cause mortality. This is a challenge that I see in Alzheimer's diseases. And I'm, I'm

843
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,920
saying this not as an absolute challenge, just as a challenge to me as an outsider, I struggle to

844
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:23,240
understand these endpoints sometimes. And I just don't understand how valid they are. Not because

845
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:28,280
I think that the people measuring them are nefarious, but because they just seem very soft

846
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:35,080
and squishy at times, like, well, did the person cognitively get better? Maybe yes, no, I'm not sure.

847
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:41,000
And yeah, we use this test and it has a five point scoring system and we square the boxes and such and

848
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:48,920
such. But in the end, it's a harder disease to measure definitive outcomes in the, to your point,

849
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:55,080
at the duration of time we want to study them. So that's a lot to unpack. And, and I guess where

850
01:38:55,160 --> 01:39:00,280
I'm going with that is how do you think about, let's start with one element. How do you think

851
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:05,960
about patient selection? Who is the right patient to be studying? Where on that progress from

852
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:11,880
preclinical to MCI to disease? I think we've ruled out bucket three, right? I think we're,

853
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:18,680
if I've heard you earlier, it's we don't want to be studying patients for disease modification

854
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:24,680
that already have significant dementia. So are you, would you say the same is true of MCI and we

855
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:29,000
should be looking at the preclinical or what the, which means we by definition are making

856
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:36,120
an imaging diagnosis or is it early MCI? So I think, you know, the jury's still out with regard

857
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:47,080
to MCI. There still are a lot of trials and I think there may be opportunity for mild cognitive

858
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:53,480
impairment as well as mild dementia to benefit from these disease modifying therapies.

859
01:39:55,160 --> 01:40:00,280
You know, if we're looking at a cure, because that's what everybody wants, right? A cure.

860
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:05,800
I think the prevention trials are really going to be the way to go because then you're

861
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:14,920
stopping it before it starts. You know, we know that these anti-amyloid drugs

862
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:21,640
remove amyloid. We know this. They successfully reduce amyloid to a point where

863
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:26,600
people go from having positive amyloid pet to negative amyloid pet.

864
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:36,200
In fact, we had an occasion once where we had a patient who was in a trial, an anti-amyloid

865
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:41,880
trial for some time and then that study stopped and then she wanted to enroll in another study

866
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:49,480
and it was actually an anti-tau antibody and they did allow people with previous exposure to

867
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:54,920
anti-amyloid drugs after a certain window of time. Sometimes they don't.

868
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:02,440
So when she had her new amyloid pet for that study, she screen failed because she was amyloid

869
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:12,280
negative. And so, you know, that's been shown in numerous trials with more than one compound that

870
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:18,440
it definitely removes amyloid. So if you look at the pet outcomes for these drugs, they're great.

871
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,680
What are the clinical outcomes?

872
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:27,640
Yeah. Just like you said, nobody cares about a marker or cholesterol. You care about the

873
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:33,400
clinical outcomes and symptoms. And so none of that matters if you're removing amyloid,

874
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:37,800
if the people aren't any better or if they're continuing to get worse. You know, that's what

875
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:45,240
was happening with the mild to moderate group, you know, the original solenazumab trials.

876
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:51,400
You know, people just kept getting worse because they already had enough neurodegeneration and

877
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:56,920
other pathology now going on in the brain that whether the amyloid was there anymore didn't

878
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:06,600
matter. I do think in MCI that there's opportunity for these drugs to work and, you know, the

879
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:17,400
FDA is considering the adjucanumab data right now. There was just last or actually at the beginning

880
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:25,640
of this week data for Donanumab, which is a Lilly study that came out at the ADPD meeting showing

881
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:32,520
that it met endpoints on almost all of the primary and secondary outcome measures that they had set

882
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:40,920
forth. So, yeah, I wouldn't rule out the MCI group at this point. But in terms of sort of the ideal,

883
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:49,000
I think prevention ultimately is going to be the way to go as far as disease modification. And,

884
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,520
you know, just like you'll go to the doctor and see you have high cholesterol and intervene then

885
01:42:55,480 --> 01:43:01,560
before you get to these, you know, bad cardiac or stroke outcomes, you know, you'll go to the doctor

886
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:06,360
and perhaps have a test that shows you have amyloid and then intervene then so that you don't then

887
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:12,200
develop cognitive impairment. That's our hope and our goal. Yeah, that makes hands down the most

888
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:17,960
sense. And again, I'm obviously stating the obvious, but the more we can model this after a disease

889
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:23,320
where we've had unbelievable success like cardiovascular disease, rather than a disease

890
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:28,200
where we've had very little success, which is cancer, because we have to wait until you have

891
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:32,600
cancer. Now, of course, I think liquid biopsies are going to change that. And we are really on

892
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:37,240
the cusp of that. In fact, that's going to be a super exciting discussion we're going to have on

893
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:42,680
the podcast in the next, you know, couple of months. So the goal, of course, is to turn cancer

894
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:47,880
into cardiovascular disease instead to turn Alzheimer's disease into the same. So one of the

895
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:55,800
most promising versions of these monoclonal antibodies to amyloid is Atacanumab, which is

896
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:00,200
a drug manufactured by a company called Biogen. And it's been in the news a lot lately.

897
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,640
I think for several reasons. One is it's a drug that made it to phase three.

898
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:14,360
And it was running two parallel studies, Emerge and what was the other one called? Engage. Yeah.

899
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:22,840
And to my understanding, very little difference between them, obviously different sites and maybe

900
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:28,600
a slight difference in some dosing, but effectively the same trial, which is not uncommon for how a

901
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:34,040
drug like this would be tested in phase three because of the size that you need to have of the

902
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:41,800
number of participants you need, where I think it got interesting was how the results were

903
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:48,840
interpreted for the two arms and then what a reevaluation looked like. So do you want to

904
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:55,720
explain the story of, I guess let's start with the beginning. This was a well done study in that

905
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:00,040
it had, you know, pre-specified endpoints. And that's very important for people when they're

906
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:04,440
evaluating clinical trials. You have to pre-specify your primary endpoint. You got to call your shot

907
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:11,400
before you, you know, go to bat. Right. What was the endpoint in this study and how did they go

908
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:20,360
about evaluating? Honestly, I don't remember what the specific primary outcome measure was.

909
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:26,920
It was cognitive, but it wasn't like, it wasn't an imaging study. It was a cognitive study, right?

910
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:33,560
I don't remember if it was the 8S cog or not, to be perfectly honest. The story of

911
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:40,440
the Embark and Engage studies is, I'm sorry, the Emergent Engage. We're doing Embark now,

912
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:45,960
which is the follow-up for the people that had previously been in Emergent Engage.

913
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:55,480
So the bottom line is that the study was going along and at some point they do what's called

914
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:00,520
a futility analysis to see if it's worthwhile to continue spending their resources on

915
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:07,880
the drug or to abandon it. And when they did the futility analysis, they were not meeting

916
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:17,480
their primary endpoints. But after further analysis and looking at sort of a cohort of people who had

917
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:23,480
dose-escalated kind of in the interim, they realized that the people in the high-dose group

918
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:29,080
actually were meeting those endpoints. And so they went back and looked at all the data

919
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:36,280
and in a very unusual turn of events, they were like, actually, we were wrong and this is helping.

920
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:45,800
And so they ended up going back and putting people back in the study who had previously been on it

921
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:54,600
in this new Embark study, as well as submitting to the FDA for approval.

922
01:46:55,080 --> 01:47:00,760
And the numbers aren't necessarily relevant, but the highest dose, if I recall, was like 10

923
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:05,480
milligrams per kilogram. And there was also a stratification for APOE and non-APOE,

924
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:10,680
which I didn't understand because they were giving a lower dose to the APOE-4 carriers than

925
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:18,200
a higher dose. And are they currently just giving everybody the highest dose in the revisit trial?

926
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:22,520
I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about the current protocol.

927
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:23,000
Okay.

928
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
That's confidential or not.

929
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,440
But what's interesting is that there's something that's going to happen on June 7th. What is that?

930
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,440
What are we waiting for on June 7th?

931
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:36,760
Well, I just want to go back and touch on a point that you mentioned. One of the reasons that they

932
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:43,800
give the APOE-4 carriers a lower dose is because of the risk of ARIA or amyloid-related imaging

933
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:51,240
abnormalities. So we know that with these amyloid drugs that remove amyloid, we often will see

934
01:47:51,960 --> 01:48:00,440
changes in MRI, either edema or swelling or microhemorrhages. So RE for edema,

935
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:09,640
REH for hemorrhages, often asymptomatic. But certainly, we're very significant in some of the

936
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:17,240
earlier iterations of anti-amyloid drugs and drug trials that were going on. And there was a distinct

937
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:23,960
difference between the risk of ARIA and E4 carriers versus not. So that would have been the reason at

938
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:32,040
the beginning that they would have been on a lower dose. I believe, and I don't want to speak

939
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:38,120
incorrectly, but I do believe that subsequently they did fine with this trial. And I think that

940
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:44,280
they did fine with this drug that that was not happening. So they may have allowed the E4 carriers

941
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:49,560
to go to the higher dose. Yeah, there was a protocol amendment. They did amend the protocol

942
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:56,760
for E4 to go to 10 mgs per KIG. So June 7th. Yeah, what's going to happen? What are we waiting

943
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:03,640
for on June 7th? Everybody's anticipating. Yeah, so the FDA is supposed to render a decision about

944
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:10,680
whether they're going to approve this or not. And what did the advisory board say earlier in

945
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:18,360
the year? There were two different things. So there was one group that recommended approval,

946
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:22,760
and then there was another panel that was like, yeah, the data is not so compelling

947
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:31,720
and recommended not. So we really do not know which way the FDA is going to go.

948
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:45,000
There is a very large push on the part of families and patients who have gone without

949
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,480
any new treatment for this disease for almost 20 years to say, it's better than nothing. Please

950
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:57,960
approve it. I know, you know, from an advocacy standpoint, there's a lot of that going on.

951
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:05,640
Then there's some very strict science people who are saying, if the data doesn't support it,

952
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:10,840
don't do it. So we really have no idea which way they're going to go.

953
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:20,600
Let's assume the FDA concludes that there's insufficient data and they do not approve it.

954
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:25,480
Does anything prevent biogen from, aside from the destruction of shareholder value,

955
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:31,080
is anything preventing biogen from running another clinical trial at phase three to try to seek

956
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:37,400
approval with a better protocol that might be able to yield a better outcome?

957
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:45,160
No, there's nothing preventing that. Obviously, it's just a question of having the funds and

958
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:51,560
inclination to do so. But that's, I think you touched on a little bit earlier, part of the

959
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:58,040
problem that we have is that the outcomes, the primary outcome measures for these trials

960
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:07,320
aren't that great. These are sort of long standing, well established cognitive tests,

961
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:17,320
but how much they move in the right period of time may not be as good as we hope. The ones that

962
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:25,160
focus on the CDR, the clinical dementia rating, there is a subjective component to that because

963
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:31,400
that's not just a test, that is an interview and a rating that a rater makes based on

964
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:37,000
what both the patient says and what an informant says.

965
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,440
The CDR is the primary endpoint for this drug.

966
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:44,440
Okay, so and that's the thing. I mean, the CDR has...

967
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,720
I think it has six dimensions to it, but it's subjective, as you said.

968
01:51:50,520 --> 01:52:01,800
It is subjective and prone to bias from, let's say, a depressed caregiver who sees everything

969
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:09,720
worse than it is. There have been studies looking at that kind of thing and a lot of times,

970
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:16,360
a caregiver who is highly stressed and depressed will over report symptoms

971
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:25,240
leading to higher scores on the sum of boxes. So the CDR looks at memory, it looks at judgment,

972
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:32,520
it looks at home and hobbies and some other things. A rater will interview the subject,

973
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:36,600
well they'll interview the informant and then they'll interview the subject and

974
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:41,800
then they'll ask about recent events, tell me something you did last week, tell me something

975
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:49,640
you did in the last month. And then part of the rating is based on what the patient remembers

976
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:58,200
compared to what the informant said. And there is that sort of intangible part where if you're

977
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:02,360
kind of on the fence, you could go either way, even though there are very well-established

978
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:08,280
scoring parameters and hours of training videos and things on how to do the CDR,

979
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:16,840
there still is that sort of, eh, it feels like a one or it feels like a 0.5 that plays into it,

980
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:23,240
that's not just an objective measure like an LDL level.

981
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:31,880
That to me is the biggest challenge here is cancer progresses quickly enough and at least

982
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:36,920
currently we study it in a very clear sense. I mean, we can debate that there are actually

983
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:43,400
some limitations in how we study cancer progression and that's been, I think, gamified a little too

984
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:49,000
much. Cardiovascular disease we've already discussed. It seems that the best hope for

985
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:57,080
a disease in which subjective evaluation is so important is to have biomarkers that are

986
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:03,800
so predictive of clinical outcome that you can rely on those in combination potentially with

987
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:10,040
a clinical evaluation. I don't think we're, you're not gonna, you can't do a long enough study to get

988
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:17,880
hard outcomes. So, I mean, there's really two enormous challenges in drug development for

989
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:22,680
Alzheimer's disease. There's the technical challenge of how do you develop a good enough drug

990
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:25,720
and then there's the operational challenge of how do you actually study it.

991
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:33,240
And, you know, so going back to your question, you know, Biogen could very well go back and do

992
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:40,200
another study and use a different primary outcome measure, whether it's the ADAS-CoG or there is a

993
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:47,960
cognitive composite score that was recently used by ESI for a different trial. You know, they got

994
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:55,240
a lot of flack for it because people accuse them of kind of cherry picking things that

995
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:02,280
worked, but at the same time, as you also mentioned earlier, these were things that were

996
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:07,240
predefined. You know, it's not like they went and just chose the best things or the things that

997
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:14,280
showed change. They defined in the beginning that these are the measures that we're going to look

998
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:21,720
at and made this cognitive composite based on years and thousands of patients worth of data

999
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:28,920
showing what specific cognitive tests may be better predictors or may change more during a

1000
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:36,840
certain period than those that won't. So, you know, I personally didn't have a problem with that

1001
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:41,320
cognitive composite because I thought that it was a thoughtful way of kind of rethinking

1002
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:50,680
and getting good data that might be useful. You know, the ADAS-CoG is just so ingrained in this

1003
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:57,240
field and although it certainly has a lot of utility, it also has limitations. And so,

1004
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:05,560
finding some of these better objective primary outcome measures from a cognitive standpoint,

1005
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:10,760
in addition to the biomarkers, I think certainly will be useful for drugs moving forward.

1006
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:15,720
So, I want to kind of close our discussion, Amanda, with something you alluded to earlier, which is

1007
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:25,320
what does it mean to undergo healthy aging? It's inevitable. We're all aging. We're all

1008
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:31,800
going to die. And unfortunately, many of us are going to die with some form of cognitive

1009
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:41,080
impairment, even if it is not dementia. So, in your 20 years of practice, what wisdom have you

1010
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:47,240
gleaned and what might someone who is, you know, seemingly far from that learn?

1011
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:53,400
So, you know, it's interesting and I knew we were going to talk about this, so I've actually been,

1012
01:56:53,400 --> 01:57:00,200
you know, more contemplative in the last few days kind of thinking about it. You know, there are a

1013
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:05,800
lot of different frameworks for aging, you know, the stuff that we learned in psychology class and,

1014
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:12,680
you know, some of these classic structured approaches to aging, both psychological and

1015
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:21,400
sociological. But, you know, I've never wanted to kind of fit into one neat category. I like to kind

1016
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:27,480
of be eclectic and take a little bit of this and a little bit of that, you know. But at the end of

1017
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:33,960
the day, you know, it really has to do with, you know, how people see themselves, how people

1018
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:43,320
interact with the world, what kind of relationships they have, how able they are to let go of things

1019
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:54,840
that they've lost, and, you know, how able they are to focus on the positive. I think that's where I

1020
01:57:54,840 --> 01:58:03,000
see people struggle the most as a psychiatrist and people develop the most depression is when

1021
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,920
they spend so much time looking down the road at what's going to happen or what might happen

1022
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:17,000
that they can't enjoy now. And, you know, it's very interesting. I can have two patients,

1023
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:23,640
you know, maybe both of whom were marathon runners and now both have Parkinson's disease.

1024
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:35,400
And while they both have disability, one of them sort of centers their whole identity around this

1025
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:41,000
new disability and focuses on the fact, well, I used to be able to do this, I used to be able to do

1026
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:49,240
that. Now I can't do this, I can't do that. Whereas the other one is like, well, okay, so I can't run

1027
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:57,320
anymore, or I might fall if I go to the beach, but I can still enjoy the sunset in a special

1028
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:04,120
wheelchair, or, you know, focusing on what I still can do and trying to make the most of each day.

1029
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:11,480
And those are the people that I think age successfully even in the face of having illness.

1030
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:17,480
You know, we all will age, we all have

1031
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:27,960
changes in our physical strength and our, you know, mental alertness and, you know, acuity,

1032
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:36,360
but it doesn't necessarily disable us. And even if it does, the key for me really is how

1033
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:42,200
that shapes our attitude or how much we let it affect our attitude.

1034
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:53,160
I want to run an idea by you and I'm curious as to your thoughts. I describe health span or quality

1035
01:59:53,160 --> 02:00:00,120
of life as having broadly three dimensions, a physical one, a cognitive one and an emotional one.

1036
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:07,800
And I think it's safe to say that as sure as God made little green apples, the first two decline

1037
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:14,520
with age. Now, if you're really lucky, they don't decline too, too much, assuming you live a long

1038
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:18,280
life, right? So if you talk about someone who's going to live into their nineties, there's a

1039
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:25,400
physical decline that is undeniable. Even if you are fortunate to be spared dementia, there is a

1040
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:31,000
cognitive decline, but not it doesn't have to be that sharp. And for the lucky ones you do here,

1041
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:36,360
you know, you got the Charlie Munger's of the world who are literally in their nineties and appear to

1042
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:42,760
be just as sharp as ever. But the one that doesn't appear to have an age component to it is the

1043
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:50,360
emotional one. And so the question I've been pondering is are the most miserable people going

1044
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:57,800
to be the people whose identity is wrapped up in the things that inevitably decline? And therefore,

1045
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:05,800
should we be putting more of our identity in the one thing that really has no tie to age, which is

1046
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:12,760
basically our emotional health, which I believe is most a function of the quality of our relationship.

1047
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:19,880
So a person who has wonderful quality relationships is generally an emotionally healthy person.

1048
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:23,720
And that doesn't mean it's a person who doesn't get sad and a person who doesn't get angry and a

1049
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:29,640
person that doesn't struggle, but, you know, they have an emotional strength to them that I think

1050
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:35,480
comes from this tethering to other people. So does that framework make sense?

1051
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:45,560
Absolutely. I think it's spot on and exactly true. You know, that is so important in terms of,

1052
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:56,200
you know, well-being is having people feeling loved, feeling that there are people you can rely on,

1053
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:01,640
feeling that there are people who can share experiences with you. You know, social isolation

1054
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:11,160
is a huge problem for some people and a definite determinant of quality of life versus not.

1055
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:18,120
I definitely see that people that struggle the most are the ones that are constantly

1056
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:26,520
comparing themselves to their former selves. You know, I used to be able to do this. I used to be

1057
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:33,160
able to do that. I used to, you know, if I did that, I would just be, you know, hiding under my

1058
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:39,640
covers. I mean, I didn't used to need these, but I do. So it's like, well, I might as well buy

1059
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:47,240
cute ones because you got to have them, you know. And so it's so hard though, Amanda. Like I,

1060
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:55,640
you know, I think about it like we're about the same age and it's true. We've already experienced

1061
02:02:55,640 --> 02:03:04,040
a decline, but it's going to get steeper, right? Like it's when you look at what it means to be

1062
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:15,400
90 for most people, at least it's going to be a far greater loss over the previous two decades

1063
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:19,560
than maybe we've experienced in the previous two decades. There's a real non-linearity to it, but

1064
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:25,560
I guess it's as good a time as any to begin rehearsing that. And I've been very deliberate

1065
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:31,560
about this for the past two to three years in anticipation of hopefully a long life,

1066
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:36,440
which, because, you know, look, I think there was a day when all of my identity was wrapped up

1067
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:43,400
in these things that are inevitably going to decline and none of it was wrapped up in the other.

1068
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:51,000
And I'm undergoing an asset reallocation, which I guess the point is we should be doing this when

1069
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:59,000
we still have a chance to. No, you're absolutely right. And that actually is a great point,

1070
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:04,680
not just doing the asset reallocation, but just doing things when you still have a chance. You

1071
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:13,720
know, one of the things I, you know, I, as we were talking earlier, another big thing that I think

1072
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:19,960
contributes to quality of life and you sort of, whether people age well or not is regret and how

1073
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:27,720
much regret they live with. And so very often I see people who come in and, you know, have worked

1074
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:35,320
really hard throughout their lives and put off this and put off that. And we're just about to

1075
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:43,400
retire and do XYZ. And then now, well, now I have this devastating disease. And so, you know, part of

1076
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:48,120
what I do is educating them. Well, you can still do XYZ. You just might have to do it a little bit

1077
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:56,280
differently. But it also, I mean, personally has affected me. You know, my happy place is the beach.

1078
02:04:56,280 --> 02:05:03,000
I love the beach. I have dreamed my whole life of being able to see, you know, the horizon from my bed.

1079
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:11,320
And so, you know, as soon as we were able to afford it, we got, you know, a condo at the beach. It was

1080
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:18,920
old, built in 1972 and, you know, quite frankly hideous at the time when we got hit. But

1081
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:25,960
it meant that I could wake up and see the Gulf of Mexico. And, you know, we, especially through

1082
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:31,240
the pandemic, we've gone there almost every weekend just because what else are you going to do?

1083
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:36,120
And, you know, but that's something I learned from my patients. You know, don't wait. Don't wait until

1084
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:41,400
I retire to get that beach condo because I might not be able to use it. You know, I'm living now,

1085
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:49,640
so do it now. And that's, you know, A, something I've learned and B, something I really try to

1086
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:55,480
impart to these people that are coming in that sort of feel like that's a hard stop. Like, oh,

1087
02:05:55,480 --> 02:06:00,760
I can't do this now because of this diagnosis. And it's like, well, no, you still can. You just

1088
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:07,080
have to be a little more careful or you can still take that cruise, but just where, you know, I

1089
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:10,920
actually, anytime I go to a meeting, I haven't been to a meeting in, you know, a year and a half, but,

1090
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:18,200
you know, I save all of my name tag, you know, lanyard things and I give them out to people.

1091
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:23,320
I say, here, take this on your cruise and just put your room number or cabin number or whatever in it

1092
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:28,200
and your cell phone number. So if, you know, your loved one wanders off on a ship,

1093
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:34,280
at least they can call you or they can find out what cabin you're in. And so it's making those

1094
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:40,600
adjustments, but still, you know, doing the things that you enjoy with the people you enjoy doing it

1095
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:48,200
with. I think that's incredibly well said, Amanda. You know, I've really enjoyed our discussion today.

1096
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:54,120
And I know that everyone listening to this has as well, because I just think people are becoming

1097
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:59,400
more and more aware of this condition. And as you said, it's less taboo. It's something that

1098
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:06,920
people are talking about. And I do believe that people are cautiously optimistic that the next

1099
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:11,720
decade looks better than the last decade in terms of actual medical treatments we have.

1100
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:17,720
I'm still firmly in the camp of Richard, which is not to say that you're not saying that,

1101
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:24,360
that says, look, prevention is the best medicine for chronic disease, be it cardiovascular disease,

1102
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:30,040
cancer or Alzheimer's disease. But inevitably, a number of us are going to slip through the

1103
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:36,600
fingers and the grasp of prevention and are going to need treatments. And I'm hopeful that these

1104
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:41,720
monoclonal antibodies that can target amyloid beta or tau can be a step in the right direction.

1105
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,720
So thanks very much for all of your insights today.

1106
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:48,040
Oh, my pleasure. And of course, exercise.

1107
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,800
You don't need to tell this audience.

1108
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:59,000
No, I know. That's what I'm saying. Even if you've passed the point of prevention,

1109
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:05,080
you know, and I know you've gotten into this in other podcasts, but, you know, the data,

1110
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:10,840
the growing body of data shows that even in people who have cognitive impairment or have

1111
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:16,360
full-blown dementia, aerobic activity can actually improve scores on cognitive testing.

1112
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:25,560
You know, some of the research that some of our colleagues do through all of these prevention

1113
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:33,640
trials and then through these intervention trials in MCI and AD, Silver Sneakers Program at the YMCA,

1114
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:43,880
Laura Baker at Wake Forest is doing a lot of great stuff with this and showing that even if you have

1115
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:52,280
dementia, your scores will go up if you do aerobic exercise. So I'm glad you said that's what gets me

1116
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:59,240
going in the afternoon. All right, Amanda. Well, thanks so much. And I hope you get to see the
