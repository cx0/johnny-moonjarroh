Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,720
today's episode. My guest this week is Dr. James O'Keefe. James is a cardiologist and medical

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,200
director of the Charles and Barbara Duboque Cardio Health and Wellness Center at St. Luke's

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Mid-American Heart Institute, an enormous practice of more than 60 cardiologists in the middle of

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,880
this lovely country. He is also a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri,

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,840
Kansas City. James has authored best selling cardiovascular books for health professionals,

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,680
including The Complete Guide to EKGs, Dyslipidemia Essentials, and Diabetes Essentials. James

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,880
has also co-authored with his wife, Joan, the best selling consumer health book, The Forever

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,640
Young Diet and Lifestyle. He is actively involved in patient care and research and has published

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,960
numerous peer reviewed articles, which honestly, I feel like I'm reading at least one every couple

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,240
of weeks. I came across James for the first time about nine or 10 years ago when I heard him speak

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,960
at a conference and frankly, what he had to talk about just threw me back on my heels. And since

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,760
that time, of course, we've become friends and James is in many ways a mentor to me with all

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,040
things that pertain to preventative cardiology. In this episode, we talk about a lot of things,

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,440
starting with his background and how he made the pivot from going into interventional cardiology

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,960
to now this much broader area of preventative cardiology. We get into some really detailed,

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,760
but very accessible physiology of what the heart does, how it works, and therefore how it's

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,280
susceptible to disease. And then we kind of launch into some of the things I wanted to get to. I

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,760
wanted to talk about the impact of exercise on the heart, both positive and negative. We go into

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,760
that in exceptional detail. We get into the role of nutrition and specific nutrients such as sodium,

28
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,040
magnesium, et cetera. And then we round the discussion out with a sort of tour de force

29
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,440
discussion of many of the pharmacologic agents that some of you have probably heard of. And

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,400
frankly, even this discussion taught me quite a bit and actually invigorated my knowledge for

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,880
this space. So I always enjoy talking with James and I suspect you will all enjoy this episode very

32
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,800
much. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. James O'Keefe.

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:21,800
James, thanks so much for sitting down with me today, albeit not in the same physical location,

34
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,040
which is always a shame. The last time we were in the same location, you swung by my office in

35
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,960
New York, I remember. It was probably about three years ago and you were kind enough to bring a

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,280
recent manuscript you just published about the impact of exercise on heart disease. And we had

37
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,160
a lovely discussion. I don't think we had the time for a meal that day because it was an impromptu

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,080
visit, but I never imagined it would be almost three years before we'd be doing our podcast,

39
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,920
which is something that from the moment I started a podcast, I knew I wanted to sit down and talk

40
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,000
with you. You're also just an incredibly gracious guy who's always sending me stuff. And so I consider

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,320
you one of those people in as my sort of constant educators. So this is going to be an exciting

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,560
episode because I'm going to be learning a lot. And I know that anybody who cares about heart

43
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,240
disease is going to be learning a lot. And I don't know how you cannot care about heart disease if

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,920
you care about longevity. Yeah, it's the heart of the matter for sure. And yeah, I think we

45
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,360
all instinctively understand how important the heart is to our health. And I might say in the

46
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,160
spirit of educating each other, I love your podcast. I think it is easily my favorite podcast. I love

47
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,440
the way you dig down into the science and really get to the heart of the matter without overhyping

48
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,280
things. And I just think you're doing a wonderful public service for improving the health of the

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,200
population. And the other thing I'm really impressed at because a lot of my fellows and

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,600
residents and kids will talk to me about what they heard on Peter Attia. So your audience is

51
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,000
a particularly, if I might say, tuned in intelligentsia, interested in health and

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,280
well-being. And I think you have a really curated, remarkable audience.

53
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:13,400
Thank you for that. You and I first met probably 11 years ago, I think. I heard you speaking at a

54
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,520
conference and it kind of blew my mind. You won't remember this because it's obviously a topic you've

55
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,320
been speaking about a lot. But as the listener, when it's the first time I heard about it, it was

56
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:35,000
kind of a gut punch. So it was probably 2011. And at that time I was still a wannabe professional

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,600
athlete. So even though I was into my late 30s, I still pretended that I was a professional

58
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,240
something or other swimmer, cyclist, incredibly high volumes of training, incredible intensity

59
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,000
of training. I actually did the math for somebody yesterday. And I think I was probably on my bike

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,960
at least, I don't know, 20 to 23 hours a week with a third of that being at or above threshold.

61
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,080
And you presented data basically suggesting that that was harmful potentially. And then I may have

62
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,120
actually gone too far and I may have actually set myself up for cardiac injury later in life.

63
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,240
So with that as a teaser, I now want to take a step way back and talk about your journey to

64
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,400
that among many other topics that interest you. You trained as a cardiologist and just for people

65
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,480
who don't understand what that means, that means after medical school you went and did internal

66
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,800
medicine and after internal medicine, you then train in cardiology. And then you went one step

67
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,240
further and said, look, I want to do interventional cardiology. Can you tell people what

68
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,240
interventional cardiology is? Yeah. So that's using procedures to fix the heart, whether it's

69
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,560
putting stents in the corner arteries or putting in pacemakers. These days it's expanded to fixing

70
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,640
the valves. The technology is just absolutely spectacular these days. We can put in valves.

71
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,720
It's become our default way of replacing a valve now is through the artery. So it's a really cool

72
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,960
field. At the time I went, I trained at the Mayo Clinic for internal medicine and cardiology,

73
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,240
and then went down to Kansas City at the Mid-American Heart Institute in 1988 to work

74
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,520
with Jeffrey Hartzler, who was the world's expert in interventional cardiology. He invented

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,760
infarct angioplasty, that is somebody who's having a heart attack. He had the sort of huts to go in,

76
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,400
do an angiogram, figure out which vessel was blocked, open it up with a balloon,

77
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,400
and suddenly the pain goes away. At the time it was radical. This is 1980, and he took a lot of

78
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,600
heat for that nationally at the meetings. But it turned out to be a game-changing therapy,

79
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:56,360
announced it's the standard across the world for treating angioplasty. So I went there and worked

80
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,880
with him and started off my career. And maybe I'll back up saying, I'm like you. I love exercise.

81
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:08,760
It's how I calm myself down, turn myself up, whatever. I mean, it's just always, my kids say

82
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,640
it's how I've been self-medicating my hyperactivity all my life. And there's probably some truth to

83
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,080
that. And it turns out that exercise, it's good for ADHD. Never had trouble focusing. But certainly

84
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,400
exercise, since I was a little kid, is just my mother used to, her mantra to us was up in the

85
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,680
prairie up in Northern North Dakota near Canada. She said, you kids, go outside and play. Go to

86
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,720
school. Play with your friends outside. And so that was kind of what I did growing up. And I got

87
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,840
into basketball and running cross-country in high school when I was just fascinated by heart. So I

88
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,320
figured out I wanted to be a cardiologist when I was 13 or 14, just because I was fascinated

89
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,080
with the heart. So back to, you know, through my cardiology training and then doing interventional

90
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,200
cardiology. And I did it for about a year or two. And then I realized, this is back in the night,

91
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,160
then we're only doing balloon angioposties. So we balloon these dialed, you know, dilate these

92
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,640
vessels up in elective people who are having angina. And then they'd be back in six months or

93
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,560
a year with more blockages. And just don't, I mean, this is not the ideal way to treat coronary

94
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,840
disease. This is a systemic disease. It's highly modifiable. We just need to, you know, focus

95
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,000
double down on prevention. And this was just when, you know, prevention was blossoming, you know,

96
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,160
statins came along in 86. And, you know, we're, you know, the beta blockers and now, I mean,

97
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,640
it's discontinued to blossom. So that coronary disease these days, even though it's the leading

98
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,080
killer in America, should be an entirely preventable, medically managed disease. Unless you have an MI,

99
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,200
you don't need to be going in having procedures. Stands in electively, you know, we have the tools.

100
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,640
And so it's also just the more enlightened approach. I mean, it doesn't pay well, you know,

101
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,680
you don't get paid for prevention, but it is the logical way to approach disease, whether you're

102
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,040
a physician, or just a person out there who's trying to live a happy, long, fully functional

103
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,880
life. I mean, you want to be thinking proactively. And it is so effective. We know what works now.

104
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,600
But you know, we just have to kind of get people's attention and get them to change their habits

105
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,520
lots of times. There's a lot in there, James. So let's kind of go back and hash some of it out. So

106
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,560
the first thing you noted was that in its earliest renditions as a specialty, interventional

107
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,240
cardiology basically had one tool, which was balloon angioplasty. And so as you explained,

108
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,040
you're putting a very small catheter. Can you tell somebody how large a coronary artery is just

109
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,360
to give them some scale? So let's take the left main artery coming right off the aorta.

110
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,400
Right before it bifurcates into the LED in the CERC, right at that widow maker location,

111
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,200
which is named appropriately, how many millimeters is that in a normal, healthy 40 or 50 year old?

112
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,760
So that's typically about four millimeters, four or five millimeters in the left main coronary,

113
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,320
you know, so not quite half a centimeter, which is a third of an inch.

114
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,640
Yeah. So we're talking tiny, tiny little, little, little things.

115
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,760
Yeah. It's even smaller than that. It's, it's, it's probably even

116
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:25,000
because an inch is 25.4 millimeters for context. So it's a four is obviously less than a quarter

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
of that. You put a little catheter that's obviously smaller than that into said vessel,

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,840
and that catheter is complicated enough in that it has a built in balloon that the operator

119
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,400
outside the body can control with a syringe by inflating it or deflating it as needed with saline.

120
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,600
So it's a really brute force method, isn't it? To sort of force open something that's narrowing.

121
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,840
And of course at the time you weren't leaving anything behind. So the best you could do was

122
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,240
get in there, inject saline back and forth, basically use the hydraulic pressure of that

123
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,160
to try to force open what was going on. And then you, you left. Now years later,

124
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,320
obviously interventional cardiologists could leave behind something called stents.

125
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,320
So little flexible metallic things that would spring open and stay open. And then there's been

126
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,160
an entire evolution of that. So folks who are interested, I had a great discussion on this

127
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,560
topic with Ethan Weiss. If you're interested, check that podcast out. I don't recall which

128
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,720
episode number it was, but if you just search Ethan Weiss's name, it'll, it'll come up.

129
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,480
And we go through the history of this a little bit, but more importantly, something you alluded to,

130
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,760
which is kind of what the literature tells us about it, which is outside of a few settings,

131
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,640
one of them being someone who is actively having a heart attack. Even today, it's not clear there's

132
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,160
an overwhelming benefit to putting these stents in people. There's certainly a lot of economic

133
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,280
benefit to certain parties, but there is not an enormous clinical benefit outside of, you know,

134
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,520
acute MI and we can bifurcate into which types of MI, et cetera. But, you know, for someone who

135
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,680
shows up asymptomatically with a blockage, I don't think there's a single shred of benefit unless

136
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,280
something has changed in the literature in the last few months that I was unaware of. Is that still

137
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,960
true? That's absolutely true. We think of this and it's very logical, which is why it's been

138
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,280
one of the many reasons why this has been so difficult to extinguish this flawed paradigm,

139
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,440
that this is a plumbing issue. You have blockages in your arteries. Well, duh, you get rid of the

140
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,760
clock. That's simple. So we've been working on that flawed paradigm for 40 years now. And you're

141
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,560
right, as logical as that is, it doesn't really turn out to be true. If you have an acute coronary

142
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,280
syndrome, but the way to think about atherosclerosis is kind of like the zits we get when we're

143
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:03,720
teenagers, and we get these pustules filled with oxidized triglycerides and LDL cholesterol,

144
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,800
then then attract the monocytes and the macrophages that elute these inflammatory markers and they

145
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,840
thin out the collagen overlying the zit and it ruptures and, you know, and it drains and heals.

146
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,160
If it's a particularly bad zit, you end up with an acne scar for the rest of your life. That same

147
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,200
thing happens in your arteries underneath the skin of the artery, the inside skin, which is the

148
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:33,880
endothelium. You form these zits, these pustules filled with nasty gallowish and flame, and these

149
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,520
get hot, they rupture. And instead of just draining, they attract thrombi because they think

150
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:46,040
there's a rent hole in the vessel. So a thrombus forms, platelets and fibrinogen. And over time,

151
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,560
you know, it heals if you're lucky enough. And mostly, most of the time you are, this happens

152
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,200
time and time again through decades before it gets to the point where one ruptures and then

153
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,640
completely closes it off. But in the meanwhile, every time you get one of those inflamed zits,

154
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,560
the ruptures, you get the growth factor, stimulate the growth of the smooth muscle and the collagen.

155
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,760
And if it's a really bad zit, you know, eventually you'll calcify. And those are

156
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:18,520
fossil evidence of previous badly inflamed zits, if you will. So this is like really

157
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,880
everyday common stuff, but we know how to prevent it. But going in with a balloon and

158
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,440
addressing one little area, and by the way, tearing it up even worse, it works if you're

159
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,720
having a heart attack. But most of the times we can regress those plaques. We can melt the

160
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,240
inflammation out of there with a lot of things we could talk about diet, lifestyle and exercise,

161
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,840
keeping the lipids down, the triglycerides down. And we can't make the acne scars go away. They're

162
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,800
there forever once you have those calcium deposits. But we can pretty much make the risk

163
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,640
go away. And that's why prevention is just so effective and so instrumental.

164
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,080
Well, again, I think you said a lot there. And I want to go back because first of all,

165
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,160
I love that analogy. I've never thought of using acne as an analogy. And I think that's actually

166
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,280
a more accessible analogy than the ones that I use. So I think with everybody listening to this,

167
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,480
I'm going to declare that I'm going to start plagiarizing that. I hope you don't mind.

168
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,960
What I find interesting, and I think it's important for patients to understand this,

169
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:25,400
is the complicated biology of both the oxidative piece, the inflammatory piece,

170
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,920
and how they feed off each other. And it is a bit of an irony, isn't it? That the body is actually

171
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:38,200
trying to repair something. The immune cells, when those monocytes get recruited to the site

172
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,080
of endothelial injury, and obviously when they translocate through the endothelium and become

173
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,200
macrophages and start doing everything that you just described, which leads to this creation of

174
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:54,840
thrombus, we would normally welcome that response elsewhere in our body. If you were out in the

175
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,520
field and you got cut, that's exactly what you would want to happen. You would want the immune

176
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,440
cells to show up there to make sure there are no bacteria. And then you would want those thromboph

177
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,280
cells to come and prevent you from bleeding. And so the problem is all of that stuff is happening

178
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,400
in an area where you don't have a lot of real estate. You've got a few millimeters, and that's

179
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,480
why it can obviously lead to this enormous problem. The other thing you said that I think is,

180
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,360
it just can't be overstated, is the understanding of what calcification means in that context.

181
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:37,320
I had a patient I saw this week who, after some hesitation, finally agreed to have a calcium scan.

182
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,600
He had very elevated lipids for a number of years, but they seemed to elevate more in the

183
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,640
previous few years. He had been quite resistant to any medical management of that, and frankly,

184
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,520
his other factors are really good. So this is a guy who eats very well, who exercises very well,

185
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,680
is metabolically very healthy. So when he got the calcium score, you know, it was about 100 and

186
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,440
change, placing him between about the 75th and 90th percentile for age, located in three vessels.

187
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,240
He was visibly alarmed, right? He said, this is really bad. And, you know, the stenoses in each

188
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,160
of these by calcification were, you know, in the ballpark of 30 to 50%. And what I tried, and I

189
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:28,200
don't know if I explained it successfully enough to him, was, look, the 30 to 50% stenosis you have

190
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,920
in that vessel is not the issue. That's a huge warning sign of what has been going on over the

191
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:42,680
past decade. It's telling us that now is the time to act and add other agents to our toolkit for how

192
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:50,440
we're going to prevent myocardial death. The analogy I use is it's like having bars on the window of a

193
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,520
home. You know, it doesn't tell you that there's a break-in that's about to happen. It tells you

194
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,720
that you live in a very bad neighborhood and there's probably a break-in that took place at

195
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,800
some point. Yeah, it's a great way to put it. And also I'm glad that, and I know from our previous

196
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,800
conversations that you're a fan of the calcium score, we call it cardio scan. We charge $50

197
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,880
for it. We use modern CT, high speed CT scans that give these really great pictures of the

198
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:25,720
coronaries with a minimal dose of radiation. So men over age 40, women over age 60, I call it like

199
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,440
the mammogram for the heart. I mean, everybody should have one really because you can have a lot

200
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,440
of risk factors for like, say lung cancer. You might be a smoker in a family history and this,

201
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:41,000
that, the next thing. But if we do a scan and see that you're growing a tumor, that's a whole

202
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,520
different deal. And that's the way this is, as you point out, there's a lot of people who have high

203
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,760
cholesterol and high blood pressure, bad family history, just a frightening array of risk factors.

204
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,400
You do a calcium score on them and it's zero. And you say, well, we've gotten through 53 years of

205
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,640
life without making any hard plaque. So we're not going to like, we maybe don't need to use a statin

206
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,120
on you. Maybe we don't, maybe we can tolerate and it seems like you're doing fine. On the other hand,

207
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,680
there's a lot of people who have relatively minor risk factors that are growing plaque. And,

208
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,840
and let's be clear, your coronaries should be soft and supple and smooth like they were,

209
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,400
like when you're a baby, when you're a teenager, there's no calcium in the coronaries normally.

210
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,000
And you see people, I think the record I've seen is 13,500 per calcium score. I mean,

211
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,120
I often show the residents like we put the Houndsfield area of interest over the left main

212
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:41,560
of the LAD and it'll be 800, 900, then you go to their spine and it's 600, 700, their arteries

213
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,720
are more bony than their bones. That's not a good thing. What is the youngest person,

214
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,040
James, that you've seen a legitimate spec of calcium in? So something that's not an

215
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,960
artifact of a score of one or something, but where there's actual calcification.

216
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,800
Yeah, late teens, but that's really unusual. In the twenties, you start seeing it. And I might say

217
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,360
that family history, when people come in, like the patient you described, they come in and say,

218
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,280
well, why do I have this? I'm doing everything right. They said, well, you probably have a bad

219
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,520
family history, right? Yeah. Yeah. I just said, well, if you weren't doing everything right,

220
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,680
if you were a smoker, you'd probably already have had a heart attack. So some of this is

221
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,160
non-modifiable, but more and more, I mean, this is a highly modifiable process.

222
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,440
Gosh, I almost don't know where to start, but I now feel like I want to start talking about some

223
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,240
of the exercise stuff. So I want to come back to cardiovascular disease prevention because there's

224
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,000
so much I want to talk with you about with respect to glycemic control, hyperinsulinemia,

225
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,320
other agents that we should be thinking about beyond just lipid lowering agents. And we can

226
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,920
dip into that, but I want to talk specifically about one of my favorite classes of drugs,

227
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:58,680
SGLT2 inhibitors. But before we do that, let's go back to circa 2011. James O'Keefe is up on stage

228
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:06,440
and he puts this graph up of a J-shaped mortality curve of exercise. And by the way, at this point,

229
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,560
Peter Attia sitting in the audience has probably just finished a four hour bike ride and he's

230
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:18,280
proud of the fact that he kept his heart rate above 172 for half of that time. Can you walk people

231
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,320
through basically, not that you remember that exact talk, but basically the thesis?

232
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:33,240
It's a reverse J curve actually, because if exercise were a drug, it would be the best drug

233
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,840
we have for preventing heart disease. I mean, for that matter, for preventing dementia, preventing

234
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,360
osteoporosis, depression, diabetes, obesity, I mean, it is a wonder drug if it were a drug.

235
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,200
But like with any drug, you got to get the dose right. Say you're using Carvedilol, one of my

236
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,520
favorite drugs, and you give somebody who has a fib or recent infarct or high blood pressure,

237
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,720
give them Carvedilol, but it's one milligram. You don't get any benefit. On the other hand,

238
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:14,360
you give them 120 milligrams twice a day. So if you give them 100 milligrams twice a day of Carvedilol,

239
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,120
it's a disaster. I mean, their blubbers are going to be low. They'll feel terrible.

240
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,240
Right. They'd have a hard time getting up off the couch.

241
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,640
Exactly. Right. So it's kind of the same thing with exercise. And amazingly, the dose of exercise

242
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,680
to get benefit is really small. I mean, most 50% of Americans do no exercise. If they just got off

243
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:41,240
the couch and went for a walk, a brisk walk, 15 minutes a day, they would get like a 30% reduction

244
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,720
in serious cardiovascular disease, 15 minutes a day. Now, ideally, we say 150 minutes a week

245
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:55,400
is sort of a lower limit benefit. But the point is that early steep limb of the survival

246
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:04,040
perversive exercise dose falls steeply. Your benefit goes down 30, 40, 50%. But then for the

247
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,040
last uptick, the people doing the most extreme doses of exercise, you start to lose some benefit.

248
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,640
And it's probably upwards of a third of the benefit. So people argue, well, I mean, no sense

249
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,960
scaring people off of exercise. I mean, it's just sort of an encouragement to not exercise,

250
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,400
knowing that if you overdo it, you could make yourself worse. And, and, and to be clear,

251
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,160
it's only like 2.5% of Americans are probably overdoing exercise versus at least 50% who are

252
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,920
underdoing exercise. But still, it's a bit like just because 50 to well, 70% of Americans are

253
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,400
overweight or obese. And it's like saying, well, we don't really want to talk about the dangers of

254
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,920
anorexia, because then, you know, we're kind of, we're sort of discouraged people from not eating

255
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,920
as much minutes, the mirror image of this. But the point is, you can overdo exercise. And, you know,

256
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,360
it might be interesting, as just an example, I know that you swam the Catalina channel,

257
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,360
like 15 years ago, right? Yeah. And I mean, that's pretty amazing feat. So when you're sitting here

258
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:15,720
talking to me, and your heart is beating probably about 45 beats a minute, and pumping out about

259
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:23,080
five leaves a minute of blood, when you're doing high intensity intervals, or when you're swimming

260
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,360
across the Catalina channel, you know, I mean, fast rate, I mean, you did that 20 miles in like

261
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,360
12 and a half, I mean, 10, 10 and a half hours. So actually, I think cycling is a is an even more

262
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:41,160
amazing place to show that because actually, for the channel, I would probably a there's something

263
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,520
about swimming where you're horizontal, I think your heart rate, for very short distances can

264
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,480
obviously climb like crazy, but I find on the bike, you would get the highest heart rate. So for me,

265
00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:00,440
the maximum area under the curve heart rate was a one hour time trial. So so like a 40 kilometer

266
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:09,480
time trial would be absolutely maximum heart rate. How fast would it be going? I have a slow heart

267
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:17,880
rate all around. So my max might my my heart rate would be about 172 for for that type of a race.

268
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,200
An hour. Well, take less than an hour, probably. Yes, exactly. It would take about 50,

269
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,560
56 minutes, 55 minutes, maybe. No, that's a perfect example, because it's not only

270
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,000
high heart rate, but it's exercising under a load. It's like rowing. You know, this is your

271
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,560
your your using big muscles, you know, your blood pressure is also probably 200.

272
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,480
Your system pressure, your pulmonary pressure is probably 80, 60, 70, 80. Let's give people

273
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,920
symmetrics of normal. So for obviously, doctors listening to this will know what we're talking

274
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,080
about. But let's take a step back. So let's say my blood pressure is I have pretty normal blood

275
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:58,280
pressure. I'm probably about a 115 over 75 is my normal blood pressure. Can you tell people what

276
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,360
that means, by the way? What do those numbers mean when you have blood pressure checked?

277
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,800
You know, this is just the pressure that is exerted to pump the five liters of blood around

278
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,000
your around your circuit every minute. It takes that pressure to, you know, that's the normal

279
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,280
pressure to just kind of get that blood squirting around there. And then it comes back at only like

280
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,080
two or three or four more meters of mercury up from the legs. And that's that's a more

281
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,280
difficult physics problem, right? Because you're overcoming gravity at low pressures, which is why

282
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,760
it's good not to be obese. It's good to be exercising because those muscles milk the

283
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,280
blood back through the veins, through the through the valves up to the heart.

284
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,880
And those two numbers, of course, referred to as systolic and diastolic. The systolic is when the

285
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,280
heart is squeezing. So during the squeeze of the left ventricle, the pressure at the tip of the,

286
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,800
basically in the aorta is 115 millimeters of mercury. Now, anybody who's ever mucked around

287
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,600
with a pressure transducer will actually be surprised at how much pressure that is. That's

288
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,120
a non-trivial amount of pressure. If you've had the luxury of operating on people, you know what

289
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,880
115, even a normal 115 millimeters of mercury is, that'll squirt across the room. Across the room.

290
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:17,640
But the 75 refers to the relaxation phase of the heart. It says even when the heart is relaxed

291
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,400
and in the, what we call diastolic phase, receiving its blood supply, there's still quite a bit of

292
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,840
pressure in there. 75 millimeters of mercury in my case. Because your vessels are nice and elastic.

293
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,200
So, you know, as it receives the bolus of blood, everything expands. And then when the aorta valve

294
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,280
shuts, then those vessels, they rebound a little bit and they keep the, take the sort of pulsatile

295
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,600
bolus flow and turn it to more of a laminar, less bolus flow. So that elasticity of the vessels are

296
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,360
super important. Now you talked about my pulmonary pressures. What are my pulmonary pressures sitting

297
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,920
here right now? And I'll, I'll confess to you, I have no pulmonary disease, though I've never had

298
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,080
a swan GANS catheter placed in me. So what would you assume my pulmonary pressures are?

299
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,960
Oh, they'd be low, you know, like 20, 25 over 15, something like that. Nice and low. Okay. So

300
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,800
basically that's the same exercise, but now you're in my pulmonary arteries instead of my systemic

301
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,800
arteries. Let's just assert to me that my heart rate's 45 beats per minute. And you said my

302
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:27,880
cardiac output is five liters per minute. So that means every minute my heart sends five liters of

303
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:35,320
blood around my body. So I love that you brought up cardiac output because I think that's the

304
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,680
variable most people are sort of failing to appreciate how much that has to improve. So

305
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,200
when a weekend warrior like me would try to do his best one hour time trial, or when the best

306
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,000
cyclist in the world or the best runner in the world is, you know, doing their most exerted thing,

307
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,000
what's the variability or the range in cardiac output that we can see from best in the world

308
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,080
to sort of weekend warrior to average conditioned person? Just by way of context, if you look down

309
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,280
at your hand and make a fist, that's about how big your heart is. This is an amazing pump.

310
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,800
So five quarts a minute, I think if you were squeezing a bowl, five quarts a minute, five

311
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,640
liters per minute, five liters per minute, it never stops. And you're a good heart should have

312
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:32,680
about three or four billion beats in it without ever stopping. Okay, it's about a billion beats

313
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:38,680
every 30 years, which is for a math geek like you, it's kind of fun to think about, you know,

314
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,240
think about designing a lifestyle and exercise program to sort of minimize the number of heart

315
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,640
beats per year. Okay, and it does involve exercise, but it doesn't involve, you know,

316
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,920
it doesn't involve perculean efforts of protracted exercise. All right, but a good athlete like you,

317
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:01,960
an exceptional athlete like you, you go out and do that time trial, that one hour time trial at 175

318
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,600
beats a minute under load for an hour, you're pumping like 30 or 35 liters a minute.

319
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,840
Think about that, you know, 10 gallons a minute, you know, like Lance Armstrong and those, you know,

320
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,520
the professional cyclists or cross country skiers will get up to 40, 40 liters per minute.

321
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,840
You mistakenly referred to me as an exceptional athlete, which even at the time I wasn't.

322
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,560
But yeah, when you do talk about the exceptional, when you talk about Lance Armstrong riding up

323
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:38,360
Alpe d'Huez in 38 minutes, and it doesn't matter that he was on EPO, it really doesn't change the

324
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,240
metrics of this 40 liters per minute of cardiac output. You know, to put this in perspective,

325
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,960
James, I just love this so much, because the only times I've ever measured cardiac output

326
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,720
are in patients in an ICU. I mean, I can't count the number of times I've put a catheter into

327
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,760
somebody's lungs to measure and their heart to measure their cardiac output. But it's always

328
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,440
been in the setting of a patient under critical care. And in that setting, it would be routine

329
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:16,040
to see two and three liters of cardiac output per minute. And that's with every drug under the sun

330
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,360
used to squeeze their heart. And to think that you and I have the luxury of sitting here without a

331
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,400
single drug to increase the contractility of our heart, and we're at five liters per minute.

332
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,080
And even a couple of old guys like us could probably go out and exercise and still hit

333
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,360
25 liters per minute, but that the best in the world can hit 40 liters per minute. Now,

334
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:46,200
let's do some math. To get to that volume, flow rate, really, their heart rate isn't making up

335
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,480
the whole gap, because cardiac output is a product of two variables, the heart rate and the stroke

336
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,000
volume. Can you sort of explain how those play together? Well, rather, stroke volume is, you

337
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
know, your heart's a pump. And so, you know, in between beats, it fills. So how big it can

338
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,200
accommodate, how much volume it can accommodate with each beat is an important factor. And I

339
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,720
remember Miguel in the rain had some studies done years ago, and his heart was basically twice

340
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,040
normal size. So you get the heart rate up, the volume goes up, your arterioles and venules dilate

341
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,400
up so that the resistance goes down. And the heart is actually not just a pump, but it like it rings

342
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,920
out the blood, it shortens and twists. And when it's going fast and you're exercising, it's basically

343
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,040
sucking blood out of the lungs and the venous system into this and pumping out as fast as

344
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:45,480
it can. I mean, it's just an elegant, astoundingly well-designed system when it's used right. And

345
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,800
of course, that's one of the beauties of exercise. You know, you can feel that from, as you get into

346
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,000
shape, you can just feel yourself being more capable of this. And it's just intoxicating,

347
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,880
and it's one of the beauties why people get addicted to exercise. But the point is,

348
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:07,480
to get back to the underlying concept is that you can imagine when you're going that hard

349
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,040
and your blood pressure's up and your pulmonary pressure's up and you're doing 25 liters a minute,

350
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,280
the soft, pliable chambers in the heart, that's the atria, the right and left atria, and the right

351
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,640
ventricle, they get distended, they stretch out. Let's pause on that so people see why, James,

352
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:30,200
because if my cardiac output, which is the dot product of heart rate and stroke volume,

353
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,360
meaning if one goes up by two-fold, the other can go down by half and they'd stay the same,

354
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:43,480
but if the whole thing has to go up by 6x and my heart rate's only going up by 3x,

355
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:52,040
because 45 to 170 is about 3x, you have to bring the other one up by 2x. So how do you take up

356
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,560
stroke volume that much? Well, part of it is what you just said. You can squeeze harder, you can

357
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,320
twist, you can get every last dropout, but there's no getting around what you're just

358
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,280
about to explain to people, which is you have to make that chamber a heck of a lot bigger.

359
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,680
Right. And we're designed for this through nature. We're designed to be very active creatures, but

360
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,560
most of the time, if you look at tribes in the wild, they're doing like 16 or 18,000 steps a day,

361
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,760
but most of that is out of sort of a comfortable walking pace. Lots of times they're carrying

362
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:33,960
things or they might be lifting, chopping, swimming, whatever, building, and occasionally,

363
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,720
critical times in the hunt or whatever, they might be sprinting, although the younger members

364
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,240
in the tribe would be assigned that task because they're faster runners, but we're not really

365
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,600
designed to do what you did when you were doing these, like you still do, do these really long

366
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:57,880
bike rides. The chambers are marathons, ultramarathons, the chambers dilate up, and we have

367
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,760
enough circulating buffers in our bloodstream because this is like an engine, like an exercising

368
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,440
muscle used as fuel, glucose, fatty acids, ketones, to create energy, but it throws off exhaust.

369
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,560
And when you're exercising that hard, it throws off a lot of exhaust in the form of free radicals.

370
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,320
We have a lot of circulating buffers in there to basically neutralize those free radicals,

371
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:29,960
but we deplete that after 45 to 50 minutes of high intensity exercise. And there's good animal

372
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,160
studies showing and human studies showing that diastolic function improves for the first 30

373
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,160
minutes of exercise, and by 50 minutes or 60 minutes, it starts to worsen, and the endothelial

374
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,280
function will start to worsen too. After you've depleted those antioxidants after 45 or 50 minutes,

375
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,480
you start searing inside of your vessels, those endothelial, those sensitive endothelial

376
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,200
linings with high free radical levels. And you also start overtaxing the heart muscle.

377
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,960
And I'm not saying it's not a big deal, especially when you're young. Youth is, when we're young,

378
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,680
we're so resilient that you can get away with doing this stuff when you're 15 or 20 or 25 or 30

379
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:15,640
or 35, and maybe even 40 or 45. But after 45, it starts more likely taking a toll. You start seeing

380
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:24,360
troponins will rise, and NT Pro-MP will rise after really, really strong efforts like Amerifond.

381
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,320
Tell folks what those markers mean, because anybody who's been to an ER with chest pain

382
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,800
will know what a troponin is or has taken their grandmother into the ER with heart failure. But

383
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,520
for most people, they might not know what those are and why

384
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,000
seeing an elevation in those post-exercise should cause us to pause.

385
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,760
Yeah, so troponin is one of the proteins that is unique to the heart. And it leaks out of the heart

386
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,800
and gets into the bloodstream when there's been some heart damage. We usually associate it with,

387
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,760
like you say, heart attacks, where the artery closes off and the muscle is stored for oxygen,

388
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:05,000
and it dies downstream in that unless there's good collateral. So that really raises our eyebrows

389
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,120
and gets us into action when we see an elevated troponin. But a lot of people, I mean, upwards

390
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,880
of half or more people after a marathon will have an elevated troponin. It's just the best at that

391
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,960
high level, 25, 30 liters a minute for two and a half, three, four hours. It starts overstretching

392
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,160
the muscles in the atria and the right ventricle particularly, and it leaks into the bloodstream.

393
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,520
And again, tell people if you want to run a marathon, fine, run one or two, but don't make

394
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,600
it. It's like climbing Mount Everest. If you want to do that, do it once, but don't do it

395
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,720
three times a year. You could do it, brag about it and all that. But you got to move on to healthier

396
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:50,360
forms of exercise because these really, especially after age 40 or 45, really protracted exercise

397
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,960
will cause this small little micro damage, like overstretching and tearing because the high

398
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,880
levels of catacolamines and high levels of free radicals that are now unbuffered. And so if you're

399
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,400
designing, like I like to talk about, training for longevity is very different than training

400
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,640
for peak exercise and a car buff like you can understand that. It's like if you're going to

401
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,640
build a Formula One car to go fast, powerful, the most impressive performance machine ever,

402
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,080
it's going to look and perform a certain way. And it's good at that, but it's not going to go 500,000

403
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:29,240
miles. So it's built for power and speed and performance now. Like a car that's going to go

404
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,920
500,000 miles, I don't know, it might be a Honda Accord that you're driving never more than 70 miles

405
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,480
an hour and maintaining it really well. And so the point is that you have to really focus on what

406
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,880
your goals are. And our goals as an athlete is different than our goals for longevity and health

407
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,400
and wellbeing. You know, I love that analogy and I appreciate you using it for me because you know

408
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:00,440
how much I do love cars. In fact, I actually think I made that comment to a patient this week

409
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,040
using a Formula One car as the reference, because as you pointed out, James, these are cars that are

410
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:14,600
built for each race effectively. They'll go through three engines in a season. So everything about that

411
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:20,840
is meant to extract the absolute maximum performance. Again, I want to reiterate what you said.

412
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:29,640
If your goal is to win the Ironman triathlon, nothing we're saying here should pertain to you.

413
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,080
We're not going to tell you how to train for that. That is a remarkable feat. I mean, when I

414
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:43,240
think about what it would take to go seven hours in that heat to do what's involved in an Ironman,

415
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,720
I can't fathom that. There's never a time in my life when I've even approached the level of

416
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,720
raw performance that the winner of Ironman is going to take, or frankly, even somebody who

417
00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:00,360
comes in under 10 hours. But swimming the Catalina Channel in the Dohrk, in 10 and a half hours,

418
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:07,400
that is also a pretty remarkable feat that's way beyond what a normal person is anywhere capable

419
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,520
of doing. Yeah, perhaps. I've never had to do all three at once. So when I was growing up, I was a

420
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,360
good runner. Good is maybe a stretch. I was a decent long, long, long distance runner. When I

421
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,160
was swimming channels, I could swim for long distances. And then when I could time trial,

422
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,640
like a time trial, but there's something about the Ironman or triathletes that can do all of

423
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,520
those things simultaneously. That's always impressed me. But my point is you're bringing

424
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,640
up the important distinction here, which is at some point an individual has to decide which master

425
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,600
they're serving. Are they serving the performance master or are they serving the longevity master?

426
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,280
And I think everybody goes through a difficult transition here. And I see this struggle with

427
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,960
many of my patients, especially the former, you know, exceptional athletes, or frankly,

428
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,240
not even people who were themselves exceptional athletes, but people who have also become,

429
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,040
I don't know how to describe it, but they found a new sense of purpose through some of their

430
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,160
athletic endeavors. And they've done their first marathon and they've thought, Oh my God,

431
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,920
this is really a great thing to do because there was a purpose. There was a goal. There was a

432
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,120
training plan. There was a camaraderie that came through that I got to do the thing. And now I

433
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,280
want to do it again and again and again and again. And they've made a lot of friends doing it too.

434
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:29,320
And it's a bonding experience and there's a lot good about that. But I'll just interject my

435
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,360
transitions because I've played basketball, you know, competitively in varsity and high school

436
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,240
and college and then for the first two years of college anyway. And then because I felt that

437
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,080
exercise was so important to me, I made this mental note when I stopped playing varsity

438
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,240
basketball that I would exercise pretty much every day because I knew it made me happy and healthy.

439
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:53,160
So then I kind of got into running then triathlons and I did short, you know,

440
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,480
like short distance sprint triathlons, but I hammered it. I mean, it trained really hard

441
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,560
and especially during my thirties up until my mid forties. And I was pretty good, you know,

442
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,360
winning like sprint distances, you know, and local races and stuff like that. But it was just

443
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,720
the fun of the competition and the friends and all that. But then I started noticing when I'd go out

444
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,840
and also in the back of my mind, being a cardiologist, you know, sort of thinking,

445
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,760
being proud and happy that, you know, that I'm capable of doing this, you know, in my in middle

446
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,600
age. But then I started noticing like when I go on really hard rides and do those hard intervals,

447
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,720
after I have this sort of vague sense of like aching in my chest. And sometimes I feel some

448
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,680
like I'm one of those people, maybe you are to a lot of people who are athletic, you can feel like

449
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,000
if I stop right now and be quiet, I could count my pulse just just feeling every heartbeat. And I

450
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,320
could feel some at the B some PVCs and some PCs or two or three runs in a row of PCs or as

451
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,000
superventricular tech cardio. And I thought, you know, my heart is not happy about this, you know,

452
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,920
and it disturbed me a little bit. And I kind of checked the cardio scan had a little bit of

453
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,600
calcium 21. But then I started thought about it, I thought, you know, this is makes no sense. I mean,

454
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,680
I'm thinking that if some exercise is good, and moderate exercise is better, that extreme exercise

455
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:15,480
is the best. There's nothing in biology like that, where the far extreme, it's usually moderation,

456
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,600
and especially moderation in the context of what we are evolutionarily designed to do. And what I

457
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:28,360
was doing for a 45 year old was out of bounds with respect to what, you know, my body was expecting.

458
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,600
And so I started looking into this and talking to some of my friends and colleagues from around

459
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,240
well, my practice and around the world, really, Peter Schnoor and Copenhagen putting together

460
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,320
some databases, and showing that in fact, and this is there in plain sight all the time, by the way,

461
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,840
path and Margaret, one of the godfathers of the exercise movement in his study in the New Moon

462
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,360
Journal of Medicine, pointing out in these Harvard alums that exercise improved longevity, like eight

463
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:00,520
to 10 years. But in the in the extreme deciles, it's just a small group of people who were doing

464
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:07,320
the most exercise per week actually lost like 38% of the benefit conferred by the less extreme

465
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,400
effort. And, and then Ken Cooper, another one of the sort of founding fathers of the modern aerobics

466
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,960
movement down in Dallas used to say, if you're running more than 15 miles a week, you're doing

467
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,440
for some other reason besides health. So they recognized and even Hippocrates 2500 years ago

468
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,200
said, if we could prescribe the right dose of exercise and nutrition, not too little, not too

469
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,480
much is the safest way to health. I mean, so this has been there right along that, you know, even

470
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,840
back 2500 years ago, they, they recognize that it's not going to be centered, but you can overdo it,

471
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,960
you can kill yourself with too much exercise. Let's go back to what you were talking about

472
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:52,920
with respect to PVCs. Explain to folks what's actually happening with a PVC, because I think

473
00:45:52,920 --> 00:46:00,440
this for me became the area when I, where I started to pay attention. Just to be clear,

474
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:10,280
James, it took me three years to fully embrace this message. It was not until 2014 that I finally

475
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:15,320
realized I needed to get into one camp and I couldn't serve two masters and my higher priority

476
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:22,760
was going to be my longevity. And that meant I was not going to do these crushing workouts anymore.

477
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,280
My workouts were going to be geared towards what makes me live longer.

478
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:34,920
And the data that I found most convincing were the electrophysiologic data. So it was looking at

479
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:42,680
athletes, the incidents of atrial fibrillation in cyclists and runners who were at or above a

480
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:50,440
certain volume versus normal age matched controls. And yes, that's full of all the same problems and

481
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:56,200
pitfalls that epidemiology was full of. But when the magnitude was so big, it was difficult to

482
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,160
ignore. And if I recall the magnitude was in the ballpark of about seven X. In other words,

483
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,520
if you took, you know, retired professional cyclists and you compared them to aged matched

484
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,640
controls and match them in any way possible, these professional cyclists were seven times

485
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,040
more likely to have atrial fibrillation. Does that, is my memory serving me correctly or am

486
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,920
I out to lunch on that? No, that's, that's almost spot on. But also I point out that,

487
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,880
you know, the heart is very capable of healing itself almost always. And so it's really these

488
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,960
high volume athletes, high volume, high intensity athletes who continue to do it. All right. Past,

489
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,800
you know, like in the middle age and beyond are the ones I see these people all the time,

490
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,800
because I've written about this a lot. I see patients all the time come in with a fib and it's

491
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:48,520
like 700% increased incidence of a fifth, which is a really common part of the rhythm, where the

492
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,640
atrial, where the rhythm arises, becomes disorganized and chaotic. And so it, it just

493
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,440
scoots through the AV node to into the conduction system down to the bottom, working part of the

494
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,080
heart rapidly and irregularly. And it's becoming more common all the time in America, because

495
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:11,160
it's common among older people, obesity, diabetes, sleep apnea, tall people, too much alcohol can

496
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,600
cause it. But one of the causes that we see is in people who are overdoing high intensity exercise.

497
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,640
So yeah, you're right on there.

498
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:23,720
I cut you off or rambled too long in my question, but tell people what a PVC is and why,

499
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,200
and is that an early warning sign?

500
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,440
The high catecholamine levels from protracted exercise and the high oxidative stress and the

501
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,080
stretched chamber causes some tearing of the myocardial fibers with protracted exercise. And

502
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,520
over time, that can cause little micro islands of fibrosis in the myocardial scar tissue.

503
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,120
And so if you keep doing this like year after year, a decade after decade, you start ending up with

504
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:58,360
this stiff dilated chambers, which then is the electrical milieu that is favorable for

505
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,880
creating these rhythm problems at first things like PVCs, but eventually can can lead to VT.

506
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:10,040
But again, and a fib is much more common still, but these are signs that your heart's irritable.

507
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,680
Your heart's been irritated by something. And in this case, it's too much exercise.

508
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,800
So let's talk about perhaps one of the more sad, publicly known examples of that, which you've

509
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:27,640
spoken about publicly, which is the sudden death of Micah True. Tell folks a little bit about who

510
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:33,400
he is and what a remarkable specimen he was and what conclusions you drew from his death.

511
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,040
Yeah, so he's sort of the poster boy for the thing, you know, that you really kind of

512
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:45,400
an extreme example. So Micah True was a remarkable endurance runner. The book,

513
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:51,560
Born to Run, was written about him. And he was kind of a hippie who sort of dropped out of society

514
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:57,640
and decided to just become a runner. We went down to northern Mexico and ran with this tribe that

515
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:03,880
has its runners in it, the Tarahumara Indians. And he would run just remarkable distances and

516
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:10,520
became sort of like an example of any of this. He was in his 40s or 50s when this happened, but

517
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:16,440
he was out for a run and he died suddenly. And they did an autopsy on him and he found

518
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,280
this, you know, dilated scarred up heart, just what we're describing, you know, the scarring

519
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,440
and the atria and the ventricles, especially the right ventricle, interventricular septum.

520
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,800
But the point is that he was really fit. He accomplished a lot of really impressive things,

521
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:36,760
but it did take a toll on his heart. And now granted, he was doing just superhuman volumes.

522
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,840
I mean, he would typically run 12 miles a day, as I recall, and lots of times would do these

523
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,280
50 or 100 mile races through the desert heat and things like that. But yeah, I'm not a big fan of

524
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,760
these extreme, and there's more, I have a friend who did the seven marathons in seven days on seven

525
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,360
continents race, Megan. You know, she's a really, she's a good friend, known her for a long time.

526
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,400
She was one of the best triathletes in America when she was doing that 10 years ago. And now

527
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,320
she still exercises a lot, although she's kind of cut back on it. But if you measured what's going

528
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:16,200
on with her heart during those times, it's, I mean, it's not pretty. It's like the heart suffers when

529
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:22,600
we really, really overdo it. Of course, all of these data that we look at the inverted J curve,

530
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,480
a lot of the Harvard prospective study, even though they're prospective, they're still epidemiologic.

531
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:34,520
A critic of this would say, look, we don't have any randomized data, experimental human randomized

532
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:41,080
data to tell us that the dose curve to exercise is nonlinear. Again, what that means is linear means

533
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:45,720
the more you do, the better you get. You're proposing the more you do, the better you get

534
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,520
to a point. And then it actually goes down. Hence the inverted or upside down J. What about

535
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,840
animal models? Are there appropriate animal models that can be studied here? If so, what have they

536
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,960
shown? Yeah, the animal models, most have done with mice, but a few with dogs have been pretty

537
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,040
much consistent with this, that you do see these elevations of a troponin acutely. And if you keep,

538
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,160
keep them going for months or a year or two, you can see these dilated chambers, the, with the

539
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,600
substrate for arrhythmias. And if you look at the epidemiological data in our last paper that we

540
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:22,280
just published, it's called training for longevity, we put all the major 10 big epidemiologic studies

541
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:27,240
and all but two of them showed this very distinct reverse J curve so that you get this deep

542
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,440
reduction in mortality that plateaus off in the middle. And at the very end, the fish hooks up.

543
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,880
It's like diet in that. So you're not going to be able to prove it because these are lifelong

544
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,280
kind of patterns that, that emerge and it's impossible to randomize people to it. But,

545
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,480
you know, there's a lot to be said for the end of one. You know, you're paying close attention

546
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:53,640
to your body. I can tell you for me as a cardiologist and also just as an athlete and a

547
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,560
person, it was very apparent to me that if I didn't change this, it was not good for my heart.

548
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:05,560
And let's just talk for a moment about the best kind of exercise. If you just stop talking about

549
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,800
volume and intensity, but just talk about like the best kinds of exercise because this, this friend

550
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:15,800
of mine, Peter Schnorr and Jacob Marat, he's a, he's a brilliant PhD from Denmark, from Copenhagen.

551
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:21,560
Peter Schnorr founded the Copenhagen city heart study. This is 10,000 Danes that they enrolled

552
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:27,800
25 to 40 years ago and focus kind of like the Framingham study was in America for diet and

553
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,160
lifestyle. This was like the Framingham study for exercise. They, they sort of collected a lot of

554
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:39,240
data about what people were doing for exercise and then followed them through the decades. And,

555
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,360
you know, the people in Copenhagen, I think it's the city in the world that has the largest number

556
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,640
of people who bike to work. I mean, it's just, it's a flat city. They have these, these, these kind

557
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,920
of really generous bike lanes and it's just really fun to watch how people bike to work, but they do

558
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:01,480
a lot of other things. And so they collected data on eight or nine specific sports, including running,

559
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,760
swimming, cycling, health club activities, which included treadmill and all those station

560
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,680
exercise machines with weight that put all that together. And then there was tennis, badminton,

561
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,320
soccer, golf, I think were the ones. And so we sat down, we'd done some other analysis,

562
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,960
this data showing that it was the moderate dose runners that did the best for longevity

563
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,320
during the four decades long follow-up of that. But this was a more, this was a different look

564
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,520
and so we said, what sport is best for conferring longevity? And so, you know,

565
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,080
they did all the multivariable analysis for, because, you know, tennis players are different than,

566
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:46,760
than maybe cyclists or whatever, but quantitative how much exercise per week. And maybe, you know,

567
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,240
this data, but, but what do you think? I know it just shocked me. I went over there to, to

568
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,880
finally look at the data and we were sitting on a coffee table one Sunday afternoon, having a glass

569
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,640
one and talking it over and he sort of reveals this data to me and I look at it, you know,

570
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:08,120
it's multivariable, just data. And I was really like speechless. I was just, it just, I just thought,

571
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:13,560
oh, what a waste we spent all this time and this is nonsense. So, so what do you think came out

572
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,920
as the least effective way for improving longevity compared to say sedentary population?

573
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,640
I've read this, so I'll let you disclose both the best and the worst to people.

574
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:30,120
Okay. So the worst was health club activities and the best was tennis followed closely by

575
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:37,000
badminton, soccer, golf, and the middle three were like cycling, swimming, running. And that was like

576
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,080
three to four years out of life expectancy. Health club activities is only one and a half year

577
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:47,720
life expectancy added and, and those social sports, badminton, tennis, golf. I mean,

578
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:53,320
it's easy to imagine soccer, but we're like six to 10 years added life expectancy multivariable.

579
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,720
And I just thought, well, it's not even a sense of publishing this, but then I started looking at

580
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,400
and thinking, wait, what if, what if it's not so much about what hammers your body into peak

581
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:09,160
fitness as well as what sort of reduces stress, makes you happy, something you can do lifelong

582
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:15,000
and sort of fosters personal relationships? Because there's a lot of studies in recent

583
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,080
decades, one by Juliana Holt, Lonested that said that single best predictor better than smoking

584
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:28,040
or diabetes or exercise or blood pressure, lipids for conferring longevity with strong social support.

585
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,960
You know, relationships are the key and you could instinctively would understand that,

586
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,200
but then I started thinking, well, you know, particularly for us sort of like emotionally

587
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:44,120
challenged gender, you know, males, it's like we make friends at work and we have our family, but

588
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:51,400
lots of times we bond by playing. And when you think about these, the sports that were done

589
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,400
playing were the ones that conferred best longevity and they're also the ones that sort of promote

590
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:04,280
more social activity. So I think we need to change our mind around about what best exercise is not

591
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,000
about if you're training for longevity, yeah, take it down a couple of notches, but also make sure

592
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:15,320
that you have some play in your life. We played as kids. We need to be playing as adults even more

593
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,440
because it's so important not only for social bonding, for stress relief or at the press,

594
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,880
I mean, I just think it's so important. Yeah, I think my reading of that was basically,

595
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:32,760
look, there are a lot of variables that can't be teased out of any multivariate analysis or

596
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:38,120
correction, but a couple of things stuck out to me. One was, I think you're right. I think

597
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,360
what tennis and golf, badminton, soccer offered that running, cycling, and swimming didn't to the

598
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:52,760
same extent on average, not globally, but on average, is you got to combine two medicines instead of one.

599
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,120
And you know better than me that two drugs are often much better than one to control blood

600
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:04,440
pressure. So when you got to combine exercise with social interaction, it does better than

601
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,840
just exercise. That's sort of the first thing I take away from that. The second thing I take away

602
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,880
from it frankly is the challenge of doing any sort of large-scale study where you don't have

603
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:19,480
a close ability to understand the intervention. And I'm very fortunate that I have a gym at home,

604
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,760
so I don't work out in gyms anymore. But from the days when I used to work out in gyms,

605
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,040
I realized that if we were going to treat everybody in that gym as one cohort of everybody who goes

606
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:36,520
to the quote health club, we would glean very little because the difference between what people

607
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:44,120
did in that gym is so enormous that the average of that borders on meaningless, just as the average

608
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:50,200
of what any group of individuals does is effectively meaningless because there is no ability to control

609
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,400
for it. So those are the two things that I took from that. Now I do want to go back to kind of

610
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,880
something you said because I look, I think there were going to be a lot of people who listened to

611
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,880
this who are going to be exercising more than what you put forth. I think you said earlier something

612
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,720
to the effect of, look, 15 miles a week of running is probably adequate if you're, if running is

613
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,800
something you enjoy doing. You probably don't need to be running more than 15 miles a week.

614
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,720
I'll tell you this right now, my wife runs a hell of a lot more than 15 miles per week.

615
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:28,840
So here's my argument to her to run less. It's, and I use economic terms called opportunity cost.

616
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,280
It's like, look, Jill, I know you want to run 50 miles a week, and I know if you had all the time

617
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:39,800
in the world, you'd run 50 miles a week, but it comes at the cost of you doing not a single other

618
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:48,280
form of exercise. No strength training, no rowing, no this, no that. So really the argument is,

619
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,800
and this was the argument for me in cycling as well, which was, look, one, you just, you're tired

620
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,640
of spending all this time training when you, you have kids that are getting older and older and you

621
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,680
have more kids and it's, there's just a cost to being away from that. But, but it really comes

622
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:09,560
down to how can you be a more balanced athlete for life? So maybe not a better athlete in a very

623
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:15,160
specific sport because cycling's a very specific sport. Running's a very specific sport. If you

624
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,320
want to be very good at those things, by definition, you're not going to be very good at much else.

625
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:26,520
But life is a pretty complicated sport and it requires strength, stability, aerobic fitness,

626
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:33,400
and anaerobic fitness. Yeah, flexibility, I mean all of these things. So you have to be able to

627
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,080
train all of those things and unless you're retired, I'm not sure how you'd want to run more

628
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,960
than 15 miles a week if you have to be able to put effort into those other things. So for me,

629
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:51,640
that is the prescriptive takeaway here is how do you have a portfolio approach to exercise?

630
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,280
What is your prescriptive approach to patients that I just sort of laid out in mind?

631
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:02,200
Well, yeah, you're right on as usual. If you're spending a lot of times running,

632
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:10,040
I know a lot of patients who run or cycle like a lot, I mean 30, 40, 50 miles a week of running

633
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:18,120
like an hour or two a day of cycling, it's like you're, yeah, you're getting your aerobic fitness

634
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:24,200
really high, but it's not great for your skeleton or your balance. I mean, I tell people

635
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:31,240
just after 30 or 45 minutes of aerobic exercise, if you want to do more, circle back home and

636
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:37,240
do some yoga, do some weights, these things that kind of don't necessarily tax your heart the same

637
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:44,360
way that the other high intensity sports do or sexual activity, if nothing else, is exercise that

638
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:51,400
again is a totally different realm that is worth investing time and energy into and also,

639
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:57,640
it's for relationship building. And so yeah, I think that it's a matter of being more balanced.

640
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,840
And also if you try to figure out the area under the curve for maximizing your heartbeats,

641
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:09,080
you want to do stuff that keeps your resting pulse low, but some high intensity intervals to keep

642
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,920
your maximal rate, your maximal capabilities high, that'll develop fitness quicker than anything,

643
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,760
some high intensity interval training in a relatively short period of time. But it's the

644
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:27,320
sort of thing that high volumes of really high intensity exercise is just not, I just don't think

645
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:32,840
it's the ideal approach to fitness. Either as a podcast I did with Inigo San Milan where we talk

646
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:39,320
very specifically and in great detail about zone two, zone two being defined as this area where

647
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:47,240
you have the maximum efficiency of the mitochondria. So you're able to keep lactate systemically below

648
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:53,240
two millimole and just barely keep it there, right? So you're sort of maximum utilization of glucose

649
01:02:53,240 --> 01:03:01,480
and fatty acid that is mitochondrial without undergoing non-oxphos. For most people, that's

650
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:08,520
a lower level of activity than they're used to. If you do popular classes, if you hop on a Peloton

651
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:14,280
class or something, you're spending very little amount of time in that zone. But you're also

652
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:20,520
spending very little amount of time at peak capacity sort of north of kind of zone five.

653
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:25,080
You're spending a lot of time in the middle. And I actually think it's that in the middle time

654
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:30,280
that unless you're an athlete who competes in the middle is actually some of the least important

655
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:37,240
areas to be training. A lot of the data looking at even world-class athletes says it's 80 percent

656
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:44,760
low intensity, 20 percent high intensity. Of course their total volume is enormous, but I think they

657
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:52,040
even have the ratio right. And yet I think most people don't have that ratio correct and they

658
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:56,760
don't appreciate how important it is to do that low end aerobic, which depending on your fitness

659
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:03,480
might just be brisk walking. If you're a little fitter, it might be again zone two level of

660
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:09,800
fitness. One of the things as a cardiologist people are always asking me, so what should my

661
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,440
heart rate be? What's my training zone and a lot kind of stuff? And for most people I tell them,

662
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:21,560
do you know, I wouldn't pay much attention to your heart rate. I mean, except for the fact that I love

663
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,880
activity trackers and that they could track the pulse and stuff, but I think the most important

664
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,600
parameters about pulse are what you're resting pulses. We want to get that nice and low. We want

665
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,680
heart rate variability. We want that to be more variable when you take slow deep breaths, which

666
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:41,480
is why meditation or yoga is a really good thing to add to somebody's fitness regimen. But with

667
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:46,200
respect to trying to, you know, get your heart rate maxed out, it's like there was a recent study

668
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:52,120
showing in middle-aged adults looking at life expectancy as a function of number of steps taken.

669
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:56,840
And people compared to people who are less than 4,000 steps a day, people who are getting 8,000

670
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:03,640
steps a day had a 50% reduction in mortality during a 12-year follow-up. And people were getting up to

671
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,400
12,000 steps a day. That was the peak. I mean, it plateaued there. Above that, it didn't go

672
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,480
down further, but there was a 67% reduction in mortality. So like you can get pretty much the

673
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:21,880
full benefit of exercise with just a lot of steps and most of those being walking. I would agree

674
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:27,480
that you want to add some higher intensity interval, but it doesn't take a lot. I mean,

675
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:33,400
like if you look at running, five miles of running a week will give you the longevity boost

676
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:39,400
from running. That's almost as good as it gets. One of the questions patients ask me, and I don't

677
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,280
really know the answer, I'm hoping you might, is how much resting heart rate is a function of

678
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:51,080
fitness versus genetics. So sometimes, because now a lot of our patients do use tracking devices,

679
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,320
and they often report your lowest resting heart rate overnight, which would really be your true

680
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:03,800
nadir. And I have some patients who say, gosh, mine is 57, why is it not 47? And I really don't

681
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:11,480
know how much of that is their exercise versus, look, some people just have different size engines

682
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,280
that rev at different levels. For example, I've always had a very low heart rate. So nowadays,

683
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:21,880
my resting heart rate, my overnight resting heart rate might be in the low 40s, but when I was

684
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,400
athletic, when I was very fit, I would wake up with a resting heart rate in the mid 30s. So actually,

685
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,200
I have a pretty high heart rate relative to my baseline now, but I've also never had a very high

686
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,080
peak heart rate. So I've just always thought of myself as having more of a diesel engine.

687
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,880
I have to believe that's somewhat genetic. So what is your view around resting heart rate,

688
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,440
given that it is a metric people are becoming more and more aware of?

689
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:51,160
So for one thing, females tend to have higher heart rates than males, even at equivalent fitness

690
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:57,720
levels. And that being said, a resting pulse is a much stronger prediction, predictor of mortality.

691
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,560
Lower is better in that regard, lower pulse, better longevity in males than in females.

692
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:09,320
Males with a resting heart rate above 85 is not a good place to be. Some of it's genetic. And as

693
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,880
people get, you know, into advanced years, some of it's disease, six-simon syndrome, you know,

694
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,680
where your pulse just slows down, because, you know, the engine's wearing out, and they need a

695
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,320
pacemaker. But most of the time, it's, you know, it's a function of, well, for instance, like

696
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:29,320
alcohol, the more alcohol you drink, the higher your pulse will be, your resting pulse, stress,

697
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:35,880
sleep problems. There's a lot of things, but it's generally a pretty good marker of fitness. And so

698
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:41,800
like a lot of things, rather than worrying about how you compare to, you know, your buddy you're

699
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,800
working out with, is how you just compare yourself to you and keep track of your pulse. And you'll

700
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:53,240
notice that when you get into a rhythm, like for instance, one of the reasons I love watching my

701
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:59,800
my resting heart rate, and I'm kind of like you, it runs, you know, 42-44 most nights. And if I get

702
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:04,360
overtrained or under slapped, I've been on call, been under more stress, been traveling too much,

703
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:11,080
it'll start raising up to, you know, 47-48-49. And if you pay close attention to it and use that as

704
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:17,000
feedback, it's a really great way to tune your lifestyle to get into a, like a cardio protective

705
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,240
zone. And it involves the right amount of exercise and the right amount of sleep and not too much

706
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:27,400
alcohol and, and some, you know, plenty of downtime and play and, and those sorts of things.

707
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:33,880
How much do you see patients' resting heart rates improve with appropriate exercise-based

708
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38,680
interventions? So when you take patients who are underdoing it, which as you said at the outset,

709
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:44,040
we shouldn't lose sight of the fact, most people are underdoing this drug called exercise,

710
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:50,520
but patient shows up with the resting heart rate of 75, who's otherwise quite healthy, has a cack,

711
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:56,200
their score is, places them at the 50th percentile. They're in no grave or acute danger at all,

712
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,400
but they say, Dr. O'Keefe, I'm here to get serious about this. I want to, you know, I want to bend the

713
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:07,320
arc of my life. I'm 45 and this is the time to really pay attention, even though there's no

714
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:12,360
heart attack in the next decade of my life at all. And you say, look, I want you to do X, Y, and Z.

715
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,840
Is there an expectation that their resting heart rate is going to be 55 one day?

716
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:25,400
55 only if they get really serious about, you know, losing 30 pounds and getting fit from unfit.

717
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:29,400
But more typically, you know, five or 10 beats per minute is not uncommon.

718
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,440
And you, you're happy with that. That's a positive sign to you.

719
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,160
Oh, absolutely. You know, and, and of course it goes along with their waistline coming down and

720
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:42,120
their blood pressure coming down and their triglycerides lower and their A1C lower. So,

721
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,600
you know, these things tend to move in tandem when you kind of dial in your lifestyle and diet

722
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:52,200
and exercise program to that sort of ideal zone. Well, let's pivot then and talk a little bit about

723
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:58,840
nutrition. Gosh, there are so many places to go on this, but something you've written extensively on

724
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:05,160
is the relationship between diabetes and cardiovascular disease. And what can be

725
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:10,840
gleaned from that as a model for studying a disease. So tell folks a little bit about that work.

726
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:16,760
Well, this is another thing that I sort of like paid attention to in my diet. And, you know,

727
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:22,200
back when I was in medical school in the eighties and my training in the eighties and, and, you know,

728
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:28,040
that was the time when, you know, the Pritikin diet and like a low fat diet was all the rage.

729
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:32,920
And unfortunately, you know, that took a long time to extinguish that, but I started following that

730
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:39,720
pretty closely. And it was a disaster. You know, it's like my triglycerides went from 80 to 300.

731
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:46,120
My HDL went down from 50 to 33. And I just thought, you know, when I was getting skinnier and, you know,

732
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,280
my athletic times weren't better. And in fact, they were worse and I wasn't feeling that good.

733
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:56,440
I thought this is not the right diet. How restricted were you? Well, like, for instance,

734
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,760
when I, you know, I was at 20 something, you know, so I'd go out to eat with friends and

735
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,080
we'd be eating pizza or, and I'd take off the toppings and just eat the crust, you know,

736
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:09,080
and then, and then for a while, then I kind of got into the sort of keto phase and I would eat

737
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,960
the toppings and throw away the crust. And then I figured, yeah, pizza probably just not worth

738
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:19,640
eating at all. So, you know, and I'd eat lots and lots of white rice and, you know, and try to

739
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:25,720
minimize fat. And then I realized, you know, you can't generalize. For one thing, that's a disaster

740
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:31,640
for, and it's played out on a, on a population wide level in America, that kind of diet, you know,

741
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:37,240
makes us fat, belly fat, triglycerides, rub, diabetes rates are up. It makes you hungry all

742
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:44,200
the time. It is not the right diet. Just two days ago, we published an article in our, our

743
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,200
flagship cardiology journal in the world called the Journal of American Culture Cardiology,

744
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:55,560
called the PESCO Mediterranean Diet Intermittent Fasting as like the omnivore solution to the

745
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,440
omnivore's dilemma of what to eat. And we think if you put together like all the data and the

746
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:05,640
guidelines and, you know, the observational data and a little bit of randomized data that we have

747
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:11,480
that a diet that's moderately high in fat, very low in refined carbohydrates, like almost no added

748
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:18,120
sugar and minimal white refined grains, but, but high in nuts and extra virgin olive oil and high

749
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:24,680
in fish and seafood and high in vegetables and low in processed food and drinking mostly water or tea,

750
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:30,680
coffee fasting for at least 12 hours each 24 hour period of time and preferably moving more like to

751
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:38,520
like a 14 or 16 hour fast per day. We think this is like arguably the healthiest cardiovascular

752
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:44,200
diet, both for preventing diabetes, but also preventing heart disease and dementia, obesity,

753
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:50,280
and a lot of the other scourges that are so common in our society. The PredaMed study,

754
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:55,320
which I'm sure I've discussed in great detail on a previous podcast, though unfortunately I can't

755
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,520
recall, hopefully in the show notes, if it's been done, we'll make sure to link to it. Probably one

756
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,080
of the most impressive diet studies with respect to cardiovascular disease prevention. And, you know,

757
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:10,280
I think the findings of that though they needed a revision based on an error in randomization the

758
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:16,120
first time around were difficult to ignore when you consider the challenges of studying primary

759
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:22,520
prevention, even with drugs, let alone with a diet. And yet to see the success of a Mediterranean

760
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:28,680
diet in that study, that was a wake up call for me. Peter, that is in my opinion the most important

761
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:35,000
diet study that's been done. Emilio Ross was the primary investigator on that. He was a co-author

762
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,440
on this recent paper that we wrote and Emilio and I have been working together on a lot of projects

763
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,480
recently, but it was the Mediterranean diet versus the American Heart Association diet, which is that

764
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:51,480
diet that we were just, you know, dissing. That's, you know, the low fat, so trending towards vegetarian

765
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:58,360
diet that's high in carbs. But that showed in this group of 7,500 people followed for

766
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,600
four and a half years that the primary endpoint, which was MI, heart attack,

767
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:09,720
stroke or cardiovascular death was reduced 30%. But also follow-up studies showed that the dementia,

768
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:15,400
cognitive impairment, diabetes, obesity were also, each of those were significantly reduced in the

769
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:20,520
people that got the Mediterranean diet. But it's important to point out that they were specific

770
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:25,160
Mediterranean diets that half of the people in the Mediterranean diet got a free liter of extra

771
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:30,600
virgin olive oil per week that they were supposed to use up in a week. And the other half got mixed

772
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:37,800
nuts, tree nuts, there were almonds, walnuts and filverts or hazelnuts. So they were adding fat

773
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:42,760
in the case of the nuts, you know, vegetable protein. And when you do the multivariable analysis

774
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,920
on what correlated best, it was the added fat. It didn't increase saturated fat, but it increased

775
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:52,840
these healthy fats from these healthy foods. And as Emilio likes to point out with the olive oil,

776
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:58,120
you know, it has to be not only extra virgin, but more importantly, it needs to be high in polyphenols,

777
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,640
which is perceptible as this black pepper stinging at the back of your palate. You need to, every

778
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:08,440
time you open a bottle of olive oil, because it's not on the maple, generally, the polyphenol content,

779
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,480
you taste it and it should have this, this, this burn 10 or 20 seconds after you swallow it in the

780
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:20,120
back of your palate. Those are super important antioxidants that because they're dissolved in

781
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:27,000
oil, they seep into your blood vessels, they seep into your brain and your eyes and your skin.

782
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,320
And they really correlate with good long term health. Whereas there's been studies,

783
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:36,040
decades, Dr. Vogel and his colleagues did a study showing that olive oil was bad for your endothelium.

784
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,800
And that never made sense to me. And then I realized, oh, they were using a like an,

785
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,400
you know, antioxidant depleted, not not one of these high polyphenol,

786
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:47,880
antioxidant olive oil. So it's really important to look for those high antioxidant olive oils and

787
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:54,200
then use them generously. So two comments. One is most people that think of the grocery store,

788
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:00,520
myself included historically aren't really paying close attention to what olive oil is. And boy,

789
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:05,400
you only need to get fooled once, which is to say catch what the label says to really get upset. But

790
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,400
a lot of things that are marketed as pure extra virgin olive oil or anything, but,

791
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,640
and I don't know how they get away with it. Truthfully, it's really an embarrassment to

792
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,800
how this stuff is regulated, but it's basically a bunch of canola oil that has some olive oil in it.

793
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:22,440
And they they've somehow managed to lie their way into saying it's pure olive oil. So you have to

794
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:27,080
be careful what you buy. But because of those, because of that, that's the pre-demand study,

795
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:32,520
though, had the intervention of extra virgin olive oil or nuts. And we have a rare thing,

796
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:37,880
by the way, as you're always pointing out, we have first level randomized data showing that adding

797
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:42,440
this to the diet will reduce heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death. And, and so I mean,

798
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,440
it's also, you know, these are delicious foods when you get used to eating them. And, and, you

799
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:51,960
know, if you want to follow a high fat ketogenic diet, it should be high unsaturated fat. It

800
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:58,120
shouldn't be cream and cheese and butter and red meat. It should be, it should be nuts and seeds,

801
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:04,120
extra virgin olive oil, avocados and oily fish like salmon. It's only those five things. I mean,

802
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,920
you need to get a lot of your calories from those five things, which by the way, is kind of the

803
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,720
traditional peasant Mediterranean diet. These were these were Mediterranean's who are living high on

804
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,440
the hog. These are the peasants who were growing their own vegetables and tending their own olive

805
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:24,200
garden and their own grapes and the red wine and that sort of thing. So. So how convincing do you

806
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:32,040
think are the data demonizing saturated fat? Given that so much of it is in the context of

807
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,600
refined carbohydrates and other things. I mean, again, when you look at the epidemiologic data,

808
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,720
unfortunately we just don't have big enough cohorts of people who consume saturated fat,

809
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:49,320
absent carbohydrates or refined carbohydrates, it saturated fat in epidemiology becomes a proxy for

810
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:55,080
people who are probably eating a lot of other bad things. So mechanistically maybe or otherwise,

811
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,880
how do you feel about it? I'm actually like what people ask me about, you know,

812
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,040
what's the most important thing of the diet? I don't mention getting rid of red meat or getting

813
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:09,240
rid of saturated fat. I mean, a moderate amount of that is, you know, again, our evolutionary

814
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:16,600
history. You know, we ate a lot of red meat and we ate saturated fat. The evil white crystal in

815
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:23,240
the American diet is not salt. The worst is sugar and sugar and refined carbohydrates are by far

816
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:29,160
the absolute worst dietary villain. Saturated fat, you know, a little bit of butter is not going to

817
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:35,800
kill you. You know, like, like if you're a vegan, there's nothing you can eat that'll be healthier

818
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,840
for you than like a juicy steak. It's not, it's not overdone, you know, because, because you're

819
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:48,360
probably low in, in the things like B12 and zinc and iron and high quality protein. So yeah,

820
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,960
it's, it's a natural food and in moderation. I mean, I think saturated fat, excessive saturated

821
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:59,160
fat is not a good idea, but we don't focus successfully on it. My wife Joan is a really

822
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:06,280
smart dietician. And like you, you know, we went to school till we're 32 or 33 to promote health

823
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:11,080
and wellness and we got zero, nothing. I mean, hardly an hour of training in nutrition. It's

824
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:16,520
just so embarrassing that it's still like that. But, but so, you know, she kind of taught me a

825
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,160
lot of the fundamentals and still continues to teach me a lot of fundamentals of nutrition because

826
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,920
this is an important thing. And, and any good dietician will tell you that, you know, red meat

827
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,800
and saturated fat are essential nutrients that they're not toxic in and of themselves.

828
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:37,720
So you touched briefly on salt. I know you've written about not just salt, but also magnesium.

829
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:42,760
And that's something that's also really near and dear to my heart. Our patients consume a lot of

830
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:48,200
magnesium, both in the form of oxide, which we basically titrate as high as they can tolerate

831
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:53,560
from a bowel function perspective. And then we use, you know, slow mag typically just to make sure

832
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:58,440
that nobody's getting any sort of cramping or anything like that. But my thesis is there's a

833
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,640
global shortage of magnesium in the human. Somehow we're just not getting enough magnesium.

834
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:08,920
Now I don't know why that's the case, but my proof for that, if that's too strong a word,

835
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:15,400
is that when you give people back on the order of two grams of magnesium a day,

836
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:22,760
they always feel better. Why is that? Well, it's the same story with potassium, Peter, by the way,

837
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:30,440
our evolutionary ancestors living out there in the wild, eating wild game, nuts, all the

838
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:36,360
vegetables and fruits we're getting like, and fiber is the same way, you know, like five times

839
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,800
more. They were getting a lot more magnesium, a lot more potassium, a lot more fiber than we're

840
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,360
getting today. So when you add those things back to the diet, and the best way to do it is with

841
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:52,120
lots of nuts or high magnesium. But I agree. The other thing, so basically I think it's like

842
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:57,480
getting us back into sort of like an ideal range of consumption of a really important

843
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:02,680
mineral. I mean, it's an important cofactor for a lot of the most essential, you know,

844
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:07,800
sort of chemical reactions going on in our body of magnesium. So it's really important, but

845
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:14,920
it also makes me think that, you know, a concept that I've come to recently that I think you'll

846
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:20,600
like, and you probably think this way as well, but again, if you look at our ancestors, when they

847
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:27,080
would get a bird or a mammal or a fish or a squirrel or whatever, and they would cook it,

848
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:32,280
or buffalo for that matter, and they'd cook it, they would eat nose to tail, right? They'd eat

849
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:38,280
the whole thing. These days when we eat meat, we usually muscle meat, which is a very narrow sort

850
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:45,480
of range of animal-based nutrients. One of the things when you eat nose to tail, say when you're

851
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:50,680
cooking the bones, for example, you cook them long enough to eat them, you get a bunch, and the skin

852
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:57,400
for that matter too, a bunch of collagen. You get calcium hydroxyapatite, which is a form of calcium

853
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,720
that we're meant to eat. We weren't meant to eat rocks, which is the standard calcium supplement.

854
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:06,760
It's calcium carbonate, calcium glucanate. Those are rocks. We didn't eat rocks. We ate bones,

855
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,640
and for the last 5,000 years, we ate dairy, but a lot of people have trouble, you know,

856
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:16,760
tolerating the lactose. We think that, and Mediterranean diet really focuses on fermented

857
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:21,800
dairy, but getting back to, I think the other supplements that are really important is like an

858
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:27,160
organic bone meal that you have to add magnesium to it, because that's calcium hydroxyapatite.

859
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:33,640
If you get that up to the gram a day of calcium from there, and your magnesium, I would agree,

860
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,520
two grams per day. Then the collagen, because you're not going to eat enough skin to get the

861
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:43,880
collagen that we're meant to get, the collagen supplement, like whether it's pills or powder,

862
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:49,240
is really, really good for hair, skin, and nails, not to mention bones. It's also good for putting

863
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:53,880
on healthy muscle and maintaining healthy muscle. I mean, this is like ideal protein,

864
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:59,480
glycine, and other amino acids that, by the way, were really meant to have in our diet. So I think

865
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:05,000
those are really important supplements to that sort of healthy Mediterranean, PESCO Mediterranean

866
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,280
diet, but the fasting, I think that it's good to add because it's hard to get those kinds of

867
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:17,320
minerals at those levels. Do you restrict sodium in any subset of your patients, including maybe

868
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:21,160
even those that are both hypertensive with compromised kidney function?

869
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,920
We see a lot of really sick people with, you know, with class four heart failure and

870
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,800
bad kidney disease or whatnot. There you have to do, be somewhat careful, but I virtually never

871
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:37,160
tell people to do that less than 1500 milligrams of sodium. And you're better off having sodium

872
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:42,680
kind of in the medium range, you know, from two to three grams per day. And actually,

873
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:49,400
a good rule of thumb for the listeners here, and generally healthy people, is like eat mostly whole

874
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:55,880
natural foods, which are very depleted, sodium core, right? And then salt to taste, because a

875
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:00,920
lot of the healthiest foods you'll eat, like vegetables, nuts, fish, you'll eat a lot more

876
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:05,480
if you can salt it to taste and make it taste good. And when you add salt to those natural,

877
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,400
you know, or lightly salted nuts, I mean, you don't need to worry about that. That's good for

878
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:14,200
you having some salt in your diet when you're eating an otherwise naturally healthy whole foods

879
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:20,120
diet. All right. Let's go back and talk about that drug that I'm so enamored with or class of

880
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:27,800
drug, there are at least two out there. Tell folks what an SGLT2 inhibitor is, besides a mouthful.

881
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:35,480
Yeah, an SGLT2 inhibitor, you know, is a diabetic drug that blocks this sodium glucose co-transporter

882
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:41,720
in the tubule in the nephron. When we filter our blood through the nephron to the kidneys,

883
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:49,160
we pull out a lot of things, your water, sodium, toxins, urea, including glucose. And then because

884
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:52,920
the body is saying we're interested reason to waste this glucose, you know, we need we need

885
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:59,800
these calories. So it reabsorbs the filtered glucose before the urine goes out. So we figured

886
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:05,560
the engineered a drug to block the reabsorption of that glucose that's filtered. And when this drug,

887
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,920
when these classic drugs first came out seven or eight years ago, I have to tell you, Peter, I

888
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:14,920
thought this is a dumb idea. I mean, everybody knows that glycosuria is terrible for the kidneys.

889
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:20,120
And this is like, it may be lower sugar, but in the long run, it's going to be, but that's the

890
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,120
beauty of science. That's why you do these big randomized placebo controlled trials. And when

891
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:30,280
the first one came out, the MPA reg study five years ago, like my phone and text messages,

892
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,640
emails just lit up with people from around the country, around the world, friends who were

893
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,960
saying, did you see this? This can't be true. Keeping in mind, we've been trying to prove for

894
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:44,040
40, 50 years, 100 years since the first diabetes drug, insulin came out, that controlling sugar

895
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:49,400
prevented cardiovascular death. And we couldn't prove it. Shockingly, until this trial came out,

896
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:56,120
and it reduced cardiovascular death 38%. It reduced heart failure, renal failure. I mean,

897
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:05,560
it was just an amazing thing. And subsequently, there's been, oh, a good seven mega trials now,

898
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:12,520
between three and 17,000 patients in each study randomized to SGLT2 inhibitor or placebo,

899
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:18,520
that shows that in fact, these are the most potent drugs for, I mean, not for lowering sugar,

900
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:23,560
they do that modestly, but for improving cardiovascular prognosis, reducing heart failure

901
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:29,240
and renal failure. And it's just fascinating to speculate about the mechanisms of action,

902
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:34,360
but may have something to do with ketones. But the most shocking thing about this that's really

903
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:40,440
blown the lid off is, is that these drugs reduce things like heart failure, deaths, heart failure

904
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:49,880
occurrence, and renal failure in people without diabetes, as well as with diabetes. So that really

905
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:55,800
makes us wonder. Well, that's why I take one. And they're currently being studied, frankly,

906
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:02,120
as just straight up longevity agents for exactly that reason. And I'm actually, my interest in this

907
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:08,120
even goes a bit beyond that of metformin, which has historically garnered much of the longevity

908
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:15,000
attention in the diabetes medication repurposed camp, because I like the mechanism of action more.

909
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,160
I like what it doesn't do. Again, I think metformin is an amazing drug. I think it's,

910
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:25,480
it's efficacy in people with diabetes is remarkable. I do have my concerns about its efficacy

911
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:31,320
in very healthy people who exercise at the upper limit of what we've discussed. And I think it

912
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:36,200
might, it might impair there. I think it's too soon to say. I've had lots of interesting discussions

913
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:41,160
with people and we're actually in the process of designing a study now to test that. But to me,

914
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:47,480
this is a drug that doesn't really show any evidence of impairing the benefits of exercise

915
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,880
and yet offers through totally different mechanisms, some of those cardio protective benefits. So

916
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,720
the good news, as you pointed out about science is it just, over time, it keeps accumulating

917
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:01,480
information and we'll get better and better answers. Churning away. And you know, but so,

918
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:06,280
it's so fascinating to think about how this works. And I don't prescribe metformin for

919
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:11,320
people without diabetes. I mean, it upsets your stomach. It kind of makes you feel a little queasy.

920
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:19,080
I use it on all my type two diabetics, but I always understand that the SGLT2 inhibitor is

921
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:25,080
more important. It burns off belly fat. When you, even a non-diabetic person takes, takes an SGLT2

922
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:30,920
inhibitor, you urinate out about a hundred grams of sugar a day. So we were talking about the evil

923
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,320
crystal compound, you know, white, the sugar. This basically is like pulling the plug and draining

924
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:41,960
a substantial amount of sugar from your body every day. It's like following a ketogenic diet

925
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:47,960
without having to follow that. I mean, it raises ketones in the low, in your system because of

926
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:53,960
the fact, and it does tap into belly fat. It taps into belly fat to get the fatty acids that then

927
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:58,920
turns in, the liver turns into ketones. So, and we still don't fully understand how it works,

928
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:04,120
but it's an important drug class that is going to only get bigger with respect to its impact on

929
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:10,680
health and longevity. Why do you think it hasn't shown an increase in UTIs or bladder cancers or

930
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,560
things like that? I mean, cause so seven years ago, that was my thinking, right? Which was,

931
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:21,320
Oh, interesting idea, but you're going to have a UTI every week. No, thanks. Like I don't,

932
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,480
I don't see how that's a good trade-off and it just hasn't panned out. Why do you think that is?

933
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:32,120
It's sort of interesting because well, when you think about it, the UTIs, you are getting rid of

934
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,600
some glucose in the urine. It actually, the only predictable side effect that you see,

935
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:42,920
and it goes up, especially in females is topical yeast infections, you know, fungal infections

936
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:46,520
down in the growing regions on the genitalia. And you know, when you think about it, you are

937
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:53,720
putting sugar in the water in warm, moist places. So I tell people on, on the SGLT2 inhibitor,

938
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,720
they need to, you know, pay special attention to use a wet wipe after urination, especially

939
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:02,600
females, because there's just more surface area there to get a yeast infection on. But,

940
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,880
but it is sort of interesting that it doesn't really increase things like UTI or pylo-naphritis

941
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:13,960
or uro-sepsis. So it may be just that it's making the system otherwise healthier, you know, your

942
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:20,280
immune system, your, your kidney function, your cardiovascular system. Maybe it's just, you know,

943
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:25,000
you're better able to deal with that. I don't know. This really brings it back to this point,

944
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,800
which is, you said something earlier that I think is worth coming back to. When you take

945
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:37,400
a patient with type two diabetes, you take two patients with type two diabetes,

946
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:46,760
and you give one of them a lot of insulin and you give the other one not as much insulin.

947
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,880
One of them is going to have lower blood sugar than the other.

948
01:30:51,880 --> 01:31:00,120
In the one with lower blood sugar, we see less microvascular disease. We see that they

949
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:08,120
have fewer amputations, less kidney disease, lower rates of impotence. Basically any tiny,

950
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:14,680
tiny blood vessel in their body does better when their glucose goes down. But if it came down

951
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:21,480
on the heels of insulin going up, we don't see a reduction in cardiovascular disease.

952
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:30,120
So why is it, in your opinion, that lowering glucose with more insulin does not reduce

953
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:37,240
cardiovascular mortality, which is so clearly tied to type two diabetes and post-prandial glucose?

954
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:45,800
This is the key issue. You know the answer to this is that insulin is the problem. Insulin is a

955
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:52,840
really super important hormone that Jason Fung and you had a really wonderful discussion about

956
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:59,640
this. But insulin ushers nutrients, fats, and glucose into cells to be burned. Or if you're not

957
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,800
in a burning mode right now, you're not exercising, you're sitting around sleeping,

958
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:10,440
it stores on its belly fat. So insulin is super important if you have type one diabetes. In type

959
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:15,080
two diabetes, I consider it the court of last resort. I mean, this is an obesity hormone.

960
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:19,480
Insulin and cortisol are the two obesity hormones. You want to get somebody fat, put them on insulin,

961
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:24,920
put them on prednisone. They will get belly fat like crazy. And I always felt sorry for these

962
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,240
diabetics. You know, the endos would be putting them on all this insulin. That'd be telling you

963
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:34,040
got to get your weight down. That's impossible. You cannot get your weight down when you're getting

964
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:39,080
a lot of exogenous insulin. You're hungry all the time. It causes weight gain. It causes fluid

965
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:43,640
retention. If anything, it accelerates atherosclerosis, you know, high insulin levels.

966
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:50,680
The key is low. You want to drive your insulin levels as low as, like your pulse. You want a nice

967
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:55,640
low insulin levels. They go up when you eat and then they go right back down. And the way you do

968
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:01,080
that is you exercise, you minimize belly fat, you eat a diet like we were just talking about.

969
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:07,000
You get no sugar. None of that easily digestible refined carbohydrates. You eat a lot of fiber,

970
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,080
a lot of low glycemic fruit, but more, more, more sort of non starchy vegetables. You eat modest

971
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:17,800
amounts of lean protein and a little bit of saturated fat. It don't hurt you. You eat a lot,

972
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,040
like 50% of your calories from unsaturated fats from those, you know, nuts and all the well and

973
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:28,840
avocados, guacamole and salmon and sardines and trout. And you will have, you know this from

974
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:32,920
wearing a glucose monitor. I've worn a glucose monitor for a while too, being non diabetic. I

975
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:37,880
find it a really great behavior modification thing. But when you eat that way, you don't see

976
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:41,320
your glucose go up at all. So when your glucose goes up, your insulin doesn't go up. And when

977
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:46,600
your insulin stays low, your vessels are happy. You're not putting on belly fat. We wrote an

978
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,600
article called, you know, insulin is a cardiotoxic medication. I mean, we want to minimize the

979
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:56,760
amount of insulin. Unfortunately, it's new, these new drug class, SGLT2 and impers,

980
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:03,560
GLP1 agonist. That's semaglutide and dulaglutide. There's a couple others. These two together,

981
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:10,520
along with metformin for diabetics, amazing drugs. They all lower insulin. They all reduce fat,

982
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:15,640
belly fat, and they all improve cardiovascular prognosis. And by the way, you know, a lot of

983
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:19,960
it has to do with the effect on insulin. Tell folks how the GLP1 agonist work.

984
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:28,040
We might as well round out that trifecta. Yeah. So GLP1 agonist work by supplying a

985
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:33,480
hormone that tends to wane and people as they develop type 2 diabetes. This is a hormone

986
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:39,320
that tells after you eat, it tells the pancreas to give a shot of insulin. And when you eat

987
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:44,200
a shot of insulin and when you're not eating, it also tells it shuts down glucagon production

988
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:48,920
in the liver. So you're making less glucose, gluconeogenesis when you don't need to be. And

989
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:53,080
that's one of the problem when you're eating this junky diet, you get these incretin levels,

990
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,120
get low, you get this gluconeogenesis. So you wake up in the morning, even after not eating for

991
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:02,440
eight or 10 hours and your glucose is high because you're making glucose when you don't need to be.

992
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:08,840
So this basically restores a hormone that is low and it sort of balances out, kind of

993
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:37,280
lowers fasting insulin and raises postprandial insulin and in-frit

994
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,320
and I'll combine it with SGLT2 inhibitors and non-diabetics. It works, reduces cardiovascular

995
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:48,480
risk. People on GLP1 agonists tend to complain of some when you first start it and when you

996
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:54,720
dose titrate it every week, some constipation and or nausea, but those go away with time.

997
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:58,480
And it is FDA approved for weight loss, isn't it? At least one of them is, right?

998
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:07,040
It is. One of them, liraglitide is sextenda, but it's a once a day drug. The semiglutide will be

999
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:12,560
approved in the next year as a once a week drug, the way we use it for diabetes and at a higher

1000
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:18,560
dose, 2.4 milligrams rather than one milligram for the top dose. And it's shown it's just best

1001
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:24,800
ever weight reduction and it's sort of an alternative to bariatric surgery for these

1002
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,720
really overweight patients. Wow. I didn't realize that. So you're telling me that you can now take

1003
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:38,720
a GLP1 agonist once a week with a sub-q injection and achieve comparable levels to the normal daily

1004
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:44,160
injected routine? Because that's historically been one of the barriers. Better cardiovascular

1005
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:48,960
reduction. It reduces heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death better than the daily one,

1006
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:54,720
the liraglitide. These are also revolutionary drugs, but the cool thing, they're very safe

1007
01:36:54,720 --> 01:37:02,480
otherwise. Whereas the SGLT2 inhibitors, you kind of reduce heart failure and renal failure

1008
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:08,480
and overall cardiovascular mortality and all cause mortality in sicker people. This reduces more the

1009
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:14,240
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It has a stronger effect on MI stroke and those ruptured

1010
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:18,320
plaques we were talking about at the beginning. They cause weight reduction from two different

1011
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:23,120
mechanisms of action. They improve cardiovascular prognosis from two different mechanisms of action

1012
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:27,760
and they really work well together. It's a phenomenal combination. Well, we can't have

1013
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,840
a discussion about medications and cardiovascular disease without talking about statins, which

1014
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,400
you've written about a lot. Certainly would have to be in the top three most prescribed

1015
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:41,680
classes of medications out there. I'm kind of a five statin guy. There's a lot out there,

1016
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:48,160
but there's probably only five that I'll use in patients. Every physician, I think who prescribes

1017
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:52,800
these has their own little secret alchemy around it. When they're using Livolov versus

1018
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:58,880
Prevostatin versus Crestor versus Lipitor, et cetera. Let's talk broadly about them as a class.

1019
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:04,320
Obviously, a type of drug that inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol, which is its direct

1020
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:11,920
action, but the money may come more from its indirect action, which increases the LDL receptor

1021
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:17,440
on the liver. You're pulling that ApoB bearing particle out of circulation and you're having

1022
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:25,200
this pretty pronounced effect in terms of LDL, C, and ApoB reduction. Second really now only to

1023
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:31,760
PCSK9 inhibitors. Rather than talk about that, although I'm happy to hear your thoughts on that,

1024
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,760
I want to talk a little bit more about the potential other benefits of statins because

1025
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:42,000
I think this is where most people do believe there are pleiotrophic benefits of statins, but

1026
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:48,800
they're harder to quantify. I'm curious as to what your thinking is on when you want to bring a

1027
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:54,720
statin in. Is it also something you use in patients whose ApoB might not be that high,

1028
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,880
but for whom you're looking for this other benefit?

1029
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:03,200
The latest pleiotrophic effect, if you will, on statins is there was a study just this week

1030
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:10,400
came out that people who are on statins seem to have some better resistance to severe COVID

1031
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:16,880
infection. It may be that the people that get a lot of inflammation are the ones who are more

1032
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,200
likely to have a bad outcome with a COVID infection, but in any event, they do have

1033
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:27,040
anti-inflammatory effects. We use them a lot. I'm always arguing with my patients about statins.

1034
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:34,560
They'll say, have you read about these things on the internet? I'll point out to them, in the

1035
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,880
history of science, in the history of medicine and randomized trials, there's never been a class

1036
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,920
of medications that have been so thoroughly tested in gold standard randomized placebo

1037
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,480
controlled trials. Last thing you have to use, there's like 500,000, half a million people

1038
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:54,000
in various randomized trials showing that if you have heart disease, or especially if you've had

1039
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,560
cardiovascular event, they will help improve your prognosis. They reduce MLIs, stroke,

1040
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,280
cardiovascular death, probably all cause mortality of high risk people.

1041
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:08,800
Pause for one second, James. I agree with you completely. There is no drug, no class of drug,

1042
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:17,840
I spend more time defending than statins. Why is that? Why is it that the internet is absolutely

1043
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:26,480
crazy with this obsession that the statin is a drug planted here by foreign operatives

1044
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:33,760
designed specifically to kill us? Yeah, it's crazy. It's a combination of things. Number one,

1045
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,480
and I was kind of skeptical about this, but then I started taking the statin back about

1046
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:44,880
when I was 45 and I had that calcium score. When I was working out hard, I wouldn't read,

1047
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:50,560
like my muscles would hurt harder. They would ache worse after a hard workout.

1048
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:58,480
Then I started taking constant Q10 and switched over to a more of a less potent one. Sure enough,

1049
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:04,560
they got better. They frequently are associated with these nuisance side effects like muscle aches.

1050
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:09,280
Some people swear that causes some brain fog, some sort of mild cognitive impairment.

1051
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:16,960
But a lot of it too is sort of the no SIBO effect, the VUDU effect. They read about this and there's

1052
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:22,400
all sorts of people trying to capitalize on selling people alternatives to statins.

1053
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:29,440
That being said, I argue with people about statins who really need that. The 55-year-old just had

1054
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:35,440
MI who tells me, I'll do anything but take a statin. Fortunately now, we do have other good options.

1055
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:41,840
Zetimide lowers cholesterol by reducing absorption by blocking the neem and PIC receptor. PCSK9

1056
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:47,520
inhibitors which just prolong the life of LDL receptors, both really elegant ways to lower

1057
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,440
cholesterol by removing it from the circulation without poisoning the cells ability to make

1058
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:56,560
cholesterol. That's really, really important. I know you were talking about the day spring about

1059
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:02,080
that and I completely agree. We have an option for those people who are statin intolerant because

1060
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:07,040
zetimide and PCSK9 inhibitor, they work synergistically like statins and PCSK9 inhibitors or

1061
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:14,560
zetimide with statins. But for people who have a zero calcium score, who are at relatively low risk,

1062
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,440
we do the mesa risk calculator or the ASCVD 10-year risk and they're under seven. Lots of times they're

1063
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:25,760
one or two or three. It's hard to improve somebody who's got such a low risk. Then I say,

1064
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:32,240
let's not get overly shook up about your LDL. You don't need to statin. We can stop your statin.

1065
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:36,240
We don't need to start it, whatever. We'll focus on diet and extravital lifestyle. But

1066
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:42,640
in middle-aged people, I need to see that zero calcium score or low calcium score to do that.

1067
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:48,080
But yeah, statins are a wonderful tool. They're cheap and we use a lot of them, but we also

1068
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:54,000
stop a lot of them. I'd be fascinated to hear this. I've thought about writing a paper on this

1069
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,920
topic because there's nothing out there in literature, but you kind of touched on it on

1070
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:04,480
one of your sessions. I think it was with Tom Dayspring that to the extent the statins do

1071
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:10,960
sort of impair a cell's ability to make cholesterol, it does that not only in the liver that makes

1072
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:14,320
mostly cholesterol, but it does that in the brain. People say it doesn't matter about getting

1073
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:19,600
cholesterol too low because cells can, if your brain makes its own cholesterol, if it does,

1074
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:25,040
if it needs it, if it's not poisoned, the HMG isn't poisoned by the statin. But if it is,

1075
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,440
that gets into the brain and it can't make its own cholesterol. And when you look at

1076
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:34,160
demented people, they have lipid depleted brains. There's shrunken brain. I mean,

1077
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:38,880
there's a good study showing that omega-3 helps to keep your brain plucked, a high omega-3 diet.

1078
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:46,240
And for that same reason, I have some sense that we might be better off using non-statin

1079
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:53,440
approaches to lowering cholesterol, like PCSK9 inhibitors, omega-3, a Zeta-Mob, a good diet,

1080
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:59,200
and other people that if we want to maximize sort of cognition and reduce Alzheimer's disease down.

1081
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:06,240
Tom, of course, works very closely with us in our practice. And that's absolutely been our approach,

1082
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,880
which of course puts us at odds with many of the people that are in the very strong

1083
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:17,920
pro-heart camp, very organ-specific camp. We look at two markers of cholesterol synthesis,

1084
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:23,840
desmosterol and lithosterol. We monitor them very closely. And there is a small body of literature

1085
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:29,920
that says, at least in high-risk people, maybe people who carry one or two copies of an APOE4 gene,

1086
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:38,880
that very low levels of desmosterol and or lithosterol in the presence of statins may be

1087
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:44,960
a predictor of increased risk. And we just, in that situation, based on all the reasons you've

1088
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:50,320
laid out, play to the precautionary principle. And frankly, our application of that is,

1089
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,120
there's probably only two patients in my entire practice that are going to walk around with a

1090
01:44:55,120 --> 01:45:01,120
desmosterol below 0.5, because there are so many other options if we need them that we don't need

1091
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:07,280
to overly suppress cholesterol synthesis. So only in the most high-risk cases of cardiovascular

1092
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:12,880
disease when we have no real other options, then we do this. But otherwise, you're right. I mean,

1093
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:18,720
we're incredibly liberal with the use of Zetia, and I think physicians are becoming more liberal

1094
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:24,400
with that, which I think is great, coupled with, frankly, Prevostatin is my favorite statin,

1095
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:31,040
if I can get the results there. You know, it's so mild. Also, anecdotally, it seems to produce less

1096
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:36,400
symptoms. It also doesn't raise glucose the way, say, Atorvastatin or Prevostatin will,

1097
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:41,280
and it doesn't increase risk of type 2 diabetes. And when you use it with a Zetimod, which, again,

1098
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:48,160
we have a great study, the Utopia study, in primary prevention, Zetimod reduced cardiovascular

1099
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:52,960
events by 30%. And then we also have the improvement study that showed that if you combine it with a

1100
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:57,600
statin, it reduced cardiovascular events. So we have really good first-level evidence about a Zetimod.

1101
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:03,280
The only thing I would disagree with you on, and disagree might be too strong a word, is tell you

1102
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:08,720
how I think about things a little bit differently is I don't look at a 10-year risk calculator.

1103
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:12,880
That's one area where in my practice, we just have to do things a bit different,

1104
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:17,760
which means we have to deviate from guidelines, because I agree with you. Look, if a person's

1105
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:25,920
10-year risk is 2%, and their calcium score is zero, but their APO B is at the 80th percentile,

1106
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:30,960
the textbook answer is do nothing once you've exhausted all the lifestyle modifications.

1107
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:37,520
My view on that is if you're 40 years old and your 10-year risk is zero, congratulations,

1108
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:43,280
but I'm playing a different game, right? I'm really in this camp of Alan Snyderman that says,

1109
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:49,680
we have to be taking a 30- and 40-year view of cardiovascular mortality. And that means I can't

1110
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:55,520
look at a 10-year risk calculator. I have to take a longer arc. And sometimes that means primary

1111
01:46:55,520 --> 01:47:03,600
prevention is adding drug to treatment of all other variables, even if the calcium score is zero.

1112
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,760
But again, that's a patient's decision based on their appetite for risk and their appetite

1113
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:14,960
for longevity. So I completely agree. And we don't, at least I don't know of 30-year risk

1114
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:20,560
calculator. So that calculator you're using is in your head. And I'm sure that's a very good

1115
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:26,000
calculator. But one point I would make is that in those kind of people, and I would say myself

1116
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,120
included, I don't take a statin. I haven't for years. I don't have a lot of risk factors, but

1117
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:35,680
I did have a little bit of calcium when I checked it years ago. So I'm sure I have more now. Statins

1118
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:41,920
will accelerate coronary calcification, by the way. So I use Zetimibe with a PCSK90 neighbor in

1119
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:46,240
myself because it doesn't have any side effects. Neither of those have side effects. I mean,

1120
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:51,760
rarely, rarely. And they work through very elegant mechanisms that don't distort your sort

1121
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,760
of milieu of cholesterol homeostasis, whether it be in the brain or wherever. I mean, this is

1122
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:02,880
just sort of making you as if you were genetically one of those gifted people that tends to run a

1123
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:07,680
nice low cholesterol. Well, that's interesting. That's sort of where I've migrated almost. I'm

1124
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:13,920
a low dose Prevostatin plus PCSK9 inhibitor. And I was thinking about doing the experiment of

1125
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:21,760
switching from Prevostatin over to Zetia to see. And the reason for me is I had a calcium score of

1126
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:27,680
six when I was 36. And that's in the presence of all the exercise and stuff. Now, I would

1127
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:32,160
argue at the time my nutrition was horrible because it was a quote unquote traditional athletes diet

1128
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:38,320
of a gallon of Gatorade a day or Powerade. That's the old athletes added, if you run the engine hot

1129
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:44,800
enough, you can burn any fuel. But Peter, I would say, you said, calcium score of six when you were

1130
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,640
36, despite your exercise, I would say maybe because when you're swimming 20 miles over,

1131
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:58,080
you were hammering, hammering and really intense exercise will accelerate coronary calcification.

1132
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:04,320
Yes, I have actually thought about that. And I repeated the calcium score in 2017. So that

1133
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:12,800
would have made me 44 or whatever. It was zero. Wow. Now it's very interesting because as you know,

1134
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:18,640
That was super rare by the way. Yeah, well, and I talked about this at length with Bob Peters,

1135
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:23,920
who is, I think Bob Peters and Steve Wolf are hands down the best cardiac radiologists in New

1136
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:33,280
York City. And so I had a CAC and CTA done with them, incredibly low radiation by the way,

1137
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:41,040
2.2 milli sieverts for a CTA and CAC. And the question was, hey, is it an artifact when you

1138
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:46,800
have a calcium score, go from six to zero, we just sort of missing it because there was still a little

1139
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:53,360
blip in the endothelium of the LAD in that 2017 study, it just didn't register as a full calcium.

1140
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:59,120
So, so I'll probably go back in a year and just repeat the CAC because I am curious.

1141
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:05,600
The point is, like, even if there's a little calcium there, it's really, really unusual for

1142
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:12,160
the calcium score to go anywhere up and usually goes up like 25, 30% a year or more with calcification.

1143
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:17,040
So it's kind of like, we wish our investments, you know, like the compound interest, you know,

1144
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:24,080
it really, it really can accumulate. But, and I'll have to say, I've probably read 150,000 calcium

1145
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:29,280
scores in the last 20 years, because we've probably done 600,000 in our practice and we

1146
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:35,840
do 50 or 60 of them a day. So, like, you virtually never see that. And now, granted, at that low

1147
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:40,800
level, you know, you kind of nipped it in the bud with your better diet and, you know, probably,

1148
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:47,040
you know, tapered your exercise, I don't know. But in any event, I saw a distinctly unusual

1149
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,800
pattern of regression in a calcium score in a good friend of mine, who's an executive, we've been on

1150
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:59,360
a statin for, you know, decades at a calcium score of like 1200, it had been going up, no diabetes,

1151
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:04,000
but you know, it's obese. And we switched them over because have some eggs to a PCS canine in

1152
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,560
Hebrew and a seven mile. And a calcium score a couple of three years, three years later,

1153
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:15,440
had gone down from like 1200, I mean, from, no, it's like 1400, but it was like two or 300 lower,

1154
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,920
you know, more than the margin of error of the test that made me think, you know, well,

1155
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:26,720
number one statins do tend to increase corner of calcification, but I bet PCS canine inhibitors

1156
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:32,400
don't. And certainly that anecdotal experience and I bet, I'll bet you Zetimov doesn't either.

1157
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:36,480
So I saw an abstract, but I don't know if it ever made it to publication that actually

1158
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,840
suggested PCS canine inhibitors decreased calcification.

1159
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,400
That was my anecdotal experience.

1160
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,480
Yeah. Now, of course, I don't know what that means because in the end,

1161
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:52,240
I don't typically rescan patients. I'm a 50 year old who shows up with a calcium score of a hundred.

1162
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:57,360
I have all the answer I need to know, which is we need to be way more aggressive. And there's

1163
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:03,760
nothing I'm going to glean by rescanning you next year to find out your 120 versus 80. It will not

1164
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:04,880
change our management.

1165
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,680
And it just discourages, you know, somebody who's doing their best.

1166
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,080
Yeah.

1167
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,680
Very discouraging to think, and then you have to explain, well, you're on a medication that

1168
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:15,600
does accelerate it, but it reduces your risk despite that because it's making the plaques

1169
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:20,400
less prone to rupture. And I'm the same way. I rarely, the only time I increase it is people

1170
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,400
who aren't doing the same right thing. They're not taking their medications or they're still

1171
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:28,800
smoking or they're not exercising. Then I'll check and say, you know, it's gone up from a

1172
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,680
thousand or 1300 or a hundred to 200. You know, you need to get on this, but the dirty little

1173
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:38,800
secret is that it goes up in most people, but nonetheless, we can prevent cardiovascular events

1174
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,240
with all these strategies we're talking about despite the coronary calcium.

1175
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:49,280
I'm so happy to hear about what you're doing. A $50 CAC really at that point, when you can get

1176
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:54,640
that level of a diagnostic test for less than the cost of a nice dinner, there's really no

1177
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:55,600
barrier to entry.

1178
01:52:56,240 --> 01:53:00,160
And then those people that have a positive score, we get them over in our cardiometabolic clinic,

1179
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:04,320
our cardiore wellness clinic. We have two different clinics, one focusing on the glucose

1180
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:09,840
side of things and, you know, the SGLT2 inhibitors and the GLP1 agonist and metformin and weight loss,

1181
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,680
and the other one on is just standard risk factors of lipids and whatnot. But we get them

1182
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:18,320
plugged in and we see them two, three times a year. We make sure there's nothing like feedback,

1183
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:26,320
right? You're a big fan on getting lipids tested and test these various markers, HSCRP, A1C,

1184
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:31,760
you know, a lot of things we follow because when you know better, you do better and people need

1185
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:32,240
feedback.

1186
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:39,360
To round out our discussion on the pharmacologic tools, where are you on the high doses of EPA

1187
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:45,520
versus EPA, DHA combined? Obviously these are becoming very popular tools in the toolkit.

1188
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:49,600
Again, just at the pharmaco level, also at the supplement level, if you pick your supplements

1189
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:52,720
right, how do you think about these in terms of heart health and brain health?

1190
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:59,360
So again, you know, super enlightened question. And this is like one at the crux of some of the

1191
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:05,040
most exciting stuff going on right now. So Omega 3, like we're talking about some other nutrients,

1192
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:11,040
we're eating like maybe an order of magnitude less of that than what we did in our evolutionary

1193
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:17,200
experience. Some people argue when we get access to shellfish and seafood is when our brain expanded,

1194
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:23,680
you know, 300,000 or 400,000 years ago. So the Omega 3, you know, like 20% of the dry weight of

1195
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:30,160
the brain is polyunsaturated fats and its favorite polyunsaturated fat to plug into those membranes

1196
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:37,760
in the neurons is DHA. EPA is also, you know, another super important Omega 3. And a lot of

1197
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:42,480
my patients come in and they stop their fish on the stop their Omega 3 because their doctor told

1198
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:47,840
them, Oh, no, these don't work. And as you pointed out many times in your writings and whatnot is

1199
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:52,240
even randomized controlled trials can be wrong, can be large and wrong if you're testing the wrong

1200
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:57,040
people, if you're using the wrong dose. And a lot of those trials were done with small doses. And

1201
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:02,400
these big meta-analyses, not to mention the reduced study, which recently tested the foregrounds of

1202
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:07,120
EPA and people who had heart disease or diabetes with other risk factors, you test

1203
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:12,800
in triglycerides above 150. So you test the right people, give them a nice robust dose,

1204
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:18,160
and you see these spectacular results from a nutrient. And a lot of the reasons doctors

1205
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:22,240
dismiss it is because again, we don't get taught anything about nutrition, we have an inherent

1206
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:29,280
distrust that anything doing diet or supplements is worthless. And that is so untrue. And Omega 3

1207
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:35,440
is exhibit A. So the latest meta-analysis, there was one just out in Mayo Clinic proceedings coming

1208
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:40,480
out this coming week. I wasn't on this, but one of my best friends was Chippewa B from down in

1209
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:44,800
Oschner. This is done with some Italian collaborators, but it's a really good meta-analysis

1210
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:53,200
of all the randomized data with Omega 3. And they show for every gram per day of EPA, DHA

1211
01:55:53,760 --> 01:56:00,720
taken, you reduce risk of MR, cardiovascular death, and even trends towards all cause mortality.

1212
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:05,680
But the point is, like a lot of the studies just use one gram, but if you use two, three, four grams,

1213
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:12,560
you see these really remarkable, like in the reduced study, 25 to 30% reduction in cardiovascular

1214
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:18,400
events and all cause mortality, even in people, especially if they have triglycerides above 150.

1215
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:24,080
The question about whether it's EPA versus DHA, the evidence in that trial was EPA. But if you

1216
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:29,600
look at the meta-analysis, as long as you're getting that dose of EPA and DHA, I think it's

1217
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:34,720
important to have some DHA in the supplement too, just because again, it's important for the

1218
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:39,360
membranes. And our evolutionary experience would suggest we weren't just using EPA,

1219
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:43,360
using the combination. I'll tell you, I agree with you completely on that. And this is,

1220
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:47,600
I put this in the category of things I can't wait to learn. I mean, sometimes I just get excited

1221
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,800
about the state of natural knowledge and how it continues to evolve. And I can't wait to see five

1222
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,560
years from now what we know on this question, because I was a bit surprised by the combined

1223
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:03,120
EPA, DHA trial. I really expected that to be a favorable response, especially in light of what

1224
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:10,080
we saw in the four gram EPA visepa trial. So again, we just have to see where this thing goes,

1225
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:13,440
but I agree with you. That was the strength trial you were talking about.

1226
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:18,960
That's right. That was halted early. Yeah. So it might be that four grams of EPA in that

1227
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:23,840
concentrated form is the way to go in a super high risk person for cardiovascular disease,

1228
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:31,120
but a combination of EPA and DHA through food, oily fish, as you said, might be what's conferring

1229
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:36,560
the real benefit. That's how we got it in nature. I think the broader question always comes to,

1230
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:43,680
is there a harm of higher doses of EPA and DHA? And I feel very confident now that the answer to

1231
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:50,400
that question is no, provided you're getting your product through a clean source. I think the answer

1232
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:55,760
is no. And so we have zero affiliation with any companies that produce any of these products.

1233
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:04,320
And we had a third party do a validation of Carlson's, which is the one that we have preferred

1234
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:10,880
for our patients. And we found it to be pure without contaminant and it contained what it

1235
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:16,240
said it contained. So I'm always happy to pay that little bit of a premium for that product

1236
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:20,800
to at least get an over the counter version. That's, that's good. So, so I don't have to sort

1237
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,520
of fork over for a prescription version. Yeah. I'm the chief medical officer for a company called

1238
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:31,920
Cardiotabs. We, you know, I don't get paid anything from them, but that's kind of my goal

1239
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:38,000
with them too. And we also source it from Norway. They know more about purifying, concentrating,

1240
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,800
detoxifying Omega-3 than anybody in the world, as far as I'm concerned, and usually go over to

1241
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,840
Scandinavia there and visit with the leaders in that just to see what their latest and greatest

1242
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,800
stuff is. But yeah, this is a food and I think it's, it's super important, not only for cardiovascular

1243
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:58,240
health, but Peter, the latest data on mental health is, is really important. Again, this is

1244
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:02,720
a fundamental component of cell membranes that most Americans, upwards of like 90%

1245
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:08,560
of Americans aren't getting enough Omega-3 in their diet. And it correlates with depression,

1246
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:15,840
ADHD, suicide, cognition, dementia, all those things. I mean, this is like an super easy way

1247
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:20,320
to markedly improve mental health. My wife, Joanne is constantly harping on this,

1248
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:27,360
that, you know, there's all this violence and suicide and depression. And like, the basic

1249
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:33,120
thing to do is take a nice high dose of Omega-3 every day. It's harmless, it's cheap, and it has

1250
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:38,320
profound benefits. And lots of times you can keep people off of, off of antidepressant medications

1251
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:45,280
that in a, like a well-absorbed curcumin with high dose Omega-3 is as good as any or better than any

1252
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:50,240
antidepressant out there. And they also have to improve brain function. And again, your doctor

1253
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:56,480
won't prescribe these, but these are very, very effective ways to improve mood, cognition, and

1254
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:00,960
probably reduce dementia in the long run. We have a paper coming out, I sent you a copy of it,

1255
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:05,360
the journal Alzheimer's disease showing that, that a highly absorbable curcumin,

1256
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:12,480
a theory curamen in a randomized trial. The study was a TNF-alpha inhibition for preventing dementia

1257
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:17,680
and TNF-alpha, as you know, is this master hormone of inflammation. And there's some really

1258
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:23,280
fascinating, which we outlined in this sort of systematic review, that the biologics that reduce

1259
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:31,200
TNF-alpha, like a Tanner-cept is the best one. It's a decoy receptor for TNF-alpha. And so it reduces

1260
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:36,960
inflammation. And there's multiple big studies of millions of people in databases that's all

1261
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:42,160
observational data, but that it reduces risk of Alzheimer's disease 60 to 70%. Now those are

1262
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:47,520
expansive biologics that sometimes can cause serious side effects, but curcumin is the activity

1263
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:53,200
of turmeric. And if you use a highly absorbed one, you get some pretty impressive reductions in TNF-alpha

1264
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:58,000
that have been correlated in small randomized trials with reduction. And there's good animal

1265
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,880
models on this too. I mean, it's one of the most exciting things to me right now is I really think

1266
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:08,320
this is easily the most exciting thing ever for maintaining cognition, preventing Alzheimer's

1267
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:13,520
disease. And it still needs to be flushed out, but there's some very good biological plausibility

1268
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:19,360
behind it and some fascinating animal data, human data, and even some small randomized trials.

1269
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:23,600
You know, working with Richard Isaacson, who I've interviewed for this podcast, and I'll be

1270
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:29,200
interviewing again shortly, we've sort of put together our in-house kind of playlist for

1271
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,800
basically once we identify patients that we deem high risk for Alzheimer's disease, which

1272
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:40,720
we define as age over 60, a relative that has a history of Alzheimer's disease, or at least one

1273
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:48,000
copy of an APOE4 gene, or some other gene such as an anti-TNF gene or Tom40, or one of these other

1274
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:54,720
genes that tends to be associated with Alzheimer's disease plus or minus APOE4. We just have sort of

1275
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:59,760
a full court press approach. And one of the things on that list is indeed thermocumen for exactly the

1276
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,560
reasons you've stated. I became pretty impressed with those data about two years ago. And so I was

1277
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:09,760
excited when you sent over that manuscript last week. So you noticed that Richard Isaacson was a

1278
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:17,120
co-author on that paper as was Gary Small from UCLA, who's in my opinion, those guys are two top

1279
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:22,240
brain scientists in the country for things like preserving cognition. So yeah, I mean, I think

1280
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:27,360
that the people who are best informed on that would agree with you on that approach.

1281
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:34,000
You know, I guess closing thought, James, is I'm just impressed by the breadth of your

1282
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:41,360
curiosity and obsession. You know, again, interventional cardiology is a niche sport,

1283
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:47,600
right? It's a, you know, you're a cath jockey at that point. And you sort of left that behind,

1284
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:53,520
and the world has become your oyster, so to speak. And you're now interested in the role that

1285
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:59,360
Theracuman can play in inhibiting tumor necrosis factor in the development of dementia. I mean,

1286
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:04,720
do you ever kind of look back and reflect on the journey of your career? I'll pause there

1287
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:10,880
before asking another question. I just followed my heart and what I was most interested in and

1288
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:16,000
I like to joke that, I mean, I'd be doing the same thing right now if I wasn't getting paid. I mean,

1289
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:22,400
I love what I do. And I think of life as, you know, like this gift of we have our time here

1290
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:27,600
on earth and it's about like helping others and making a positive difference. And I'm just so

1291
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:33,600
grateful that we live now where we have all these tools. And like you say, it's just so exciting.

1292
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:38,800
There's all this emerging data for people who are trying to pay attention. It kind of like that line

1293
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,920
from Dickens was it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. You know, there's a lot of

1294
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:48,240
people out there that, you know, suffering from all sorts of terrible things. A lot of it's

1295
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:52,400
lifestyle related and it's not their fault. I mean, it's like this whole world is set up to

1296
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:57,760
minimize activity and maximize calorie consumption. But there's also people who are paying close

1297
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:03,840
attention and we have all these powerful tools and use this information to help each other

1298
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:09,600
and to live not only longer, but more sort of active and fulfilling and enjoyable lives. So

1299
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:13,600
to me, it's just a blast. My last question then, James, would be,

1300
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:20,000
if there's somebody listening to this who wants to go into medicine and feels or is in medicine

1301
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,880
for that matter and kind of feels the same conviction you do, which is the real answer

1302
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:30,240
is in preventing disease and whether that's their passion is in cancer or cardiovascular disease or

1303
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:35,680
neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, whatever the case might be, you know, you said it at the outset,

1304
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:40,640
nobody's reimbursing really for prevention. You've got to kind of create your own path.

1305
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:47,920
What would your advice be to somebody who wants to become a preventative oncologist,

1306
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:54,560
a preventative cardiologist, a preventative neurologist? How would you advise them to craft

1307
02:04:54,560 --> 02:05:00,960
their way? Well, that's a difficult question, but I can just tell you that it doesn't have to be all

1308
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:06,320
or nothing, you know, even like the calf jockeys, like they say, you know, some of my partners are

1309
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:11,200
calf jockeys, they're very enlightened about lipids. And you don't necessarily have to do it

1310
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:17,040
all the time, but you need to be able to be well versed enough to strongly endorse it. And I mean,

1311
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:23,360
I'm in a big group of 65 cardiologists with another 50 nurse practitioners or physicians

1312
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:28,640
assistants. And so I can kind of carve out that niche and live there most of the time, although

1313
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:33,840
I still ride in the hospital and that sort of thing. But in the future, this is going to be an

1314
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:38,400
increasingly important part of medicine. People are going to understand, you know, they'll pay a

1315
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:46,160
lot to have their life optimized, not only for longevity, but also for enjoying life and being

1316
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:51,760
fully functional. And I think it's never been a better time to get interested in prevention.

1317
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:58,880
It's just, it's a lot of blue sky out there and a lot of promising therapies and lifestyles and

1318
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:04,800
strategies that we can deploy now. I've enjoyed this discussion immensely, as is the case with

1319
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:10,560
virtually every podcast. I learn at least one thing. And in this one, I've learned many things

1320
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:15,600
that I can't wait to take back to my patients and frankly to myself. So thank you for your

1321
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:21,760
generosity and thank you for continuing to mentor me. I've considered you both a friend and teacher

1322
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:25,600
for many years now. And I look forward to that continuing. Thanks for the opportunity,

1323
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,600
Peter. It's really my honor to be on your show. Thank you for listening to this week's episode

1329
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:01,280
The word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these. Monthly AMA episodes or ask me

1330
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:06,000
anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast

1331

feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this. The

1332
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:16,160
Qualies, which are a super short podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday, highlighting

1333
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:21,040
the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great

1334
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:26,080
way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone.

1335
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:32,080
Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse,
