00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Peter, Bill, how are you guys doing?

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,040
Doing all right.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
Doing good.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,800
This is the first time we've ever done three people in person, so we'll see how it goes.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,080
But it should be fun, and I think what we're here to talk about is the book. So by the

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,440
time this comes out, the book will be out, which is still kind of crazy to think about,

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,960
more so for probably both of you who have been much more involved in the process than

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,160
me. But I think what we did is we collected a ton of questions from the audience on wanting

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,200
to understand the process of the book, who Bill is, what the cover means, what's talked

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,640
about, all of that stuff. And so we collected those questions. We're going to cover them

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,360
today, and it should be kind of a fun way to learn more about the book, what's involved,

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,240
kind of that inside baseball story about it. So with all that said, I think the first thing

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,560
we should start with is Peter, how's the voice doing?

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,600
I would say it is like 80% of the way back to normal.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,120
Do you want to tell people who are maybe unfamiliar how the book tried to kill you through your

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
voice?

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,560
I think the book has tried to kill us in many ways, but I think most recently, between reading

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,640
the book for the audio book and then getting some virus and then having a hectic travel

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,480
schedule to try to do some podcasts, I basically just developed the worst case of laryngitis

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,000
and had a pharyngeal abscess that caused my vocal cords to stop working.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,280
Oh, yeah, which in your profession you kind of need. So it's good that they made their

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
way back.

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,040
Yes, but I will say this, I really enjoyed not speaking for two weeks.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,720
Sort of a vow of silence kind of thing.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,440
It was just amazing. I was like, it was amazing how many things I got to tune out. I'd hear

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,560
people call my name and I'd be like, I can't do anything about it, so I'm just going to

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
sit here.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,440
How did the family take that? Did they set it to their advantage?

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,160
They absolutely loved it. The boys were, what was really funny was the first couple of days,

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,860
everybody else got very quiet in response to me being quiet. So actually it's very interesting.

32
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,480
One of the few times social media turned out to be insightful and helpful. After I posted,

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,600
I think the second video of the direct laryngoscopy, someone, a very astute, actually several

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,640
commenters said, hey Peter, by the way, don't whisper. Because that was basically all I

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,400
could do. I could go like, I can sort of do this. And they said, don't whisper. Whisper

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,720
is a bad form of phonation. It's actually teaching you the incorrect movements. Either

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,660
don't speak or speak normally, but at the lowest volume possible. I was like, that really

38
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,000
makes a ton of sense because my throat was actually starting to hurt from all the whispering.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,920
It was utilizing muscles incorrectly and stuff like that. So anyway, so I'm talking very

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,120
quietly and my boys who as you know are not, you can use a lot of words that describe them,

41
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,800
quiet would not be on those lists.

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,240
Definitely not one of them.

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,000
They got so quiet in response to me being quiet that I was like, I got to figure out

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,200
a way to just do this enduringly.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Yeah. Next time you have people over, you need to just be under control. It's just going

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,240
to, I can't talk to you.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,560
Yeah. So you learned the parenting hack.

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Yes, totally. The quieter you are with your kids, the quieter they are about treatment.

49
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,360
One of the questions that we'll get to later is, will you ever write a second book? Which

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,760
you say no, I'm curious what Bill thinks, but maybe if you do, that could be the parenting

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,040
hacks 101. Just lose your voice.

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,200
So I think we'll kind of get into it and we have a lot of questions to get through, but

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,520
the first one, which I think makes the most sense and which to start with, which is relevant

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,200
to the book sitting in front of us and the cover is, I think people would ask, we understand

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,600
how to outlive and what that means, but where does the science and art of longevity come

56
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,640
from and why was that so important to include in the title?

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:22,520
Well I mean, the title was actually an evolution. So the first title I had in mind when I wrote

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,240
my manifesto, which was an awful title, but it was the longevity manifesto, which of course,

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:36,100
obvious reasons got scrapped immediately, but the working title during, call it 2016

60
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,520
when we were shopping, the proposal around was the long game. So that was kind of the

61
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,320
working title that pretty quickly got replaced by outlive for I think obvious reasons and

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,280
I think I've talked about why I like that title so much and why, I don't know, we never

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,040
really even questioned it, right? I don't think there was ever a point where we thought

64
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,760
of something else for the main title. Yeah, I mean, I think there was a moment when I think

65
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:10,920
a previous publisher questioned it, but I think it's just very evocative and it's very simple.

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,400
And it's an action. Yeah. And you think, it could mean different things to different people,

67
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,920
but I think of like, you're going to outlive your expectations or outlive your parents or

68
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,480
your grandparents. Your fate is not set in stone is kind of the idea. So to your question

69
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:39,120
about the subtitle, art and science is a pretty common term. People understand that this is the

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,240
art and science, this is the art and science, but I felt that there were two things that needed to

71
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,520
be communicated. One, the study of human longevity is part science and part art, but the science

72
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,120
should come first. So that's why I wanted to flip that order and say it's the science and art of

73
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:04,520
longevity. And I think in the book, we make a pretty good case for where the application of each

74
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:12,120
comes, right? Why this is not, if this were a book about mouse longevity, that could just be the

75
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,040
science of longevity. Because in mice, you can do all of the definitive experiments and answer all

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:25,960
these questions. And in humans, as is readily apparent, we will never know definitively what

77
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,080
the answers are. And therefore we always have to have some art involved. So Peter, another question

78
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,680
we got is you often talk about longevity having two components, the lifespan piece, which is how

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,000
long you live, and the health span piece, which is how well you live. The lifespan piece is kind of

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,920
covered a little bit with the outlive. But we did get a question to someone wondering, was it purposeful

81
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,040
that health span didn't make the title? Or kind of what was the thought process there?

82
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,560
I see, I think outlive encompasses both truthfully, I think, you know, to Bill's earlier comment,

83
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:05,480
outliving is more than about the chronological years of life. It's about the quality of life as

84
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,280
well. And so I think next, the most common question we got, as it related to the cover is,

85
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,960
can you explain the cover art? And I know for those listening or watching, it went through a

86
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,600
lengthy process of a lot of different iterations. So do you maybe kind of want to talk about that,

87
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,160
why you ultimately settled on this and kind of to you what it means?

88
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:39,240
Yeah, I think the cover is interesting because there were two things that in the back of my

89
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,480
mind were enormous stressors as we got closer and closer to the finish line. And by that,

90
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:53,940
I mean, basically by about the spring of 2022, so about exactly a year ago, you know, we had a

91
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,040
manuscript that was, we knew it was too long. It was probably about 190,000 words at that point.

92
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,160
So we knew it was going to get a big haircut, but we knew we basically had the book at that point.

93
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,960
But these two things that kind of nagged at me and kept me up at night were, how could this be

94
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,960
represented in a cover? And who is going to read this book for the audio book? Those two things

95
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,960
just created such a low level anxiety for me. I can't even talk about it. And so as the spring

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,840
turned into this summer, and our publisher is like, okay, like, we need to get on this cover

97
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,920
thing. And they've got kind of a checklist of, okay, for the book to come out in March,

98
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,600
we have to have this thing designed by here and da da da da da. I just didn't even have a sense

99
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:49,280
of what one does because I couldn't, you know, as Bill can say, I have very strong opinions about

100
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,520
everything. I couldn't even offer an opinion on the cover, right? All I could say was, I want it

101
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,520
to be elegant. I want it to be kind of timeless. I don't want it to be too busy. Like I had vague

102
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,600
ideas of what I wanted. And as you know, I'm a font fanatic, so I kind of understood the fonts

103
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,360
I wanted, but no sense artistically of what was wanted. So then Bill sent, this is probably August,

104
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,760
right? You sent over an email of a guy named Rodrigo Carell, who I'd never heard of before,

105
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,400
but you sent over, I think his website. Yeah, my sister is a book designer and he's like a big,

106
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,940
he's revered in those circles. And we looked at some of his designs. Yeah. And I really

107
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:42,720
kind of popped. And I was like, yes, this is elegant. And while that's happening in parallel,

108
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:51,400
the publisher is churning out designs as well. And I'm kind of like, okay, there's a couple of

109
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:03,600
these that I could see iterating on. And basically we weren't really making a ton of progress until

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,480
we, I think just collectively decided. And really, I think Bill has contributed a lot of things to the

111
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,360
project. But if I was going to say the single most important thing Bill contributed was being

112
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,520
adamant that we engage with Rodrigo. And this was late in the game. This was October, if I'm not

113
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:31,240
mistaken. And I remember where I was, I was on a flight and I got an email from Bill and it was

114
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,440
said something to the effect of, cause we were looking at something that I was almost going to

115
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,880
capitulate on. It was a design. I remember what the design was. And I basically was saying,

116
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,360
it's a solid seven out of 10 and I'm too tired to do anything about it. And Bill was like,

117
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:56,240
this is bullshit, man. We've worked way too hard on this book to have a seven out of 10 cover. I

118
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,760
think we just, we just, we just, we go and get Rodrigo and it doesn't matter how much it costs

119
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,200
and it doesn't matter how much it slows the process down. We do it. And I was like, yeah,

120
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,960
Bill's right. I don't want to regret this. I don't want to, I don't want to be sitting here in 10

121
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:19,480
years going, why did we do that? So then we reached out to Rodrigo, had a long call with him.

122
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:29,040
And I guess this is what makes great artists, great artists is even having this call, just

123
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,720
talking with him about the book. He didn't have a chance to read the whole book cause it's long.

124
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:44,120
And I mean, within three days he threw up 30 covers. And they're all different, totally different,

125
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,000
all sort of evocative. I mean, there were some, there were some images that I liked and that you

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,680
liked and other people liked and but different ways to kind of evoke this concept of longevity

127
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,200
and outliving and living better and all that stuff, which I mean, it's really easy to also

128
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,560
get that wrong visually. Like the, I was telling Nick about the Korean cover of my book,

129
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,160
Spring Chicken, that portrays a fat guy on a beach chair, like frying an egg. And that's

130
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,120
supposed to mean longevity. So there's many ways it can go off the rails. So I think there was

131
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,520
something about this and I think, I don't think this was your favorite at first either.

132
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,720
It was, but it was in my top six. So I remember he sent over 30 and I think we each decided to

133
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,800
pick our top five or top six. This was on for all of us. It had a very different font. There

134
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
were a number of things about it that were different at the time. And I think the font

135
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,720
threw me off the first time around. Font guy. Yeah. Font guy. I'm very particular about my fonts.

136
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,760
And to make a very long story short, we ultimately decided this was the one we were going to make

137
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:06,280
the winner. And, you know, I wish I could sit here and tell you that the blue, green, yellow,

138
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,880
pink all signify something. I can't tell you that. What I can tell you is it signifies a bunch of

139
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,440
things to me, right? It signifies kind of a keyhole that you're walking through. It's a passage,

140
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,800
but it also looks like a target. And that's a big part of this. There's a very subtle theme

141
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,640
in this book about lots of metaphors that revolve around archery. Anyway, I could talk

142
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,360
about it length. I'm not sure, Bill, what you're saying. Well, it's different. I showed it to

143
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,640
different people, like my partner, Martha, and various other people and everybody kind of liked

144
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,920
it, but they had a different reason to say, I like it because it's like an aura. I like it because

145
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,080
it's like you're going into the beyond, into the future or, you know, the little guy there,

146
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,680
let's not forget him, is an important part. That was an important addition. So it was different

147
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,920
things to different people. And that spoke to the art side of it, science and art.

148
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,960
And I think that that's, I think that it speaks to what art is, right? Art means different things

149
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,520
to different people. And in that sense, I think the cover, I just wanted a cover that I would

150
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,840
like to look at. And I have certain books that I love looking at their covers. And so I wanted

151
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,040
this to be one of them. Yeah. And it is interesting too, as you kind of mentioned, like what makes

152
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,600
Rodrigo so good. And when we saw that list of 30, you were just every time you would look at another

153
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,200
one, you're like, this could easily be it. There literally wasn't a bad one on his list of 30.

154
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,040
That's the thing. Like every one of those was reasonable. And there were a handful that were

155
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,960
exceptional. And there was one that was perfect. Yeah. Yeah. It just shows people who are experts

156
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,680
at their craft, how good they are and how they can think so differently. And this cover, yeah,

157
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,840
it turned out really, really well. And I think I drove everybody absolutely insane with all the

158
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:09,040
font changes I made. I was going to say, I think to say you're fanatic about fonts does not do it

159
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,840
justice how fanatic you are about fonts. Yeah. One little inside baseball thing here. If you go with

160
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,280
this font, the commas work out to be much cruder. And so I was like, nope, we can't do that. We have

161
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,320
to use a different font for the comma because the comma, I really wanted to be serif to a sans serif

162
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,880
font otherwise. And everyone was like, I mean, only Rodrigo was like, yeah, that totally makes

163
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,840
sense. Everyone else was like, Jesus Christ. Yeah. Everyone else was like, this comma is going

164
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,920
to cost this book, not actually getting done because the cover won't be done on time.

165
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,960
So I think it kind of pivots to the next question and Bill, you hinted at a little bit, but a lot

166
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,560
of people were kind of curious, you know, who is Bill Gifford? Like, what's his backstory? How did

167
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,120
he get involved in the book? So do you kind of want to give a little rundown of kind of who you

168
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,000
are, your story, and then ultimately how you initially got connected with Peter and the project,

169
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,240
which was six years ago now? It was end of 2017. Yeah. Yeah. I got an email out of the blue.

170
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,000
For me, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I knew who you were because I had read your, you know,

171
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,040
I knew you were, and I think in particular, I had read your insane 13 part series about cholesterol.

172
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:37,360
This is epic. And I had read that in the course of researching my own sort of more personal book

173
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,560
about longevity spring chicken, which came out in 2015. I thought I was done with longevity,

174
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:51,280
honestly, but this seemed interesting, but sort of to reel back, I'm, you know, like where other

175
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,880
kids' dads were throwing the football, passing the old baseball around, like my dad took me to

176
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:05,120
the library. So I became a writer eventually, and I just love writing and words. And I thought I

177
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,440
would be like a poet at one point when I was in college, but then I realized I like writing

178
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,960
to people and sort of connecting with people and evolved from sort of general journalism into

179
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,920
writing more and more about sort of scientific and medical topics and writing about like sports

180
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,000
performance and doping and cycling, and then more general health related topics. And then

181
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,200
got interested in, like Peter did, you know, you reach a certain age and you're like, huh,

182
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,080
what is happening here? You know, I'm not the guy I was 10 years ago. And there's this interesting

183
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,960
process going on. It's this big sort of biological mystery. It's super fascinating.

184
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,800
And it has not been solved. It still has not been solved. So yes, so I ended up writing about

185
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,240
longevity and I ended up writing, I write a lot about athletes too. So I found myself writing

186
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,840
about older athletes as well. Like Phil Mayer, the skier came back to racing when he was 50.

187
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,040
So I followed him around and he was competing against 22 year olds. So that kind of longevity

188
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,000
kind of fascinates me as well. And Peter, I actually don't know if I know the story,

189
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,480
but you mentioned you first reached out to Bill. So what caused you to do that

190
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,960
throughout the writing process? Well, so in 2016, I was working with an agent.

191
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:39,920
This book got sold to a different publisher. And, you know, I was the author of the book and I'm

192
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,000
working on it nights and weekends, you know, while I'm doing my day job. And I finally have

193
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,400
kind of the first part of the book to submit. It was just under 40,000 words. And I submit it to

194
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:03,120
my agent who then submits it to the publisher. Now, by this point, the editor who had bought the book

195
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,360
had left. So there was this woman who was at the publisher and I seem to like her and I thought

196
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
she really got the concept of the book. But unfortunately, and I guess this is not uncommon

197
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,320
in publishing, within a couple months of me coming on with the publisher, she gets a better job at

198
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,320
another publisher. So she's gone. So now another editor basically comes on. It's now her book,

199
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,920
but she doesn't really have as much invested in it. And so I submit this first section to them.

200
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:42,640
And it is met with a very lukewarm response. And they really had two huge criticisms of it.

201
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:52,320
The first was, it's too technical. And I, you know, I can see why that's the case.

202
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,720
The second was there was no story in it, right? There was no narrative. It was mostly just a

203
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:09,040
scientific treatise on the subject matter. And so then my, I guess both my agent and the publisher

204
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:16,240
said, look, we think you should bring a co-author in who can help massage and smooth this out and

205
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:24,080
make it, you know, a better book for the lay person to read. So I said, okay, how do we go about

206
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,160
doing that? And they said, we've got a long list of people to introduce you to. I said, great.

207
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,640
So sure enough, the courting began and every, this is back when I was in New York constantly,

208
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,880
because I was, you know, this, you know, this is back when I traveled a lot to work there.

209
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,720
And so basically every week that I'm in New York, I'm meeting another author. And usually what would

210
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,120
happen is they would send me one of their books. I'd, you know, read as much of the book as I could

211
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,480
get through or skim it or something and then sit down with them. And I kind of went through five

212
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,440
or six of these. And it just, I was like, there's no way this person gets it. Like this person has

213
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:10,880
no clue what I'm trying to write about. And this is not going to work. So then I talked to Bob

214
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,200
Kaplan and I said, Bob, here's the problem. What do you, do you have any ideas? He goes, yeah, let's,

215
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,800
let's go find somebody who's already written about what you find interesting and see. And the very

216
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,080
first thing that I remembered, what year did you write that Bloomberg piece on Rapamycin? Was that

217
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:39,440
2015? I think that came out, um, 2015. Yeah. Early. So it's actually interesting that you wrote it

218
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,520
back then, because this was still sort of pre hype of geoscience. Yeah. But there was an article in

219
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,360
Bloomberg, yeah, I guess 2015 that, you know, because I was obsessed with this stuff, I read

220
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,080
everything that came out. And this was the first one that I read that I was like, this is a very

221
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,280
good article. Most of them were so simplistic. They just missed the point, but this was a very good

222
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:13,760
article. Um, and so I said to Bill, I said to Bob, I said, this is the guy, because he already

223
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,960
gets it. I'm not going to have to like, you know, explain to him this, that or the other thing, or

224
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,240
at least I said, like, my intuition is that he will get it. And I don't, did I contact you through

225
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,200
Twitter? How did I, I do remember reaching out to you, was it through your website or through

226
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
you just emailed me? Yeah. Yeah. So somehow I just got Bill's email. Maybe it was on the article

227
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,640
and I, I don't remember what the email said, but I do remember we met for dinner on the upper east

228
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,000
side one day in late 2017. Yep. And I think I probably just said everything I just said now,

229
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,360
which is, you know, and, and, and by that point, so what did I send you to read? What was the

230
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,640
version I had sent you at that point? I think it wasn't the 38,000 words. It was more like,

231
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,120
I think I probably by that point, it was kind of the proposal. It was like 5,000 or something.

232
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,400
And you know, some interesting, I was just thinking about it. Like I think some of the

233
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:12,560
DNA of that is definitely in part one. Yep. Like if you did a, you know, text analysis,

234
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,960
you'd probably find some bits of that sprinkled in there. You know, it had the sort of the central,

235
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,160
central ideas in part one. Yeah. So you had to start, but you know, starting is super hard.

236
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:33,520
And then keeping going is even harder. And then figuring out that you're done is the hardest of

237
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:42,720
all. So you had to start. I had no idea how hard this would be. I mean, I, I, I'm sure every first

238
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:51,600
time author says that, but this was so much more difficult, so much more time consuming

239
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:59,040
than, than anything I could have imagined. I do remember in the early days, we spent a lot of

240
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,280
time in front of a whiteboard in my office. Yes. And that was the easiest way for me to communicate

241
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:13,840
kind of broad strokes was, you know, this is how I think of these as pillars. This is how I think

242
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,560
of these as foundations. This is this, this is that. Yeah. We had a lot of pillars and foundations.

243
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:27,360
Yeah. Frameworks. Lots of frameworks. And I feel like that was kind of the easiest way, I think,

244
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:35,440
to get us on the same page about how I was thinking about it. But the structure that emerged

245
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,480
in the final book, which is basically, you know, three big sections that communicate, you know,

246
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,400
each important and builds on the other. I feel like that didn't really crystallize until,

247
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:59,440
gosh, I mean, 2019, I don't, 2018 is a blur. Right? Like I don't, I don't remember

248
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:08,080
the difficulty. I mean, I do in some ways, but, but clearly there was a, so if version one of the

249
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,400
book was what we just talked about, the sort of pre-bill, then there was version two, which was

250
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,880
the book that got written basically from the beginning of 2018 through the beginning of 2020.

251
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,120
Yeah. Yeah. And it, even in that period, so the two things I remember, first of all, I remember

252
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,320
you ordered about half the menu at that Turkish restaurant and the waiter was like all for you.

253
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,800
This was back when I was eating just one meal a day. So it was like, I would fast all day and

254
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,880
then basically throw down 3000 calories at dinner. Yeah. So I was like, this is whatever this is

255
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,960
going to be, it's not going to be dull. And then the other thing is sort of, we had a basic template.

256
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,440
We kind of outlined, okay, what's the book going to be? It's going to be, you know, 25%

257
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:08,480
kind of this part one, this kind of the manifesto stuff. And then it was going to be basically a

258
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,440
biology of aging book. I mean, that was kind of where we were going, the Rapamycin stuff and the

259
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:24,560
kind of mechanisms that, the hallmarks of aging, almost like the molecular cellular level stuff.

260
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,040
And then we were like, you were like, 10% tactics.

261
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,720
I didn't want any tactics in it. I want to do that.

262
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
Yeah. Maybe 5% tactics.

263
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
We were making appendix with a couple of tactics in it.

264
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah. We had 200 pages on tactics.

265
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,200
What did the publisher say when you said, I'm actually not going to tell anyone what to do in

266
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
this book? No, they were apoplectic.

267
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,520
And what do you, you mentioned it was so hard to kind of write and it obviously took a very long

268
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,400
time. What do you think was so hard about the process? Was it translating the science into

269
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,800
something that was more of a story? Was it figuring out how to verbalize the frameworks?

270
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,280
Was it just getting what was in your head cohesively on paper?

271
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,920
I think there are a couple of things. So first of all, I love writing. I've been, you know,

272
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:20,560
been blogging for, for as long as I can remember, but that's a very different style of writing.

273
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,480
You know, Bill was talking about my 13 part cholesterol series.

274
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,920
You don't have any constraints when you're blogging. You can go as deep as you want to go

275
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,360
because you are attracting an audience of similar weirdos who are going to go as

276
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,280
far down the rabbit hole as you will take them. And so I think the biggest struggle I had

277
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,000
switching to this kind of writing, and it's so funny for me to look at this version of the book

278
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,720
now and compare it to what I was writing in 2018. And I remember Bill really tolerated a lot of my

279
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,960
stupid things that I was writing and what the basic, basically how he tolerated it was he made

280
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,760
a lot of footnotes. He was like, all right, I really want to delete all of this, but we're going

281
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,800
to make it a footnote. And of course, four years later or three years later, I was the one deleting

282
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,440
those footnotes. And I was like, this is so gratuitous. Like it doesn't matter that much.

283
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,440
And that to me is a remarkable evolution, I guess, that everyone has to go through.

284
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,320
You know, Bill presumably went through this 30 years ago, right? But for me, that was new. That

285
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:37,680
was like, no, but I do need to explain the extracorporeal circulation of the liver in this

286
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,320
section. And Bill is like, I don't think that's really important. And I was like, no, no, no,

287
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,640
Bill, you don't understand. If the reader doesn't understand portal blood flow here,

288
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,560
they will never understand why glycogen gets there. And he's like, Peter, I can assure you there are

289
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,120
seven people who give a shit about that. And I was like, no, no, Bill, it's important. He's like,

290
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,040
all right, let's make it a footnote. Fine, let's make it a footnote. I was pissed. And then of

291
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,040
course, two years later, I'm like, that's so goddamn irrelevant. Get rid of it.

292
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,160
But you have to know it though, to be able to write intelligently, like you have to know it and you

293
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:17,520
have to know what's going on. But then you also have to decide, you're talking about getting in

294
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,760
the weeds, right? And you have to know all the weeds to write well about science. But then you

295
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,480
also have to, and I think ultimately we both got pretty good at this, get pretty harsh about what

296
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,520
you're going to leave out. And we left out a lot of stuff. I mean, so much. It's like, it's the,

297
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,440
I mean, I think I've told this story before, but I remember when I was writing probably my first

298
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,160
or second scientific paper, you do a lot of experiments, most of which don't make it into

299
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,520
the paper. And I forget who it was that told me this. I think his name was Dan Powell. It was one

300
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,360
of the postdocs that I was in the lab with. And he said, you just have to learn how to kill your

301
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:07,600
babies. You're going to throw out 90% of this. And I just think that that for me was hard,

302
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:15,360
getting to that point of, but will the reader, if the reader doesn't know all of this, you know,

303
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,000
stuff below the surface, can they appreciate the piece of the iceberg above? And I think ultimately

304
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,000
the readers will determine if we've struck that balance correctly. I think we have.

305
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,880
And I'll tell you why I think so. I think it became readily apparent when I read the audio

306
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:43,440
version of the book, because when you're reading it out loud, it's very different from when you

307
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,840
read it the way one edits their own writing. Cause you're, you're, you're obviously reading it much

308
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:57,520
slower and you realize the unnecessary interruptions of endless footnotes that are

309
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,520
you know, incremental in what they're adding.

310
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,920
Yeah. It's kind of, it's interesting to hear you talk about it because I can't imagine,

311
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,680
I haven't read the first iteration, which I think you said practically none of it made the

312
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:20,720
final version, right? Certainly in direct content, absolutely not in spirit, some of it, but yeah.

313
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,680
I just can't imagine what it was is if you handed them a whole manifesto, zero tactical advice.

314
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,920
And literally explaining every little nuance of the liver, like I would just love to see the face

315
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,320
of the person who came in after that publisher left and read this and just was like, what the

316
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,720
hell are we going to do with this thing? I'm sure they were freaking out. So I think it makes sense

317
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,280
to kind of talk a little bit. You mentioned it there, but there's three main parts of this

318
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,920
book, right? So let's talk about what ultimately made it into this final version. Do you kind of

319
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,440
want to walk through what the structure of the book is, kind of some of that content? We don't

320
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,240
have to get into detail, but just kind of what people can expect to read about.

321
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,640
Yeah. I mean, look, there's three parts. I think the first part sets up the structure of the book.

322
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,680
It gets the frameworks across. You'll certainly as a reader understand the problem statement,

323
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:26,400
right? And again, I think you can't solve or even attempt to solve complicated problems if you

324
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,760
aren't asking the right questions and you don't have the right frameworks. That's something that

325
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,240
we posit very clearly here. And that's really what part one is about. And that's not just explaining

326
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,520
what longevity is and isn't, but it's explaining something called medicine 3.0, which is the

327
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:50,560
vehicle through which you pursue this thing. Then part two, sorry, I guess the other thing

328
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:57,200
in part one is I'm blanking on where the delineation occurs, but I think part one also

329
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,600
includes kind of some of the scientific underpinning, doesn't it? Or does that all get lumped in part

330
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,840
two? I think that's part two with the horses. That's part two. Yeah. So then part two is

331
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,640
probably the most technical part of the book where we get into the scientific underpinning

332
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,760
of everything coupled with get to know your opponents, basically, right? So there's no denying

333
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,440
this. A big part of this book is trying to figure out how to live longer. Now, not in terms of

334
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,240
science fiction living longer, but I mean, I think we argue very convincingly that a person reading

335
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,960
this book who puts these principles into practice is really thinking about elongating their life by

336
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,680
five to 10 years. But to do that, you really have to understand what are the things that are coming

337
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:50,080
to take your life. So we kind of go through all that in part two. And then part three is how do

338
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,760
you put this into practice? It is that which I initially didn't want to write about, but ultimately

339
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,960
think, I don't know, I think that section just turned out better than I ever could have imagined

340
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:15,440
it. It kind of organically evolved and kept growing and changing. But going back to part two,

341
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,680
I think we were looking at, because we're both fascinated by centenarians, we were looking at that

342
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:28,400
chapter and kind of hammering out that chapter. And we kind of had a little bit of a revelation

343
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,240
where it was like, wait, it's not like a big mystery how these people live to a hundred when

344
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:44,720
most people live to 80. They get heart disease much later, if at all. They get cancer much later,

345
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:56,400
or maybe never. And they get neurodegenerative disease later or never. And so that's the ball

346
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,800
game. You've got to figure out how to delay all of those diseases, which you call the horseman.

347
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,360
And we didn't even contemplate writing these chapters at the beginning. And then we decided,

348
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,560
no, we have to, because we have to, like you say, know the enemy, know the opponent.

349
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,720
That's right. Yeah, the first version of this, which is the first version that we wrote,

350
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,760
which is the second version of the book, was way heavier in the molecular science of aging.

351
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,720
So we came at this much more through, let's go really deep into autophagy. Let's go really deep

352
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,960
into nutrient sensing pathways. Let's go really deep into all of these things, which of course,

353
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:47,520
I found super interesting, but ultimately we pivoted much more towards this insight,

354
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,800
which is there are two completely different strategies to live long. One is figure out a way

355
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,400
to extend the period of time you live once you have a disease. And by the way, that's everything

356
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,800
medicine 2.0 does. We're going to wait till you have a disease and we're going to figure out a way

357
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,880
to just drag you through that and keep you from dying. Okay. That strategy has worked a little bit.

358
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,400
Strategy two, which is medicine 3.0 is no way we have to figure out the time. We have to figure

359
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,680
out a way to drag out the time you live without a disease. And to understand, you can't enter,

360
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,880
you can't play that game if you don't know everything about these diseases. You have to

361
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,840
become so intimately familiar with each of the horsemen. And, and of course, therefore, each of

362
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,320
those horsemen has a very robust chapter. As I'm listening to you talk, I'm curious, do you think

363
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,240
for as tough as it was to write the book and all the pain to go through that process over the years,

364
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,400
do you think how you practice medicine with your patients, what we talk about on the podcast,

365
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,160
weekly newsletters, how all that structured, do you think it would evolve to what it is

366
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,960
if you didn't write the book? I mean, I think they help each other for sure. I think,

367
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,600
I mean, you can't write well if you don't think well. And you could argue it's hard to think well

368
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:22,080
if you're not able to write well. So I think the relentless process of streamlining and figuring

369
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,400
out how to get to the point sooner, all of those things would absolutely force me to,

370
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,320
to reconsider how things were happening. By the way, I think a lot of what's written in there

371
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,600
comes out of just the conversations I'm having with patients. I do, I don't, in fact, I know there

372
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,920
were certain times when I even asked patients, hey, do you mind if I record our Zoom today?

373
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,320
Because I, I just want to be able to go back and listen to how we talked about it. And they'd be

374
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,080
like, sure. And so I would walk them through all of their cardiovascular disease risk and then go

375
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,960
back and listen to it after and go, okay, yep, this is the way I would, this is a good version

376
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,280
of this talk. Because I give the same talk to patients constantly, but sometimes they're,

377
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,000
sometimes they hit better and sometimes they don't. And so having some recordings of those

378
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
was really helpful to kind of go back and remember how, what worked.

379
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,520
I think the, when you started the podcast, I think it was about six months,

380
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,520
it was about six months into the book writing process. I think that gradually that made you

381
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:36,880
more cognizant of how to communicate science and medical topics. I think maybe by nature,

382
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,520
you're a very data-driven kind of mathematical guy and you'll want to maybe just present like,

383
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:51,360
numbers and, you know, facts straight up. And I think doing the podcast, you kind of learned how

384
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:59,040
to, how to, how to kind of speak and, you know, introduce these subjects in a more sort of user

385
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,680
friendly way. It was an interesting progression. Yeah, that's true. We did start the, we started

386
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,960
the podcast in June of, or yeah, June of 2018. And I remember in the summer of 2017, so before we

387
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,520
were still working, when I was still working on version one, I was effectively podcasting,

388
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,320
but without podcasting. And in other words, I was flying around interviewing people, you know,

389
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,680
going up to Boston to meet with David Sabatini, meeting with Matt Caberlin, meeting with the

390
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,680
postdocs in their labs, sitting down and recording these interviews with them. And it was effectively

391
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,440
my foray into podcasting without, but it was all for the book. You know, these were all just

392
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,960
interviews that were used to sort of drive the book. And yes, what an evolution in that. That's

393
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,160
another, save that for another discussion. But boy, how difficult podcasting is too.

394
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,680
Yeah, it's kind of funny because some of those initial interviews ended up being some of the

395
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,280
first podcasts we released. That's right. I think we did end up using at least three of probably a

396
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,040
dozen of those as actual podcasts. And I think too, the interview, the first interview we did with

397
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,440
In You Go and Rick Johnson, that stemmed from you wanting to go talk to them or the book.

398
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,680
And we just kind of double dipped. So it is kind of funny to think about.

399
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,880
You know, a lot of those interviews, you'd come back and you'd be like, you gotta listen to this,

400
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,160
Billy, you gotta listen to In You Go. And so those fed into the, not only the writing of the book,

401
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,760
but sort of the evolution of thinking behind the book.

402
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,320
And it kind of fits in with a question we got asked quite a bit, which is,

403
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,800
it took you six years to write the book. There was a lot that changed in those six years as it

404
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,280
relates to science. There's a lot that's going to change in the next 10 years. And you, when you

405
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,400
announced the book, you kind of wrote about your goal with this book is it would still be applicable

406
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,440
in 10 years. So kind of people were curious, you know, how do you think about one writing a book

407
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,800
that can stand the test of time to, you know, what changed a lot in your mindset and where did

408
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:18,480
you evolve in that whole process? I mean, I think a lot of things changed in me in the six years.

409
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,600
Some of them just obviously very personal things, some of which I've written about in the book.

410
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,280
But I think more it has to do with emphasis, right? So there were things at the beginning

411
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:39,040
that were much more the emphasis in my mind and other things became more important over time.

412
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:48,400
So for example, at the outset of the writing of this book, I probably placed more of an emphasis

413
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,640
on nutrition than exercise as one of the important drivers, one of the important leavers we have at

414
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,800
our disposal. And I would say that my views on that have flipped. I think that exercise

415
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,360
has a bigger impact than nutrition. And certainly on the positive side, nutrition can have a pretty

416
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:13,760
big negative impact. But once it's corrected, it doesn't have this enormous upside, whereas exercise

417
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,160
has an enormous downside in its absence and an enormous upside in its presence. So that's,

418
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,920
you know, that's a, you're reading a different version of this book than you would have read

419
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,360
six years ago with respect to that. Or two years ago. Yeah, exactly. One year ago. Obviously,

420
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,440
you know, a book, this book written five years ago would have not had anything about emotional

421
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,080
health. There's not a lot on it, but there's something on it and I think it's relevant.

422
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:51,360
I think it's very framework focused, which I think lends to a more timeless piece.

423
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:58,400
Because frameworks or scaffoldings are there upon which to place information and substitute

424
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:06,000
information. So if the framework says delay the time that you do not have disease,

425
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,720
that's relatively timeless as a strategy. Now we're going to learn different things about these

426
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,400
diseases. I've been 10 years. My hope is that, you know, one, taking one example, liquid biopsies

427
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,000
should be a heck of a lot more valuable in 10 years than they are today. That's going to

428
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,200
completely change our approach and our efficacy of screening. So you'll have a different tactic

429
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,760
that you'll use in a toolkit to go about the strategy, but the goal is still the same.

430
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,720
So you're talking about liquid biopsies for cancer detection. Yeah. So if you can detect cancer

431
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,760
much earlier, it's treating, it's a whole different thing.

432
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah. And it's interesting because anyone who's listening to podcasts for a long period of time

433
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,360
will know, like hear you talk about things in a different way as you learn more information. And

434
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,960
I think sometimes a natural reaction from people is to be frustrated at that. And like, well,

435
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,520
why did you say this one time? And then you kind of change your mind. But I think to what you just

436
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,080
said, which is really important, it's probably worth spending a few minutes on it is you will

437
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,480
focus heavily on objective strategy tactic. And that's probably the reason why in the initial

438
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,800
version, it had zero tactics, which a lot of people are probably like, how do you write a

439
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,360
book that doesn't tell people what to do? But for you, it's how do you write a book that tells

440
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:35,440
people it's all about objective and strategy? Because as new information comes in, the tactic

441
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,400
may change, but the objective and strategy doesn't. Do you kind of maybe want to talk people through

442
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,720
how you think about that objective strategy tactic? Because I think it is applicable

443
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,360
for anyone who's going to read the book to really understand that for knowing how to take this

444
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,320
information and still make it applicable years down the road, not just months down the road.

445
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:02,720
Well, there's a whole chapter on it in part one, right? Which is like, why is it that we spend so

446
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:13,120
much time hammering this idea? And it's a simple concept, but it's amazing how often it's ignored.

447
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:20,240
So for starters, you do have to define the objective. And I won't say any more on that now,

448
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,120
but again, the objective, you'd be amazed at how many people would struggle to define their

449
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,400
objective, you know, oh, I'm taking this 27 different supplements, because I'm hacking my,

450
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,040
you know, whatever. And it's like, okay, what is your objective? And if you can't clearly state

451
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,800
that, then there's so much fog around this. The strategy is very important. And again, you know,

452
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,440
we open each chapter with a quote, but of the quotes, my favorite has to be the one that opens

453
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:54,560
that chapter, which is the Sun Tzu quote about strategy. What is it is the objectives,

454
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,880
sorry, strategy without tactics, without strategy is the noise before defeat or something.

455
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:08,400
That's right. That's it. And so we go to great lengths using lots of examples to really help

456
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,040
a person understand the difference between a strategy and then the tactics that they employ.

457
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,000
And we do this because we say the tactics are the most valuable things here. They're the things

458
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,320
that are going to change the most. And to your previous question, those are the things that have

459
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,520
already changed the most, right? So give you another example, right? Like how much emphasis

460
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,720
did I used to place on fasting? How much emphasis do I place on fasting today? Totally different.

461
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:41,040
I am positive that there is some set of drugs that I am either not taking now or don't even know what

462
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,720
they are now that I'll probably be taking in 10 years. And similarly, there's probably something

463
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,200
I'm taking now that in 10 years, I'm going to say the evidence for this sucks. I'm not going to do it.

464
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:57,360
So, you know, if I can't take that and anchor it back to a strategy, which is the reason I would

465
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,080
take this or wouldn't take this is because it feeds into one of these three overarching

466
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:09,440
principles that guides the subjective. Then I'm really just doing a bunch of random things

467
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:17,920
that aren't in concert. But you're also able and open to changing your mind. So, you know, one of

468
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:25,760
the things I noticed early on is like, you're not like a dogmatic person. If you get information or

469
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:32,240
a new interpretation of the existing data that kind of causes you to see something differently

470
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,360
and fasting is a big one. And Frank, I was a little bit relieved actually, because I knew I was going

471
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,840
to have to do it myself just to be able to write about it. But I wasn't looking forward to it. But

472
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,680
then you kind of got off the fasting. I think it had served a purpose for you.

473
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,440
Yeah. And again, there's still times when I think it makes sense, but yes, it just is one

474
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,800
specific example of this isn't something that everybody needs to be doing.

475
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,440
And one of the questions we got was, what areas of a book do you think within the next 10 years

476
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,120
will evolve the most? You mentioned there like liquid biopsies and cancer detection. Is there

477
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,280
anything else that you kind of think about when you write this book? If you're like, if I was

478
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,280
going to update this in 10 years, I had to make a guess on which sections I would want to refocus

479
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,480
on. Is there anything that you would think? Another way to think about it is, what in this

480
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,160
sphere are you kind of really excited about progress in the next 10 years?

481
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:42,000
I do think that we've taken a very aggressive posture on cancer screening for the reason

482
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,120
that Bill alluded to a moment ago, which is certainly in doing research for this book and

483
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:56,880
getting really deep in the weeds. There simply is no ambiguity that the earlier you catch cancer,

484
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,560
the better your odds are at treating it while it remains local.

485
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,200
Given the exact same histology of cancer, treating it when there are a billion cells versus treating

486
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,000
it when there are a hundred billion cells with the exact same therapy has such dramatically

487
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,920
different outcomes that there should be no question about that. You basically have to

488
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:30,160
put yourself into different camps. Are you of the mindset that we will come up with systemic cures

489
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:40,080
for cancer regardless of size and stage in the next couple of decades? Or do you think it is

490
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:46,000
more likely that we will get better and better at finding cancer when it is smaller and smaller

491
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and treating it with existing therapies? Now, those don't have to be mutually exclusive,

492
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,360
but the question is which one of those you think is more likely. I think the latter is much more

493
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:04,160
likely. We present it as such. Goal number one, don't get cancer. Goal number two, if you do get

494
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:12,160
cancer, catch it as early as possible. And then, and only then, goal number three is we get into

495
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,440
what are the most promising things. So I think that's another area where what we're seeing right

496
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:30,480
now with immunotherapy is so exciting. And I think we are right on the verge of unlocking the next

497
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,360
layer of immunotherapy, right? Which is once, and by the way, I think this gets to another part of

498
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,000
your question, which is what else would I be excited about in 10 years that is not in this

499
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,160
book? Because I think it's too soon for prime time. But if we could reprogram immune cells,

500
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,880
so you've heard a lot of talk about reprogramming. Well, reprogramming gets talked about nonstop and

501
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,440
there's so much nonsense there. But there is one subset of the human body that if it could be

502
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,760
reprogrammed would change the game and that's the immune cell. And by the way, that's much easier to

503
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,600
reprogram than like your heart or your liver or things like that, in my opinion, because of how

504
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:13,360
easily we can access those cells. If we could epigenetically reprogram T cells, I think it's

505
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,160
a totally different game when it comes to cancer therapy and cancer incidence.

506
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,400
I think, yeah, I would say maybe neurodegeneration.

507
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,400
Yeah, that's a good one too.

508
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:35,280
But that's someplace where we're nowhere in terms of effective treatments for Alzheimer's

509
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,360
disease or Parkinson's disease. Hopefully better data on prevention. Right now, we've taken,

510
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,040
and we do this in our practice as well, we're taking very much a kitchen sink approach,

511
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,920
which is there are a handful of things that, especially for dementia, less clear for the

512
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,680
movement disorders, there are a handful of things that unambiguously reduce your risk of dementia.

513
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:03,520
There seemed to be at least three, four, if we were going to be right clear, exercise,

514
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,760
management of lipids on the AD and dementia side, sleep, and not having diabetes.

515
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:20,160
Those things you can take to the bank. We talk about 27 other things for which the data are

516
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,680
not clear yet. To have more clarity around that would be great.

517
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:34,720
And as someone who's not in the scientific field, how you talk about cancer makes a lot of sense

518
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,600
in the idea of if the goal, like if you have better treatment, the earlier catch it,

519
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,880
you want to screen as early as possible. But you talk about in the book, kind of the difference

520
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,920
between medicine 2.0 and 3.0 and how that's not the case now. Why do you think that's,

521
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,360
I don't want to say controversial approach to it, but why is that not the norm? Because from the

522
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:04,880
outside and looking in, it's hard to poke holes in that idea. Do you mean why is the traditional

523
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:13,680
view of cancer screening different from kind of the view we present? Yes. I think if I'm going

524
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:20,160
to be fair and charitable to the outside view, it would be that it's being, we're basically

525
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,240
asking two different questions. Okay. So I think the question and the solution that we're proposing

526
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:35,440
is at the individual level. The outside view, I think is at the population or societal level.

527
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,080
So there was a recent study that got a lot of attention in Europe. I think it was published in

528
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:47,440
the New England Journal of Medicine that looked at colonoscopies. The study took a large group

529
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,880
of people and they were randomized into two groups. So one group was standard of care. Don't

530
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,840
do anything. The next group was suggested that they should have a colonoscopy in the next decade.

531
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,360
Okay. At the end of the decade, they were compared for rates of colon cancer and colon cancer

532
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:09,040
mortality and all cause mortality. And while there was a slight benefit to the group that were

533
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,960
recommended to get a colonoscopy, it was nothing to write home about. The relative and absolute

534
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,240
difference in colon cancer and colon cancer deaths, while statistically significant, didn't seem very

535
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:26,400
clinically significant. And opponents of colonoscopy said, look, this is proof positive that

536
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,800
colonoscopies don't save lives. The route of it is no, it's proof positive that telling people

537
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,080
to maybe get a colonoscopy once every 10 years, when by the way, I think less than 40% of them

538
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:43,040
actually did, probably doesn't save lives. That's very different from the example and the approach

539
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:49,760
that we take. I mean, I'm 50, I've already had three colonoscopies. I get them every three years

540
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,640
and I will continue to do that until my life expectancy is so short that it becomes irrelevant.

541
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:03,520
And again, totally different approach. So we have to, and am I suggesting that

542
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,000
everybody get a colonoscopy every three years? Of course I'm not. What I'm suggesting is,

543
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,080
that everybody think about their own risk reward trade off and decide what's the cost benefit

544
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,040
analysis. So there's an enormous cost to doing that. My insurance company doesn't pay for most

545
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:26,240
of those. They've paid for one of the three. There are risks of bowel preps, right? You do a bowel

546
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,240
prep in a person who's significantly older, who runs risks from the electrolyte abnormalities that

547
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,720
come from those things. All of those things have to be, I certainly wouldn't want my 86 year old dad

548
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,680
getting a colonoscopy under any circumstance. That ship has sailed, right? The bowel prep alone

549
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,960
could injure him, let alone the sedation of it. So one has to be very thoughtful and measured in

550
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,480
how they think about doing these things. And I think the long answer to your question is, I think

551
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,760
when people talk in blanket statements, like cancer screening is bad, they're generally speaking

552
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:06,080
through the lens of policy and population. And it kind of leads to another question we saw come

553
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,960
through quite a bit, which is, sometimes on the podcast, it can get technical, can kind of get in

554
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:19,520
the weeds. A lot of people were curious, how is the book compared to that in terms of technicality?

555
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,280
Is it something that obviously if you're an MD, PhD, you're going to be able to understand?

556
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,840
But what about for just the layman? Do you think they'll be able to get as much out of the book?

557
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:37,520
And was that kind of the hope and how you wrote it? And my guess is we can get Bill's response to that.

558
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,320
I was actually going to turn this question over to Bill first and then I'll chime in,

559
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,280
but I'd like to hear Bill's thoughts on that. I have a strong thought on this.

560
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:55,200
Well, I think we're both fascinated, probably more than me, but we kind of go down these rabbit holes

561
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,600
of the technical details, which I call the alphabet soup. Once you start streaming together,

562
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:09,520
a lot of acronyms like APOE and PSAN and all this stuff turns into alphabet soup.

563
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:16,240
And I sort of think of the podcast as like your playground to go deep with these scientists.

564
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,760
And it's tremendously valuable, right? Because they don't have really a lot of other, you can't

565
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:28,640
go on fresh air as a scientist and get into that level of detail. But I would say it's

566
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:35,520
considerably less technical than the podcast, but the basic message and the kind of the...

567
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:44,000
We cover a lot more ground, so we can't really go too deep on any one particular topic. Like I was

568
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:53,280
listening to the episode about HDL. It's super interesting, but like mind bogglingly complicated.

569
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:00,480
And we just didn't have the time or the need to go that deep. And I do hope that

570
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:09,200
they figure out how to enhance the function of HDL, but yeah, we can go that far.

571
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,400
There were probably some sections, actually, that's interesting. The cardiovascular section,

572
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
pretty detailed actually. We go pretty detailed in that section.

573
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:22,320
But we have to. And again, I think part of it is we're trying to add enormous value in writing

574
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,280
this. There's a lot of kind of me too books out there on this subject matter. And by me too,

575
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,600
I just mean it's just another book that is literally adding no value.

576
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,400
Saying the same thing.

577
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,640
Yeah, it's just saying the same thing. And our goal here was like, there's no chapter in this book,

578
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:45,360
none, that should ever just be another version of checking that box. And so on the chapter of

579
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:50,800
atherosclerosis, I mean, yeah, I think we do go probably deeper than certainly our editor would

580
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:59,040
have wanted. I think she was kind of to her credit, just accepted the fact that she might

581
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:06,720
not understand every word of it, but you don't need to necessarily understand every word of it

582
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,000
to understand what to do about it. And if you do want to go deeper, because we do get into HDL,

583
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,760
and we do comment on the fact that HDL functionality is not captured by HDL cholesterol and HDL

584
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,120
particle number and APOA concentration and all of those things. And we do have to talk about the

585
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:28,080
Mendelian randomizations and what they've taught us with respect to HDL cholesterol and what they

586
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:33,280
haven't taught us and things like that. So that's probably, yeah, that's probably a little more

587
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:41,040
technical than maybe the average person would want. But I think that overall, this book is

588
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:51,120
very readable by a person who is curious. And I agree that it is definitely a notch below the

589
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,520
technical depth of what we often do in our podcasts.

590
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:05,360
It's not it's not meant to be a textbook either. But kind of the way I think of it is you want

591
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:13,760
people to learn more than they expected without even realizing that they're learning, kind of

592
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:21,680
package it in a story or a metaphor. And the atherosclerosis chapter is a good example of that

593
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:28,800
because most people know, everybody knows about good and bad cholesterol. And I think Peter got

594
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:34,640
a little triggered by that and we're just going to go to town. And in the writing process,

595
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,120
what was it, how was that like between the both of you in the sense of,

596
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,440
were you often trying to keep Peter in check in terms of the scientific aspect of it, trying to

597
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:53,200
bring stories in kind of how, how would you both do that throughout? Because obviously, the book is,

598
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:00,240
I mean, it's a good chunk now, it clearly could be four times as long if you went into the detail

599
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,240
that you could go. So kind of where in the writing process did you decide, okay,

600
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,320
like this deserves to go deep, this doesn't, was there ever disagreement about that? Or kind of

601
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:20,320
how did that work? Yeah, I mean, I think Bill always thought about it through the lens of the reader.

602
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:29,840
And I think there was a very healthy tension between us on those things, for sure. And I say

603
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:35,840
healthy because it was never, I don't think, I think both of us would sit here and say,

604
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,280
never once did we have a disagreement that was about ego, right? We had lots of disagreements

605
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,320
about content. But it was like Bill saying, I don't think a reader needs to know this. And I'm

606
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:52,400
saying, Bill, I think a reader does need to know this. And it wasn't about like, I want to put this

607
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,760
in because it's mine. It was never about that kind of stuff. So yeah, I think there was always a great

608
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:03,520
and healthy tension about that. I think once, you know, there's a backstory here, which I,

609
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:10,960
we didn't really get into, but this book basically got killed in 2020. And then it died, like it was

610
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,240
left, it was left for dead. And it only got revisited with a whole new publisher and a whole

611
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:25,120
new editor and a whole new process. And so that process, which went, which was now 2021 into 2022,

612
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,720
introduced a new player into the mix, which was our editor at Penguin. And

613
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,800
I don't have anything to compare Diana to as far as other editors, but she struck me as

614
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,160
relatively hands off. I, I, would you, would she be described as more of a hands,

615
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,280
more of a conceptual editor as opposed to a line editor?

616
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:56,640
Yeah. And she gave great sort of, you know, guidance and, you know, she had some give and

617
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,520
take, but I think between you and I, like we, it took us about six months to kind of get the right

618
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,760
voice and register, right? Like how, who are we writing this book for? And I think you weren't quite

619
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:16,880
clear. No, I think initially I was, I'm writing this like I would write a scientific article.

620
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,120
I'm writing this like I would be writing in a journal, a scientific journal.

621
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,480
For people who know.

622
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,360
And I think Bill initially was like, no, no, no, we're going to write this more like I'm making

623
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,480
this up. It's not what was actually said, but like, we're going to write this for USA today.

624
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:38,320
And I think in the end, we probably settled on, you know, the New Yorkers slash the New York

625
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:45,440
Times slash the wall street journal. Like it's, it's halfway in between and it's the right voice.

626
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:53,200
It is. And again, I go back to, I finally realized it's absolutely written the way it should be based

627
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,720
on how it sounded when I finally read the book out loud, which by the way, we dodged a bit of a

628
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,240
bullet because I was given this advice by Sam Harris a couple of years ago and I didn't follow

629
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:13,600
it because I never had the time. But Sam said to me, do not do your edits silently. When you were

630
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:19,600
editing this book, read it out loud. And yeah, that's good writer's advice. Yeah. And I was like,

631
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,400
I mean, I acknowledged what he said and I never had the time to do it. Because when push came to

632
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,880
shove, this is like nights and weekends. And if I got to get through a 5,000 word section,

633
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,080
like I don't have the fricking time to sit there and read that out loud. And so as we got closer

634
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,680
and closer to that reading, my anxiety was peaking because I was like, I haven't actually sat here

635
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:48,560
and done this exercise. And there were a lot of last minute edits that came out of that. Probably

636
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:54,240
many more than anybody would have been comfortable. I mean, I think you said 400. Yeah. You pushed it

637
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,960
to the very end. Yeah. And also not only like line edits, but also like, Hey, we just saw the

638
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:09,280
study about Tao deposition. Oh, in women. Yeah. Can we put this in? Bill's like, oh my God,

639
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,320
we're going crazy. But I think just kind of going back to something you said, like a lot of times

640
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:20,160
you didn't kind of come up with something or some idea or there'd be some new study about Tao. Can

641
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:28,000
we put this in? It's like, well, we'd find a way to do it. Right. That worked and kind of weave it

642
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:37,360
in and massage it in. Yeah. But a lot of times it would be, you realize like something so significant

643
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:45,280
might only warrant a sentence in a book of this nature. And yeah, I think that was just a general

644
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,440
process of getting comfortable, but it is the way these things need to be done. And I really,

645
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,880
I'm glad, I'm really glad with the way this turned out, because if this had been written in the voice

646
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,920
that the first version had been written in, it would have been accessible to so many fewer people.

647
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,280
It just would have been returned off to people. I mean, I think, you know, the feedback again from

648
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:13,680
that first version was not just that it's so technical, but there is no story in here. There's

649
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:22,000
no protagonists. There are no journeys. There's nothing to follow. And that was one of Diana's

650
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,480
insights. Like what's the thread that pulls the reader? That was her big saying, what's the thread

651
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,520
that pulls the reader through the book? And they were there. We just had to kind of expose them,

652
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,920
let them kind of shine. You know, one of the questions we get asked a lot, which is,

653
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,040
you often said this is the only book you're ever going to write. And a lot of people are like,

654
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:48,160
there's no way. And I think even Bill joked that he doesn't think this is the only book you're

655
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,840
going to write. And whenever people would ask that, I always be like, oh, there's not a chance Peter

656
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:57,440
writes another book. Like, there's no way. But as I'm hearing you talk now, kind of thinking to

657
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:04,720
myself, how do you not write another book in 10 years on an update to all this? So how do you,

658
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,080
because I know you, you went into this being like, look, I want to write one book. I want it to

659
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:15,360
contain everything, which is why you did the objective strategy tactics. Like we talked.

660
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,240
What makes you think that you'll actually never write another book?

661
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,680
You know, again, I think if we're being reasonable people, we could never say never, right?

662
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,840
I just think a couple of things would have to be true for me to write another book. So I say that

663
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,640
one thing that would have to be true is I would have to have something to say, like you, you, I

664
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:44,000
think this process is so difficult. At least, I mean, I see these people that write a book a year.

665
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,880
I don't understand how they're doing it. So again, let's just put those people aside. But for someone

666
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:59,680
like me to do this with the unbelievable inertia that's required to do it, the desire, the drive

667
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:05,520
to need to say something must be so great that that you have to be able to overcome that pain.

668
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:11,760
So so that's that's condition number one, I would have to have something so overwhelming to talk

669
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:17,120
about. The second condition is I would have to be at a different place in my life than I am today.

670
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:24,320
I would not want to repeat what I have done for the past five years, which is work on something

671
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:33,680
so difficult on nights and weekends. This has been I think it's just been it's just it's I've

672
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,080
paid a price for it that is probably higher than I would like to have paid. And I don't want to do

673
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,040
that again. So so I think the second equally important condition is I will need to be at a

674
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:49,840
point in my life where I'm not working 24 seven. And writing this will not kill me. Meaning, it's

675
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,640
not something I have to do nights and weekends, I can write it during the daytime. And that just

676
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,800
means my life looks different than it looks today, right? That means my kids are a lot older. That

677
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:05,120
means I'm not working as hard on my practice or other things as I am today, where those are my

678
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:11,120
jobs. And this is my hobby. So I think if those two conditions were met, if I had something really

679
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:18,320
amazing to write about, or update or tweak, and I could do it in a civilized manner, I would be open

680
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:23,600
to it. One of the questions that we got came through, which I thought was really interesting,

681
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:29,200
fits well with thread you just went on is, did you want or need to write this book? Because

682
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,840
you mentioned it there, there's obviously no shortage of books on health, books on longevity,

683
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:42,880
whatever you want to call it. And so what, going back to the framework you just laid out,

684
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,440
what do you think to you was so important to say that you were like,

685
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,760
I need to get this out there. And I need people to have these insights.

686
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:58,560
I think it's hard to speak to the motivation at the outset, because when I started this in 2016,

687
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:04,320
it was two years before having a podcast. So it never occurred to me at that time to have a

688
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,560
podcast, where I probably would have had a podcast. And maybe if I did have a podcast,

689
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,840
I wouldn't have thought to write a book because in some ways, a podcast is an easier way to

690
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,880
communicate. It's less formal, but it's easier, right? And you can communicate much more through

691
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:25,920
a podcast. So I think the more interesting question for me to think about is, let's go

692
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:35,680
back to where we were in December of 2020, Bill. So basically in February of 2020, this project is

693
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:42,480
nuked. It's dead. We're done. Publishers fired me. And nobody wants a book about longevity in

694
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:52,960
the pandemic anyway. Yeah. Yeah. It's over. And I'm over it. I'm so frustrated that, and I feel

695
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:00,720
bad that I've wasted so much of Bill's time because he's put in two full years at that point,

696
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,600
and he's going to have nothing to show for it. He's not going to have a book to show for it.

697
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:14,480
For me personally, I don't care. I don't need a book, whatever. And so I don't know,

698
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:22,080
Bill and I probably didn't talk for nine months. It was sort of done. I felt bad, and Bill didn't

699
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:27,680
make me feel bad or anything like that. That was just the nature of things. So that was the end of

700
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:37,440
it until late, late, late 2020 when Michael Ovets somehow asked me about it. I don't know

701
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:45,040
what brought it up. We were talking about his book, which I love. And somehow it came up that,

702
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,560
oh, I'd kind of written a book too, but it sort of got scrapped. And he was like, oh, send it to me.

703
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,120
And so I called Bill and I was like, hey, Bill, do we still have the G-Doc that has like whatever

704
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:03,120
the last version was of that thing before it died? And he's like, yeah, I could probably find it.

705
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,600
And I was like, do you mind sending it to me? So he did. And I sent it to Michael. And I remember

706
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:14,320
this was around Christmas of 2020. He read it in two weeks, which is saying something because it

707
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:20,640
was a pretty long ass thing. And he said, look, man, this has got to be published.

708
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:28,000
And I was like, well, we don't have a publisher. And I explained how much hair was on this dog.

709
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,080
And then the rest is kind of history. He just said, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no. He goes,

710
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:41,760
look, we'll get this published. So that's really the question then becomes why at that moment in

711
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:48,720
time did I go back in the ring? Because I was clearly out of the ring. And by that point,

712
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,560
we had a podcast. I mean, this was not like I wasn't looking for things to do.

713
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,160
And honestly, I think it kind of comes down to some of the stuff I write about in the very

714
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:10,240
last chapter of the book. I think there was a coming to peace with some of my demons and a

715
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:20,720
realization that I wanted to do it. I really did have a I really had a strong desire to put

716
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:30,720
this material out there in basically the form it's in now, which turned out to be such a blessing.

717
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:36,400
Had it not been for getting fired by the old publisher, had it not been for COVID, had it

718
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,920
not been for all of the crises that emerged. This book looks a lot different. And truthfully,

719
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:48,720
I think it's not as good. But to answer your question, I think it was want more than need,

720
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:57,680
but I don't think that want really found its why until the end of 2020, the beginning of 2021.

721
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:03,680
Yeah, Bill. So hearing that, I mean, what are your thoughts on that process? And also during

722
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:08,160
that nine months of silence to you, did you ever think the book would see the light of day?

723
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:14,960
I think deep down, I knew that it would because there had been so much work that went into it.

724
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,640
And there was so much that's original and interesting and amazing in it that I felt like

725
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:27,520
it would be a tragedy if it wasn't published. And I was kind of depressed and sad for a while that

726
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,160
it wasn't. So I was very glad to get your call about your friend, Michael Ovets, wanting to see

727
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:41,200
it. It was yes, this is going to happen. And I think it was kind of interesting watching Peter

728
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,760
kind of like become a writer in certain ways. You're talking about like working on nights and

729
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,120
weekends, and you're just kind of tortured by this thing that's like hanging over your head.

730
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:57,200
And it won't go away and it has to be good, it has to be perfect. And so one of the

731
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:04,080
stages of that process is deciding that the whole thing sucks. And there's all kinds of

732
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:12,880
stories about writers throwing all their manuscripts in the fire and like, ah. And it's a process you

733
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:18,560
have to go to and go through. And especially in science writing, there's like a first draft that

734
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,920
we call it like the shitty first draft, and you have to write it. And it doesn't mean you're a

735
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,840
shitty writer or a shitty thinker. You're just getting it all out there. And then it's like,

736
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:38,240
what do we got? And then the process, you think you're done, right? Because I remember finishing

737
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:43,280
the first draft, it's like, okay, sweet, I'm done. And I think at about that point, you had sent me

738
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:49,200
an espresso machine. It's like, this was nice of Peter to send me this espresso machine now that

739
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:54,800
we're done, but we weren't done. We weren't even close. You've got the first draft. It's like you

740
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,200
run the first half of the marathon. Like don't put the sticker on your car. You got to run the

741
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:05,600
other half of the marathon before you're done. So yeah, it was a marathon.

742
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:12,560
And like a marathon, anybody who's run one or swum one or done these things, you know that the

743
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:20,320
physiologic halfway point is not the actual halfway point. My wife just ran a marathon recently and

744
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:26,480
we, you know, in training for this, I mean, it was all about the training for the physiologic hits.

745
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:34,000
And in that 26 miles, you don't physiologically hit the half point till 20. So you'll hurt as much in

746
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,680
the last 6.2 miles. You will, it will be as difficult metabolically and physiologically in

747
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:44,720
the last six miles as the first 20 were. And I think the same as I exactly the same for this

748
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,880
writing process, right? The, yeah, what we did in the last nine months

749
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,680
was more valuable than the previous five years.

750
01:16:55,680 --> 01:17:00,640
Right. And I, I kept telling you that through the process, like,

751
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,720
you got to trust this process. Yeah, you got to trust it. And it's going to get a lot better in

752
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:11,680
the last six months than in the first however many, many years. And that's just the nature of the beast.

753
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:20,320
I remember this summer, sorry, last summer. So it was July of 2022.

754
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:29,360
We were on a pretty tight deadline at this point. So this was when Penguin said this book has to

755
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:37,280
come out in March. And if you reverse engineer that the manuscript needed to be final by the

756
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:43,840
first week of September, and we were six weeks away from that. And there were gaping holes in

757
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,920
this thing. Like you could drive a tractor truck through some of the holes in this thing. And

758
01:17:52,400 --> 01:18:05,120
I had a feeling that I have not had since I was on a very difficult swim in 2008, 2009,

759
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,880
where I was in the water and nothing was going well. This was actually early on after I tore my

760
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:19,120
labrum and I was in so much pain and the current was moving in the wrong direction. Everything was

761
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:24,160
going wrong. And you know, these things are very psychological. You know, you, you, you, it's just

762
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:30,320
like running. It's like cycling. I mean, once your brain is hurting, like nothing, nothing goes right.

763
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:36,400
And I remember at one point realizing I still had seven hours to swim. And every stroke,

764
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:41,040
I felt like someone was sticking a dagger into my shoulder. And there was just a part of me that

765
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:47,760
was like, I don't want to do this anymore. I just don't want to do this. And I remember thinking

766
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:52,800
for at least an hour, all I thought about was quitting. All I thought about was just getting

767
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,280
out of the water. All I had to do was put my hand up and touch the boat. And I was disqualified and

768
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:04,000
the swim was over. Um, and I didn't, you know, for better or worse, I kept swimming. I don't think

769
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,040
it changed anything in my shoulder. I'm still going to need shoulder surgery regardless.

770
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:14,320
But I came back to this in July of 2022. And I remember talking about this with Jill.

771
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:26,000
And I remember thinking in the next six weeks, we will have to work so hard to get this thing

772
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,280
submitted. And we don't have a choice now, meaning we can't stretch that out for six months.

773
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,600
It's you have six weeks to finish. Do what you can in six weeks. And I remember saying to Jill,

774
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:45,600
I'm so torn right now because I am so tired. I don't want to do anymore. And I know that for,

775
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,560
I know that our publisher would accept this right now as is because it's good enough.

776
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:58,640
Yeah. But in my mind, it's not good enough. And the only way this thing is going to be good enough

777
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:05,280
to what we think it deserves is I'm going to have to kill myself for the next six weeks.

778
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:13,360
Everything I do will revolve around this and I will have to rewrite and rewrite and chop out and

779
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:18,000
do and do all these things. And I just, I just remember saying to Jill, like I want to quit right

780
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,640
now. I've never wanted to quit so bad and quitting. This is a soft quit. It's just a saying,

781
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,480
I'm going to back off. It's not that I'm not going to finish. I'm just going to back off.

782
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,800
And I'm glad that I didn't. I don't know how you felt at that point, but that's, I really was

783
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:42,640
like, I'm done with this. I don't even know if I care anymore. Nobody, most people won't notice

784
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:49,440
the difference between this version and the version we might be able to get to in six weeks.

785
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:58,480
Yeah. I think one thing we share in common is, maybe you're more than me, but like a kind of

786
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:09,200
a perfectionism. And to me, that goes to the sort of the level of the writing, right? Is this,

787
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,200
I would be going through every single sentence, like, is this the best way that this sentence can

788
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:21,840
be cast or are these in the right order? How are we structuring this? I was doing that constantly

789
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:29,920
and spent that most of that summer doing just that. And it was, yeah, it felt like in a pretty

790
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,680
deep hole and the deadline is looming, but deadlines are good, right? Because like,

791
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,360
nothing would be finished without a deadline. So at a certain point, you have to like,

792
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:47,280
take your hands off it and say, all right, this is what it is. But it did get a lot better,

793
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:53,040
even between then and when they finally yanked it out of our cold dead hands,

794
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,200
it got better, got a lot better, more readable.

795
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:05,760
Yeah, that was the proverbial darkness before light was that August, September was really hard.

796
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,360
And that's what I think every person was trying to tell me before, which is,

797
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,120
you have to trust how much this is going to converge at the end.

798
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,120
Yeah, it's kind of funny hearing that timeline, because by the time this comes out, we'll have

799
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:27,200
released a podcast with Ethan Weiss and you guys were talking about blood pressure on it.

800
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,320
You're like, you know, Ethan, my blood pressure has always been normal, but in August, I started

801
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:37,280
taking a reading and it just was higher, but I could calm down. And he was like, well, did

802
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,760
anything change during that time? And you were like, yeah, I had a book deadline. So it's kind

803
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,800
of funny to just see how much this book is trying to kill you along the way of not only the blood

804
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:56,240
pressure, the voice, just every little bit of stress. Yeah, ironically. Yeah. Let's talk about

805
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,360
the audio book. You kind of mentioned it there. I know you struggled a lot with,

806
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:07,440
should I read this or should I not? And part of it was, you know, you've said yourself, like,

807
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,880
sometimes like reading that much, like you'll struggle with, it was not only that, it was the

808
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:18,800
time aspect, the commitment. What made you ultimately decide to read it? Because the

809
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:24,080
overwhelming feedback we got from the audience was they didn't want to hear someone else read this

810
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:29,680
book if it wasn't you. And people will, I think this is where kind of having your own podcast

811
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:34,240
probably hurt you as everyone knew your voice and knew what it sounded like. You weren't a

812
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,840
voiceless figure who was just a writer. So what made you ultimately decide, all right,

813
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,280
I'm going to go do this audio book. Well, I mean, first I should explain why I didn't want to do

814
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,920
it. And I think I had some pretty good reasons for not wanting to do it. First of all, I'm not a great

815
01:23:51,360 --> 01:24:01,760
out loud reader. I think I do have mild dyslexia. I certainly do when it comes to spelling. So I

816
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:09,520
can't spell if my life depends on it. And when you hear me read even to my kids, like, you know,

817
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,280
Reese is eight so he can read. So if I'm reading to him, he's catching mistakes that I'm,

818
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:21,760
he's catching words that I'm flipping back and forth. So that was one reason there was just like,

819
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:27,520
this is going to be very hard for me to do. The second is I did the math pretty quickly,

820
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:33,520
meaning I had figured out how long it took me to read a page. I multiplied it by how many pages

821
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,680
that were in the book. And I knew that I was going to basically be in a recording studio for two weeks.

822
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:45,920
I also knew that meant that that was the one week a year that I kind of wind down is between

823
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,240
Christmas and New Year's. I was going to be in a recording studio all day, every day. And I just

824
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:55,520
knew how I felt, which was I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted. And I don't, I actually need a week

825
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:02,640
to recharge. I don't need two more extra weeks of work. The third thing was when Rick Rubin was in

826
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:08,240
town visiting over the summer, he was beginning the process of recording for his audio book.

827
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:14,320
And he had a sound engineer set up a studio in our basement. So he was beginning to do his read

828
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:19,120
that he and his family stayed with us for a couple of weeks. And one day he was like,

829
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,400
Hey, why don't you go in the studio with my engineer and just read a bit and see how it goes?

830
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:31,360
And I was like, all right, that's not a bad idea. So I did. And I read it and I sent it to you guys

831
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:35,360
and you guys finally acknowledged what I was saying, which was, yeah, that's pretty rough.

832
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:41,600
Like, dude, there's no intonation in your voice. Like you're, you sound like a robot reading that.

833
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:47,440
So now we've got confirmation on my worst fear, which is I'm a lousy reader coupled with all these

834
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:55,440
other things. And I, you know, so, so, so that, those were all the reasons I didn't want to do it.

835
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:01,840
And I think those were all very compelling. So on the flip side of that, I don't remember

836
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:07,680
who suggested it. If it was you or somebody suggested that I at least meet with this woman

837
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:13,920
named Stacy Snell, who I guess is it kind of a freelancer, but works for Penguin and she would

838
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:20,320
be the producer director of my audio book. And maybe Stacy had just said, let me, let me go

839
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:25,280
and spend an afternoon with Peter and do some coaching. So sure enough, one day, and this is

840
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:33,440
probably like November, she comes over here and we do some reading and for two hours we read,

841
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:40,160
but she coached me on reading and she gave me some really amazing tips that seems so self-evident,

842
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:48,480
but they made a difference. So for example, first is read slower, right? And I should have known

843
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:54,640
this because I consume virtually all of my books in audio first, and then certain ones I go back

844
01:26:54,640 --> 01:27:03,280
and read in paper, but I listen at about 1.8 to 2x, depending on the author. And so in my mind,

845
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:07,520
that's the cadence of an audio book. But if you ever actually go and listen to an audio book on

846
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:18,560
1x, I mean, it sounds like this. So what she reminded me was, you know, it needs to sound

847
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:24,400
pretty slow at 1x speed. Everything she said is, and she could tell right away, she's like, you're

848
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:30,560
not present when you're reading. It's clear to me how bored you are of this book, and I can't blame

849
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:36,720
you for it. You've read every word a thousand times, but your boredom is showing in your reading.

850
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:43,920
She's like, a good reader reads this like it's the first time they've seen these words.

851
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:52,880
She's like, you have to get there. And I was like, wow. And she's like, oh, and by the way,

852
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:59,840
reading slow makes that easier. The slower you read, the easier it is for you to be present

853
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:10,880
with every word. So armed with Stacy's feedback, I decided I'm going to do this.

854
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,720
And so a couple of days before starting it, I had a session with one of my therapists, and obviously

855
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,760
one of the things you talk about in therapy is like, what do you worry about? What do we know?

856
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,880
What's going on in your life? And I said, well, you know, I'm really worried. And, you know,

857
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,040
a couple of days I start this reading process. And so Katie said, well, what's your why? Why are

858
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:36,080
you doing this? And let's write those down. So I had three reasons why I was writing this,

859
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:41,440
and I wrote those three reasons down on a piece of paper. And those were with me in the recording

860
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:49,440
studio. And the three reasons were very simply, one, the listeners of the podcast will expect this

861
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,040
and deserve it. In other words, you know, we feel really grateful. Obviously,

862
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,200
I don't need to just say this, but, you know, we have a very loyal group of listeners to this

863
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:07,440
podcast. And to your point, there is an expectation that the person whose voice they listen to is the

864
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:12,720
one that reads it. And I think it's a correct expectation. I think they deserve that. The

865
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:20,480
second is a pet peeve of mine when I'm listening to technical books that are not read by the author

866
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:27,680
is how many mistakes there are when things are read incorrectly. It bothers me to no end. I mean,

867
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:34,960
I remember listening to one book where the author had written the word causal multiple times. And

868
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:42,640
every time the word causal was misread as casual. Oh, it's like how that got missed. I don't know.

869
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:47,280
But, you know, I thought about how many technical words are in this book. And I was like, I'm going

870
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:52,320
to lose my mind if a person. And I basically said, I'm going to end up having to be in the

871
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:57,200
recording studio anyway, just to make sure everything is said correctly. And then the

872
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:01,760
third reason was just a very personal one, which was, you know, right now, none of my kids are old

873
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:07,920
enough to appreciate this book. None of them are going to read this book anytime soon. But one day

874
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:13,680
they will. And one day they might listen to it. And in fact, I thought further, and this is kind

875
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:19,600
of a weird thing to think about because we don't normally think this way. But like imagine Hemingway

876
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:26,560
had read some of his audio books and now like distant relatives of him could listen to it and

877
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:33,920
listen to him reading it. And I thought like long after I'm dead, my great grandkids could still

878
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,320
listen to this, but they'll hear me reading it. And I think that will be more valuable than hearing

879
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:42,960
someone else read it. So it was really more of like something for kids and grandkids to one day have.

880
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:51,040
But it's also, you know, there are a lot of stories in there about your early life and your

881
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:59,440
medical career and, you know, some, there's some fairly dramatic, you know, ER stories. And,

882
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:05,040
you know, your story is kind of like embedded throughout the book and especially in the last

883
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:13,280
chapter. So I think it would have, like you had to read it. You just didn't realize it.

884
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,240
Yeah, I think that's true.

885
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:21,840
But it is a daunting and kind of terrifying task at the same time. But I don't know. Are you

886
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,480
glad you did it?

887
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:29,200
Oh, I'm 100%. I'm 100% glad I did zero regret on that. And just glad that you

888
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:35,200
would have turned out glad with having Stacy there in my ear for the whole thing was incredible.

889
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,280
I couldn't imagine if I had to do it with somebody else.

890
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,200
Yeah, it's funny. There'll be a lot of times where you'll be like, you know, we'll be like, Peter,

891
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:48,240
you got to do this. And I'll be like, no, I suck at this. Like I can't do it. And it's like,

892
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,840
okay, yeah, yeah. Like just go ahead and do it. You're like, okay. And you send it. It's like,

893
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:57,120
yeah, this is totally fine. And I think that's what we all expected when we sent over the sample

894
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,920
from the studio in the basement. I remember listening to it.

895
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,880
You're like, he's right.

896
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:08,000
And I was like, this is bad. Like there is no sugar coating it. Like it was, I remember

897
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,080
talking to Lacey and I was like, I honestly think it's so bad because people hear him talk on the

898
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:20,640
podcast and clearly you can speak. But you sounded like you'd never read anything in your life. And

899
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:24,800
like, you were a caveman dropped in and you were just like, what is all this stuff around me?

900
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:25,360
Right.

901
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,320
So you've got these phonetic symbols and like, go.

902
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:34,240
Yeah. And it was, it was just a conversation of, yeah, we can't let them do this. This is going

903
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:40,240
to be embarrassing. But then Stacy came in and really cleaned it up. And I know I listened to

904
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:45,440
some of the audio and it, it does sound really good. So to see that progression, maybe down the

905
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,760
road, we'll release a snippet of the initial just so people can hear the difference of it.

906
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:54,000
Because it's blackmail material hits. It's strong.

907
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,400
Well, actually really, we got to make sure Stacy does it before, after, on her website or something

908
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:04,800
like working with me will get you from here to here. Before and after. That's funny.

909
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,280
And you kind of talked about it earlier where, you know, reading the book caused you to make some

910
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,320
edits. Some edits.

911
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,640
563 or was it 863?

912
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:22,800
I think that's the closest Bill and Diana came to wanting to kill me. I think if they could have,

913
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,000
if they could have killed me and nobody would have found out about it, they probably would have.

914
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,120
And been like, Oh, God, so tragic that something happened to Peter this week. Well, you know,

915
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,360
I'm sure he actually, we will, we'll publish this book with your name on it.

916
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:41,040
We'll release it as is. I think there, there is a little Easter egg in the audio version as well.

917
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,200
That's a little different too, which probably also led to some of Diana's stress. Do you kind

918
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,160
of want to talk about that piece of it?

919
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:57,680
Sure. So the, before, before we turned the book over to Penguin, so back when, you know, it was in

920
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:03,520
the, the old version that died, you know, it was a very similar structure to the way it is now,

921
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:10,640
just a much longer, less elegant version. But there was an ending to that chapter. So the end

922
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:20,400
of the book, the 17th and final chapter had an ending. And I loved it. Bill was sort of ambivalent.

923
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:28,480
When Diana saw it, she hated it. She was like, I don't get it. This sucks. And I was like,

924
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,160
what do you mean you don't get it? I even like sent her YouTube videos to help her understand it,

925
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:37,360
to get the reference. She's like, I don't get it. It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. This is

926
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:43,600
awful. And at this point, Bill was like, I kind of see Diana's point. Like, I don't think it's good.

927
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:51,040
And I was like, and I was like, all right, fine. So they took it out. So we took it out. And

928
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:55,360
this is, you know, this is months ago, like it's long been forgotten.

929
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:05,680
So I'm in the studio finishing and I finished the whole book. And I said to Stacy,

930
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,240
do you want to see the alternative ending? And she's like, what do you mean? And I was like,

931
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,920
this book ended with a totally different thing. Where you see it ending now, there used to be a

932
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,600
whole page after this. And she's like, Oh, really? Let me see it. I was like, let me see if I can

933
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:28,160
even find it. So I'm like rummaging through my computer and I find it and I give it to her.

934
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:36,000
And I'm like, read it. And she reads it. And she's in tears. And I was like,

935
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,200
what do you think about ending? She goes, I think it's beautiful. And I was like, well,

936
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,640
what do you think of, do you want me to read that? And we can decide if maybe that goes in.

937
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:52,160
And she's like, yeah, I'd go. So I went back in the booth and I read it. And I go home that day

938
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:57,280
and I email Bill and Diana and I'm like, all right, guys. And by the way, you got to put this in

939
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:04,000
context. They are at the point of wanting to kill me for changing words at this point. Literally,

940
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:11,200
I'm like, can we get rid of the the here? And this word needs to be like this versus this. And

941
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:16,800
I'm saying I want to add another page and a half to this manuscript. It's going to screw up

942
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:22,640
everything. And I won't get into the details of those conversations. They were not pleasant.

943
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:30,320
But suffice it to say, the answer was, oh, hell no. And so I accepted the fact that it would never

944
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,920
make its way into the written version of the book. But I said, but would you at least entertain

945
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:39,120
this being in the audio version? And they were like, of course not. Like you can't have the audio

946
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:45,520
version and different from the written version. And if we kind of left it at that, I think, but then

947
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:54,800
I asked Stacy to send it once it was edited and I just forwarded it on to Bill.

948
01:36:54,800 --> 01:37:02,880
So it sounds good the way you read it. So I was like, this sounds, this is good. This is moving.

949
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:10,240
Tried to find a place to kind of massage it in or put it in someplace, maybe not as the ending,

950
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:15,600
but someplace in the manuscript. And that kind of didn't work because I mean, without going into

951
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:23,680
detail, like that last chapter probably evolved the most of any chapter in the book. And we'd kind

952
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:30,560
of gotten to a place where it was working and that part had dropped out. So we kind of decided

953
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,000
as a compromise to leave it in the audio as the kind of like Stanley Kubrick directors cut.

954
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:48,080
But I think it's great. Yeah. But honestly, I feel like as far as print, like the last few paragraphs

955
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:54,480
of the book, and especially like the last line is something that like sticks with me. And I think

956
01:37:54,480 --> 01:38:03,760
about that. I think about that every day, that line, and I won't say what it is, but every day

957
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,200
when I walk the dogs, I think about that. And I think when I'm thinking about like, what's,

958
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,720
what am I going to do today? Like, how am I thinking about this day and the week to come?

959
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:20,480
And everything, that line sings in my head. So glad it's there.

960
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:24,800
I think we capture the best of both worlds. I think it makes sense. I think it would have been,

961
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:29,680
even if we thought it could have been shoved in at the end, I think it would have been logistically

962
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,920
impossible because of how it changes the pages of the book and stuff like that. So I think it's

963
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,240
an elegant way to do it. And I know that also if people are anything like me, like a lot of times

964
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:44,240
you want an audio book and you want the paper book. You want to fold your pages, you want to

965
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:49,840
mark it over, you want to do that kind of stuff. So I think it worked out just fine.

966
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,480
Frankly, I was glad you were on some level that you were making like little line edits and stuff,

967
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:03,920
like, because it makes it better. There's always stuff you can find that, I did a lot of things

968
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:14,000
that probably didn't even notice, but- No, it got so much better. There is a huge sprint at the end

969
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:20,720
to just make this thing sound right. And you're getting these PDFs from the publisher, like,

970
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,840
okay, your book's done. Here's your PDF. Just proofread it and see if there are any

971
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:30,240
spelling mistakes. And of course, I think we both went to town on it.

972
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:36,000
Typically, I guess the industry standard is you would do three passes on the PDF final copy.

973
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:43,120
So once you are out of working in a Word doc, you're into a fully typeset PDF copy.

974
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,240
And it's expected that like the first round of passes on that, you might find some mistakes.

975
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:55,120
By the third round, there's none. We got up to six or seven passes on a PDF. I mean, these

976
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:00,720
people are going, they were incredibly patient with us.

977
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,560
The lovely people at Penguin Random House worked very hard to-

978
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,440
Absolutely. They were-

979
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,680
Accommodate all of our last minute changes.

980
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:13,040
And they also now understand why we say with you, the only thing you do in moderation is moderation.

981
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:13,520
That's right.

982
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,160
And also, it's just really funny to just think about the aspect of,

983
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:23,120
they probably thought of you like a child. Like, we left Peter unsupervised to record this book,

984
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,440
and he just totally went off script.

985
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:34,400
And speaking of things that kind of joke, like what could go wrong, did go wrong, voice,

986
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:38,880
everything else, you want to talk about the first day in the recording studio, what happened?

987
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:47,040
So we had two recording studios to choose from in Austin. And I don't know, I just was like,

988
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,600
Stacy's like, it's totally up to you. Which one do you want to do? And I was like, well,

989
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,960
this one seems a little closer to my house than that one. And given that I'm going to

990
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,280
be over there every day, let's minimize the commute. So we went to the closer one.

991
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:05,920
So first day, we go in there. And I sit down and we just jump right into it. And

992
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:09,600
right out of- I'm reading the book in chronological order, of course.

993
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:17,920
I just hear like a weird little hissing sound. And I call out to the engineer and I say, hey,

994
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:24,080
do you hear that? And he says, yeah, but that's not being picked up on the recording. They said,

995
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:32,160
okay. And I can get over it. Like it's annoying, but it's like I can work through it. So I keep

996
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:39,600
reading, get through the introduction, get through chapter one. I'm like, are you, it's getting

997
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:43,920
louder. Are you sure it's not being picked up on the mic? He goes, no, I can tell you it's not

998
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:50,560
being picked up on the mic. And I'm like, yeah, this can't be right because I can hear it with my

999
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:57,120
ears off the, off the speaker. Like, you know, you're wearing a headset in there and it's not

1000
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:01,120
coming through the headset. It's what I'm hearing in the room. And I know how sensitive the mics

1001
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:05,440
are in those studios. I mean, they're insanely, they're so sensitive that if you're moving your

1002
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:12,080
feet on the floor, it's being picked up. So we keep having this back and forth where he keeps

1003
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:19,760
insisting that this is not being picked up. And I, I just finally said like, I don't, I'm not going

1004
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:25,600
to tell you, I know your world, but I know how recording works. And if I can hear this with my

1005
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:33,040
ears off sound in the recording studio, it must be picked up. And then he kind of pivots and says,

1006
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:39,680
well, we'll be able to strip it out in post. And I'm like, okay, so it is being picked up.

1007
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:48,000
So finally, I'm one paragraph away from finishing the third chapter, which was all we were going to

1008
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,120
get through that day. That's a big day to get through the intro and then three chapters,

1009
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:55,200
but they were short chapters. But so it's a full day of reading. And I remember this,

1010
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:58,160
I had literally one paragraph to go and we were done for the day and he goes, you know what?

1011
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:06,880
I think we are picking it up. Like what? He goes, I think there's a, it's a grounding issue.

1012
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,720
So to make our long story short, we ended up having to go to the other studio anyway,

1013
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:18,240
because they, we couldn't record there. And they assured me that they would be able to fix that

1014
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:23,840
in post and they could not. So when I finished the book, they were like, you gotta come back

1015
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:31,200
and reread that first day again. But I think that also was a good thing in a weird way, because

1016
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,520
I think I was a better reader by the end than I was at the beginning. And so in a way,

1017
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:43,680
I got a day to practice where it didn't count. Yeah, it is. It's funny how it ended up. You

1018
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:48,960
ended up getting a free practice run, which at the time, I don't know if we thought of it that

1019
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:56,000
positively, like wasting day on something you were dreading doing, but I think the audio version

1020
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,720
ended up really well. You know, one of the last questions that we got, which I think is a really

1021
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:05,200
interesting question based on the whole conversation we had. And I think we can start with you,

1022
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:10,000
Bill, because I'm curious what you think as it relates to this, which is looking back at

1023
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,240
everything that ended up in the book, did you have a favorite chapter that you guys wrote? Is there

1024
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:22,000
anything that stands out where like for whatever reason, you really look back fondly at that chapter?

1025
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:35,600
So it's sort of like picking favorite child. But geez, so there are these four chapters,

1026
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:44,080
kind of core chapters about the horseman diseases, right? Metabolic disorders, atherosclerosis,

1027
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:50,960
heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. And those were not in the original plan.

1028
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:59,120
And kind of the way those all came together, it was a huge heavy lift to try and like

1029
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:06,160
understand each one of these disease processes really. And it took a huge amount of research

1030
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:13,440
and me spending time with Bob Kaplan, who was kind of our research guru for the book project,

1031
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:22,640
and just kind of hammering these things out. Yeah, that was pretty intense, a pretty intense

1032
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:28,320
experience. And I feel like a real sense of accomplishment about how those chapters all

1033
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:37,120
came out. I feel really good about them. But as far as like the chapter that progressed the most

1034
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:47,120
from like most improved, I think, is the final chapter. And just from where that started to where

1035
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:54,240
that ended up, I think that has to be probably my favorite chapter.

1036
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,960
It's interesting because you didn't like that chapter initially. I know that you and Diana both,

1037
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:06,240
that was probably your least favorite. And Michael was like, in the early discussions we had,

1038
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,880
Michael was like, is this- It should be a separate book.

1039
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,760
Is this part of the- This book or is this part of a different book?

1040
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:17,600
The second book you're going to write. And I didn't agree with that either, but

1041
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:27,200
it had to change. And I'm always thinking about, like Nick said, where the reader is kind of from,

1042
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:33,840
like you said. So that chapter ended up being one of my favorites, probably my favorite.

1043
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:38,240
I think there were sections of various chapters that I really like. I think that

1044
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:47,680
the insights that come out of the atherosclerosis chapter are so important and probably have the

1045
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:56,400
potential to save more lives than anything else. I really think that I don't pull any punches in my

1046
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:03,200
views on how we are mistreating this condition and why it does not need to be the leading cause

1047
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:10,400
of death. No chance of that. And I do think that in a, and that's also one of those things where

1048
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:16,160
earlier versions of it didn't get to the point quick enough. They had too much in it that didn't

1049
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:23,360
matter enough. And it was really a very late, late edition was that the really clear pivot to the

1050
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:28,880
causality stuff at the end that I think is a much more insightful way to talk about it. So I'm very

1051
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:37,280
proud with how that turned out. I think for me, the exercise chapters, there are three chapters on

1052
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:46,400
exercise, which speaks to the importance that that plays in this book. And that was probably the one

1053
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:54,480
where even as recently as like July or August of last year, I was like, I don't see how we get this

1054
01:47:54,480 --> 01:48:02,560
to the finish line. Like I don't see how this gets done. And we were trying at that time to do too

1055
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:12,080
much. And when we instead focused on what we could do in a book, because again, it's not a picture

1056
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:18,000
book, right? This is not a how to exercise book where you're going to have like a picture of every

1057
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,600
single step of like, here's how to deadlift, here's how to do this, here's how to do that. And we were

1058
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:29,200
trying to do all of that in writing at one point. It had an incredible level of detail. Just wasn't

1059
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:36,080
happening. Couldn't make sense. Like you can't explain these things in writing. And so I think

1060
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:45,520
a big aha moment we had was, A, let's restructure this, which we did. B, let's simply make a page

1061
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:54,240
of videos that explain some of these things so that we don't drown the reader in anatomic,

1062
01:48:54,240 --> 01:49:04,240
kinesthetic lingo that won't actually serve the purpose. And so when I look at how those three

1063
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:11,040
chapters form together and coalesce around the centenarian decathlon in the marginal decade,

1064
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:18,480
I'm really proud of that. And you mentioned Bob's name a few times, kind of both of you, but

1065
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:24,240
I know this was beyond just the two of you. There was a lot of people involved in the research,

1066
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:30,480
the writing, the science piece. So anyone else kind of, because one of the questions that we got was,

1067
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:34,000
how many people do you think were involved in the writing of this book?

1068
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:41,920
Well, Bob did the heaviest lifting in terms of the, because Bob was working on

1069
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:47,120
the research full-time. So basically the way it would work is I would be writing and I would be

1070
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:52,640
saying, Bob, I remember there was a study that sort of had this, like the end notes on this book are

1071
01:49:52,640 --> 01:50:01,840
probably 500. So there's just probably more than that. So I would say, Bob, can you go and find me

1072
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,520
the citation of this study? I kind of vaguely remember reading it a year ago, blah, blah, blah,

1073
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:11,920
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Or it would be, I want to write about this. Is the answer this or this,

1074
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,400
Bob, can you go figure it out? So this was really important research that was being done.

1075
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:22,560
But then the other thing that had to be done was all the fact checking. And one of the things that

1076
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:29,360
I took as wise advice from other authors who had written scientific books is you can't just rely on

1077
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:34,960
a publisher to fact check your book. They can fact check some things, but you have to have an

1078
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:40,800
independent person to come in and do scientific fact checking. So we had one analyst named Vin

1079
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:47,520
Miller who did a lot of that work because Bob was too close to it at the time, right? If Bob's the

1080
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:53,120
guy pulling the citations, can't have Bob fact check it. So had to have a separate analyst that

1081
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:59,680
was working on fact checking. And then once we got into a much, much later version,

1082
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:05,840
then we had Bob go back and do specific certain fact checks on certain things,

1083
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:13,680
which also meant, and God bless Bob, because this is long after Bob had left, he came back and did

1084
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:18,640
a night weekend, like he was the guy that organized the end notes. And that was another thing that

1085
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:25,520
just gave me chest pain. Like, I mean, the unbelievable thought of what it would take

1086
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:30,800
to organize the end notes to this book and the version control problems that we had with multiple

1087
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:36,080
different documents. I mean, it was so stressful. And by the way, it should go without saying,

1088
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:41,040
people are going to find mistakes in this. It's impossible that we got it all right. It's

1089
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:48,000
impossible that we got every end note perfectly. I guarantee you, we have a citation in there that

1090
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:56,240
we got wrong. And that's why you have second and third editions to books. And so folks should let

1091
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:03,760
us know when they see those things and we'll do that. But I think we did as good a job as one

1092
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,880
could do in this regard and having a lot of people to shoulder some of those lifts.

1093
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:16,720
I spent a lot of time kind of putting my head together and on Zooms and going back and forth

1094
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:23,040
with Diana when you were off doing things and kind of trying to work out the kind of

1095
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:30,720
literary side of the book and how to structure it and how to make these different chapters

1096
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:37,920
kind of move better, basically, is a better way of putting it. So I worked very closely with Diana

1097
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:44,960
and Bob, actually. Bob would give me the full research download on literally, I'd say like,

1098
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:51,680
hey, Bob, I'm trying to understand how APOE works and boom, a G-Doc would appear the next day

1099
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,840
with tons of sites and studies that just go down the rabbit hole with Bob about that.

1100
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:06,240
So he was great with that. Bob has a endless number of G-Docs. I would love to know how he

1101
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:12,640
stores all of them because you asked Bob a question, you are getting a G-Doc in response.

1102
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:19,760
I spent weeks, we probably all spent weeks talking about the monkeys, the caloric restriction

1103
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,880
monkey studies. I'm glad that they stayed in the book. I was really worried that the Bethesda,

1104
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,200
Wisconsin monkeys were going to get chopped, but in the end, they found a great place for them.

1105
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:38,080
It's a fantastic story to tell. There are a lot of folks in here that I put in my acknowledgments.

1106
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:45,040
And in fact, it's pretty unusual, I think, that an author will read the acknowledgments in the

1107
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:51,120
audio book, but there was no hesitation in my mind. When we finished the book and I said,

1108
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:54,640
look, I'm going to not just read the epilogue, but the acknowledgments, they were like, oh,

1109
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:03,120
that's unusual. A lot of authors don't, but it's a very sincere heartfelt thank you to a lot of

1110
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:10,160
people who have played an enormous role in my broad education on this topic, which has been

1111
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:16,880
going on for more than a decade, and also some of the real specifics. So broad education, the

1112
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:22,320
podcast guests, again, the podcast started basically as a research tool for the book.

1113
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:28,000
And then of course, one of the things I do mention in the acknowledgement section,

1114
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:35,680
which is true and interesting, every single person that I ever sent a chapter out to for

1115
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:42,720
technical feedback and review did so. There's not one person that I sent a chapter to, and every

1116
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:47,440
chapter of this book, every technical chapter has been reviewed by a technical expert in that field.

1117
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,480
At least one.

1118
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:54,960
At least one, that's right. And oftentimes at least more than one. There is not one example

1119
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,680
where I said, hey, you're so-and-so, can you read this cancer chapter? Can you read this

1120
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:06,000
athro chapter? Can you read this? Where that person didn't come back with incredible feedback?

1121
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:14,960
And I mean, the word is overused, but I'm humbled by that. And that means a lot to me. And I think

1122
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,240
it makes this book a better book.

1123
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:21,200
When you decided to read the acknowledgments, did they try and get you to read the footnotes as

1124
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:24,080
well? Or did that not make the audio book?

1125
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:29,040
You know, it's funny, and Bill, you probably don't even realize this, but I took a hit or

1126
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:32,640
miss approach on footnotes. Some of them I read and some of them I actually didn't.

1127
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:34,080
Oh, the ones at the bottom of the page?

1128
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:38,400
The true footnotes at the bottom of the page, which obviously we took 98% of them out.

1129
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:43,200
You were delighted, I'm sure. And of the remaining ones, some of them I just felt

1130
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:50,240
they don't flow with the text. Like I'm trying to put myself in the mindset of the reader

1131
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:58,640
or the listener rather. And if the footnote was so tangential that it would be difficult to get

1132
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:00,400
back into the book, I didn't read it.

1133
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,920
Yeah. There were some funny tangents that maybe didn't need to be read.

1134
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:09,040
I think there's one about making all your dates read Richard Feynman.

1135
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:14,160
I definitely didn't read that one. I don't even know if that one stayed in the book.

1136
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:17,280
And Steven Rosenberg. You made them read the Transform 7 also.

1137
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:17,600
That's right.

1138
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,120
About immunotherapy.

1139
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:29,120
Well, Peter, Bill, anything either of you want to end with as we end the podcast? And again,

1140
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:34,720
the hope going into this wasn't to answer specific questions about the book. I'm sure we'll do a

1141
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:40,800
podcast down the road, which is once people have had time to dive into it, answer specific questions.

1142
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,880
Yeah, we should do a book AMA at some point. And obviously, I've been on a few podcasts

1143
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:51,920
already for the book. And the coming months, I will be on many podcasts. We have a number

1144
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:57,040
scheduled where we'll get into the subject matter. But yeah, I think this was a unique

1145
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:01,840
opportunity to talk about something we'll probably otherwise never really talk about.

1146
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,080
A little behind the scenes.

1147
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:13,920
I would say it was an honor and a pleasure to work with you. And I learned a lot, obviously,

1148
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:24,080
but as far as thinking and rethinking about these issues was an exciting adventure and a

1149
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:29,280
little tough to get it on the page sometimes and get it just right. I'm proud. I hope you are too

1150
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:36,800
proud of what we have come up with. I really am, Bill. And I think it's hard to imagine this

1151
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:44,640
having worked out any other way. So I'm glad that all the way back in 2017, they said, Peter,

1152
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:50,400
this will be a better book if you write it with someone. And that even back then, trusted me to

1153
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:56,080
go and find who that person was. And I think this is the best book I could have ever been a part of.

1154
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,680
So thank you, Bill.

1155
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,300
you
