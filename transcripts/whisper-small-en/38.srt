1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
individuals in the world.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,460
If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,480
Hey, everybody.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,760
Welcome to this week's episode of the drive.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,840
I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,240
and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,440
If you're listening to this, you probably already know.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
The two things I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,560
I have a complete fascination and obsession with this topic.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,440
I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,280
all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,660
Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,700
And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me.

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,440
The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
with you.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,600
To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,180
In fact, we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,160
has mirrored this.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,680
So all of this raises a natural question.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,920
How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this?

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,500
As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,820
But after a lot of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Now the first and most important of these is trust.

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,340
paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it.

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,720
Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,400
I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,680
So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,800
So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,740
work over time, and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,800
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,560
If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
works for you.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,960
In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
It's that simple.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
get back more than you give.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,960
So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,260
other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode.

50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,260
These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,840
of our shows.

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,000
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,560
episodes.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,540
That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,480
podcasts when they come out.

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,960
Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,340
deals possible on the products that I love.

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,920
And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,240
do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,960
about for free and have them pass savings on to you.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,600
Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,160
enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,440
members to support us at a level that makes sense for you.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,400
I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,920
If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,280
by signing up for a monthly subscription.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,440
My guest this week is Francisco Gonzalez Lima, a professor of neuroscience and pharmacology

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,680
and toxicology at the University of Texas, Austin.

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,600
In this episode, we talk about Alzheimer's disease.

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,900
In particular, Francisco explains the vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, a hypothesis

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,640
that his colleague and collaborator at UT Austin, Jack Bellatorre, introduced to the

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,920
field about 25 years ago.

73
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,640
He makes the case that the central problem in late onset Alzheimer's disease is a progressive

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,680
neuronal energy crisis, meaning impaired blood flow to the brain and impaired mitochondrial

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,980
respiration.

76
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,840
If the problem is an energetic crisis, Francisco argues, then we can improve the supply of

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,940
energy and blood to the brain.

78
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,400
We could probably make progress in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
We of course get into great detail about all of this stuff.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,200
To paraphrase my friend and my colleague, Richard Isaacson, who I've already spoken with on

81
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,000
the podcast a while back, as you may remember, and who directs the Alzheimer's Prevention

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,240
Clinic at Cornell, if you have a brain, you don't want to miss this episode.

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,960
So without further delay, here's my conversation with Francisco Gonzalez Lima.

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,280
Francisco, how are you?

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
Fine, thank you.

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,720
Thank you so much for making time to see me on a Friday afternoon.

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
My pleasure.

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,960
This is actually my first time to the university.

89
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,200
I've been to Austin many times, but I never seem to be north of downtown.

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,560
So it was beautiful to drive by the medical center on the way here.

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
It's kind of amazing.

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,080
I haven't even been to a football game, which I hope to one day do at some point.

93
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,520
So how long have you been in Austin?

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,000
I've been here as a tenure professor for 27 years.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wow.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,840
And during that time, I started out in pharmacology and toxicology and moved to psychology, just

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,760
added that.

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,360
And the recruiting institution was the Institute for Neuroscience.

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,240
And now I'm a faculty also at the Department of Psychiatry at the New Medical School.

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,880
And we were talking a little bit earlier, you describe yourself as a behavioral neuroscientist.

102
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Yes.

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,560
Tell me a little bit about what that title means, why behavioral.

104
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,800
My original training as a PhD was in anatomy and neurobiology.

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,680
And then as a postdoctoral fellow, I tried to understand how the brain related to behavior.

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,760
And I did that work as a Humboldt fellow in Germany.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,280
And that was my introduction to the study of functional brain mapping and how we could

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,760
see behavioral functions reflected in brain activity.

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:59,280
This was the time where we developed the fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiographic method

110
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,560
in that German group in Drosstatt that later became the key to develop FTG PET, the first

111
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,080
functional imaging technique in humans.

112
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,440
It's interesting you say that because I noticed that a number of patients when I talk to them

113
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,000
don't understand sometimes the difference because I don't think physicians explain the

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,520
difference between functional studies and imaging studies.

115
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,360
And I remember feeling very fortunate in medical school during a radiology rotation where one

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,240
of the residents sat me down and explained the difference.

117
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,640
And the PET, of course, the FTG Positron Emission Tomography being a great example of a functional

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
study.

119
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,560
It's not giving you anatomic resolution, it's giving you functional resolution with respect

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,160
to glucose uptake.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,560
And similarly, you now have functional MRI, which is doing the same sort of thing.

122
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,640
So yeah, that's a very important distinction.

123
00:07:50,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Especially important if you want to be able to determine a disease in a very early stage

124
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,920
in which there are no structural changes in the brain that can be seen at least at the

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,040
microscopic level.

126
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,520
And having functional techniques, you are able to identify these functional changes

127
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
even before you have any other signs of the disease.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,120
So I know you're a gentleman who has spent time all over the place.

129
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,320
You were born in Cuba, you left Cuba when you were quite young, you spent time in Costa

130
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Rica, Venezuela.

131
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I mean, where did you?

132
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Puerto Rico.

133
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,880
And Puerto Rico, of course.

134
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,040
All of those things, at what point did it become clear to you that you were interested

135
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
in the brain?

136
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,640
I think my father was a veterinary doctor.

137
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,840
And originally my interests have to do with working with animals.

138
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,160
But soon I realized that an ever-system was so important for the entire health of the

139
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
animal and the behavior of the animal.

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,240
So I started to move away from just a more general interest to something that had to

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,160
do more with the brain.

142
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,400
But I would say my key influence happened as an undergraduate at Tulane University in

143
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,120
New Orleans.

144
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,200
When one of my professors, Dr. John King, dissected a brain in one of our classes,

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,600
and this was an undergraduate honors class.

146
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,840
And it was fascinating to me.

147
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:29,240
And I joined her lab to do an honors thesis working on the relationship between the brain,

148
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,400
hormones, and behavior in animal models.

149
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
It's so interesting.

150
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,320
I think back to my own time in medical school.

151
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,960
There were clearly a subset of my colleagues who were so captivated by the brain, which

152
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,280
in gross anatomy really doesn't depict a fraction of its brilliance, right?

153
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,480
Unlike the heart, where certainly microscopically there are things about the heart that are

154
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
relevant.

155
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,600
You can't see the Purkinje fibers.

156
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,760
You can't see the AV node or the SA node.

157
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,880
There's so much that is invisible to the naked eye.

158
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,640
But for the most part, you can appreciate the brilliance of the heart at the macroscopic

159
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
level.

160
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,640
There are other organs that, on the other end of the spectrum, get no attention like

161
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
the liver.

162
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,080
I mean, macroscopically, it's just a lump of whatever.

163
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,720
But of course, what's happening inside the liver to me makes it one of the most remarkable

164
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
organs.

165
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,400
But the brain is an organ that has such a unique look, right?

166
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,560
Grossly it looks so distinct.

167
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,280
The tissue looks so distinct from all of the other tissue outside of the central nervous

168
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
system.

169
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:35,400
And also, to this day, I would say our knowledge of the brain must be far, far behind that

170
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,280
of any other organ at the sort of physiologic signaling level.

171
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,960
I mean, is that a fair assumption?

172
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Oh, yes.

173
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,380
I agree completely.

174
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:49,520
And I would say using the same analogies that you have, the heart, you can think of it as

175
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,240
a mechanical engineer, a pump, a hydraulic pump.

176
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,680
Because the brain is more of an electrical engineer where you have lots of circuits.

177
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,760
And the liver, for that matter, will be a chemical engineer where we break down all

178
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,480
of these substances that the body consumes.

179
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,760
I actually love that.

180
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,760
I've never thought of what you just said, and that is a great way to explain the different

181
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,320
types of engineering.

182
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,000
The kidney would be some sort of sanitation filtering engineer.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean, we could really...

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Environmental.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

186
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,800
And so in many ways, the brain is probably not only electrical engineering, but it's

187
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,920
computer science engineering.

188
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,880
There's so much going on there.

189
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Right.

190
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,680
You hit in a very important point.

191
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,960
One cannot simply look at the brain the same way that you look at other organs.

192
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,560
Because of that circuit property, it allows the development of computational power.

193
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,320
So the brain uses the circuits, not just for communication, which is the most obvious

194
00:11:50,320 --> 00:12:00,040
function, but to determine and compute outcomes that they are used to guide the other tissues

195
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
in the body.

196
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,920
For example, the musculoskeletal system cannot do anything on its own without the commands

197
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,640
that are the result of computations from the nervous system.

198
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,200
So all of our behavior results from how the nervous system process our experiences and

199
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
our current situations.

200
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,880
And it's become not in the same way as a computer works that is a serial device.

201
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:36,440
The brain is a very redundant parallel system where they have to be a lot of convergency

202
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,600
between different regions that are computing for that to be acknowledged as the way to

203
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,240
go in a behavioral point of view.

204
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,680
So for a person listening to this who might not have the luxury of knowing some of the

205
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,440
nuances about the brain that you do, when you're talking to an audience that is presumably

206
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
most people are interested in the brain because of brain pathology, it's, you know, once a

207
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,840
disease strikes the brain, everybody becomes well aware of how much it's doing because the

208
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,600
absence of that function leads to such an obvious downside.

209
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,200
How do you describe for people this notion of convergence and redundancy and overlap?

210
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,480
I mean, obviously there's a very strong evolutionary reason.

211
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,000
What are some examples of those and how those things are, these processes are preserved

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,040
in terms of, because you use, I like the use of, I'm an engineer, so I do like the use of

213
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,320
talking about serial versus parallel processing.

214
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,600
Maybe expand on that a little bit.

215
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,040
In reality, all of the anatomy is redundant and parallel.

216
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,440
At least, for example, we have bilateral symmetry, you know, everybody knows we have two hands,

217
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
two legs, two eyes.

218
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,800
We probably could have done it with one eye, but the way the system works is that it creates

219
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
redundancy.

220
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,680
And then, for example, the circulatory system is the same.

221
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,600
You have parallel blood vessels where you can get the blood from one point to another

222
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,480
in more than one way.

223
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,240
And of course, when you sit, when you put your elbow down, you can compress a blood

224
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,480
vessel, but there's still another route that can be used.

225
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,280
It's like coming from the university to the downtown area, you have many options to get

226
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,960
from one point to the other.

227
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,200
So in the brain, this is maximized to its extreme.

228
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,240
It's an organ specialized for this large amount of communications.

229
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,680
In other words, having so many highways and avenues where information can go through.

230
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,400
So in that sense, it differs from other organs where you have a pattern that repeats itself.

231
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
And the redundancy is only on that pattern.

232
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Here in the brain, the redundancy is combined with the acquisition of new networks or circuit

233
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,400
auctions that are not possible if you only have one design.

234
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,000
So you have multiple designs.

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,160
If you want an analogy, for example, when NASA was sending the man to the moon, they

236
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,480
have like 100 computers doing the same computation.

237
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,600
And then they look at the output and they see which is the output that is repeated more

238
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,800
often.

239
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,720
And that's the one that those coordinates are the ones that they're going to pass on.

240
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,520
The brain uses that strategy.

241
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,000
And that's what I mean by convergency.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,960
In other words, you have all of these multiple parallel system and they are doing these computations

243
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,480
but only the ones that converge on the same solutions are the ones that are acknowledged

244
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,880
and move on for the next stage.

245
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:49,880
When you look at other species beyond humans, how much of that redundancy do you see as

246
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,200
you go down the evolutionary chain or down the food chain maybe is an easier way to think

247
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
about it.

248
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,400
I mean, at what presumably chimps and cats and dogs are very similar, but is there a

249
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,120
point at which it very suddenly stops or does it simply diminish to the point where when

250
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,440
you're looking at a simpler organism like a worm, for example, I don't even know what

251
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
the nervous system of C. elegans looks like.

252
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:19,360
Well, definitely mammals and primates in particular where basic plan is the same.

253
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,680
And most of the differences have to do with which of the networks are more developed than

254
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
others.

255
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,600
So in primates, we have the cerebral cortex becoming the dominant component in the brain.

256
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,200
This is to a certain degree the same thing in all the mammals, but then other regions

257
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,280
of the brain have more similar contribution.

258
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,160
When you go down to, for example, reptiles or amphibians, the midbrain, the mesencephalon

259
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,920
is the largest part of the brain, not the portion where we have the cerebral cortex.

260
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,360
And what that means basically is in addition to this parallel processing that we have,

261
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,680
information goes through several hierarchical stages.

262
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:14,680
And at every one of these stages, similar processing is done and you add an additional

263
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,240
piece of information when you move it on.

264
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,080
For example, you can respond at the level of the spinal cord.

265
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,280
That will be the lowest level of response.

266
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,080
That would be, for example, a reflex.

267
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,260
Like if you tap somebody's knee, you transiently lengthen the patellar tendon, the knee kicks

268
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,260
out to straighten it or reduce the length.

269
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,980
And that is happening outside of the brain.

270
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,980
Yes.

271
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,980
However, when you tap the knee, the information also goes to all the levels of the nervous

272
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
system.

273
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,880
In that case, you saw the spinal reflex being manifested.

274
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,700
But the person still knows, they felt the sensation and they know what happened.

275
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,740
So the same was happening at different hierarchical level of processing.

276
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:06,180
So behaviorally speaking, when we respond to stimuli at very basic level, like what

277
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,980
you indicated, like the spinal level, we call it a reflex.

278
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,060
So that would be the most basic behavioral response.

279
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,540
But that means that you are not seeing what is happening at the other levels.

280
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:25,500
But for example, in a frog that is following an insect, a worm, as it's moving, the frog

281
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,860
would orient to the movement.

282
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,060
As long as the worm is moving in the same direction as the long axis of the body, you

283
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:40,820
have the same worm that is a fake worm where it's moving in a direction perpendicular to

284
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
the long axis.

285
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
It's long axis, yeah.

286
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,700
The frog will not follow.

287
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,340
So the pattern isn't recognized.

288
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:52,020
So if a frog sees a worm moving in the normal direction a worm moves, it knows that pattern.

289
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,580
If it sees the exact same food source standing up and walking on the side, it's not going

290
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
to pursue it.

291
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,820
It's not pursuing it.

292
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,100
So but in order to do that new computation, then you need the level of the midbrain.

293
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:12,260
So the midbrain becomes now the point our decision is made and with it to follow and

294
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,820
then eventually snap and capture the worm.

295
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:25,740
So the sub mammalian species primarily operate at that level and they have well defined.

296
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,620
Instead of being called a reflex, we would call this like release stimulus.

297
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,580
Release stimulus creates that generates a pattern.

298
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,700
There is a pattern generator that recognizes it.

299
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,820
But then in mammals, we have to move information to the level of the thalamus that is in the

300
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,900
middle of the brain, but higher than the midbrain.

301
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:54,620
And then from there, the majority of the mass of the brain is in primates and humans in

302
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,100
particular is in the cerebral cortex.

303
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,140
So we have to pass that information to the cerebral cortex and then feed that back down

304
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,660
to the output systems.

305
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,780
So it might be a way of oversimplifying, but one could think of it as the brainstem and

306
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,620
spinal cord are responsible for these reflexes.

307
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,180
For example, we breathe without thinking because our brainstem allows us to.

308
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,780
We recoil from pain without thought because of these things.

309
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,580
The midbrain took it up a notch by basically allowing for that stimulus response.

310
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,500
But the thalamus then becomes the gateway to the cortex where we can do this higher

311
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
processing.

312
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,300
That's probably an oversimplification.

313
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:38,020
And the main contribution of this thalamic cortical system is to allow us to inhibit

314
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
behavior.

315
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,220
In other words, not to respond in a more immediate short term matter.

316
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:51,140
So the ability to delay a response and to try to compute what are the consequences if

317
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,380
we were to make that response.

318
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,620
This is what really is brought up by our more elaborate cerebral cortex.

319
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,660
So the majority of the influence of the cerebral cortex on subcortical levels.

320
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
It's inhibitory.

321
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
It's not excitatory.

322
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,540
No, and engineers actually don't understand this very well.

323
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:18,180
When they, for example, try to create a prosthetic device to have somebody send neural impulses

324
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:25,700
to move a leg that is paralyzed, they try to create this as an excitatory type of phenomenon.

325
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,940
But what the brain is doing is not like that.

326
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:36,300
What the brain is doing is inhibiting all possible vectors of movement in a space and

327
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,460
then selectively releasing some of them by sending an inhibitory signal to that.

328
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:48,060
Yeah, it inhibits the inhibitory signal, thereby selectively, quote unquote, releasing activation.

329
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
Yes.

330
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,580
And when you do that, you have more control because you are actually for every movement.

331
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,660
You're not just working as a puppet or you're trying to only emulate those vectors.

332
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,460
You're controlling all of the other possibilities.

333
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:10,340
So you sort of curve a tunnel in a space which are the only vectors that are allowed

334
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,100
to be manifested.

335
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:20,140
So the engineering of the brain in this sense requires this more effort in order to achieve

336
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,300
something that could have been achieved by a more simplified system because it wants

337
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,380
that control.

338
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:35,540
So is it safe to say that more of the pathology that we see in the brain occurs in the cortex

339
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,380
than in the midbrain?

340
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,140
For example, Parkinson's, I guess, would be partially midbrain, right?

341
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Primarily.

342
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,140
Yeah.

343
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,940
Are there great examples of common pathology in the brainstem?

344
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Yes.

345
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:54,580
But from the point of view of dementia and neurodegenerative disorders with the exception

346
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,580
of Parkinson's disease, these are primarily cerebral cortex.

347
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:07,740
This is where you see, especially the initial functional deficits and later on the atrophy

348
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,660
and loss of tissue.

349
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,980
But most of the diseases of all age that affect the brain primarily target these cortical

350
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,180
regions.

351
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,260
And that's obviously the thing that I most wanted to chat with you about because you

352
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,620
and your colleagues, you have a different point of view on Alzheimer's disease.

353
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:32,660
And in many ways, it's when you read your work or hear you guys talk about it, it doesn't

354
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,900
sound that hard to believe.

355
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,060
It's actually quite a reasonable hypothesis.

356
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,260
Let's start with the conventional thinking on Alzheimer's disease, which needs to be

357
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:46,340
caveated with the fact that there is no disease for which we have had a greater failure in

358
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,020
our ability to treat it than this one.

359
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,940
Even cancer, which one could argue we're not exactly hitting it out of the park on,

360
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,540
we at least have some success.

361
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,740
We can point to very, very specific successes, not only in terms of prevention, for example,

362
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,460
simply the recognition that something like smoking could cause cancer led to an enormous

363
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,100
reduction and a continued enormous reduction in the onset of that disease, but also very

364
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,380
specific chemotherapeutic regiments for a subset of cancers, particularly liquid cancers.

365
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,100
And now more recently, we've seen some real breakthroughs with things like checkpoint

366
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,540
inhibitors on even solid organ tumors.

367
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,620
So at least with cancer, we have some sense of we're making progress.

368
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,860
Certainly with heart disease, we've probably made the most progress.

369
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:36,640
And yet with this disease, it appears we have not made a shred of progress.

370
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,660
What is the typical explanation for what causes Alzheimer's disease?

371
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,820
And therefore, by extension, what the path should be to prevent it or treat it.

372
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,780
You're completely right.

373
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,780
We have not made any significant progress in Alzheimer's disease research.

374
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:02,060
This is the largest failure of the biomedical research enterprise in the world during my

375
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,780
lifetime.

376
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:13,520
And the main reason is we have remained faithful to an initial observation that was done or

377
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:21,380
published at least in 1907 by Lois Alzheimer's that indicated that he saw these abnormal

378
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,440
depositions in the brains of an individual after that individual died.

379
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,680
This individual was 51 years old when he died.

380
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,800
But Alzheimer's was actually a psychiatrist, not an aeropathologist like it's pointed

381
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,120
out in books.

382
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,840
He worked in a psychiatric hospital.

383
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,960
It was part of the original group led by Crepling in Munich.

384
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,900
And they were studying mental illness.

385
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,840
And in those days, it was believed that what we call nowadays dementia was a form of mental

386
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,980
illness.

387
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:02,380
And he was surprised by this young patient that was showing these early signs of dementia,

388
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,220
you know, in his 50s.

389
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,620
And already by the time he died, that person had been suffering for many years.

390
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:15,260
So what Alzheimer's described as in the brain of that individual has Alzheimer's disease

391
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,780
is not the same disease that is happening in older people.

392
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,220
It is not the same disease that is the most common type of dementia.

393
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,580
And this has been the most basic misunderstanding from the beginning.

394
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:37,300
Historically, there was a competition between two groups, one in Prague, in Czech Republic

395
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,620
at that time was under German rule.

396
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,340
And Oscar Ficher published studies where, for example, he looked at 16 brains from patients

397
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,940
that had what was called senile dementia.

398
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,700
That is the type of dementia that was showing up in people after they were 60, 70, 80 years

399
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,820
of age, not these younger individuals.

400
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,860
And he described some of these same abnormalities that later that Alzheimer's published, but

401
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,020
for that single case.

402
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:18,140
However, Crepling was a rival of that group, especially about Ficher, who was Jewish and

403
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:24,700
so he published in the first book that talk about Alzheimer's, the first textbook of psychiatry

404
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,060
that was published by Crepling.

405
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,220
And then he say, oh, what we're seeing in these old people, this type of dementia is

406
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,020
what Alzheimer's described in that younger individual.

407
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:43,660
And from their own, there was a movement away from factors that were related to aging and

408
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:50,380
to say this is a disease that is invading somehow and it's not something that is building

409
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,180
up over the years.

410
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,060
Of course, this is actually not the case.

411
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,580
So nowadays they try to have a compromise and say Alzheimer's disease, there is early

412
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,300
onset or familial, which is primarily familial.

413
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:12,060
There's some evidence for inheritance, but nine out of 10 cases of what is referred to

414
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:20,420
as Alzheimer's disease, there is absolutely no inheritance or familial component, which

415
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:26,060
is one of the greatest fears of people when they have patients with dementia in their

416
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,420
family.

417
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,140
And not only that, it's aging related.

418
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:39,460
And because it develops very slowly over the decades, it provides an opportunity to intervene,

419
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:45,580
to determine what are the risk factors that are behind and to do an intervention.

420
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,380
If you take the other approach that this is a disease of these abnormal proteins and it

421
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,100
can happen early on, then you have a very different strategy.

422
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:03,140
So the whole field has been dominated primarily by what is called the amyloid beta hypothesis.

423
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,300
This hypothesis is completely, absolutely false.

424
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:18,020
It has no relationship whatsoever with what we see in the older people that develop dementia.

425
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:24,080
It has a relationship with some of these early cases that like the one that Alzheimer's

426
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,980
described and they have a familial component and that there is a somatic genetic component.

427
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,100
Let me just interrupt for a second to make sure I'm understanding.

428
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,060
This is obviously such an important point that I want to make sure I'm clear in that

429
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
the listener is clear.

430
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:45,860
Now, the case that Alzheimer's found in 1907, I have to assume that was a PSEN1 or 2 mutation.

431
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,940
That was what we now see accounting for less than 1% of Alzheimer's disease, but it is

432
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,700
probably the closest to a fully penetrant gene that results in Alzheimer's disease.

433
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,980
Has that ever been confirmed?

434
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,460
Are there any biologic specimens remaining from that particular individual who was so

435
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
young?

436
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,100
There are slides available, but it has never been confirmed.

437
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,020
The patient died in 1906 after many years with this chronic dementia in that hospital

438
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,820
in Munich.

439
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,660
He was deteriorated in every other respect.

440
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,940
By that time, he was unable to move and carry on activities of daily living.

441
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,500
He's been suffering from this for many years.

442
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,420
Which is not unlike what we can see in the rare patients that do have the PSEN1 or 2

443
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,060
gene, which is it can easily take hold in the 40s.

444
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,820
I unfortunately have a patient whose mother is debilitated in her mid-50s.

445
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,940
Now, it turns out she doesn't have the gene, which was a surprise to a lot of us, we assumed

446
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,620
because it had taken hold so early.

447
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,780
But the autopsy, the pathology that they could see, which at the time was limited to very

448
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,540
gross things relative to today.

449
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,700
Gross for the listener, I don't mean gross as in disgusting.

450
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,840
I mean gross as in visible through a microscope.

451
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,340
Was this the first time that amyloid beta was observed?

452
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:08,700
No, the first time was done by Oscar Fisher in the senile dimension.

453
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,420
So Alzheimer's was basically describing a phenotype, but without a pathologic explanation

454
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
or characteristic.

455
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:22,260
Yes, but because it was happening so early, then it moved the people away from the idea

456
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,380
that this has something to do with senility, with the older deterioration that happens

457
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,300
as a function of aging.

458
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,780
So they say, oh no, this can happen early on.

459
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,380
So aging cannot be a primary contributor.

460
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:46,100
So even though a very small percentage of people that are described as having Alzheimer's

461
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:54,420
belongs to this early onset, over 90% of the research is focused on that group.

462
00:31:54,420 --> 00:32:01,780
And the reasoning is because it's the same disease, which is a false premise, if we find

463
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:07,260
out what's happening in the early onset and we model that in animals by doing this genetic

464
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:16,340
manipulation, then we can fix the more common senile, older age, late onset dimension.

465
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,340
And that false premise is what has been driving all of these failures.

466
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,940
Because yes, they have been able to detect genetic changes.

467
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,500
They can manipulate this.

468
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:32,660
I was able to work, examine the brain of the first amyloid precursor mouse model that was

469
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,660
developed.

470
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:38,460
And one of the first things that I noticed in the brains, even before there was any amyloid

471
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,700
deposition in that model that they had inserted, it was a transgenic mouse model.

472
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:51,180
They had taken away the native gene from the mouse and replaced that gene with one that

473
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,980
was abnormal for an patient with early onset Alzheimer's.

474
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,860
But even before that gene could start any observable deposition of amyloid, these brains

475
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,500
by that very manipulation were abnormal.

476
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,980
They had severe atrophy.

477
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:16,100
In for example, the corpus callosum, the bundle that communicates to hemisphere and the region

478
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,020
of the hippocampal formation has lost one third of its volume.

479
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:26,980
So the intervention itself may have altered the resilience, if nothing else, of the brain.

480
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,900
And of course, then these animals show all kinds of behavioral abnormalities.

481
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,420
But these things were happening even before there was any amyloid deposition.

482
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:44,860
So it was clear that having a gene with these abnormalities, even before you can see that

483
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,540
the product building up is enough to distort how the brain develops.

484
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,460
So this has been the main problem.

485
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,140
And because biology, just like when I started studying biology, my major was called cell

486
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,980
and molecular biology.

487
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,980
And that became the dominant orientation in biology.

488
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:12,140
So people who do this research oftentimes don't have a very good understanding of the

489
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:17,180
brain as a whole, and they just focus at that molecular level.

490
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,820
And in a way, they're trying to find the answer where the light is, that is the light that

491
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:28,660
they can use, and trying to ignore that this is really a disease of all age that involves

492
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:36,260
a long development, and that there is absolutely no correlation, no relationship between the

493
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:44,300
amount of, for example, amyloid beta deposition and the onset of memory deficits, cognitive

494
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,860
impairment, or the progression of the disease.

495
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,540
There are brains of individuals that I have the fortune to examine here in Austin, has

496
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,940
had primarily a neural anatomy, a functional neural anatomy, as I collaborated with neuropathologists

497
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,100
here.

498
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:06,220
And the brains of these people who were cognitively normal after they die, they couldn't deframe

499
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:13,300
shape them from the ones that were diagnosis Alzheimer's based on amyloid and neurofibular

500
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,020
retangle depositions.

501
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,300
That's an enormous statement.

502
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,700
It doesn't call into question the causality of amyloid, it just calls into it the necessity

503
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,140
and sufficiency of it.

504
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:30,580
In other words, it could be that you have to have, I mean, I'm making this up, but to

505
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:36,180
illustrate a point within logic, it could be that you need to have amyloid beta deposition.

506
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,140
To cause dementia, but that is not sufficient.

507
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,180
It is only a necessary condition and that you might need other factors to coalesce around

508
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,380
that the obvious example that comes to my mind is LDL and APO B, which is necessary

509
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,660
for cardiovascular disease, but not alone sufficient.

510
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,860
You still need an inflammatory response and an immune response.

511
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,900
I go beyond that point.

512
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,860
What I'm saying is against the dogma.

513
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,380
You're saying one step further than that.

514
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:10,460
You were saying that not only is the deposition of amyloid not correlated strongly enough,

515
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,340
it might not even be causally related.

516
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:20,420
Not not even, it is not causally related to what we call primarily Alzheimer's disease

517
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,820
with this majority of late onset.

518
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,820
That's not true for the early onset.

519
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,680
What I'm saying is that there are two different diseases.

520
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,200
The early onset, there is a role for this amyloid deposition.

521
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,560
You can demonstrate this.

522
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:42,360
In other words, if you take autopsies of 50-year-olds that die from heart disease, cancer, or accidental

523
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,880
death and you examine their brains relative to 50-year-olds who die from early onset dementia,

524
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,680
the relationship is more clear.

525
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,920
It is clear.

526
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,280
The amyloid beta is playing a causal role.

527
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,160
Yes, there is no question.

528
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,120
You can find the genetic mutations and you can induce it in the animal, but that's not

529
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,920
the case in the late onset.

530
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,720
The neuropathologists will tell you if they don't know what the clinical picture was,

531
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,720
they wouldn't be able to say that this was what they refer to as a probable Alzheimer's

532
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,480
disease.

533
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,560
When they see the sac to the same pathology and there's no evidence of cognitive deterioration,

534
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,440
they just diagnose that brain as possible Alzheimer's disease.

535
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,160
This created a circular definition.

536
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,320
To be clear, to close the loop on that analogy with heart disease, you would have to know

537
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:45,660
that there are cases where patients have significant dementia that by all other metrics is consistent

538
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,760
with Alzheimer's dementia and not Lewy body or something else and there is an absence

539
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,040
of amyloid beta deposition.

540
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,640
What percentage approximately, I know it's hard to know these things because we don't

541
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,920
always get autopsies, but in your experience, what percentage of patients who die with or

542
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,920
from Alzheimer's disease that is late onset do not have the histopathologic features of

543
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,080
amyloid beta?

544
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:21,120
The majority of patients that are diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, pro-Alzheimer's disease

545
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,200
when they die have the same level.

546
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,680
It's not that they don't have because it's an age-related deposition.

547
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,720
The same levels of all the patients are comparable age and the only reason that they are labeled

548
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,880
as Alzheimer's is because they have the dementia.

549
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,360
The pathology cannot really tell them apart.

550
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:51,440
If you give these two pathologies blind to the medical diagnosis or clinical examination,

551
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,120
they won't be able to tell apart which are the ones that are actually demented and which

552
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,480
are not if you do it in a match.

553
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,040
There is a large degree of variability and pathologies are not quantitative.

554
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,720
Pathology is an approximation.

555
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,760
You look at only a few sections through the cortex and then you give a certain proportion

556
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,880
of the findings that you see as categories.

557
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,120
But even when I have done this personally, in 2001, we published in the journal Neuroscience

558
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,040
a study where we use brains from people who die from Alzheimer's.

559
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,680
The main difference from my study from what's been done before is that we were able to do

560
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:43,200
to obtain brains with only a few hours after the individuals had died.

561
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,880
We called a very small post-mortem interval and I was able to do this by collaborating

562
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,600
with the Institute in Arizona.

563
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:00,000
There is a city called Sun City, Arizona and they have a Sun City Health Center which actually

564
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,180
ascribes to these amyloid and neurofibular rectangle ideas.

565
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:11,980
But what we did with them was we traveled there and we, my PhD student, we collected

566
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:17,460
these brains, controlled brains and brains of people who have died of Alzheimer's.

567
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,780
Some of them we were able to collect them fresh right there.

568
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:27,140
And were you and your team also blinded to the circumstances of the death prior to the

569
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,980
autopsies being performed?

570
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,980
No.

571
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:36,740
What we did is we collected all the brains and I sectioned them into pieces and these

572
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:42,020
pieces were frozen and then one sample would remain there.

573
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I see, I see.

574
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,420
So you did everything in parallel.

575
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:50,980
Yeah, we would be chipped here to Austin and once the samples were chipped, they were coded.

576
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:56,900
But when we were there, no, we knew when somebody died because I had a pathologist with me who

577
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,460
had to certify.

578
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,300
They were dead so that we could immediately.

579
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:08,820
But when the pairwise results were evaluated, the evaluator was blind to the clinical circumstances

580
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,260
of the patient's death?

581
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
Yes.

582
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:17,340
What we did in that study was we were not only interested in just looking at amyloid

583
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:23,820
plates and neurofibular rectangles being done, we were interested in seeing is there any

584
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:31,620
biochemical change that could account for this so-called hypometabolism, this decrease

585
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,660
in energy metabolism that is seen early in Alzheimer's?

586
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,860
Is it generally well regarded bringing it back to some of your earlier work in PET?

587
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:46,820
I assume it is generally agreed upon that patients who are in the stages of cognitive

588
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,860
decline have hypo-functioning metabolism.

589
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,940
So their PET scans show less glucose uptake in the brain.

590
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,740
Is that generally acknowledged?

591
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:02,580
And not only FTG PET, when you do also cerebral blood flow, you find the same.

592
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:08,740
When you do fMRI arterial spin labeling to look at blood flow, every technique that has

593
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:16,660
been used has demonstrated that first it was with mild Alzheimer's cases but more recently

594
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:23,740
also with the so-called mild cognitive impairment that nowadays also referred to as mild neurocognitive

595
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,260
disorder.

596
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:32,140
And in those cases there is hypometabolism and the hypometabolism is primarily not in

597
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:39,580
the regions that become atrophic later on in the disease like in the temporal lobe.

598
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,820
It's primarily in the posterior cingulate cortex, one region of the brain that is in

599
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,340
the medial part in the center of the brain.

600
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:54,660
This area is the one that you can see having earliest sign of hypometabolism.

601
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,620
And from a phenotypic standpoint, what does it control in the normal brain?

602
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:07,540
This region provides the major input to what is called the entorhinal cortex, which is

603
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:15,220
the part of the temporal lobe that then feeds into the hippocampal formation.

604
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:23,140
So what essentially is happening is you have a functional disconnection between the main

605
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,260
input to the entorhinal cortex.

606
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,040
The entorhinal cortex is the primary source of inputs to the hippocampal formation.

607
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,680
So when you functionally denervate a region in the brain, eventually that leads to atrophy

608
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,040
from the region that is receiving the stimulus.

609
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,540
It is receiving that.

610
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,740
Just like happens when you denervate a muscle in the periphery, there is a trophic action

611
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:55,800
and action that that region survives because it's being stimulated by the other one.

612
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,900
So people have missed when you study pathology, you don't study these functional changes and

613
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:09,160
you don't look at the system as a network of pathways or influence functionality.

614
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,520
You're seeing the end result.

615
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,760
What has happened after all of these processes are taking place over the years.

616
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,640
So by doing that, you cannot infer these other phenomena.

617
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,360
So if you take an animal like a mouse and you just take out the, it's the posterior cingulate?

618
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,900
The posterior cingulate.

619
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,900
If you lesion that in a rat or a mouse acutely, which is not the same as what's presumably

620
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:40,260
happening in this disease state, what is the immediate phenotype of that animal or behavior?

621
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,040
Well you don't have to lesion it.

622
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:48,020
You can functionally deactivate it, which is more similar to what is actually happening

623
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,020
in Alzheimer's.

624
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,820
It's not that this region is damaged structurally.

625
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,920
Right, it's just functionally not allowing the conduit.

626
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,560
Yeah, it's affecting the network that is providing the main input to the hippocampal

627
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,560
formation.

628
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:07,600
You get the same kind of memory deficits that are characteristic of the initial stages of

629
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
dementia.

630
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,060
And is that because of the role the hippocampus plays in the consolidation of memory or is

631
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,560
it to do more with the target in the temporal lobe?

632
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:23,100
It is because it's a network, not a single region.

633
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:28,600
In other words, for example, a long time ago in the 1930s there was a circuit that was

634
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:36,580
defined by an American neuroanatomy called James Pappas, also pronounced Pappas.

635
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:43,080
And he describes the connections between the cingulate cortex, this parahypocampal cortex

636
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,420
that we now primarily refer to as the endorhinal cortex.

637
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:53,680
And then from there to the hippocampal formation, from the hippocampal formation the main output

638
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,140
goes to a region called the mammillary bodies.

639
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,360
And then from the mammillary bodies it goes to the anterior part of the thalamus.

640
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:08,640
And then from the thalamus it fans out the projections back into the cingulate cortex.

641
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,760
So it creates a circle.

642
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,760
And this is often being referred to as the limbic circuit of Pappas.

643
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:23,980
And we know it has to do with emotional memory formation because events that have a large

644
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,040
emotional signature are the ones we store.

645
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,080
We create the greatest memories from them.

646
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,080
Yes.

647
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:38,400
So if you affect this system anywhere in this system, you get a memory disease and they

648
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,280
just have different names.

649
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:47,000
So for example, people that have chronic alcohol, they develop sometimes referred to

650
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,520
as Wernicke's Korsakov dementia, also known as Korsakov psychosis.

651
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,120
You can get this from B vitamin deficiencies as well.

652
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,440
B1 deficiency, thiamine deficiency in particular.

653
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,000
You look at the pathology of the brain, where is the damage?

654
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,200
The damage is primarily in the mammillary bodies.

655
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,440
So the mammillary bodies is the main output from the hypogempo formation.

656
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,040
So whatever the hypogempo formation is contributing, if you are knocking down its main output

657
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,800
target, you get the same thing.

658
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,720
Then in a second place is the hypogempo formation itself.

659
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,800
Then the entorhymic cortex and so on.

660
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,480
All you have damage in any part of the system.

661
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,480
There's also something called diencephalic retrograde amnesia that happens with thalamic

662
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
lesions.

663
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,160
This is when these lesions interfere with these anterior thalamic areas.

664
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:47,440
So really in order for us to see the memory problems that we have linked usually with

665
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,720
Alzheimer's dementia, you have to engage this system because that system is part of the

666
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,080
brain regions in which this is operating.

667
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,780
You use the term retrograde there.

668
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,600
For the listener, we should explain the difference between retrograde and antigrade amnesia.

669
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,000
I'll let you do that quickly, but of course my follow-up question will be in the earliest

670
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,240
stages of dementia, is the bigger issue the inability to form new short-term memories,

671
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,560
which would be a form of antigrade amnesia?

672
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,080
That would happen before the retrograde amnesia, which is later.

673
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,080
Let me explain.

674
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:26,400
In the early Alzheimer's disease, the main problem is not in this limbic circuit.

675
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,960
When that happens, when you can see the hypometabolism.

676
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,400
That's when you can see the behavioral changes in the individual as well.

677
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,120
But before that, in the prefrontal cortex, especially the lateral, we call dorsal lateral

678
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:50,000
prefrontal cortex, you have a functional deficit that is interfering with what we call working

679
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,400
memory.

680
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:59,320
So you can think of memories as having three modes or temporal stages, an immediate memory

681
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,960
mode where you can remember things for only a few seconds.

682
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,520
Tell me your phone number and I have to write it down.

683
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,120
That's the perfect example.

684
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:14,240
A clinician will do this by giving a string of numbers to people and people will be able

685
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,520
to remember approximately seven numbers.

686
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:24,880
So it is usually seven plus or minus two items.

687
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,520
And this is the reason why the telephone numbers have seven digits because most people

688
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,240
after reading seven digits, turning around to try to punch those numbers in the phone,

689
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,240
if they are more than seven, they drop some of them.

690
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,600
This is this immediate memory mode.

691
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,840
But for memories to happen, they have to move from this immediate memory mode to a more

692
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,300
recent memory mode.

693
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:55,020
So the immediate, the movement from immediate to recent is done by this prefrontal cortex.

694
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:01,380
So the initial deficit that you see in Alzheimer's and all of these types of dementia of all

695
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,060
age is in this more immediate memory mode.

696
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,540
And one way we refer to this is also working memory.

697
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:14,580
So for example, you come out of your house and you lock the door, but after a few seconds

698
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:20,980
you're working to your car, then you ask, did I lock the door or is it unlocked?

699
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,920
And then you have to go back and check.

700
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,740
So this is the first thing that you're going to have.

701
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,380
And it happens physiologically as a function of aging.

702
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,280
And this is the first one, this working memory things are.

703
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,260
So the prefrontal one is the initial signal that there is a memory problem.

704
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,020
This is before, and this is an enter rate memory.

705
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,400
In other words, it's a new memory that you want to form.

706
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,620
So this is the first thing that is affected.

707
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,100
But once the memory are in the recent memory mode, this, for example, would be your phone

708
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,540
number, which is one of the easy seven digits to remember because you're so familiar with

709
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:04,060
it that it's now become quote unquote permanent memory by repetition, by exposure to the same

710
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,060
items.

711
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:09,060
These reverberate in that limbic circuit that I just told you.

712
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:14,220
And the hippocampal formation has an inner circuit that is crucial for that.

713
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,220
So it is crucial for that forming.

714
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,860
And then you being able to retrieve that number again.

715
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:26,100
So when that circuit becomes engaged at any point, then you start having this retrograde

716
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,100
memory problem.

717
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,340
You cannot remember your number, which is interesting.

718
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,100
That's the point at which the family members tend to really notice what's happening and

719
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,100
become concerned.

720
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,100
Yes.

721
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,860
The patients tend to become concerned much sooner.

722
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,540
The patients become concerned with the integrate memory deficits.

723
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,860
You're absolutely right.

724
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:51,460
How do you distinguish between something you said a moment ago, which was this slight deficit

725
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:57,180
of formation of new memory is on some levels, not necessarily a pathological finding as we

726
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:03,940
age, but how do we differentiate between the pathologic or the appropriate age related

727
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,900
versus the potentially the harbinger of something pathologic?

728
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,980
It is difficult to draw the line.

729
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,660
This is one of the main reasons that this diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment has

730
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,580
been elusive.

731
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:23,060
I have asked this question to other researchers and I get very many different opinions.

732
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,660
And the main reason is that the only way to know for sure is to compare this to your own

733
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,420
history, to compare it to yourself.

734
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:38,580
So in this case, the patient and their immediate patterns, they are more knowledgeable whether

735
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,300
they're being a change.

736
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:46,660
If you just compare to a standardized age population, you may not see any difference,

737
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,700
but the patient will tell you, no, I know I am having more difficulty with, for example,

738
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,420
this working memory test.

739
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:01,740
So it is a challenge, but the beauty of this is you don't have to wait because everybody

740
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:05,860
goes through this cognitive decline is just to different extent.

741
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:10,980
And we all start out at a different level of cognitive performance.

742
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,140
So it's very difficult to have a standard.

743
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:18,740
So my approach is to try to intervene at that point.

744
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:24,380
And therefore, the main target at that point is to intervene in the prefrontal cortex,

745
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,100
the region that is just behind your forehead.

746
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:36,700
And that one engages, we call an essential executive network that for cognitive processing

747
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,660
that is involved in working memory, that is involved in problem solving, that is involved

748
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,500
in sustained attention vigilance.

749
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:51,340
Those are the things that are going to be seen first, having a decline as you grow older,

750
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,740
just like all kinds of tissues decline as you grow older.

751
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,580
This is a reality.

752
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:03,660
But it is possible to intervene then before you get into the limbic system problems.

753
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,460
And that's the approach that we have done in our interventions.

754
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,240
And I think this is what's going to make the biggest difference.

755
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,620
So let's go back to now the sort of revised hypothesis.

756
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:20,700
So if I can summarize, the actual nomenclature of Alzheimer's disease might be a bit of an

757
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:26,380
unfortunate artifact in that it was first observed in a subset of what would become

758
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:31,660
this disease that really isn't representative of the epidemic that we're seeing today.

759
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,860
Absolutely right.

760
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,660
And so we'll put that aside for a moment because despite how tragic those early onset cases

761
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,220
are and they strike me as among the most tragic things I've ever seen in medicine, by the

762
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,780
way, you have more experience with this.

763
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:51,980
The thing that's running amok right now is this sort of late onset dementia that it seems

764
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,960
to me that we are probably diagnosing it much more than we were before, but it also seems

765
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,060
to be increasing out beyond just the rate of diagnosis.

766
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,340
And it also seems to be increasing at a rate disproportionate to the increase in our longevity,

767
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,900
which is really not that significant.

768
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:14,740
I believe that human longevity is increasing at about 0.4% per year in the United States

769
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:20,500
and yet the rate of growth of Alzheimer's disease is growing much more than that.

770
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,380
So if you discount that somewhat for the rate of for the diagnostic acumen or urgency with

771
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,220
which we seek it, there's still a gap, which means on a real level, not just a perceived

772
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,180
level, this disease is becoming more common.

773
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,540
In your research, you talk about five areas of study that help you think about this, the

774
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:44,300
epidemiology of the disease, the imaging of the disease, the pharmacologic response to

775
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:49,900
the disease, the pathologic findings in the disease, and then the clinical course of the

776
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,100
disease.

777
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,740
You and your colleagues have a different hypothesis that pertains to the vascular system.

778
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,740
Yes.

779
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:03,260
This is actually the original hypothesis that was associated with senile dementia.

780
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,180
I don't want to take credit for the people who gone after that because in the early days

781
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:17,060
it was just an idea, not well formulated, but what seems to be happening is if you compromise

782
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,700
circulation to the brain, you're always going to get a neurological deficit.

783
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,660
However, in the case of what we're seeing as late onset dementia that I may refer to

784
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:34,620
as features dementia as opposed to the early onset Alzheimer's dementia, which is what

785
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,620
should be named.

786
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:44,220
There is a chronic hypoperfusion that is the brain is receiving less blood supply.

787
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:52,980
For example, it is known that between 22 years old to 60 years old, there is a decrease of

788
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:58,340
about 20% on your supply of blood to the brain.

789
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:03,900
Some people have calculated at approximately half of a percentage per year in statistical

790
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,900
terms.

791
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,980
I have a sense of why, how much of that ... I mean, because I think a lay person might

792
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:15,660
understandably but naively assume that is just due to a gradual and gradual narrowing

793
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,580
of arteries or something like that, but it strikes me that that's very unlikely the case

794
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:26,640
and that it's much more related to something within capillaries and or other metrics.

795
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,660
Because paradoxically as we age, we're seeing an increase in our blood pressure typically.

796
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,260
When you're 20 versus 60, you're generally running with a higher blood pressure.

797
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:40,100
If anything, you would think that should increase cerebral perfusion, not decrease it.

798
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,980
But of course, we're not seeing that.

799
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,860
What do you think at the level of vascular biology would explain even that observation?

800
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,860
Yes.

801
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,860
Unfortunately, the answer is all of the above.

802
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:55,860
In other words, the vascular changes happened at the microscopic and microscopic levels.

803
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:02,700
But it is the case if you, for example, only look like we have done, for example, the carotid

804
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:07,500
artery, the one in the neck that supplies the blood to the head.

805
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,880
This is where most of the blood is going to the brain from this.

806
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:18,460
You can use ultrasound imaging, knowing basically, and are able to look at the layers.

807
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:23,060
Even the intimal thickening of the carotid artery, which would presumably get a little

808
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,420
more and more and more as one ages, is going to play a role in this potential.

809
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,420
Yes.

810
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:35,380
There is a linear relationship between what we call the intima-media thickness, the layers

811
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:40,180
of the artery and the decline in cognitive function.

812
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,980
Now, why, I mean, this sounds silly, but why a linear relationship given that it should

813
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,820
be non-linear, shouldn't it?

814
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:54,940
Given that with increase in intimal thickening, you would see exponential change in cross-sectional

815
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:59,260
area, wouldn't that lead to a non-linear change in perfusion?

816
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,260
No.

817
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,260
Which I realize you were talking about cognition, not perfusion.

818
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,260
Cognition, not perfusion.

819
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:09,420
The reason there is not a linear change with perfusion is what you alluded to.

820
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,420
We have an auto-regulatory mechanism.

821
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,420
I get it.

822
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,340
Basically, can start to auto-correct, at least try to dampen it.

823
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,340
Yes, try to.

824
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,260
Yeah, dampens it from an exponential problem to a linear problem.

825
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,940
That's a beautiful, beautiful example of biology.

826
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:29,620
So as the artery becomes stiffer with the thicker walls, it's just like if you imagine

827
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,860
somebody having a hose that is releasing water and then you stick your finger in front of

828
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:39,620
the hose and you can see how the water is coming in a faster place.

829
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,300
So this is one aspect, but this is the auto-regulation.

830
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,700
The body is trying to achieve that.

831
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:51,100
It does that when the walls become stiffer because of the thickening.

832
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:56,740
When you have this systolic pump that they're supposed to comply, or arterial compliance,

833
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,820
they don't do that.

834
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:03,180
So even though you may see the lumen being the same size, in other words, the hole being

835
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:08,900
the same size, but it's not the same size when you have the pulse, the bolus of blood

836
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,100
going through that it has to open up.

837
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:17,980
However, when we increase blood pressure, we have a constant process of trying to increase

838
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:22,700
blood pressure to maintain that same level of perfusion.

839
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,620
This now leads to problems with the capillaries because these capillaries.

840
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:33,660
So the compensation for the macrovascular disease may actually be driving part of the

841
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,980
damage at the microvascular disease.

842
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,380
We're pushing now with a higher blood pressure through capillaries.

843
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,980
And this creates pathology at this boundary we call the endothelial walls.

844
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:50,820
And these endothelial walls are now subjected to mechanical pressures that they were not

845
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,460
designed to do.

846
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:59,420
And you have extravasation and you have cells that normally are only engaged when we have

847
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,860
like a hemorrhage, like the platelets to try to coagulate.

848
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:10,740
Now they start sticking to these endothelial walls and compromising some of the microcirculation

849
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,580
as a consequence.

850
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:20,460
So the auto-regulation cannot compensate and it creates additional problems as time goes

851
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,700
by.

852
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:26,980
And that's why you are actually better off with less blood pressure by controlling your

853
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:32,940
high blood pressure than with more, even though you're trying to make up for the decreased

854
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,940
blood supply.

855
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,300
And this has actually been borne out in very recent clinical trials.

856
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:43,380
Every five years or so we see more and more data revising how we think about blood pressure

857
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:49,260
regulation and the most recent results seem to indicate the best outcomes occur with a

858
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:56,580
systolic blood pressure below 120 millimeters per mercury, a diastolic below 80.

859
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:00,460
Formerly this used to be 135-ish, over 90 was accepted.

860
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:06,860
So that's a significant difference because many people walk around, many adults walk

861
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,380
around with a blood pressure above 120 over 80.

862
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,380
You're right.

863
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:17,340
And that is an index of this pathology that is developing in the large arteries like in

864
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,340
the carotid here.

865
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,500
But I'm using the carotid as an example.

866
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,900
When this happens at the level of the carotid is happening.

867
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:27,340
You know what's happening at the vertebral arteries and into the circle of Willis and

868
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:33,820
the main basically is happening more in the arteries that have the largest flow because

869
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:39,860
we get like about one third of the blood going into the head for the primary for the brain

870
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,940
function.

871
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:46,420
So there is a much more blood flow that is going through those arteries than the one,

872
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:50,140
for example, going through your arm, your brachial artery.

873
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:53,280
However, in the case of the heart, the same thing happens.

874
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,160
You have the small coronary arteries that are feeding the heart itself as soon as you

875
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,600
it pumps.

876
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,160
So they have greater flows.

877
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,760
The other thing that happens, these walls are not only thicker, but they become irregular,

878
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,840
especially the inner walls are no longer smooth.

879
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,800
And when they are no longer smooth, you start creating turbulence.

880
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:23,120
That is, if you look at the flow of liquid, when they hit an irregularity in the walls,

881
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,760
there is a little turbulence.

882
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:31,200
So these turbulence creates a system in which the position is going to be favored, like

883
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,120
when blood is going or in the blood that is usually the white blood cells.

884
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,080
Is it usually a macrophage that infiltrates as well?

885
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,080
Yes.

886
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:46,880
But even before infiltrating, they identify this area of turbulence as an area of potential

887
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,880
injury.

888
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,760
And they start aggregating there.

889
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:56,760
And because of the turbulence cells, they start then dying out against the walls.

890
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,600
And unfortunately, cholesterol levels then can add to it.

891
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,280
But they are not the problem.

892
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,000
The high total cholesterol is not the reason.

893
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,940
Again, there's confusing causality here with a consequence of this problem.

894
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:18,620
So lowering your total cholesterol is not going to really make a major difference in

895
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:24,180
this progression, which is, I think, one of the biggest misconceptions that is happening

896
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,460
in medicine right now.

897
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:32,060
But in any case, you have a number of phenomena that are taking place that are contributing

898
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,540
to the vascular hyperperfusion.

899
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:42,460
On the other hand, you can have a similar type of insult to the brain not coming from

900
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,180
this atherosclerotic process.

901
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:51,980
If the heart muscle itself is compromised in its function because of a process where

902
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:59,380
it weakens its ability to operate as a pump, you're going to have hyperperfusion that is

903
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,380
going to be developing.

904
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:04,760
And in that case, there would even be less likely that you're going to have an auto-regulatory

905
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,860
mechanism for that.

906
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:13,940
So you can have heart disease that is affecting the pumping, the force of the pump that can

907
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,220
lead to the hyperperfusion.

908
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:22,780
You can have arterial disease like atherosclerosis that is causing similar kind of phenomenon

909
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:27,380
with some more complications that are detected by this high blood pressure.

910
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,300
In the cardiac case, you will not see the high blood pressure, but in the other one,

911
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,060
you will see that.

912
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,420
So all of these things can be detected.

913
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:40,660
It is possible for cardiologists to advance and measure these things.

914
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:46,920
And once you detect this, the health of the heart and the arterial circulation in particular

915
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,780
is very closely related to the health of the brain.

916
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:57,700
So if whatever you do that improves cardiovascular health, wealth also helps the brain.

917
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,160
But there are some differences.

918
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:05,160
For example, the brain in some ways seems a little bit more exposed because the brain

919
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,920
is perfused during systole at a higher pressure.

920
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,060
The heart is the only organ that is actually perfused during diastole.

921
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:20,800
So in that sense, the coronary arteries themselves are less susceptible to hypertension than

922
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,760
the arteries in the brain or the kidney for that matter, which would be the two organs

923
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,400
that seem to be most damaged by hypertension more so than the heart.

924
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,320
The other thing that I'm hearing you say that creates a bit of a differentiation between

925
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:39,560
the heart is in the process of atherosclerosis in the heart, cholesterol does play a very

926
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,040
important role.

927
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:46,320
But you still have the initiation of the endothelial injury, which is necessary.

928
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,560
But once the lipoprotein can get inside the subendothelial space and becomes oxidized,

929
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,480
that's what elicits the immune response, which is what does the damage.

930
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,240
What you're describing in the brain is two different processes.

931
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,600
I'm hearing you correctly.

932
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:06,680
The first is cerebrovascular disease that leads to strokes, occlusive or hemorrhagic,

933
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:11,960
which that's a separate disease because it tends to produce an acute event that is the

934
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,720
result of an acute hypoperfusion that usually produces a much more functional deficit.

935
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,720
So it's almost like you can think of that as a quote unquote brain attack the way we

936
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,720
think of a heart attack.

937
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:28,220
But what you're describing that is now sort of unique to me is a different type of much

938
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:32,860
more indolent chronic hypoperfusion that actually seems to have a slightly different

939
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:39,080
pathophysiology from coronary physiology that doesn't produce an acute event, but rather

940
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,160
a chronic disease.

941
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,300
Is that, am I, did I summarize that?

942
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,900
You summarized that really well.

943
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:51,680
It is this chronic brain hypoperfusion, regardless of the particular cardiovascular cause, because

944
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,460
I told you with heart failure, you can have, you can simulate that aspect without some

945
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,100
of the other components.

946
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:07,060
So it is possible nowadays to pick this up and to intervene to try to resolve this vascular

947
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,820
problems or cardiovascular.

948
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,820
They involve the heart.

949
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:16,380
So the epidemiology states the first and most obvious relationship, which is so obvious

950
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:20,900
that it's not almost not helpful, which is there is no greater association with Alzheimer's

951
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:25,220
disease than age, just as there is no greater association with cardiovascular disease than

952
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,460
age.

953
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:32,780
So that's stating the obvious, but it's very difficult to draw a clear hypothesis or at

954
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,900
least confirm a hypothesis.

955
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:39,220
So the next layer of thinking on the epidemiology is what?

956
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:43,980
Is it the association with hypertension or is it the association with cardiometabolic

957
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,980
disease?

958
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:50,180
How do you then continue down that line of thinking on, just again, before we get to

959
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,940
the more interesting stuff, which I think is the pathology and the pharmacology, just

960
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,180
based on the epidemiology, what else can you infer?

961
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:04,060
What would be ideal to me would be what the main purpose of that circulation from the

962
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:11,100
point of view of energy is to bring oxygen to the tissue, tissue oxygenation.

963
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:22,180
It is only through this process of reducing oxygen to water that in mitochondrial this

964
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:27,980
process is linked, this cellular respiration is linked to the production of chemical energy.

965
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:36,260
So the more direct measurements would be measurements of oxygen consumption, but also could be the

966
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:41,020
enzyme that is responsible for that oxygen consumption.

967
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:45,180
And that's where it comes to our work and what we found in the brains of those Alzheimer's

968
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,340
patients.

969
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:50,660
We found that the enzyme called cytochrome oxidase or cytochrome C.

970
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,900
Which is complex for in the electron transport chain.

971
01:09:53,900 --> 01:10:00,780
The electron transport is the last and the rate limiting enzyme and the one that actually

972
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:07,260
reduces oxygen to water that is linked to oxidative phosphorylation, the creation of

973
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,260
ATP.

974
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,580
Let's pause for a moment to make sure people understand this.

975
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,220
It's so important that even though I think I've talked about this before, it's worth

976
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,460
reiterating.

977
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:20,740
The mitochondria has an inner and outer membrane and these have four complexes.

978
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,980
Three of them span both the inner and outer membrane.

979
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:25,260
I believe it's one, three and four.

980
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,300
Complex two is only on the inner membrane.

981
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:31,780
These things are about the most essential elements of life.

982
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:36,540
Interrupting their activity for even moments at a time is the end of life.

983
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,460
I would say it's the key to aerobic life on the planet.

984
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,860
You can't overstate the importance of the electron transport chain.

985
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:52,180
As you pointed out, it is basically, we can't create energy out of nothing.

986
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,580
We simply change its form.

987
01:10:54,580 --> 01:11:00,300
When we eat food, we're eating stored potential energy that is in a chemical form that is

988
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,780
generally between the carbon-carbon-carbon-hydrogen bonds.

989
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:08,740
As these things get reduced to simpler and simpler molecules, this process specifically

990
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:17,060
within the mitochondria takes these units and it, by breaking apart the chemical bonds,

991
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:22,500
creates an electrical gradient by shuttling electrons outside of this membrane as they

992
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,100
go from complex one, two, three.

993
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,500
Of course, they each come with their own reducing agents.

994
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:31,540
I spend my most time thinking about complex one, which is the NADH, NAD shuttle.

995
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,860
I believe complex four is NADPH, isn't it?

996
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:36,260
Is that what it's using as the electron acceptor donor?

997
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:40,820
Yes, I need to emphasize from what you're saying so people understand.

998
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:47,060
The whole purpose of that chemistry that is done with the foods that we eat is to generate

999
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,420
electron donors.

1000
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:55,260
Electron donors are going to donate their electrons to electron transport.

1001
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:00,300
There are only two of them, the NADH and the FADH.

1002
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:07,100
The NADH primarily, it donates to different parts of the electron transport systems, but

1003
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:10,380
the other one, the FADH, only to complex two.

1004
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:14,260
You have two entry points, complex one and two.

1005
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,860
That's why complex two doesn't span the full membrane.

1006
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,300
It's sitting there only on the internal.

1007
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,020
It's much smaller than complex one.

1008
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,300
It's the largest one.

1009
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:28,260
This is a biochemical key to this phenomenon because what we eat from an energy point of

1010
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,620
view is just becoming electron donors.

1011
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,540
Can we donate electrons to the electron transport?

1012
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:40,980
If we could do that, we can accelerate respiration because the ultimate electron acceptor in

1013
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,180
nature is oxygen.

1014
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,060
That's what we call oxidation, the process of removing electrons.

1015
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:55,420
Making water out of oxygen and these protons that are being donated is the ultimate byproduct

1016
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:56,420
of respiration.

1017
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:59,380
That's why we breathe out water vapor.

1018
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:05,940
Of course, all of this is in service of creating an electron gradient to then fuel the generation

1019
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,500
of adenosine triphosphate ATP.

1020
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:16,460
What the mitochondria have done is coupling this affinity of oxygen to take these electrons

1021
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:26,460
that are coming from the food that we eat into a closed system in which the electrons

1022
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:34,020
when they are moving from one complex to the other, they are releasing what is called a

1023
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:37,380
proton that is positively charged.

1024
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:41,180
This is trapped in that intermembrane between the two membranes that you mentioned, the

1025
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,940
outer and the inner one.

1026
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:52,220
The matrix of the mitochondria, the more innermost portion is primarily negative in electrical

1027
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:53,220
charge.

1028
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,420
Ions are negative.

1029
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:00,020
These protons are trying to move.

1030
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:06,100
They are attracted towards this negativity just like when you have the pulse in a magnet,

1031
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,700
the positive and the negative ball.

1032
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,580
This is what we call electromagnetic force.

1033
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,740
There are only very few forces in nature like gravitation.

1034
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,180
This one is electromagnetic force.

1035
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:22,660
The system was designed in such a way that the protons will leak through a hole.

1036
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:32,820
That hole or pore is this complex V. Complex V is designed so that when the proton is

1037
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:42,380
pushing through to get from the intermembrane space to the matrix, it clicks, changes the

1038
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,940
conformation of that enzyme.

1039
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:52,300
That movement generates the energy for a phosphate to be bound to ADP.

1040
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:58,180
That phosphate is called inorganic phosphate when this is what in chemistry is called an

1041
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,020
endothermic reaction.

1042
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:04,620
It needs energy in order to happen and it's because of that movement.

1043
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:10,580
Later on, when you need some other enzyme to work, all of these chemical reactions that

1044
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:14,820
have to do with life are catalyzed or mediated by enzymes.

1045
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:21,140
What this means is that you may have the reactants already in place but nothing is going to happen

1046
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:25,820
in terms of products unless you provide energy to the system.

1047
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:34,380
These are so-called reactions that when you remove that phosphate from the ADP, it generates

1048
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,380
heat.

1049
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:38,780
This is what we call calorie.

1050
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:44,780
You can then have a quantitative relationship with how much food you eat, how many electrons

1051
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:50,380
are donated, how many of these phosphates can be broken and generate the heat.

1052
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:55,660
My heat is just like in chemistry when you had your reactants in a beaker and you have

1053
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:00,380
a catalyst and nothing was happening and then you apply heat and then all the salt in a

1054
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:04,260
reaction happens, it changes color for example.

1055
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:10,940
When that phenomenon happens, then we call that an exothermic reaction that break it

1056
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,780
and it fuels.

1057
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:18,740
The key to the system is to be able, how can we facilitate that mitochondrial respiration?

1058
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,620
This illustrates of course the most important point here.

1059
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:27,140
What you're saying is the whole purpose of eating is to convert chemical energy into

1060
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,860
chemical energy from one form to another.

1061
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:35,580
To do it, you need an intermediary to translate and that intermediate has to turn the chemical

1062
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:40,980
energy into electrical energy that then facilitates a conversion back to chemical energy.

1063
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,220
That is the key to life and that is what the mitochondria do.

1064
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:46,060
However, that is a way-

1065
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,980
At least aerobically, we can obviously do this inefficiently and anaerobically later.

1066
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,180
Correct, correct.

1067
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:55,820
You can do this, especially in other tissues, not so much the brain.

1068
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:00,940
You can generate ATP without using oxygen and this machinery.

1069
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:08,460
But every organism including single cells on the planet that uses oxygen to obtain energy

1070
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,180
relies on cytochrome oxidase.

1071
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:13,740
They may not have mitochondria, but at least they need cytochrome oxidase.

1072
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,740
Wait, I didn't realize that.

1073
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:17,500
So red blood cells, for example, don't have mitochondria.

1074
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,300
Do they have cytochrome oxidase?

1075
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,300
Yes.

1076
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,300
I didn't know that.

1077
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,300
Yes.

1078
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:29,460
If they use oxygen to generate ATP, they have to have cytochrome C and cytochrome C oxidase.

1079
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,460
This is the minimum requirement.

1080
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:37,340
That's why you can look at cell lines from microbes and so on and you can identify these

1081
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,500
proteins.

1082
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:44,380
As long as it's aerobic, it's the only way nature found how to solve this.

1083
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:48,980
But the interesting thing is that when the circulation is compromised and you have less

1084
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:54,860
oxygen, you're creating a situation where these events cannot move on.

1085
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:58,900
It doesn't matter how much you eat, and this is happening in older people.

1086
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,700
It doesn't matter how much they eat.

1087
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:06,420
In fact, their brain is telling them that they should be hungry because they are not

1088
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:12,100
able to transfer those electron donors into electron transport and produce energy.

1089
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:17,380
So they feel they're energy deprived, so they increase food consumption, especially if they

1090
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:22,860
are attracted to carbohydrates, simple carbohydrates that can quickly break down and produce these

1091
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:23,860
electron donors.

1092
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:27,340
So do you think that this is the first insult then?

1093
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,540
Because you talked about this slightly different type of microvascular disease that is much

1094
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:37,740
more chronic and insidious and doesn't lead to acute changes like hemorrhage or occlusion.

1095
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:44,300
How does that change ultimately impact the ability of the mitochondria to do its job

1096
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,940
and facilitate electron transfer?

1097
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:48,380
Yes, you put your finger on it.

1098
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,420
This is what links this phenomenon.

1099
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:55,340
Regardless of whether the chronic hyperperfusion or the more acute, one of the things that

1100
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:03,740
happen is when we have a hypoxia situation, cytochrome oxidase is an inducible enzyme.

1101
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:11,020
What that means is that our body only maintains as much as it's needed, as much as it's demanded.

1102
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:17,260
It's a complex of 13 different subunits, three of them mitochondrial DNA derived and the

1103
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:20,500
other 10 from nuclear DNA.

1104
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:26,180
You can regulate it at many different levels, including both the nucleus or mitochondria.

1105
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:31,540
But essentially, within minutes, if for example you have an area of ischemia, you occlude

1106
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:37,980
a blood vessel, half an hour later you lost a significant amount of cytochrome oxidase

1107
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:38,980
from being functional.

1108
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:39,980
That's irreversible then?

1109
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,700
No, it is not irreversible.

1110
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,060
That's the advantage of the system.

1111
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,300
The system works on demand.

1112
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,140
It may not be immediately reversible.

1113
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,620
It depends on the level of regulation.

1114
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:56,900
In other words, you can simply inhibit the enzyme and the enzyme is still there.

1115
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:02,940
Or you can disassemble the catalytic units of the enzyme, the ones from mitochondrial

1116
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:08,860
origin, and then you have a partial enzyme, not the so-called hollow enzyme.

1117
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:13,660
Or you can eliminate the other components and throughout the mitochondrial inner membrane

1118
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:18,740
you have all of these graduations of stages that can be used for regulating this.

1119
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:25,420
So you can regulate it a more immediate way or eventually you need proteins transported

1120
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:31,820
from the cytoplasm to be shipped where the mitochondria are and incorporated into this.

1121
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:34,120
Why was this done?

1122
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:39,620
Because mitochondria have a symbiotic relationship with the cells that they live on.

1123
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:46,220
And this was created to develop a dependency that mitochondria are doing this but they

1124
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,260
cannot do it on their own.

1125
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:55,460
The cell has found a way to obtain the energy but is conditional on then contributing a

1126
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:00,380
component that is necessary for the entire machinery to work.

1127
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:04,980
The important portion here is that these phenomena are coupled.

1128
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:11,620
As soon as you have hypoxia, ischemia, you reduce, then this machinery goes down regulated.

1129
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:14,980
Is that true of complex I, II, III as well?

1130
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,920
Are they also inducible the way complex IV is?

1131
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,660
Not as much as complex IV.

1132
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:24,640
They are to a certain degree if you keep taxing the system it's going to happen.

1133
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:30,500
But the one that has the more flexibility from more immediate to long term because of

1134
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:37,300
this role has rate limiting is complex IV and that's the reason it is preferred modulator

1135
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,600
of the system.

1136
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,620
That's why I love doing these podcasts.

1137
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:44,460
Every single podcast I get to learn something new in biology that I didn't know.

1138
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:51,100
I had no idea that complex IV was inducible to a greater extent than the others.

1139
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:57,140
As it is for example you may have heard for sure during your training about other inducible

1140
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:58,140
enzymes.

1141
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,140
Yes of course.

1142
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:01,380
In some systems in the liver.

1143
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:05,040
So the liver is P450, the most inducible of them all.

1144
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,960
So it's a perfect example.

1145
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,860
If you have more, if you drink more alcohol you're going to build up more of this cytochrome

1146
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:12,860
enzyme.

1147
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:16,500
So these are the most inducible and somatic complexes that we have.

1148
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,900
Just never think of it in something so important.

1149
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:24,940
Not that the liver is less important of course but the ETC is so fundamental for everything

1150
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,380
that we do.

1151
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,580
It's so interesting to think of that.

1152
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:32,340
And it's also interesting to hear you say that at least in transient periods of ischemia

1153
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,340
this is not irreversible.

1154
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,220
No, it's not irreversible.

1155
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:40,060
It's an inducible system just like you stop drinking alcohol.

1156
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:45,220
These enzymes are going to be down regulated but if you start challenging the system again

1157
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,220
they are inducible.

1158
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,220
They're going to go back.

1159
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:51,660
Of course you're going to suffer somewhat in between because at the beginning you're

1160
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,820
not going to be able to meet the demand.

1161
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,540
But they are inducible.

1162
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:03,120
This is the key that I have understood from our investigation of the Alzheimer's brain.

1163
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:09,900
In those fresh frosting Alzheimer's brain the main problem was cytochrome oxidase inhibition.

1164
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:15,540
The levels of the protein levels of the enzymes were not compromised but you could see that

1165
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:21,700
the enzyme was not in its catalytic functional state and you could demonstrate this using

1166
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,460
enzyme histochemistry.

1167
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:31,940
If you were able to extract at the moment those patients died their cells in culture

1168
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:35,540
and now they're perfused would they have still been hypo functioning?

1169
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:39,580
In other words would you still have been able to measure a deficit of oxygen utilization?

1170
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:40,580
Yes, yes.

1171
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,460
And this has been done.

1172
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:48,140
Groups have taken actually what they've taken is mitochondria and they can then see that

1173
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:53,780
these mitochondria are not performing this cellular respiration from Alzheimer's patients.

1174
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:59,140
Give me a sense of what is the magnitude of the deficit to result in the phenotype that

1175
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:00,700
we observe clinically?

1176
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:07,500
Yes, this is a very good question because if you inhibit cytochrome oxidase after about

1177
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:12,660
40% in an organism the organism dies.

1178
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,380
You cannot cut.

1179
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:19,860
But presumably it's a nomogram of duration and degree of suppression, right?

1180
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:26,020
So maybe you could have a 40% reduction for two seconds but not a 40% reduction for two

1181
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,020
minutes or something.

1182
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,900
I mean I assume that's correct.

1183
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:33,500
For example, the classic poison cyanide.

1184
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,940
What does cyanide does?

1185
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:40,660
Cyanide is complex for a cytochrome oxidase inhibitor.

1186
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:46,660
It gets into a circulation, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase and minutes later you die.

1187
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:51,020
So if that happens it's not compatible to life.

1188
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:57,260
However, you can have many degrees of this reduction because the enzyme is so inducible

1189
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,380
you not only change the catalytic activity of a particular...

1190
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:04,220
In other words, cyanide is not binary in its ability to kill.

1191
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:08,860
It seems functionally binary because it's so potent that even a trace amount of cyanide

1192
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:12,640
will kill but presumably if you dilute it enough and enough and enough you could give

1193
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,180
enough cyanide to somebody that they have a chronic illness due to...

1194
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,340
It's almost like it's a thought experiment.

1195
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:24,980
You could induce Alzheimer's at a low enough dose of cyanide to create a functional hypoperfusion

1196
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:28,060
by inhibiting complex four without killing the organism.

1197
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,060
And we did this.

1198
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,780
I like when I think of things 10 years after someone else did.

1199
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:37,060
This thought experiment was done and in fact Dr. Jack De La Torre, the one that wrote the

1200
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:40,700
book Alzheimer's Turning Point that I highly recommend.

1201
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,740
Yeah, we'll link to that for sure.

1202
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,960
And we collaborated in that study.

1203
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,860
So it works both ways.

1204
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:52,900
In other words, if you compromise the circulation by partially occluding blood vessels to the

1205
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:58,540
brain you get a downregulation on cytochrome oxidase and therefore mitochondrial respiration

1206
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:05,540
and ATP production and so on and the animal choke cognitive picture that is analogous.

1207
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:12,220
It's not the same but it's analogous to what you see in cognitive, neurocognitive disorders.

1208
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:18,740
The other way around you can directly suppress the electron transport and in our study we

1209
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:25,740
decided to use sodium as I because it's less potent than cyanide and when you do that,

1210
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:31,820
yes, you have an animal that at a very low level of decreasing you can decrease up to

1211
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:37,940
30% without seeing any neurological evident change.

1212
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:42,820
The animals appear to be eating and behaving normally but when you test them with cognitive

1213
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:46,100
memory tests they cannot perform well.

1214
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:54,020
In other words, a 30% reduction in the oxidative capacity of complex IV shows cognitive impairment

1215
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:58,580
when challenged even though behaviorally at the gross motor level the animal is still

1216
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,580
fine.

1217
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:05,340
It's an Alzheimer's patient that you will appear to be generally okay.

1218
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,940
Until you test the system harder.

1219
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:12,220
Yes, so these animals and in fact that was proposed as a model for Alzheimer's disease

1220
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:20,100
that very same approach by ColixtoMine, the one that comes to mind, it's Rose and Bennett.

1221
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:26,140
However because of the influence of this amyloid and tangled hypothesis all of these models

1222
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:32,460
were based on biochemical and physiological phenomena where really not developed fully.

1223
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:38,820
All the attention was in the genes and the abnormal proteins but yes, you can do this

1224
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,820
in animals.

1225
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:43,020
You can test these hypotheses in animals.

1226
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:45,700
Does this lead to any change in the amount?

1227
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,500
Let's assume you had an animal model where you could do this for a long enough period

1228
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,980
of time before the animal would die and you had a control animal in which you were not

1229
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:54,980
doing this.

1230
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:59,420
Did you in those two situations side by side see a difference in amyloid beta accumulation?

1231
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:05,220
No, the amyloid beta would not be a good reflection of these processes.

1232
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:11,340
The amyloid beta is primarily a process that is compensatory when the cells are showing

1233
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,420
atrophy.

1234
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:18,820
So when cells are showing signs of atrophy we have a lot of amyloid beta that is released

1235
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:24,700
embryonically during the development of the nervous system and it's because during development

1236
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:31,060
of the nervous system you have faces of large proliferation of neurons but then you have

1237
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:39,060
other faces of trimming where there is a lot of neuronal death and in those situations

1238
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,580
you see amyloid that is formed.

1239
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:51,340
So as you know probably the major signal for a cell to die in an aerobic organism is for

1240
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:58,140
the mitochondria to release cytochrome C. Cytochrome C is a protein that carries the

1241
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:00,540
electron to cytochrome C oxidase.

1242
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:08,220
If that machinery is not working and cytochrome C leaks out we say the mitochondrial permeability

1243
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:12,860
pore has been modified so that small cytochrome C leaks out.

1244
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:15,180
That's a big signal for apoptosis.

1245
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:17,700
Apoptosis or programmed cell death.

1246
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:20,380
In other words if a cell mitochondria.

1247
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:21,740
That's the surrender of the cell.

1248
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:22,740
That's the white flag.

1249
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,540
Here's my cytochrome C.

1250
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:29,420
So what I'm telling you is if you compromise the system you're going to have neural degeneration.

1251
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:33,020
You're going to have cell death and not just in the nervous system.

1252
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:37,380
It just happens that there is more critical because in all the systems we have other ways

1253
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:43,300
to get ATP but in neurons we don't have any significant amount of alternative ways to get

1254
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,300
it.

1255
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,740
Yeah that's exactly the point I was going to make is we're having this discussion and

1256
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:52,020
it would be easy for a moment to say wow why is this all isolated to the brain.

1257
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,100
It's not.

1258
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:57,060
It's just the brain I think has two problems.

1259
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:00,060
The first you know if you're going to be critical of the brain.

1260
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:05,700
The first is an energetic problem which is it is simply the most demanding and therefore

1261
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:10,460
it is the most susceptible to a reduction in total available energy.

1262
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:15,020
The brain weighs about 2 percent of our body weight and yet consumes about 20 percent of

1263
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,900
our total energy expenditure.

1264
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:21,060
So that's a grossly disproportionate amount of energy.

1265
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:25,700
And the second by the way would be the kidney which by the way is the second organ we tend

1266
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28,120
to see great ischemic.

1267
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:33,340
When we see hypoperfusion clinically we see kidney damage and myocardial damage.

1268
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:36,060
So the more energy demanding the organ the bigger the problem.

1269
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:42,420
And then the second issue with the brain is this seemingly overreliance on oxidative phosphorylation

1270
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,860
without an anaerobic escape route.

1271
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:49,780
Yes you are right on target and this is what makes it so vulnerable.

1272
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:56,020
And this is why we see these changes more as cognitive deficit before all the tissues

1273
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,860
are really damaged or the brain itself.

1274
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:04,780
But as you continue with this process as we just talked about if downregulation of cytochromox

1275
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:09,500
they reach a certain level cytochrome C is going to start releasing.

1276
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:13,940
There is this permeability change goes out and cells start dying.

1277
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:21,060
So it is the direction of causality is completely different from the amyloid ideas that the

1278
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:26,940
amyloid comes there because of a gene that is abnormal and then it's creating these cascades

1279
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,020
that are leading to these changes.

1280
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:35,820
No what we have is this problems with supply of oxygen that happen to the brain and it's

1281
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:41,580
this high energetic demand and they could be due to the circulation or it could be due

1282
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,660
to a cardiac effect on the circulation.

1283
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:51,740
But unfortunately the vascular hypothesis of dementia is not exclusionary because you

1284
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:59,620
can have toxic insults that affect the mitochondria that will for all physiological purposes will

1285
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:04,460
do something similar to these cardiovascular insults.

1286
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:09,460
In other words they are going to lead also to downregulation of cytochrome oxidase and

1287
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:13,620
your inability to use oxygen to generate energy.

1288
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:20,820
So that's why I have used that entry point into the system because it is completely consistent

1289
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:29,340
with the vascular hypothesis of dementia but it also provides room for other insults to

1290
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:34,220
the brain that are going to be reflected at that level and it's only when they are reflected

1291
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:38,540
at the level that then they because of this energetic demand this vulnerability that you

1292
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:42,140
alluded to that then this is going to lead to a cognitive.

1293
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,900
Why a cognitive problem and not something else?

1294
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:53,900
Because when we are engaged in these functions that I explained we these functions are not

1295
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,660
limited to one region of the brain.

1296
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:00,480
They are relied on interaction between different regions.

1297
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:05,700
So when you're reading something that information goes to your visual system but then if you're

1298
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:10,060
going to engage learning having to do with that then we'll engage other systems.

1299
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:14,480
So the memory functions are more distributed.

1300
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:18,580
So when you have a more distributed metabolic insult they're going to be affected.

1301
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:24,540
It's just like people know somebody may get a blow to the head and then all of a sudden

1302
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:26,420
they may have retrograde amnesia.

1303
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:29,100
They may not remember what happened.

1304
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:35,260
They may remember who they are and you may not see any significant level of structural

1305
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:41,380
damage but you affected the way the systems were interacted in a more global way.

1306
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:47,880
So this is one of the reasons we detect this primarily as a memory problem initially but

1307
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:54,020
later on it becomes a neurodegenerative disorder when cells cannot longer work without this

1308
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,020
mitochondrial machinery.

1309
01:33:55,020 --> 01:34:03,200
Do we have any insight into how much mitophagy or autophagy is going on in the later stages

1310
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,200
of Alzheimer's disease?

1311
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:10,360
In other words, is it possible that so much of this damage is now due to defective cleaning

1312
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:16,220
up of the mitochondria because the more these mitochondria are damaged the more mitochondrial

1313
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,720
DNA is getting released.

1314
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:23,000
The mitochondrial DNA itself is actually looks bacterial so it elicits an immune response.

1315
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,260
This probably accelerates the process.

1316
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:31,080
It would seem that anything that would increase mitophagy or autophagy would at least be able

1317
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:38,080
to curb the progression of the feed forward loop on this damage going and accelerating.

1318
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,420
Wouldn't that make sense?

1319
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:41,420
I agree.

1320
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:43,880
However, it's too late.

1321
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:49,420
If you already compromised the machinery for obtaining the energy, it's too late at that

1322
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,420
point.

1323
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:57,420
So my focus on the focus of Jack Delatorre and other people is how can we intervene,

1324
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:03,360
for example, one way is in the risk factors that have to do with the cardiovascular compromise,

1325
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,120
try to intervene with the risk factors.

1326
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:10,960
Besides blood pressure, what do you view as the most important risk factors then?

1327
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:17,380
I think atherosclerosis is a really important risk factor and the major blood vessels you

1328
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:23,920
indicated like the carotid, the ascending aorta and the renal arteries.

1329
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:29,420
They are the large blood vessels are the main targets of these arterocollortic processes,

1330
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:32,500
especially at the bifurcation points.

1331
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:38,900
The other factors that I would consider would be generalized trauma to the brain.

1332
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,660
Yeah, I was going to ask you about this.

1333
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:47,700
This seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to chronic traumatic encephalopathy where

1334
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:54,040
the difference is if you're a football player or a boxer, you have repeated short bouts

1335
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,440
of hypoxia.

1336
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,960
It appears from my reading of the literature that every time you're getting hit in the

1337
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,720
head, you're having a transient interruption of blood flow.

1338
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:09,560
And also it appears based on at least the animal models, we're seeing transient insulin

1339
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:13,060
resistance at the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase.

1340
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:20,060
So a blow to the head will transiently make it harder for pyruvate to turn into acetyl

1341
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:25,560
CoA, which is the opening substrate in the Krebs cycle.

1342
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:29,840
And so while the patients we're describing, who presumably let's just make math simple

1343
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,500
and say they never get a concussion or a hit in the head, they have this chronic insidious

1344
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:36,620
disease process.

1345
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:41,940
The athletes who are suffering this type of injury are getting punctuated by spike functions

1346
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:44,120
of these, and it doesn't have to be a concussion every time.

1347
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,700
It could be each play on the field or something like that.

1348
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,820
Do you think there's an overlap in these processes?

1349
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:49,860
Oh yes, completely.

1350
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:55,780
This is what's called dementia pugilistica originally.

1351
01:36:55,780 --> 01:37:01,580
And often nowadays this is confused with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

1352
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:06,880
In the case of Parkinson's disease, because with the blows to the head, there is a rapid

1353
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,740
twisting of the head.

1354
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,620
When you get a blow to the head, a rapid twisting, bending of the head with respect

1355
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,620
to the neck.

1356
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:18,400
Yeah, it's an angular momentum that usually causes that injury.

1357
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:22,240
And this affects the midbrain and the upper brain stem.

1358
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,820
And actually that's what leads to the knockout.

1359
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:29,340
That would feed more into a Parkinsonian phenotype in the midbrain and the substantia nigra.

1360
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:34,200
You will be isolated in that region as more vulnerable for this.

1361
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,740
But it is the same phenomena.

1362
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:41,340
All of these forms of dementia will have a common denominator at some point, regardless

1363
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:45,460
of the many different ways that you can impact the system.

1364
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:50,460
The most likely common denominator will be at the level of the mitochondrial respiration.

1365
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:56,380
And therefore, another way, for example, the circulation may not be a good target for neural

1366
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:05,040
trauma, but if you find a way to facilitate mitochondrial respiration, even if there's

1367
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:11,280
compromise, hyper-refusion or some other condition, and this is what I've been working on for

1368
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,800
many years.

1369
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:19,880
And once we discovered that the main problem in the Alzheimer's brain had to do with this

1370
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:25,340
inhibition of cytochrome oxidase, we set out to how can we intervene?

1371
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:26,720
Is there any way?

1372
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:32,480
And you have two interventions that you have now coupled that both work on cytochrome C,

1373
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,440
but in a slightly different way.

1374
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,240
Yes, cytochrome C oxidase.

1375
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:40,640
Cytochrome C is the carrier, and cytochrome C oxidase is the large inside.

1376
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,640
The large complex, yeah.

1377
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,640
Thank you for clarifying.

1378
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:47,240
So the first one, I use a pharmacological approach because I was more familiar with

1379
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:51,240
those approaches, but I couldn't do it with regular.

1380
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:56,300
Because of what is called neuropharmacology or psychopharmacology is really aimed at

1381
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:01,620
neurotransmission, resectors and agonists and antagonists.

1382
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:05,460
What's needed here is something is acting at the level of mitochondrial respiration

1383
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:10,260
and reviewing all literature from the 1960s.

1384
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:18,220
I found out that metal and blue commonly used compounds in the lab was able to act as an

1385
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,820
electron donor.

1386
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:25,020
And depending on the conditions, but if you make it a very low concentration, it acts

1387
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:26,300
as an electron cycler.

1388
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:31,740
It will donate, but it will also get electrons from other compounds and it will continue

1389
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:37,420
to feed into the electron transport as an alternate route.

1390
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:43,820
And in fact, if you block, for example, complex one with ruthenon that you're interested,

1391
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:50,340
still the electron transport can proceed going through metal and blue as a bypass.

1392
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:54,920
Because in a normal organism, complete blocking of complex one would be fatal.

1393
01:39:54,920 --> 01:40:00,560
You're saying with a high enough concentration of methylene blue, you can still get electrons

1394
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,740
past the bottleneck of complex one.

1395
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:06,760
We can prevent in animal models, degeneration.

1396
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,940
We showed this in many preparations.

1397
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:13,400
We first did it in the retina because it was more accessible and we could manipulate that

1398
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:16,040
locally as a model of the brain.

1399
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,800
And then we did it in the brain.

1400
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,240
So this has an interesting history, right?

1401
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:22,000
There's a guy named Paul Ehrlich who studied this, right?

1402
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,440
And the only reason I remember this is-

1403
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,400
One of my heroes.

1404
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,400
Really?

1405
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,400
Yeah.

1406
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,120
Well, I read something that I love where expressions come from.

1407
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:35,440
And so there's an expression balls to the wall, which means like going very, very fast

1408
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,440
all out.

1409
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:40,400
And most people don't realize, but it just refers to a governor and a train where the

1410
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:45,320
governor, the faster that the train was going, these balls that were hanging on, you know,

1411
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:48,980
basically cables would move further and further out as the centrifugal force goes.

1412
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:52,680
And once they touch the wall, that's the mechanism that would regulate the speed and slow it

1413
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,680
down.

1414
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:57,280
But there's another expression that comes from Ehrlich's work, which is, is it a magic

1415
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,280
bullet?

1416
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,280
Magic bullet.

1417
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,240
And he referred to methylene blue as a magic bullet.

1418
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:10,280
And Ehrlich, Paul Ehrlich, he worked in Berlin, Germany, and he was able to be part of a very

1419
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,200
progressive group at the time.

1420
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,160
So before World War II, this was in the-

1421
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,160
Yeah.

1422
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,160
This is-

1423
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,160
Actually, this is in the late 1800s, right?

1424
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,160
No, no.

1425
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,160
This is in the late 1800s.

1426
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1427
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,080
1886, he was working on this and he injected.

1428
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,880
At that time, it was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

1429
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,480
And the first thing in the Industrial Revolution that was developed were the textiles, being

1430
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:34,040
able to manufacture clothing.

1431
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:40,040
And one of the important things was the transition from using natural products for dyes to, you

1432
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,760
know, develop chemists, developing synthetic dyes.

1433
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,560
And actually, Germany led this process and methylene blue was one of these synthetic

1434
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,760
dyes, blue dye.

1435
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:56,440
And for many decades, it was the blue dye used in blue jeans and most of the other blue

1436
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,840
clothing.

1437
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:05,000
So one of the things that intrigued Paul Ehrlich was that he injected methylene blue, one of

1438
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,160
these new synthetic dyes, into a live rat.

1439
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:15,720
And then he dissected the animal after killing the animal, he dissected the animal.

1440
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:21,200
And he found out that the methylene blue, this was a large concentration intravenous

1441
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:29,240
injection, was primarily staining nervous tissue, the brain and peripheral nervous tissue.

1442
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:34,440
So he created the concept there of a magic bullet.

1443
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:40,080
This is a chemical that, remember this in the 1880s, this is a chemical that I'm giving

1444
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:46,600
systemically, yet it is somehow finding its way to the nervous system.

1445
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:51,240
And it's becoming trapped there, as you can see by the stain.

1446
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:55,680
Later this phenomenon was called supra vital or vital staining.

1447
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:01,880
And it was exploited, for example, by Santiago Ramón Iqal, one of my other heroes during

1448
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:03,160
this time.

1449
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:09,160
He referred to this as the Ehrlich reaction, to be able to stain nervous tissue when the

1450
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,160
animal was alive.

1451
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:17,120
But what does it mean, the animal being alive, the animal respiring, the animal using oxygen.

1452
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:22,200
So methylene blue, they didn't know this, but methylene blue has affinity for these

1453
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:28,880
redox reactions that are happening in a maximized way inside the mitochondrial in the electron

1454
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,520
transport chain.

1455
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:37,720
And especially at low concentrations, it becomes trapped for periods of hours inside mitochondrial.

1456
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,960
It can work as a mitochondrial stain.

1457
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,460
Does it become toxic?

1458
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,720
What is it toxic that you look like at a higher dose?

1459
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:51,480
At a higher dose, instead of acting as an electron cycler, it actually replaces oxygen.

1460
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,720
You know, it competes with oxygen.

1461
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:57,320
Remember that I told you oxygen was the one that was taking the electrons.

1462
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:04,080
So he can be, you wanted to have it in a low concentration that is giving electrons

1463
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,580
and taking electrons at the same rate.

1464
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:09,600
But you're saying at a higher dose, it becomes a proton acceptor.

1465
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:15,960
Little, little, yes, because it competes with oxygen and it oxidizes the tissues.

1466
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:23,520
And actually, that was in part the first application that Ehrlich found for methylene blue.

1467
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:28,280
So that's interesting because the only time obviously that I've ever seen it used is for

1468
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:31,040
treating methemoglobinemia in the emergency room.

1469
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:35,760
So someone is exposed to carbon monoxide, you know, acutely or even chronically over

1470
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,200
a long period of time.

1471
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:39,800
This basically breaks it apart.

1472
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:44,280
So there you actually want it to sort of outcompete oxygen a little bit, right?

1473
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:45,880
Is that what's happening there?

1474
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:46,880
Yes.

1475
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:51,800
No, what is happening there in the carbon monoxide occupies the in the heme molecule,

1476
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,160
the pocket where normally oxygen finds.

1477
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,160
That's right.

1478
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,760
So you actually wanted a competitor.

1479
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,480
Yeah, you wanted to get the carbon monoxide out.

1480
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:03,160
That will displace it and methemol blue will do that.

1481
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:13,480
But because you do this infusion, so methemol blue can be used to prevent or rescue you from

1482
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:18,280
methemoglobinemia, this inability to bind the oxygen.

1483
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:22,720
But a higher concentration induces methemoglobinemia.

1484
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,720
Yes.

1485
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,240
The same compound.

1486
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:30,120
So this is typical of all of these three dogs chemicals that I studied.

1487
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,120
They have this.

1488
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,800
They have bimodal functional points.

1489
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:38,120
We call these by basic dose response or a hormetic dose responses.

1490
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:43,920
But essentially they do the opposite effects, low and high concentrations.

1491
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,440
Now the color, the other, if someone's listening to this, they'll remember the high school

1492
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,080
chemistry class.

1493
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,000
How do you demonstrate this to your students?

1494
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Yes.

1495
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,800
Well, when you add the powder of methelene blue into water, the water becomes very blue.

1496
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:05,760
And then if you use a reducing agent and I use vitamin C ascorbic acid because it's an

1497
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,160
effective reducing agent, but it's harmless.

1498
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:12,000
When the methelene blue is reduced, it becomes transparent.

1499
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Reducing meaning it's accepting protons.

1500
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Yes.

1501
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,880
It's no longer acting as oxygen.

1502
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,080
So then you'll turn that vial clear.

1503
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,080
Clear.

1504
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:25,160
And this is then you'll refer to it as leuco, methelene blue.

1505
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:29,280
Leuco actually comes from the same root like leucosides, the white blood cells.

1506
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,280
Yes.

1507
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:32,560
So you call it the leuco, methelene blue.

1508
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:37,360
That refers to the methelene blue being in the reduced state as opposed to the oxidized

1509
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,360
state that is the blue.

1510
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:45,600
So methelene blue had major advantages, but one of the cosmetic disadvantage is that

1511
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,880
once it goes through this process that I explained that becoming trapped, that was discovered

1512
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,480
by air leach of becoming trapped in the nervous tissue.

1513
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:58,640
So it has affinity for nervous tissue inside mitochondria.

1514
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:01,400
Eventually it goes back into the circulation.

1515
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:08,440
It takes half life of about 12 hours with a dose that is a low dose that produces this

1516
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,100
redox benefit.

1517
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:13,360
So it concentrates in the urine, in the bladder.

1518
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:19,240
And actually here in the U.S. for decades before the antibiotics were available, if

1519
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:24,800
you had a urinary bladder infection, you took methelene blue pills.

1520
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,080
The methelene blue pills will start increasing the concentration of methelene blue inside

1521
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:36,120
the bladder until it became a pro-oxidant while it was there and it eliminated any bacteria

1522
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:39,280
or virus in a non-specific manner.

1523
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:46,480
And it was a very effective, more effective way to eliminate urinary bladder infection.

1524
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:51,640
For example, in older people have chronic problems that they go through round after

1525
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:56,900
round of antibiotics that they rehabilitate them or create resistance.

1526
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,440
You could use methelene blue.

1527
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:04,080
And is it because the methelene blue would add a dose that was not toxic to the human

1528
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:08,360
once it concentrates in the bladder, it increases its concentration and therefore is toxic to

1529
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,360
the organism.

1530
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,040
It would become oxidative and it would be toxic for the bacteria.

1531
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:16,040
Also is it a Ross-induced injury to the bacteria then?

1532
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,040
Correct.

1533
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,720
So you're basically going after the mitochondria of the bacteria.

1534
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:20,720
Yes.

1535
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:21,720
Yes.

1536
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:25,360
It does the opposite, but it does it to the microorganisms that are inside the bladder

1537
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,960
that are producing the infection.

1538
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,080
So it has the potential to do this in all the situations, but here naturally concentrates

1539
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,080
there.

1540
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,320
So that provides the advantage.

1541
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:41,760
But there are many things about methelene blue I will not go into, but Erlich himself

1542
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:49,760
determined that the parasite that produces malaria, the Plasmodium falciparum had an

1543
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:55,960
enzyme that was particularly vulnerable to not much large concentrations of methelene

1544
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:59,560
blue were enough to affect this enzyme.

1545
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:05,480
So methelene blue became the first and for a long time, the only treatment for malaria.

1546
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:13,160
And this was a major breakthrough in medical research was in fact the first synthetic chemical

1547
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:19,720
used for a medicinal application in the history of medicine and pharmacology was methelene

1548
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:20,920
blue.

1549
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:28,720
And all of the first synthetic medicines were derivatives of methelene blue, including in

1550
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:37,200
particular the late 1940s, early 1950s, the development of chloropromase, the first psychopharmacological

1551
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:41,360
agent that was used for psychosis or what we call now schizophrenia.

1552
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:47,760
In those days they will call it dementia precause because they were thinking that it was the

1553
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,400
same kind of dementia that was happening.

1554
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:52,040
The older people happening, the young people.

1555
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:57,160
Now we make a separation between dementia and schizophrenia, but chloropromase is a

1556
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:03,280
methelene blue derivative and in fact there are reports as far as 1930s of physicians

1557
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,480
giving methelene blue mixes.

1558
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:11,520
The problem was that in the original way that methelene blue was synthesized for textiles,

1559
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:17,400
there were a lot of intermediary products as a result of the synthesis and some of these

1560
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:20,000
were likely chloropromase.

1561
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,320
So they were seeing anti-psychotic effects from giving these methelene blue preparations.

1562
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:31,080
Because I found reports in the 1930s and 1940s and then it was picked up by a pharmaceutical

1563
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:37,600
company and by the end of the 1940s they developed chloropromase as the first anti-psychotic

1564
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:41,600
medication and that would change completely the face of psychiatry.

1565
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:45,960
And it may have just been simply a chemical contaminant slash intermediary contaminant

1566
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:49,560
within the formulation of methelene blue.

1567
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:53,720
So they thought the benefit was methelene blue, it was actually from a byproduct within.

1568
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,280
And they discovered what the byproduct was.

1569
01:50:56,280 --> 01:51:02,960
Which is such a great story of chemistry in general, how easy it is to be fooled by something

1570
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,320
that seemingly makes sense.

1571
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:10,040
Now today the only FDA indication to my knowledge for methelene blue is methemoglobinemia, is

1572
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,040
that correct?

1573
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,040
Yes.

1574
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,480
I mean there's clinical trials that are going on to study this in all fibrous diseases.

1575
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:20,760
Yeah, let me clarify that because what happened is that methelene blue was being available

1576
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,280
for 120 years plus.

1577
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:28,480
So methelene blue was grandfathered by the FDA.

1578
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,660
It preceded the creation of the FDA.

1579
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:40,280
So the FDA has not been able to resolve well how they deal with these grandfathered drugs.

1580
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:44,440
Being the first synthetic drug available, so it was used for many things.

1581
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:49,920
I'm not going to go into all of them but malaria was probably the most important one.

1582
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:55,200
Until some Spanish and French explorers in South America discovered from the bark of

1583
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:01,920
the tree quinine and then that happened and it became the next generation after methelene

1584
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:02,920
blue.

1585
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:07,080
Nowadays they're bringing back the methelene blue, especially in Africa, because there

1586
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:10,960
the Plasmodium has become persistent to quinines.

1587
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,000
So they are combining it.

1588
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,560
So there's a comeback for methelene blue in that respect.

1589
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:21,240
So it is used medicinally for that.

1590
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:25,800
But the FDA never really got to have a saying on it.

1591
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:33,780
So what you're referring to is what has survived in what is called the US pharmacopoeia.

1592
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:37,680
These companions of medications with indications.

1593
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:43,280
And in the US pharmacopoeia, that indication of methelene blue for methemoglominemia has

1594
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,680
survived.

1595
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:48,480
Some of the others have been removed, like I told you, for urinary bladder infections

1596
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:51,080
when the antibiotics became available.

1597
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:53,600
But it's being used to protect the brain.

1598
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:58,340
You mentioned cancer early before we started the interview.

1599
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:03,840
Many of the drugs that are used for chemotherapy have side effects that affect the brain, in

1600
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,560
particular mitochondrial respiration.

1601
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:12,920
So methelene blue, given before or during chemotherapy interventions, have been found

1602
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:15,120
to be life saving.

1603
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:18,160
One example is one called Iphosphamide.

1604
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:24,480
So Iphosphamide in deuce encephalopathy happens in this chemotherapy.

1605
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:28,240
And there are many papers on this.

1606
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:35,080
However, the problem is the FDA will not acknowledge these uses because there is no pharmaceutical

1607
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:37,680
company who is bringing these materials.

1608
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:43,320
I guess this is sort of an impossible situation to understand because the FDA can't really

1609
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:49,480
consider the approval for an agent or a use without an investigational new drug filing

1610
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,480
an IND.

1611
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,480
Oh, yes.

1612
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:56,040
There is no IND, I assume, for methelene blue because there's no economics in methelene

1613
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,040
blue.

1614
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,040
Yeah.

1615
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:02,160
There is no company that wants to invest because it's not patentable.

1616
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:04,520
They cannot protect their with a patent.

1617
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:09,480
So anybody can manufacture methelene blue and prescribe it or use it.

1618
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,520
In some countries like Canada, it's freely available.

1619
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:20,280
Here in the US, it's unclear what its status is, but you can get it through the internet.

1620
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,880
The problem is there are two problems.

1621
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,040
One, you have different purities.

1622
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:30,240
So you have at least three categories of purities for methelene blue.

1623
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:37,400
The one that should be used in humans like in the emergency room is called pharmaceutical

1624
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,680
quality or the US, we call USP grade.

1625
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:48,320
The Europeans have a similar, but the one in the USP is actually more stringent than

1626
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,160
the European methelene blue.

1627
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:55,400
Then there is chemical quality that is used in laboratory for staining.

1628
01:54:55,400 --> 01:55:01,840
But that can go, for example, the one produced by Sigma has about 15% impurities.

1629
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:07,160
It should not be given to live animals or humans and is readily available.

1630
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,360
So I always want to warn against that.

1631
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:14,020
And in many experiments with animals, they use that Sigma Prado.

1632
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:18,400
So we don't know if we're confounding the results of the experiments with the impurities.

1633
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,920
And impurities are very toxic.

1634
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,320
He has lead, he has mercury, he has cadmium.

1635
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:26,200
He has a number of neurotoxic impurities.

1636
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:29,480
And then the other one is even less pure, it's the industrial.

1637
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:30,480
Color the genes.

1638
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,800
To color the blue genes and all the things.

1639
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,280
And that is even more than 15% impurity and nobody knows for sure.

1640
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:45,400
Now there was a company in Scotland several years ago that ran a compound, LMTM.

1641
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:49,920
And the trial, which was announced, results of this trial were announced about two years

1642
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,920
ago.

1643
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,160
And that was a big hoopla because the study, which I went back and skimmed the other day

1644
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:58,220
because I knew we would probably, I was hoping we would talk about this.

1645
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:03,160
The study basically took patients in early stages of dementia, randomized them to various

1646
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:08,040
interventions, but one of them was this agent, this LMTM, which they described as a methylin

1647
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,360
blue derivative.

1648
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,760
I don't know how far a derivative it was.

1649
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,160
It might have been not much of a derivative.

1650
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:19,520
It's essentially, you remember when I told you I added ascorbic acid, it used methylin

1651
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:20,520
blue.

1652
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,800
So they don't something like this.

1653
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:26,000
They have reduced methylin blue, but they don't use the name methylin blue.

1654
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:32,560
They use the name of a methyltionine chloride, which is a more chemical name.

1655
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,600
And that's where the MT comes.

1656
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,920
And then the L is for the leuco.

1657
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:39,320
Because it's clear, it comes in its reduced form.

1658
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:41,640
That's the form that is in the pill.

1659
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,440
As soon as it's in the body, it's oxidized.

1660
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,920
Yeah, it starts these redox cycles.

1661
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,560
And those patients did void blue.

1662
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:49,560
Oh, yes.

1663
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:52,640
So it is clear that it's doing the redox cycles.

1664
01:56:52,640 --> 01:57:00,440
Now, what was very controversial about this was the primary endpoint of that study was

1665
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:04,720
a neuroimaging outcome.

1666
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:07,040
And the primary output failed.

1667
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,760
There was no difference on neuroimaging.

1668
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,000
There was a secondary outcome on cognitive function.

1669
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,280
And in a subgroup analysis, which again, the statisticians will say, they cry foul,

1670
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,280
right?

1671
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:21,920
And understandable, you can't start parsing the data.

1672
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:22,920
And I agree.

1673
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:23,920
Yes.

1674
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:29,600
But the argument was the subset in which this benefit was seen, which was about 15%.

1675
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:33,960
And if I recall, it was only patients that received the LMTM in monotherapy.

1676
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:38,640
So what we don't know, unfortunately, because this to me left a lot of questions unanswered,

1677
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:39,640
right?

1678
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:43,520
It certainly suggested there's something going on with methylin blue.

1679
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:49,840
But are we being misled because the combination of methylin blue with other drugs obfuscates

1680
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:50,840
the results?

1681
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:51,840
Yes.

1682
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,840
I think that's the most likely.

1683
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:53,840
That's one.

1684
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,840
Yeah.

1685
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:55,840
That's a, you think that's the most likely.

1686
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,840
Oh, yes.

1687
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,400
However, let me clarify.

1688
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:03,760
These individuals have never presented methylin blue or understood methylin blue from the

1689
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:09,640
point of view that are being presented to you as a metabolic enhancer, or it could be

1690
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:16,760
a metabolic poison too, but in low concentrations, the low concentrations as a metabolic enhancer

1691
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:22,680
acting on the mitochondrial respiration, they have been presented these as an anti-towel

1692
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,280
medication.

1693
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:25,280
That's correct.

1694
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,920
The entire company with whose name I forget now.

1695
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:28,920
Yes, called towel.

1696
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,320
It had towel in the name.

1697
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:31,320
Yes, towel X.

1698
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:32,320
Yeah.

1699
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:33,320
Yeah.

1700
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:34,320
That's the other thing that interested me, which was.

1701
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,440
The hypothesis is completely wrong.

1702
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:39,000
They might have backed into something interesting, potentially.

1703
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Yes.

1704
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,520
And I say this here publicly.

1705
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:49,680
It is unfortunate that they have done this this way because they are undermining the

1706
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:52,440
potential benefits of methylin blue.

1707
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:57,440
The biochemist who is behind the hypothesis are not going to name.

1708
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:06,440
He found that in vitro, relatively large concentrations to based on what I'm telling you about mitochondrial

1709
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:14,360
respiration, it prevented the phosphorylation and agglutination of tau in vitro.

1710
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:20,440
So they then infer, or this is an anti-towel agent.

1711
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:26,960
If you test methylin blue with immediate different compounds, depending on the concentration

1712
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:32,920
of methylin blue, because it has reducing or anoxidating action, it will interfere with

1713
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,640
all kinds of phenomena.

1714
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,400
There's nothing specific about methylin blue.

1715
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,720
This may be true, true and unrelated.

1716
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:44,440
Its effect on tau, whether correct or incorrect, may not actually matter.

1717
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:48,400
And not only that, the effect is dose-dependent.

1718
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:53,080
In other words, in vitro, the more concentration of methylin blue had you, the more you interfere

1719
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,000
with the tau aggregation.

1720
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,800
In other words, you don't see this bimodal dose response.

1721
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:02,680
No, because they were actually working on the high end of concentration.

1722
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:06,600
Does that mean they weren't even looking to see what the toxicity was in the mitochondria

1723
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,360
when they did the initial work?

1724
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:15,240
They did some later work to address this when they wanted to move this to the FDA.

1725
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:21,400
But the point is, in the first studies from this group, the most effective dose was the

1726
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,400
lowest dose.

1727
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,560
And it was in the monotherapy group.

1728
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:27,480
No, no, this was before that study.

1729
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,080
Before that study that you're citing.

1730
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:30,560
Oh, this is the phase two.

1731
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,400
That was the first study.

1732
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:39,480
In the first study, they found some effect with a very low dose.

1733
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:46,600
And in the higher doses that would approximate these anti-tau effects, they found no effects.

1734
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:51,480
And they turned this around in such a way that in one of the papers published in the

1735
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:59,000
Journal of Alzheimer's disease, that a friend of mine is the editor, they claimed that actually

1736
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,280
the highest dose, there was a problem with the absorption.

1737
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:07,040
And it was really a low dose.

1738
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:11,680
And the lowest dose was more easily absorbed.

1739
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,220
And it was really then the high dose.

1740
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:20,880
And then they changed the result to indicate all the low dose was the high and the high

1741
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,040
dose was the low.

1742
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:23,160
And that's why it worked.

1743
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:28,280
So in other words, they did not change their hypothesis that was contradicted by their

1744
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:32,160
data, which is the same thing that's been happening with the amyloid people.

1745
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:37,440
Their results do not support their hypothesis and they keep blindly moving forward.

1746
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:45,880
So now what you explain was because they have difficulties getting a patent for this compound,

1747
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:52,880
they created this reduced version of methyl and blue and did similar studies.

1748
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:59,840
But in that study, they had the problem that the majority of the people, if you are having

1749
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:06,080
Alzheimer's disease and you're in a hospital or being treated by usually neurologists or

1750
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:13,240
sometimes psychiatrists, they would prescribe unfortunately, unfortunately, drugs that have

1751
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:20,920
no benefit to the patients, but produce adverse effects such as cholinesterase inhibitors and

1752
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:21,920
memantine.

1753
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,560
And the idea being as well, this is the standard of care.

1754
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:29,280
It would be quote unquote unethical to take these patients off these agents even to allow

1755
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:30,760
them to enter another trial.

1756
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:35,880
Well, that may be the reasoning that some people may have, but that's actually the opposite

1757
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:36,880
of what's happening.

1758
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:43,240
These drugs are ineffective and is unethical to continue to use these ineffective dose that

1759
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:47,400
are having these toxic and adverse effects on people.

1760
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:53,920
If you go back to the original studies that were used by the FDA to approve these drugs

1761
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:59,760
and the reviews that were done subsequently by like the Crochain groups meta-analysis,

1762
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:05,600
they all conclude very clearly that these drugs are ineffective and they do not improve

1763
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:12,240
activities of daily living and that the disease continues and progress and people die.

1764
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:19,120
In fact, in countries where they have more elaborate longitudinal data like in the UK

1765
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:26,000
of administration of these compounds to patients with Alzheimer's, they know that they die

1766
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,840
sooner if they're taking these medications that the ones that refuse to take them.

1767
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,080
And the UK made an attempt.

1768
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:38,880
In fact, they banned these compounds because they had evidence-based that not only they

1769
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,400
weren't effective, but they were counterproductive.

1770
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:48,360
And within a year, the public demanded to the politicians because if they're used in

1771
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:52,480
the US, they must be beneficial.

1772
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:59,000
And so this is a decision that was done politically, motivated to bring them back and make them

1773
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:05,960
available even though we have all the evidence, just like we have against the amyloid hypothesis

1774
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:10,600
that the cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is also irrelevant.

1775
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:15,520
I actually, it's funny, I didn't realize people still subscribe to that hypothesis.

1776
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:20,000
The most commonly prescribed medications are the cholinestarase inhibitors.

1777
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:27,400
And then the FDA did not approve memantine for early Alzheimer's or mild Alzheimer's

1778
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:29,160
or myocardium impairment.

1779
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:35,320
They approved originally only for severe and then later for moderate and severe, which

1780
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:37,040
was very unfortunate.

1781
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:43,560
The memantine is preventing some of the excitotoxicity that is damaging those hippocampal cells.

1782
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:50,000
But essentially what you're doing when you do that, you are rescuing from dying a cell

1783
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,960
that is functionally incompetent.

1784
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:52,960
Yeah.

1785
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:56,560
So indirectly, which is interesting because there was a study that came out about a month

1786
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,560
and a half ago on memantine.

1787
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:00,480
And I remember, you know, this is obviously not my field of expertise.

1788
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:04,620
So my level of knowledge in the literature is so much less than other areas.

1789
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:10,260
But the problem with that could be that you're actually rescuing a cell that's going to

1790
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:14,300
go on to send a signal that could cause more damage down the line.

1791
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:19,900
It is completely counterproductive and is based on the pathology, pathology oriented

1792
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:23,500
that you can see more of these neurons there when the people die.

1793
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:25,020
But it's not a functional assay.

1794
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:30,060
In other words, it's a neuropathological, which there's value in these things, but it

1795
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:35,100
sounds like the real overarching challenge here is triangulating between neurobiology,

1796
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:37,460
anatomy, functional signaling.

1797
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:41,340
And then of course, ultimately clinical outcomes matter more than any of these other things

1798
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:42,340
in the end.

1799
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:43,340
I agree.

1800
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:46,700
And that's what should direct all of this in the first place.

1801
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:47,700
And it's not what's happening.

1802
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:52,020
Now, I know this is a little outside of the work you do, but do you have a point of view

1803
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:56,380
on the recent excitement around Herpesymplex virus 1?

1804
02:05:56,380 --> 02:05:57,780
Have you followed that discussion?

1805
02:05:57,780 --> 02:05:58,780
No.

1806
02:05:58,780 --> 02:06:00,500
I don't have a good point of view.

1807
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:06,860
What I can tell you is we found another way to try to intervene with mitochondrial respiration

1808
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:13,500
using light, in particular, infrared light that can go through the tissues.

1809
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:20,460
And the photons in the near infrared light are absorbed by cytochrome oxidase.

1810
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:26,900
It turns out that cytochrome oxidase, that's the name cytosil, but chrome color, is because

1811
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:32,020
of its exhaust, certain wavelengths, and it reflects other sources, the chemical in

1812
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:34,980
the cell that gives color to the cell.

1813
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:42,580
And this property of photonic absorption we have used in conjunction with the laser delivery

1814
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:49,540
of near infrared light transcranially through the forehead as a source of photons that actually

1815
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:54,660
oxidizes, photo oxidizes, cytochrome oxidase.

1816
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:58,020
And by doing that, the enzyme has more affinity.

1817
02:06:58,020 --> 02:07:04,100
That's the confirmation of the enzyme that has more affinity to oxygen for oxygen consumption.

1818
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:08,500
Yeah, I just pulled out a picture that we'll make sure we link to in the show notes that

1819
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:13,220
comes from one of your papers, actually, where it shows in the same figure a close section

1820
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:18,940
of the mitochondria, and you can see the effect of methylene blue and also the effect of near

1821
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:19,940
infrared light.

1822
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:23,980
Now, it strikes me as interesting that you can get the wavelength just right because

1823
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:27,380
you have to be able to get through not just the tissue, but the skull itself.

1824
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:29,860
Actually, the skull is less of a problem.

1825
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:30,860
It's easier to go through.

1826
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:32,940
Because it's porous because of the bony matrix?

1827
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:36,540
Yeah, because there is less circulation through it.

1828
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:39,780
One of the big promo force that we have is hemoglobin.

1829
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:40,780
I see.

1830
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:44,100
So hemoglobin can absorb and reflect much of this light before it actually reaches the

1831
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:45,100
neurons.

1832
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:50,500
So what we try to do is we move away from this peak of absorption, so oxy and deoxy

1833
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:56,300
hemoglobin, to one that is still can be absorbed by cytochrome oxidase.

1834
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:57,920
To how many nanometers then?

1835
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:05,340
We use 1,064 nanometers wavelength, so around 1,000, which is a wavelength that is not very

1836
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:08,140
well studied in biochemistry.

1837
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:13,660
Most of the spectrophotometers in biochemistry, they do not go all the way to 1,000.

1838
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:15,580
Yeah, they're in the hundreds, usually.

1839
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:16,580
Yes, they usually.

1840
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:18,820
300 to 800 or something to that.

1841
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:19,820
Yes.

1842
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:24,780
The longer the wavelength, the more it penetrates to the tissues.

1843
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:26,340
How do we know how safe that is?

1844
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:30,620
I'm sure somebody listening to this is going to say, wait, that sounds like microwaving

1845
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:31,620
my brain.

1846
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:32,620
Like, ha, ha.

1847
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:33,620
No, no.

1848
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:34,620
Of course, it's a different wavelength.

1849
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:35,620
No, I understand.

1850
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:37,900
But as the sort of lay person, this sounds very scary, right?

1851
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:40,340
Yeah, microwaves moving the other direction.

1852
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:43,260
But the longer the wavelength, the less energy they carry.

1853
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:44,920
So the less they can penetrate.

1854
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:51,400
So they cannot really penetrate inside atoms like the ones that have short wavelengths.

1855
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:56,320
But they are good enough to penetrate to the tissues, not very deep.

1856
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:03,160
And only about 1 to 2%, if we do it transcranially through the head, actually goes through to

1857
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:06,040
the surface of the cerebral cortex.

1858
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:10,240
Once in the cerebral cortex, the white matter is also a barrier.

1859
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:18,200
So the effect of the photons is primarily in the gray matter layer of the cerebral cortex.

1860
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:23,120
And what it does is it you donate in these photons to the electron transport.

1861
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:28,040
So you're bypassing the electron donors.

1862
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:34,240
The photons are not identical to electrons, but they act in a similar way in the electron

1863
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,240
transport.

1864
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:38,440
So the photons and the electrons are very similar.

1865
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:42,840
The difference is that the electron can carry a very small mass.

1866
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:45,320
Photons essentially do not have mass.

1867
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:50,640
And by providing photons to the electron transport, you keep the electron transport going because

1868
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:54,960
these enzymes engage in the redox changes.

1869
02:09:54,960 --> 02:10:01,720
And the more photons you send to cytochrome oxidase, the more of the enzyme quickly goes

1870
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:04,160
to the oxidized conformation.

1871
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:08,400
And that oxidized conformation is the one that has more affinity to bind oxygen.

1872
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:13,280
But I don't understand how is this actually making its way systemically to the brain through

1873
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:15,880
a transcranial stimulation?

1874
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:22,400
When you aim through, for example, the forehead, it goes through the tissue and reaches the

1875
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:26,080
surface of the cerebral cortex.

1876
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,400
And that's how it makes its way.

1877
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:32,680
It's a more localized, it's different from, it's not a systemic administration like metal

1878
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:33,680
in blue.

1879
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:40,200
It's enough to just be able to hit the frontal cortex to create a clinical improvement without

1880
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:46,560
impacting the mitochondrial function deeper in the midbrain or lower part of the cortex.

1881
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:53,440
To create a functional improvement, we don't know yet about clinicals, especially I would

1882
02:10:53,440 --> 02:11:00,200
not say that in somebody with the degree of atrophy that many of the Alzheimer's patients

1883
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:06,400
have, we're going to have enough substrate there to be able to stimulate and reverse

1884
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,880
the disease.

1885
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:12,120
So this will have to be tested with clinical population.

1886
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:17,080
Are there clinical trials that are going to be looking at this near infrared light strategy

1887
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:19,080
combined with methylene blue?

1888
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:20,480
No, not combined.

1889
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:21,960
You don't think of these as synergistic.

1890
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:23,760
You consider these separate approaches?

1891
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,800
Yeah, I consider them separate approaches.

1892
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:29,880
The reason for this is the following.

1893
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:33,480
Methylene blue can affect these photons.

1894
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:35,520
Of course, that makes sense.

1895
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:38,440
And this is actually used nowadays.

1896
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:46,200
For example, dermatologists, if you have a melanoma, a cancer in your skin, or any other

1897
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:53,280
lesion, they can inject methylene blue into that region and then they just shine light.

1898
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,280
And the light.

1899
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:55,840
It concentrates the light.

1900
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:58,560
The methylene blue and the methylene blue oxidizes.

1901
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:02,880
You've had that Ross reaction, the same thing that you see in the bladder.

1902
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:05,400
And it kills those cells there.

1903
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,600
This is called photodynamic therapy.

1904
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:14,280
It has many applications because if you have a virus that you have no other way to kill,

1905
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:16,320
you can always kill it this way.

1906
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,560
So this is happening.

1907
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:24,560
Even people don't know, methylene blue is injected into blood that is used for transfusion

1908
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:28,360
so that you can then treat this blood with these bright lights.

1909
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:34,600
And by photodynamic therapy, kill viruses like the HIV virus or the herpes.

1910
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:38,560
Is there a difference between giving the methylene blue orally versus intravenously?

1911
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:39,560
Yes.

1912
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,040
For this purpose specifically.

1913
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:42,040
Yes.

1914
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:46,220
The intravenous one, the first target will be the blood cells.

1915
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:52,600
So you have to be more careful with the concentration because you don't want to promote the methemoglobinear.

1916
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,680
In other words, to compete with oxygen.

1917
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:56,520
So it seems safer to administer oral?

1918
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,520
Yes.

1919
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:03,560
The oral administration produces slower release and in low concentration is very safe.

1920
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:10,240
And it's like I say, it's being done in thousands and thousands of people for malaria.

1921
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:16,080
And it's studies that are being published in the last few years have primarily given

1922
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:20,000
to children in Africa for killing the parasites.

1923
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,880
And in that case, the oral administration at the advantage that many of these parasites

1924
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,280
are in the gut as well.

1925
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,280
Yeah, in the gut.

1926
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:29,000
So you can have the higher amounts there.

1927
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,800
So going back to this broader perspective, I mean, the clear theme here is, which I think

1928
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:36,040
is that prevention matters.

1929
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:40,880
In fact, we shouldn't be focusing so many resources on the treatment of clinically

1930
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,680
evident apparent dementia for the reasons you've discussed.

1931
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:46,960
So now what we want to do is prevent.

1932
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:51,040
I was going to say prevent in high risk individuals, but as one of my friends who's a neurologist

1933
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:53,120
would say, anybody with a brain is at risk.

1934
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:56,960
So let's stop stratifying as who's high risk versus low risk.

1935
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,720
Everybody should take a preventative measure.

1936
02:13:58,720 --> 02:13:59,760
Yes, definitely.

1937
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:04,920
In addition to this idea of all the things that matter in the heart, so lower smoking,

1938
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:09,520
lower blood pressure, better glycemic control, better management of lipoproteins, et cetera,

1939
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:14,280
et cetera, is there anything that you see is unique in the brain specifically that is

1940
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:19,560
maybe not unique or maybe not as important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease?

1941
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:26,040
The only one that I would say will have to do with the ketogenic diet.

1942
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:31,680
Ketogenic diet will facilitate mitochondrial respiration in a different way, but this will

1943
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:40,240
contribute to targeting mitochondrial respiration so that the brain will benefit more than the

1944
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:41,240
heart.

1945
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:42,240
The heart will benefit.

1946
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:47,840
Of course, all of these tissues will benefit, but because of the brain reliance on aerobic

1947
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:49,160
metabolism.

1948
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:53,440
For example, you alluded, for example, an insulin resistance.

1949
02:14:53,440 --> 02:15:00,320
One of the problems that happens as the brain ages, even in normal people, is that the transport

1950
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:02,560
of glucose is affected.

1951
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:09,080
So even though we can increase glucose levels in the blood or what we're eating, we cannot

1952
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:14,880
get that glucose being transported to the brain as effectively as in the younger individuals.

1953
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:20,080
That's why some of these studies with intranasal insulin administration show transient improvement

1954
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:25,040
in symptoms, presumably because they're becoming resistant to glucose.

1955
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:29,800
Now that's obviously not a long-term solution, but it illustrates a point.

1956
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:36,560
And unfortunately, insulin primarily facilitates glucose transports in other tissues other than

1957
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:37,560
the brain.

1958
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:40,120
The brain actually doesn't require insulin.

1959
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:45,160
It can boost its transport of glucose, but the reason for that is that when you wake

1960
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:52,080
up in the morning that you have been fasting overnight, whatever levels of glucose are

1961
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:57,120
circulating in your blood, then the brain tissue will be the only one that will be able

1962
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:58,800
to take that up.

1963
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:03,800
And it's only when you have large glucose levels that then insulin is released by the

1964
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:08,880
pancreas and then all the tissues then can use it, can feast on it.

1965
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:16,920
So the ketogenic diet, so ketone bodies can act as an alternative source for energy in

1966
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:18,280
the brain.

1967
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:26,480
And the important point is that even though glucose is a preferred substrate during aging,

1968
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:29,040
this is compromised, this uptake.

1969
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:33,880
However, the uptake of ketone bodies is not compromised.

1970
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:40,800
Therefore, you could satisfy some of these nutritional requirements by adding the ketone

1971
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:42,560
bodies to the diet.

1972
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:47,880
Do you think it matters if a person is on a ketogenic diet or if they're on a non-ketogenic

1973
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:51,520
diet, but they supplement with exogenous ketones?

1974
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:53,480
I hope it doesn't matter.

1975
02:16:53,480 --> 02:17:00,440
As long as you have the ketone bodies available, you don't require to have the ketogenic diet

1976
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:01,440
itself.

1977
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:06,080
But this eventually will have to be resolved empirically.

1978
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:09,960
And there is no question that this is going to promote mitochondrial respiration.

1979
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:16,040
And we know, as you know, when we were born as infants, we rely primarily for neural function

1980
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:21,360
and everything else on these ketone bodies produced by the liver.

1981
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:26,120
Not because of the kind of lipids that we get through the mother's milk.

1982
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:33,480
So essentially, what we're trying to do is bring in somebody who is in all age to rely

1983
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:36,160
more on ketosis.

1984
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:41,120
That is a process that we know exists under physiological conditions every day.

1985
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:47,060
If we go beyond 12, 14 hours without eating, we start generating this.

1986
02:17:47,060 --> 02:17:51,620
But it's something that we know in infancy is the primary source for the brain.

1987
02:17:51,620 --> 02:17:52,700
I didn't realize that.

1988
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:58,580
Is that more a result of their livers not being able to release enough glycogen via

1989
02:17:58,580 --> 02:17:59,580
an empataglucose output?

1990
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:03,500
I mean, I know they have a very high demand for energy.

1991
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:05,620
Can you measure the ketone in their blood?

1992
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:08,940
Yes, but it is because of the source of food that they're taking.

1993
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:09,940
I see.

1994
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:12,780
So they're basically getting medium chain triglycerides through the milk.

1995
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:13,780
Yes.

1996
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:18,980
Medium chain triglycerides being the main source there for energy conversion as opposed

1997
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:20,660
to some of the other triglycerides.

1998
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:26,540
So the original bulletproof coffee is actually mother's breast milk before it is the fancy

1999
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:28,420
coffees that everybody drinks.

2000
02:18:28,420 --> 02:18:29,420
Yes.

2001
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:32,140
So I do believe that that's another alternative.

2002
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:38,220
So in essence, you could potentially have pharmacological interventions that address

2003
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:43,820
mitochondrial respiration, but they will not have to be classic pharmacology like neurotransmitter

2004
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:44,820
based pharmacology.

2005
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:48,060
There will be more of a metabolic pharmacology.

2006
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:53,420
You can have near infrared light by providing this photonic stimulation.

2007
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:57,620
However, that one is targeted is not systemic like you pointed out.

2008
02:18:57,620 --> 02:18:59,820
So one will have to find the target.

2009
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:02,380
Luckily, the forehead is more accessible.

2010
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:08,140
We don't have hairs and we can target that prefrontal cortex that shows the initial

2011
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:12,540
cognitive difficulties as people become older.

2012
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:14,300
And that's what we have been doing.

2013
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:19,100
And then the third one will be through the diet, which you facilitate because as you

2014
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:24,020
pointed out, the insulin resistance is because our glucose levels are going up because we

2015
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:29,740
cannot transport it into the tissue, especially nervous tissue, which was a primary consumer

2016
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:31,300
has effectively.

2017
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:35,300
And then we have these high levels of glucose for longer times.

2018
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:41,400
So there's more insulin that is being released and then this desensitizes the resectors.

2019
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:49,900
So there is a natural development of metabolic syndrome as we grow old because of this phenomenon.

2020
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:55,620
These manifest itself then has less substrate or energy for the brain.

2021
02:19:55,620 --> 02:20:02,540
And then you have a cognitive decline accelerated associated with obesity and hypertension and

2022
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,660
this insulin resistance.

2023
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:08,420
So it's all part of the same age related picture.

2024
02:20:08,420 --> 02:20:13,820
And probably people eat more because they are trying to make up for this lack of energy

2025
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:16,180
that the brain is consuming.

2026
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:23,060
And if any organ is more liable to influence our eating behavior, it will be the neural

2027
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:24,060
tissue.

2028
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:28,700
That's such an interesting thought because I've always believed as you've suggested that

2029
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:34,320
I think our appetite is driven by fundamentally important physiologic processes and starvation

2030
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:36,560
would be the most important among them.

2031
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:41,000
And starvation in the modern world doesn't look like starvation in the prehistoric world.

2032
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,360
Starvation in the modern world can be in the presence of obesity because we're not talking

2033
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:47,200
about the obvious.

2034
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,000
We're talking about the cellular level.

2035
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:53,800
And so if cellular metabolism is deficient, which is often the case in insulin resistance,

2036
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:57,840
an individual can be functionally starving and that can drive it.

2037
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:01,120
Now I've always thought about it through the lens of the liver, but you're making an argument

2038
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:06,320
that says there's also a central starvation that could be also driving these repetitive

2039
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:07,320
changes.

2040
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:08,320
Yes.

2041
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:13,080
But there are also peripheral components, like you say, for example, the case of the obese.

2042
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:24,040
An individual that has obesity will, by almost definition, will have down regulated the ketogenesis.

2043
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:32,960
The ketogenesis enzymes will not be upregulated unless you're consuming your own fat.

2044
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:36,640
And these are trainable enzymes, like endusable as well.

2045
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:44,000
So if you don't go through periods of fasting, you cannot elevate these enzymes.

2046
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:52,560
So somebody who is obese and suddenly stops eating is starved because his body cannot.

2047
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:59,400
In the presence of hyperinsulinemia, it is a very painful transition into fasting.

2048
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:04,560
You cannot use your body fat to feed, especially the brain, which is the first one that is

2049
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:06,920
going to give you these signs and symptoms.

2050
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:12,840
So the first thing that somebody has to do is start out by having a periodic period of

2051
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:17,200
fasting that in my own case, I do it once a week.

2052
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:23,160
Usually between Friday and Saturday, I fast for at least 14 or 16 hours.

2053
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:28,520
It's not difficult to do if you have an early meal and then a late brunch, you will have

2054
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:34,320
significant fasting and you can accelerate that process by consuming some of the circulating

2055
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:37,520
glucose if you do a workout that morning.

2056
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:45,200
So by doing that, I am allowing my body to build up these ketogenic enzymes.

2057
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:50,640
And therefore, then during a regular day in the week, if I don't eat anything between

2058
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:56,760
meals, I don't feel hungry because I can consume my own body fat.

2059
02:22:56,760 --> 02:23:00,160
And people who are obese cannot do that.

2060
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:04,000
They don't have the biochemical machinery to do it.

2061
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,880
So I believe that's probably the third way of approaching this problem.

2062
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:13,480
If those three things could be used and like I say, it may not be possible to combine some

2063
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:14,760
of them.

2064
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:19,240
I will have to empirically determine how much metal and blue one can have systemically so

2065
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:26,760
that to not produce a photodynamic effect when I do transcranial laser stimulation.

2066
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:31,120
We hope in the future we may be able to do this with LEDs.

2067
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,580
Right now with the LEDs are commercially available.

2068
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:40,720
We haven't been able to find the results that we get, but we are investing time in trying

2069
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:42,280
to change this.

2070
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:46,000
So it will be safer and cheaper to do.

2071
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,720
So right now, the only ones.

2072
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:56,060
So my bioengineering colleagues has been able to collaborate with me and develop a device

2073
02:23:56,060 --> 02:24:03,600
that we can transcranially do imaging with near infrared spectroscopy and actually measure

2074
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:08,880
the concentrations of oxidized cytochrome oxidase in vivo in the human brain.

2075
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:11,400
We published that last year.

2076
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:18,680
And this allows us to directly have a measurement that we are indeed engaging our target.

2077
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:24,200
And this also will allow us to find what is the optimal dose response for that particular

2078
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:25,640
brain.

2079
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:29,840
Because like you indicated, different people have different heads and the transmission

2080
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:31,920
would not be equivalent.

2081
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:33,720
So this is what we're doing.

2082
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:39,440
So we have obtained three major grants for doing this with the bioengineering group in

2083
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:41,040
the Dallas area.

2084
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,960
For example, Professor Henley Liu.

2085
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:49,680
We are doing the development of these devices to monitor the physiological changes.

2086
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:56,000
And this is a grant by NEIH that is called the Brain Initiative Program.

2087
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:01,840
And then here with my colleague, Andrea Ann Halley, we have a grant from the National

2088
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:09,240
Institute of Aging to test this transcranial near infrared light in older people and people

2089
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:12,120
with mild cognitive impairment.

2090
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:19,680
And then the third has been a benefactor who's giving us large amounts of money so that we

2091
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:24,200
can pursue this line of work with the transcranial lasers.

2092
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:28,720
And I can show you the endorsement from some of the people in the field.

2093
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:31,960
Oh, yeah, I'll take a picture of this and we'll put this on.

2094
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:37,240
In fact, it was actually Jack who directed me to speak with you maybe six months ago.

2095
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,240
This is exciting.

2096
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:41,000
You know, I want to add one other thought to this, which is I hope that if somebody's

2097
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,800
listening to this who's involved in traumatic brain injury that someone ought to look into

2098
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:51,640
a clinical trial of using methylene blue as a rescue agent during periods of traumatic

2099
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:57,120
injury, because again, mechanistically, it's at least plausible that you could salvage

2100
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:02,680
and rescue some of the transient insult and the damage that goes through that.

2101
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:08,080
And again, there's another example of a disease for which we don't seem to have any solution

2102
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:12,040
other than the obvious, which is avoidance of the injury, the insult.

2103
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:16,360
But there's still a lot of people out there that are being exposed to repetitive head

2104
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:17,360
trauma.

2105
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:22,360
And, you know, as you probably know, there's been some interesting hypotheses around the

2106
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:27,600
presence of ketones in the system before traumatic injury and potentially a salvage

2107
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:28,600
after.

2108
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:32,360
But it seems to me that this methylene blue story probably deserves a bit more attention

2109
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:35,040
in other areas, given these properties you've described.

2110
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:37,160
I actually agree with you.

2111
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:43,360
And I would say because it's used in emergency rooms, I believe in every ambulance, you should

2112
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:45,640
have methylene blue available.

2113
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:52,640
And if there is any insult that compromises metabolic supply to the brain, you're going

2114
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:57,040
to be better off infusing methylene blue at a low concentration.

2115
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:04,200
We're talking about one milligram per kilogram concentration that is going to be neuroprotective,

2116
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:06,400
regardless of the source of the...

2117
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,840
It could be transiting its chemical track.

2118
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:10,240
It could be any stroke.

2119
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:13,720
We have done this in stroke models in animals using the methylene blue.

2120
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:20,120
And we're being able to rescue the majority of the damage produced in the in part in

2121
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:26,000
animal models, and animal models where we look at these longitudinally using fMRI.

2122
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,640
So we know these works in animals.

2123
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:34,560
I've just been unable to convince emergency physicians to start doing this to their ischemic

2124
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:35,800
patients.

2125
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:42,120
And not only for the brain, but ischemia affecting all the other organs, is being also trying

2126
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:46,320
to protect the animal models of neurotrauma with similar benefits.

2127
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:52,160
So the problem is there's no interest by the pharmaceutical company because they cannot

2128
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,040
make money on it.

2129
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:59,760
And unfortunately, the NEIH is also influenced by...

2130
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:04,160
If you're using an old drug, essentially you're repositioning this old drug for these other

2131
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:10,000
applications as a neuroprotective agent or more generally metabolic protective agent.

2132
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:17,240
They are concerned that their investment is not going to pan out because when it goes

2133
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:21,520
to commercialization, you're not going to be able to patent that medication.

2134
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:27,240
And believe it or not, even though if it works, if there is no prospect that profits can be

2135
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:29,280
made, they don't want to invest.

2136
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:33,200
Yeah, it's a shame because I worry that we'll be in this state of limbo where we're not

2137
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:38,000
really going to know the answer and we can't know the answer without clinical trials.

2138
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:43,120
This is about as easy an agent as there is to study given its long history, its relatively

2139
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:47,720
well understood toxicity profile, and in many cases, the speed with which you could see

2140
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:51,120
a response, especially if you're studying ischemic events.

2141
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:57,280
And I will tell you that just a couple of years ago, it was published last year, the

2142
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:03,080
group that I collaborated with in San Antonio, we were the first to show the effects of methyl

2143
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:11,680
and blue in the human brain using fMRI and measuring blood flow and measuring ball signals.

2144
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:16,960
And also in those subjects, we did memory testing and we were able to demonstrate a

2145
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:23,600
significant improvement in their memory retrieval just after an acute treatment with methyl

2146
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:27,360
and blue in a blind placebo control study.

2147
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:32,740
The first time that that was done, contrary to these other groups that are doing it as

2148
02:29:32,740 --> 02:29:41,500
an anti-towel agent in healthy and older people, we can improve memory and we can demonstrate

2149
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:45,060
using imaging that we can do this through methyl and blue.

2150
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:50,940
So the only problem is that there's not going to be any profit because I believe if some

2151
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:55,980
company would like to develop this purity, pharmaceutical grade, methyl and blue, there

2152
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:58,020
will be a huge market.

2153
02:29:58,020 --> 02:30:02,340
Other companies may imitate them, but there's enough for everybody.

2154
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:11,300
Still, the cosmetic aspect of having urine that is a problem many people would not accept.

2155
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,300
Yeah.

2156
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:14,660
Well, Francisco, this has been great.

2157
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:18,660
You've been very generous with your time and I really appreciate this discussion.

2158
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:22,220
I've learned a lot and I'm guessing that people listening to this will have also learned a

2159
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:23,380
lot.

2160
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:28,140
So we will have a great set of show notes to accompany this where all of the papers

2161
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:32,020
that we've talked about, a link to Jack's book and a number of other things will be

2162
02:30:32,020 --> 02:30:36,140
included so that hopefully it's a reference for anyone else you want to share this with

2163
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:37,620
and certainly anyone listening.

2164
02:30:37,620 --> 02:30:39,020
So thank you very much.

2165
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:42,020
