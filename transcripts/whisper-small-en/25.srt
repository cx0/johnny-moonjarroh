00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
along with a few other obsessions along the way.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,520
I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
individuals in the world.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,560
And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
live a higher quality, more fulfilling life.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,400

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the drive.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,480
My guest this week is a gentleman by the name of Scott Harrison, who I suspect many of you

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,440
have not heard of, which is not uncommon for this podcast, but my hope is certainly that

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,880
by the end of this episode, you'll be glad you heard of him and heard him.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,360
Scott's the founder and CEO of Charity Water, which we'll talk about in great detail.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,040
Charity Water is a pretty unique charity, not just in that the work they're doing is

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,800
remarkable, but I think the efficiency with which they do it and the transparency with

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,000
which they do it and the sort of financial model that they've built is really interesting.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,520
But truthfully, the real reason I had Scott on was not so much to talk about Charity Water.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,880
And we do get to it probably at the end of the podcast, but it's more to actually talk

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,040
about his personal story.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,420
And even though Scott, as you'll learn in this podcast, is religious, and I don't find

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,000
myself to be a religious person in any way, shape or form, I'm really moved by not just

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,240
his conviction, but this sort of incredible sense of purpose he's found in life.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,480
And it's really his life's story and transformation that really moved me the very first time we

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,400
met, which was about four or five years ago.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,160
And to this day, whenever I speak with Scott, I come away feeling on some level like kind

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,400
of a lousy person who's not good enough, which is probably okay, but more importantly,

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
just inspired.

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,060
And I'm convinced that you will come away also feeling inspired by Scott, who never once

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,120
is the kind of person that leaves you feeling like, why aren't you doing more?

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,200
But Scott has really dedicated his life to helping people in a way that I think many

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,620
of us can only dream of.

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,680
I would go so far as to say, honestly, that Scott is one of two people that I consider

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,720
the most remarkable people in the nonprofit space.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,760
The other one being a woman by the name of Catherine Hoke, who some of you may have

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,240
heard of, she's been on Tim Ferriss' podcast and I'm sure to have her on here at some point

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
as well.

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,240
But between Cat Hoke and Scott Harrison, I find them to be two of the most inspiring

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,480
people who have really chosen to dedicate their lives to the public sector in this way.

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,080
Part of the stuff we talk about in this episode has been covered in his book.

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,320
So Scott is now a New York Times bestselling author.

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,160
That book is called Thirst.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,800
I don't know that he'd want me to publicly disclose what the advance was, but it was

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,380
a very sizable advance and he gave every single penny of that to his charity and all of that

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,400
goes directly to the work that they're doing.

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,320
He's an amazing speaker and he's just kind of a magnetic personality.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,120
So I would invite you to take a chance and listen to this, even if it sounds like at

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,720
the surface, this isn't what I'm really interested in.

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
But I think you will definitely get something out of this and you'll definitely get a sense

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,520
as I did of how we can get a glimpse of happiness and how Scott on one level, in the first chapter

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,200
of his adult life, seemed to be living what many of us might think, oh, that sounds pretty

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,680
cool and interesting.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
And I can see how that would make you happy, but how he ultimately found something totally

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
different and now I think Scott's probably one of the happiest people I know.

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,840
So without any further delay, welcome to this episode with Scott Harrison.

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Hey Scott.

58
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
Hey Scott, good to have you here man.

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Nice to be here.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Thanks for slumming on the Upper East Side with me.

61
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Took the train off.

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
It was pretty quick.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,480
It's actually a nice day.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
It's beautiful.

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,320
It falls my favorite time.

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Where do you live?

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
You live in?

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Tribeca.

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Actually Battery Park City.

70
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,200
So we had kids and moved across the highway.

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Got it.

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,600
So we met in kind of one of the funniest ways imaginable.

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,480
And that's been what, three or four years ago?

74
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Yeah.

75
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
You gonna tell them?

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,040
Well no, no, it's just, I mean, you can tell, I'll tell the story from my end and you can

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,500
tell the story from your end, but we'll not name the name of the person who we met through,

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,240
but we met through one of my patients and we were all at this meeting called Dialogue,

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,720
which I've enjoyed and I've gone to probably four of them.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I didn't go this year.

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,120
This is my first year not going in a while.

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,200
And it was a weird day, but I had arranged for my family to come to meet at the airport

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,160
and then we were gonna fly together on his plane to New York.

84
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,400
And as we were leaving the hotel, he said, hey, I met this really cool guy.

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
He's gonna hop on the flight with us.

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Do you mind?

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,720
To which I said, how can you ask me if I mind?

88
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It's your plane.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,160
Of course I don't mind.

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,800
But yeah, awesome.

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,400
And so we basically, you and I met in the, for the first time in the car ride on the

92
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,160
way to the airport because dialogue is big enough that it's easy to not meet somebody

93
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
there.

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,480
So we didn't actually sit in any sessions together.

95
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,120
So that was how we met.

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,360
It wasn't at your birthday?

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
It was.

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
It was just by coincidence that happened to be my birthday.

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,120
And the funniest part is we got somehow got talking about watches and pretty early in

100
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,840
the conversation you mentioned, look, I'm on a budget, man.

101
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
I run a nonprofit.

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,880
I can't, I can't be rolling with the high level watches.

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,560
And I think you said sort of what is your best, what's your favorite watch, you know,

104
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
on a certain price point.

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,520
And I said, oh, this is a no brainer, man.

106
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
It's a Seiko.

107
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
It's a Seiko cocktail.

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Yep.

109
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
And I remember on my phone, I pulled up a picture and I showed it to you and you like,

110
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
oh, that's gorgeous.

111
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,040
And then, and then we, you know, we spent seven minutes talking about that and 23 minutes

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,520
talking about your story, which was really captivating.

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,800
But then if I remember correctly, your wife had then surprised you at the end of a flight

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,560
with that specific watch.

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
That's right.

116
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
This is the only time my wife has bought me a watch because she generally doesn't like

117
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,520
to support my watch habit, but she also knew how much I loved the Seiko cocktail.

118
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,220
So when we're on the plane, she whips out the watch, which I couldn't believe it.

119
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,240
Not only that she had done this, even ordinarily, I would have been very surprised, but how

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,920
could this have happened a few hours after we had just talked about it?

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,480
And then you gave the watch to me, which was, which was a wonderful surprise and nice.

122
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,280
And then I think that surprised your wife even more.

123
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,720
Well, I asked her, I said, you know, hey, I know this is going to sound strange, but,

124
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
and I love the watch.

125
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,840
So please don't assume that like I'm asking you this because I don't love the watch.

126
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,960
But I think giving this watch to Scott would be like it's almost, it's meant to be, it's

127
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
sort of, he's meant to have this watch because it's what we talked about.

128
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,160
And I told her the whole story and she was like, yeah, you're right.

129
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,800
You gotta, you gotta give him the watch.

130
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,280
Which I'm, I'm very grateful for.

131
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,640
I actually heard someone in California who's a family friend say once that on his birthday,

132
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,960
he would give gifts to everyone else.

133
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,720
He would give gifts to his children and then later his grandchildren.

134
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,460
So he would look at his birthday as the time that he could lavish extravagant gifts on

135
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,000
all the loved ones around him, which I always thought was so nice.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,280
Well, and you have kids.

137
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,640
So I think you understand what all of us understand who have kids.

138
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,600
And I'm sure there are people who have come to appreciate this even before they have kids,

139
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,360
which I guess in some way I did as well.

140
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,560
But it is really much more enjoyable to give than to receive.

141
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,320
And it was probably two years before I went out and finally bought myself a cocktail.

142
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,200
And it was funny, I kind of forgot that I'd given it to you.

143
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,720
And then about a year ago, I remember somebody on Twitter said, Peter, please tell me best

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,340
watch to get under 500.

145
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,440
And I said, say, go cocktail, here you go.

146
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,560
And you just chimed in on Twitter and made a comment that nobody else would have known

147
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,920
what the context was.

148
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,120
But I was like, Oh my God, I totally forgot about that.

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
That's fun.

150
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,640
And birthdays have been significant for me and for the organization.

151
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,060
So that was just a fun, really fun thing.

152
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
So thanks for that.

153
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,100
Well, more importantly, let's talk about the real stuff that we talked about because we

154
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,620
had, you know, obviously that car ride.

155
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,340
And then we had like a five hour flight to New York when we got to really kind of talk

156
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,460
about your story, which I was just blown away by.

157
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,020
And at the time, my day job was running a nonprofit.

158
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,620
And unfortunately for me, that was probably the single, it's been the worst professional

159
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
experience of my life.

160
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
I really hated running a nonprofit.

161
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,060
I probably vented to you somewhat about how much I hated fundraising, which sort of became

162
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,140
the only thing I was doing.

163
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:37,140
But I was really blown away by not just your work, but the efficiency with which you did

164
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
it.

165
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,300
And once you're in the nonprofit space, you start to understand what metrics matter.

166
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,960
And look, I mean, a lot of nonprofits are doing great work, but some of them are doing

167
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,260
it with staggering efficiency.

168
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,820
And you know, I'm going to want to hear all about that.

169
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,160
But actually the part that really gripped me was your background.

170
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,520
So let's, if you don't mind, can we start at the beginning?

171
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Sure.

172
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Where'd you grow up?

173
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,000
I was born in Philadelphia and my dad was, he had been working for Arthur Anderson.

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,960
He was kind of on the big accounting career trajectory would hope to make partner one

175
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,400
day, had me and then started traveling.

176
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,520
He was traveling all the time and said, look, I'm actually going to jump off that track

177
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,200
and I'm going to take a smaller job.

178
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,080
But why not to be a transformer company, you know, selling power supply to the Navy

179
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,400
and to municipalities.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,480
So we moved to get closer to his new job, which would have him not on the road and allowed

181
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,640
to just be a dad.

182
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,880
They wanted a bigger family, he and my mom.

183
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
And she was a writer.

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,160
So she was working for the Philadelphia Inquirer and the local newspaper.

185
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,400
And at four, we pick up from outside of a suburb outside Philly, moved to South Jersey

186
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
into this.

187
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,240
I remember it was a very gray drab four bedroom house, not their dream house by any stretch

188
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,640
of the imagination, but it was 22 minutes from his job, which he just had a 22 minute

189
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
commute.

190
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,920
I remember he just kept saying that.

191
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
And it was a good school.

192
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,000
It was on a cul-de-sac, so I could walk to school, elementary school.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,200
And what we didn't know was that the gas company had installed a faulty heat exchanger in this

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,160
house and there was a carbon oxide gas leak.

195
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,640
So we move in in the dead of winter and it's an energy efficient house.

196
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,160
So the whole thing is just locked up tight.

197
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,600
And we all start breathing in these invisible fumes.

198
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,400
I get a little sick, headaches and just some kind of allergy spring up.

199
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,120
My dad gets a little sick, but we were only doing nights in the house and we were doing

200
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
it upstairs.

201
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,400
My mom, unfortunately, was doing all 24 hours in the house, unpacking boxes, fixing up the

202
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,920
house, fixing up the basement, actually.

203
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,520
On New Year's Day in 1980, she walks across the bedroom and she collapses unconscious.

204
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,760
And after a series of blood tests, they finally identify massive amounts of carboxyhemoglobin.

205
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
But this took a while.

206
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,560
It took a period of a couple months.

207
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Yeah.

208
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Yeah.

209
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,840
This was a real, I mean, in your book, which we're going to get to because obviously the

210
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,840
listeners, I think, would really enjoy your book.

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,800
This was something I didn't even know from meeting you.

212
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,840
This is something I knew only from reading the book.

213
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,280
But that was a really, really complicated diagnosis.

214
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,040
I mean, that was not obvious to the doctors what was going on with your mom.

215
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,360
And I almost, it's not even clear you're representing in as much detail just how sick

216
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
she became.

217
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah.

218
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,400
And what happened again from my non-medical perspective was my mom's immune system died.

219
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,760
So it was irreparably destroyed.

220
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,040
And she went from flying around the world with my dad.

221
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,560
Before they had me, they were flying to Paris and to Rome and vacationing in the Bahamas

222
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
and Bermuda.

223
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,400
They were completely healthy.

224
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,400
She was a tennis player, just this vibrant, amazing wife, and then later amazing mom.

225
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,360
From this moment, effectively anything chemical begins to make her sick, very sick.

226
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,320
Perfume, soap, car fumes.

227
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,400
The ink from books would make her sick.

228
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,680
The print, the smell from a new book.

229
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,680
And she goes from clinic to clinic and they wind up isolating her.

230
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,120
And they find that by isolating her from all toxins, she can be okay.

231
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,840
So the healthiest they can ever get her is drinking spring water, eating one organic

232
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,160
food on a rotation diet every six days.

233
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,960
So breakfast would be cashews, lunch would be lettuce, dinner would be a piece of cod

234
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,840
because she had a slew of food allergies that came along with this.

235
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,120
And bringing her back from the clinics with this diagnosis of multiple chemical sensitivity

236
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,640
or they called it environmental illness at the time.

237
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,400
And at one point, if I recall, she did a five day fast.

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,200
They put her on water only to try to sort of detox her.

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,560
And then try foods one by one and she reacted negatively to almost every food.

240
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,240
So I think she had maybe it was 20 foods at the end after testing over a hundred.

241
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,960
So what I remember as a kid was there was a miscarriage that happened around this time

242
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,480
and then family planning stopped.

243
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,680
So I was an only child growing up and I go very quickly into a caregiver role to help

244
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,080
dad take care of mom.

245
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,640
This started when you were four or five.

246
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Four.

247
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
It happened very quickly.

248
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,360
We then prepared a special room for her that would be her safe room in the house.

249
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,240
And I remember it was a tile bathroom, a little bathtub.

250
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,320
And we put an army caught in there for her to sleep in.

251
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,280
And then we washed, we used to wash everything in baking soda.

252
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,560
Baking soda was just, it was everywhere in the house.

253
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,960
So we would wash our clothes 10 times in baking soda just to get any odor out.

254
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,960
We washed this army caught that was made out of cotton, you know, at least 10 times to

255
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,120
get all the smell out.

256
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,920
And then I remember my dad covered the door with aluminum foil because there might be

257
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,480
the slight smell from the varnish stain used years ago.

258
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,400
So this then became her room and she always wore these charcoal masks, which would also

259
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,160
help just filter out.

260
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,840
There were years where oxygen played a part and she'd be walking around with oxygen tanks.

261
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,280
Tell me how high her levels were.

262
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,520
So the diagnosis of carbon monoxide needs to be made through blood and you measure a

263
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,760
byproduct of it.

264
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,280
And once you cross, so most of us walking around should be at zero.

265
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Yeah.

266
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
What was her level?

267
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
I actually wrote about it in the book.

268
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
I don't remember.

269
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,760
I remember it was way, it was shocking.

270
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:37,160
I feel like it was 20 or 25 times than the upper limit of what we would consider toxic.

271
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Yes.

272
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,120
And way more than a smoker, you know, it was, it was in the upper room.

273
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,600
We never tested dad and I, it was interesting because we were also exposed and I remember

274
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
bouncing back.

275
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,280
So the food hour just kind of went away.

276
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
The headaches went away.

277
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,480
Oh, so you had food allergies as well.

278
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I did too.

279
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,560
And I would, I would have headaches.

280
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,280
I would have nausea.

281
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,400
My dad eventually ripped out the heater.

282
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,200
So he found the leak and then, you know, threw the thing on the driveway.

283
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,860
It was a really sad story because my dad had actually suspected that maybe something was

284
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,360
wrong with the stove or the heater.

285
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,960
So he called the gas company out a couple of times.

286
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,680
They checked everything, checked the hose and said, no, everything's fine.

287
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,760
So it was a plumber friend of his that said, Hey, let's go down to the basement.

288
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,720
And they ripped out the thing and they found it themselves.

289
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,960
And this, you know, this really destroyed our, our lives.

290
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,440
And the gas company wasn't terribly accommodating.

291
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
If I recall.

292
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
No.

293
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,240
And, and I guess most people would have expected my parents to sue for negligence.

294
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,680
I think a couple of things happened.

295
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,640
One they had just become Christians.

296
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,720
They'd become people of faith right around this time.

297
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
I think I was two.

298
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,120
And they had a doctor friend, you know, from their church that said, Hey, I don't think

299
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
you should sue.

300
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,440
I don't think this would be good for your family to be in a long protracted, angry, bitter

301
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
battle.

302
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
You've got healthcare.

303
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
And it was an accident.

304
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,960
It actually was an accident.

305
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,280
It wasn't like the gas company was trying to kill my family.

306
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
This was an accident.

307
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,360
This was a faulty piece of metal that was installed.

308
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,400
So I think my parents took a settlement check for 1250 or $1,500 from the gas company and

309
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
said, you know, okay.

310
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,880
And I can relate to that.

311
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,240
I had a really bad back injury in medical school, which I've talked about in the past,

312
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,440
but a lot of things went wrong with my care, including a surgeon that operated on the wrong

313
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,680
side.

314
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,240
And I lived a different life for about a year, including three months where I couldn't even

315
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,840
feed myself.

316
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,160
And when it was all like, so now obviously I'm fine, right?

317
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,740
And I was fine within a relatively short period of time.

318
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,320
Within a year I was completely functional.

319
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,400
And within I would say three years, I was as good as before.

320
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,480
And whenever I tell the story, people are always like, Oh, you must have sued for a

321
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
lot of money.

322
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
And it's funny.

323
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
It never crossed my mind.

324
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,040
And I always kind of joke about it and say, well, I think it's because I grew up in Canada

325
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,480
and we're simply not litigious people in Canada.

326
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,020
I don't know.

327
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,920
But I also realized that in the moment, the only thing you want to do is get better.

328
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
And a lawsuit generally doesn't accelerate that.

329
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,800
Now I'm not for a moment saying there shouldn't be litigious action and lawsuits certainly

330
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,920
have their place.

331
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,320
But I think most people don't come to the conclusion that I think your family friend

332
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,360
came to, which is my brother's a lawyer.

333
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,040
So I see what lawsuits look like.

334
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,040
I understand from friends and family what that process is.

335
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,000
It generally results in more pain before there is a remedy.

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Certainly stress.

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes.

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,440
And I mean, we talk about it and it sounds touchy feely, but stress really matters.

339
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,160
And especially in the case of what your mom was going through, I suspect stress would

340
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,200
have been a far greater impediment to her recovery.

341
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
The other thing about your story, about your mom's story that blows my mind just as a doc

342
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,240
is people like your mom often fall through the cracks in medicine because they're viewed

343
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
as crazy.

344
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,520
So we have a bad habit in medicine of dismissing patients when we don't know what's wrong and

345
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,120
they don't fit into an obvious bucket.

346
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,720
So you say, well, look, she was totally healthy and now she's a wreck.

347
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,120
It's got to be in her mind.

348
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,760
She's got to be having a nervous breakdown.

349
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,080
There's got to be something going on.

350
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,280
And I see this a lot and I get approached a lot by people who are in that situation.

351
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,080
And it breaks my heart because I don't know how to fix it.

352
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,480
I mean, that's just, I don't, there's a real narrow lane that I play in, but deep down,

353
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,040
I know like I just have a hard time believing that there's that many people who are sort

354
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,800
of crazy.

355
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,800
And that in reality, I remember something one of my med school professors said, which

356
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,920
is we use this term in medicine, idiopathic.

357
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,280
Idiopathic means we don't know what the cause is.

358
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,640
So you have idiopathic fill in the blank idiopathic pain.

359
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
And he says, you know what it really means is probably idiotic, like, but referring to

360
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,040
the doctor, not the patient.

361
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,600
So I guess you were not old enough to recall, but in discussions with your mom since, I

362
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,400
mean, did you get a sense of how difficult it was for your mom and dad during the period

363
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,000
of time when the diagnosis was unclear and it was this huge mystery of what the heck

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
happened?

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,880
Well, I remember when I read about this in the book, people thought, damn, I'm going

366
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,840
to tell you, my dad was crazy at work.

367
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,120
So or the mom was crazy.

368
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,920
So they would say, oh, this is just in her head.

369
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,600
And you know, I remember the term psychosomatic thrown around so so much as a kid.

370
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,760
And I was never a suspect of that until I became a teenager.

371
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,760
And then I joined that camp briefly, just thinking, it's just not possible.

372
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,480
I mean, some of these things that she said made her sick just just seemed to defy logic

373
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
to me to a 13 or 14 year old boy.

374
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
You know, there's this I remember there's this scene that I write about where there

375
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,480
was a period of time where electromagnetic radiation was making her sick TVs and radio

376
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
waves.

377
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,640
And I thought she's just trying to rain on my parade and make sure I don't watch TV or

378
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,800
listen to the radio so that I'm reading all the time up in my room.

379
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,120
I got to try this with my kids.

380
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,600
Anytime they spend more than 30 minutes on the iPad, I start getting sick.

381
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I got to get sick.

382
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Start twitching.

383
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,880
So this this one night, you know, I'm very, very clever.

384
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,640
And the little teenage boy, you know, climbs up the stairs and I've got a radio in my hand

385
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,560
and all the lights are out and I'm padding very softly.

386
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,780
And there's an outlet right outside the door.

387
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,140
So her doors closed the tinfoil door.

388
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,280
And I turn the radio, I plug it in, but the volumes all the way down.

389
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,000
And I turn the speakers so that they're aiming right at the cot where she's sleeping on the

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,160
other side of the door.

391
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,600
And I'm like, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna nuke you all night with the radio waves.

392
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,680
You're gonna wake up fine.

393
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
And I'm gonna have a big aha.

394
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,840
I mean, I'm gonna drop the mic on this.

395
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,120
And I'm gonna listen to all the radio I freaking want from this point on.

396
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Well, the opposite happened.

397
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,360
You know, the morning she woke up, she was terribly sick.

398
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,240
I don't remember the specific symptoms she had that day, but she was really scared because

399
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,040
what had gotten to her in her safe room.

400
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,840
I mean, this is the room that she would go to recover from exposure to things.

401
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,920
And actually don't remember feeling that much kind of shame or, you know, feeling that bad

402
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,360
as a kid, but it did cross that off the list.

403
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,680
You know, I believed her.

404
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,840
And that was a really important moment for me to say, wow, okay, she's, you know, specifically

405
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
with this, she's not crazy.

406
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,520
And that was one of the crazier ones.

407
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,720
I mean, you can understand how car fumes, you know, or a diesel truck going by is probably

408
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,120
not great for our bodies.

409
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,800
Well, mom would have a migraine within 30 seconds of that exposure or, or often would

410
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,500
even break out, you know, her body would just start reacting.

411
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
So it was weird.

412
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,660
It was a weird childhood.

413
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,060
I remember, you know, you just have these glimpses in these scenes that the books was

414
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,040
just this illustration of how far she'd really gone.

415
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,440
And mom being a writer, she was also an avid reader and she still wanted to have books

416
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
in her life.

417
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,000
So my dad's and my solution to this was we would, we'd bake them.

418
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,440
We would open up the oven and we would just start baking over, you know, the period of

419
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,480
a day or two on low, you know, maybe 200, 250.

420
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,140
And we'd be moving the pages just to try to alcacet to get that smell of new print out

421
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,400
through the heat.

422
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,080
We would also put them out in the sun.

423
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,280
So I just recently was home and I came across a family photo in an album of a hundred books

424
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,800
out on the grass, baking in the sun, just out, outgassing.

425
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,520
So that was a, there were these words, you know, outgassing, reacting.

426
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,440
These are words that getting pure that I would just hear, you know, countless times growing

427
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,600
up.

428
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,880
So I wanted mom to be like other moms, but I'd say in the first part of childhood, I

429
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
was really taking care of her.

430
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,280
I felt bad for her.

431
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,400
I would go sing her songs or I would go and sit with her.

432
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,720
I was always getting pure.

433
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,600
So if I came in from the outside world, I would have to wear special clothes that had

434
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
been washed in baking soda.

435
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,840
And there were clothes trees out in the garage where I'd take off the clothes that might

436
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,840
have, I don't know, the whiff of smoke on them.

437
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,160
My dad was always giving me the sniff test, like a bloodhound, you know, I'd walk in from

438
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,560
the outside and, you know, oh, I smell this or I smell that because I never wanted to

439
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
change my clothes.

440
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
I'd say I'm fine.

441
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
I wasn't around anything.

442
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
I went for a walk.

443
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,840
They would always smell something.

444
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,040
So then, you know, I would I would I was constantly getting pure so that I could be around her.

445
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,160
And it was it was it was weird.

446
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,720
I did a lot of the cooking for her.

447
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,680
I did the cleaning, did the washing up.

448
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,880
And then I think as that moved towards as it moved into teenage years, I just began

449
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,680
to really resent it and resent her.

450
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,140
Last thing, just going back a minute, you know, the what was really helpful for my parents

451
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,020
was finding other people like mom who had been sick.

452
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,340
And I don't remember.

453
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,540
She was the only one I remember that had been sick because of a gas leak.

454
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:02,080
But I do remember a couple people in our family, friends that had been completely normal.

455
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,180
And then one day, a pesticide company came in and did all the lawns in the neighborhood.

456
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,380
It was called chem lawn.

457
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,760
And then they just snapped and they were like, mom, the next day.

458
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,460
So there was something in their body that just couldn't take massive amounts of pesticides,

459
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,580
you know, throughout the entire neighborhood on their lawn and their front lawn in their

460
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,240
backyard.

461
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,680
And that made sense to me.

462
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,960
At least there was an event.

463
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,040
Pesticides are probably not good for any of us.

464
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,640
But your, you know, your body and my body, we can fight that off.

465
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,320
So I remember that really helped me, too, saying mom is not alone.

466
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,120
There is a community of environmentally sensitive patients.

467
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,680
And my dad was just this hero through the whole thing.

468
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,040
He doesn't leave her.

469
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,480
I mean, they slept in separate beds for almost 10 years because there was a period of time

470
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,760
where she needed to be in this special room.

471
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,040
And there was a period of time where he would make her sick, the candida.

472
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,440
I mean, it was just always, always something making her sick.

473
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
And he just stuck, stuck by her.

474
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,080
I mean, it was very loyal, tried to do the best he could with me and take me to baseball

475
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,440
when he could and soccer and gave me the most normal life that he could.

476
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,120
But it was far from normal.

477
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,160
You know, you obviously, there's many kids that go through variations of this.

478
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,200
But in many ways, you were sort of what we would call enmeshed, the enmeshment, meaning

479
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
you were forced into an adult role too soon.

480
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,840
And I guess it's not surprising to me that as a teenager, you'd start to kind of rebel

481
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,420
against that because you sort of you miss that period of life when you have absolutely

482
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,900
no responsibility and you had the responsibility.

483
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,620
I mean, it's hard for me to imagine what you're talking about based on a personal experience.

484
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,260
But I can try to extrapolate that, you know, look, you were forced into a caregiver role.

485
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,340
You were sharing care with your father of your mom.

486
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,220
And so do you remember when it started to sort of become frustrating to you?

487
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,240
And, you know, my guess is the combination of adolescence and puberty by themselves are

488
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,480
enough jarring disruptive change coupled with the, you know, the soil of all you've

489
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
experienced.

490
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,620
I think, you know, there was a hope as a child, maybe that this would end.

491
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,900
And when you hit adolescence and, you know, I realized this was never going to end.

492
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
There was no cure.

493
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,280
And you like, could you bring friends over after school and hang out or was that just

494
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,640
too disruptive to the house?

495
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,180
Only if they stayed outside.

496
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,880
So there were signs, keep out on all the doors, chemically safe, sensitive patient.

497
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,240
So no, they couldn't come in.

498
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,600
You know, there were periods of time later on in high school where if they did get pure

499
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,080
and mom was in a different part of the house, then we could open up the windows and air

500
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,320
out that room.

501
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,680
So there were some exceptions.

502
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,920
But the general rule was, you know, everything had all life had to happen outside of the

503
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
house.

504
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,320
You know, this is terrible for her too, to not be able to, you know, play video, not

505
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,840
video games, play board games or she'd be watching out a window as I played soccer in

506
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,960
the back, but she couldn't really meet my friends and see what they were like.

507
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,720
She couldn't invite them into the kitchen and bake brownies, all these things that she

508
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
really wanted to do.

509
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,840
So there was a lot of pain for her feeling like she wasn't able to show up as a mother

510
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,080
or as a wife.

511
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,800
How did your mom cope with that pain?

512
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Emotionally pain?

513
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,040
Well, my parents, there's one answer.

514
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,800
She had this unwavering faith.

515
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
She would read the Bible.

516
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,980
She would try and stay positive.

517
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:36,060
She would thank God for her symptoms and believe that through these trials, she was

518
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:41,940
getting closer to, you know, to serving, you know, closer to kind of having this pure hearts.

519
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,740
So really, I mean, just a remarkable, extreme version of stoicism, really, if you think

520
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,740
about it.

521
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,220
I mean, I think, you know, the stoics, Marcus Aurelius and Seneca, of course, they don't

522
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,500
talk so much about religion, but there's still this belief that these challenges make us

523
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
better.

524
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,820
And so, you know, you can't sharpen the knife without a blunt object.

525
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,620
And for mom, I think that was in the picture.

526
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,500
It sounds like how she was describing it.

527
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,300
And in the picture of Jesus, he was suffering.

528
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,980
And you know, well, there's all these stories that she would find in the Bible of people

529
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,420
suffering and it being for a great purpose, you know, there being a reason for it all.

530
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:27,260
So I just remember she would walk around and she would say, like, praise God for the fabrics

531
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,820
offener that just made her sick.

532
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,780
You know, she was just trying to stay positive throughout all of this.

533
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,860
So you know, kicking up into the teenage years, too, I start to rebel against the role of

534
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,380
faith, the role of the church, the rules, the religiosity.

535
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,580
I didn't like going to church anymore.

536
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,420
You know, it's more fun as a kid when they're telling stories of Jonah and the whale and

537
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,580
you know, the flannel boards, but not as a teenager when you just realize you're not

538
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,140
allowed to swear, you're not allowed to sleep around, you can't drink, you can't smoke.

539
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
It was there are a lot of rules.

540
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,540
There's a lot of can't do's.

541
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:04,340
And I remember I have this vivid memory of coming home after school and mom, there was

542
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,500
a period of time where mom then lived out in the yard.

543
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,180
A friend built a lean to.

544
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,460
So she found that in times where the pollen wasn't too bad or the mold wasn't too bad,

545
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,420
there were seasons where she would feel better sitting outside than in her safe room.

546
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,140
And she would have this little igloo cooler next to her.

547
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,820
She would have a chair.

548
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,860
She would have her mask on and she would just protect herself from the wind.

549
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,340
So she would be on one of these four corners, depending on which way the wind was blowing.

550
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,060
And I would come home from school and she'd hear the car pull up into the driveway and

551
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,780
she'd yell my name and I would just pretend not to hear her and I'd walk in the house,

552
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,460
which, you know, that to me feels like the kind of the picture of this just got old.

553
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,180
This was tiring.

554
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,660
You know, I didn't want to go and find out what she wanted me to bring her.

555
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,140
And I can only imagine that on some level that produces some guilt and shame within you.

556
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:06,020
But at the same time, it's sort of a protective thing that you're doing because of all the sort of the pain and the trauma that you've been

557
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
you know, it's been inflicted on you since you're four years old.

558
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,380
And so I've always find like stories like this to be so tragic in a way.

559
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,940
And I mean, I think in many ways your story has a happy ending.

560
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,300
But for many people, these don't have happy endings because nobody's at fault here.

561
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,620
This isn't about like blame or fault, right?

562
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,340
People get sick, bad things happen.

563
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,980
And yet families can get ripped apart by these things in ways that aren't entirely obvious.

564
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:39,020
And I think what comes next in your story to me is makes much more sense after I read your book than just knowing a couple of snippets along the way.

565
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,580
Now, you're a pretty musical guy, right?

566
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,020
I played piano growing up.

567
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,820
You know, I remember my grandpa taught me at four, taught me on an organ and I always played.

568
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,060
So then in high school, you you transfer to a new school, if I recall.

569
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,740
Yeah, I got to talk about the first high school.

570
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,900
So this was also part of the rebellion.

571
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:05,660
So I'd gone to public elementary school and then they put me in a Christian kind of Baptist middle school, which I actually liked.

572
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:18,140
But then ninth grade freshman year of high school, they put me in the basement of a church school and there were nine people in my freshman class and they couldn't afford

573
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,060
enough teachers. So we would be taught by VHS video.

574
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,820
So they would wheel in the cart.

575
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:35,420
Remember those old gray metal carts and they had kind of the ribbed trays and they'd pop in science and we'd sit there for 45 minutes, which felt like it was 100 hours.

576
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,780
And it was just terrible.

577
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:46,500
And we had to wear these ugly uniforms and it was just everything was wrong for a 14 year old kid going to school in the basement of a church by video.

578
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,380
And I was surprised this was accredited.

579
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,180
How it's amazing to me.

580
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,300
They did their best.

581
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,900
And it's funny because I know a bunch of people that came out of that school that did all four years and actually became very successful.

582
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,500
I just at that moment, I wanted to explore the public high school and it couldn't be any more different.

583
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,700
There were 4000 people in high school.

584
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:16,100
I think my parents saw something in something simmering, maybe in my personality that really scared them.

585
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:26,740
Throwing me into this worldly high school where undoubtedly there would be drugs and sex and drinking and ungodly things going on.

586
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,820
And I remember just saying, look, I'm going to run away from home.

587
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,540
Or I'm not going back to the school.

588
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:39,740
And they said, you know, and I was smart enough to say, look, I'm not being challenged, academically challenged.

589
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,180
I was an avid reader growing up.

590
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:48,780
I remember getting a job when I was I think I was 14 writing or 14 or 15 writing for the local county newspaper.

591
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,940
So I was a pretty good writer.

592
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,980
I was an avid reader.

593
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,780
TV was just TV made bomb sick.

594
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,660
So we did have a tiny TV, but it was in a in a room that they made really uncomfortable.

595
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,060
And maybe I watched a couple of hours of TV a week growing up.

596
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,580
So reading was really my escape.

597
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,900
And I moved into the big high school and exactly what they had feared happens almost immediately.

598
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,620
Fallen with the wrong crowd.

599
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:18,260
I fallen with a crowd who's older and is not really interested in going to high school but was in a band.

600
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,660
So I then joined the band, which was an alternative rock band.

601
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,100
So it was kind of Counting Crows meets Pearl Jam meets Live.

602
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,100
And I was going to be the keyboard player.

603
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,380
What was the name of the band?

604
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,460
It's called Sunday River.

605
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,820
Just random.

606
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,180
It was like a ski resort in New Hampshire we'd heard of and nobody had even been to.

607
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
So I joined this band and I grow my hair.

608
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,260
I just start growing my hair out.

609
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,740
So it hits my shoulders and I become the bands and I self appoint as the band's manager.

610
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,180
And I am going to get us a record deal.

611
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,860
So you're the keyboard guy and the manager manager.

612
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,100
So I'm sending our demo tapes into New York City.

613
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,620
And for some strange reason, people listen to our tapes and say, hey, we'll book you.

614
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,500
So we start playing CBGBs the wetlands.

615
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,860
This is like what mid 80s late 80s.

616
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,420
This would be, let's see, 75, 93.

617
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,060
Okay.

618
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,340
Okay.

619
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,700
93 to 95.

620
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:13,980
Yeah.

621
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,100
And we're driving my parents Ford Taurus station wagon.

622
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,900
You know, I'm throwing all the gear, the keyboards and the guitars.

623
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,940
We're driving into New York City.

624
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
We're driving into Philly.

625
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,740
We're playing not that interested in going to school.

626
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,740
So I'm a C minus student at best in this new high school.

627
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,180
And I'm not jumping into the drugs that the band was doing.

628
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:42,820
And I'm not jumping into all the vices yet, but they made it look good and they made it look cool.

629
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,980
So what prevented you from joining them?

630
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,620
I don't know.

631
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,700
I think I was still holding on to, you know, the virtue.

632
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,460
I was still trying to stay pure, I guess you could say.

633
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:58,260
So what was the, what was the best part for you in that moment prior to going,

634
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,780
you know, further into, you know, drugs or all these other things?

635
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,140
Was it just a sense of like community and tribe with these guys?

636
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:05,940
Yeah.

637
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,980
And playing music was fun.

638
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:19,420
I'm playing music in front of, you know, 300, 400 people driving into New York City to the legendary CBGBs where, you know, I don't know, all these great bands had been discovered and been found.

639
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,500
And then talking with A&R people at labels that were interested in being pursued by real managers.

640
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:32,060
This was a moment in time that felt like we were, we had a shot at getting a record deal and record deals back then they were the thing.

641
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:40,220
You know, there was Atlantic Records and BMG and Virgin, you know, it was a really exciting possibility.

642
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,420
How close were you to the other guys in the band?

643
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,020
Did they know about your story at home?

644
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,740
They did.

645
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,220
They did.

646
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,340
I wasn't that close.

647
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,220
They were in a way they were, they were other.

648
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,740
They were more worldly.

649
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,060
They hadn't been sheltered.

650
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,220
They, you know, had been sleeping around for years.

651
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,940
They'd been smoking and experimenting with drinking and drugs for years.

652
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,420
They were older, maybe two to four years older.

653
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,340
So I was the baby of the band, but it was, it was a sense of community.

654
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,380
It was, it was fun being together, playing music and driving to have these experiences.

655
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,100
It felt dangerous.

656
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,700
It felt edgy.

657
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,340
So I barely graduate high school.

658
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:28,660
I remember up until the very last day, neither my parents nor I knew whether I would actually have enough attendance credit to

659
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,980
get the high school diploma.

660
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,380
I mean, I was on the brink.

661
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,540
It was one day.

662
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,980
I thought shy of actually passing and I would have to repeat the 12th grade.

663
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,420
And I think I probably, oh, I probably got a doctor or something to lie about, you know, something.

664
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,580
I mean, I managed to pass, but certainly, you know, high school was not a proud achievement.

665
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,740
So when you were a senior, were you applying to college?

666
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,540
I wasn't because I was, I was delighted to announce to my parents that I would not be going to college.

667
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,060
I would not be pursuing further education because I would be getting a record deal.

668
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,580
Peter, that's what, that's what bands do, right?

669
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,020
All bands in New York city.

670
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,620
And we get, I would be getting a multimillion dollar record deal.

671
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,860
I announced to my parents.

672
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:18,740
So who would need a college education when you had a multimillion dollar record deal and you were touring not just the country, but the world.

673
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,660
And your parents had worked pretty hard to put money aside for you to go to college.

674
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,300
They had.

675
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,140
There was a little over a hundred thousand dollars sitting in an account since birth.

676
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,580
You know, he'd been putting in probably a couple hundred bucks a month or whatever he could.

677
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,060
My dad was very middle class.

678
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,780
They, they didn't spend money on things.

679
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,900
They'd run their cars 15, 20 years and you know, they buy a Toyota Camry and keep it for 20 years.

680
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,460
Would go to, you know, the diner when it was two for one special.

681
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,620
So he was a saver.

682
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,260
I need save for college.

683
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,740
So this was really an affront to them.

684
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,940
And I think what made it even more difficult was that when I was a child, I wanted to be a doctor.

685
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,300
So I was talking about Johns Hopkins medical school.

686
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:06,620
That was, if you'd asked me probably up until 13, 14, what I was going to do, it was doctor to help sick people like mom.

687
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,340
I was going to be in the med, you know, and I obviously didn't have the grades to do that in high school and took a different path.

688
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,860
So yeah, I moved to New York city by myself.

689
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:23,740
I'm the only band member that takes the leap, but I said, well, the band's manager, me needs to be in the heart of things.

690
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,900
I moved to an apartment in Greenwich village.

691
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,180
I was paying $650 a month.

692
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,340
It was on Christopher street and seven.

693
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,540
And it wasn't too big.

694
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,100
If I recall, it was, it was, it was hundreds of square feet.

695
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,900
It was tiny.

696
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,700
It was a sixth floor walk up and it just felt amazing.

697
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,700
I mean, I was living in the heart of the West village alone.

698
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,260
Yeah.

699
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,900
It's the dream.

700
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:46,940
It was the dream.

701
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,780
And I start working at Sam.

702
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,620
So you was at 96 95.

703
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,780
So this would be, were you here for the big snow storm in January of 96?

704
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,460
Do you remember that?

705
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,300
I was.

706
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,460
Yeah, this would have been 94.

707
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,660
So I was 19.

708
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:10,380
And you know, I, I start working at Sam Ash music cause I wanted some, some pocket money, um, alongside the, the very little money that our bands would, would make gigging.

709
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:20,220
And you know, I then realized that, so I actually met a manager for our band who says, well, I'm actually a real band manager and I'll take you guys on.

710
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,660
And we, we signed a contract.

711
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:28,180
And I remember him finding out that my dad had saved for college and he said, well, you're in New York city.

712
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,260
You're crazy to squander that money.

713
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,100
I mean, he's not going to give it to you for anything else.

714
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,140
So why don't you go to NYU part time?

715
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,400
You might as well get a degree and there's Tisch, you know, school of the arts.

716
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,700
I mean, it's, it's, you're in the city.

717
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,380
You might as well, you have the time and he'd been an NYU grad.

718
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,580
So I then call my parents and say, okay, you can start paying NYU.

719
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,580
So I've gotten those scholarship.

720
00:39:51,580 --> 00:40:00,540
I mean, you know, I picked one of the most expensive schools in the country and I do wind up getting a degree again, you know, without any sort of colors.

721
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,700
I mean, see student really just putting in the minimum amount of work to make dad happy.

722
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,580
And what did you study?

723
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,620
Communications.

724
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,400
Cause it was easy.

725
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,480
I could write and communicate.

726
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
So the band breaks up.

727
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,600
Which by the way, does come back to serve you well.

728
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
There's a lot of, there's a lot of this.

729
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,560
It's so funny.

730
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,840
I mean, I've now gotten several awards from NYU.

731
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,320
They invite me into speak.

732
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,680
I just made a video for the like commencement ceremony.

733
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,520
So now I'm like celebrated by NYU many years later.

734
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,520
And every time they've interviewed me, probably six or seven interviews now, I'm like, okay, so here's what really happened.

735
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,640
Don't ask me this questions.

736
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,320
Cause I can't lie.

737
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,080
Okay.

738
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,440
I can talk about the city being a great campus.

739
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,280
I could talk about, you know, the diversity of New York and the community, but don't ask me what it was like for me.

740
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,840
Cause I would, I was not your good student.

741
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,080
So, okay.

742
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,400
So I'm living in the village.

743
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm working at Sam Ash.

744
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:00,720
The band breaks up months later and there was a lot of drugs and we, we just didn't like each other that much.

745
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:07,440
I mean, it was, we didn't like each other outside of the time that we were on stage, but I've already made the leap to New York.

746
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,200
I've got this NYU opportunity and I'm making pretty good money selling high-end stereo gear.

747
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:24,080
I remember one night Stevie Wonder came in and I got to sell him $50,000 of gear and make a commission on that, you know, keyboards and modules and all this stuff.

748
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,640
So I was, I won some favor with my managers that I would get to do a lot of the big clients.

749
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,640
I then almost immediately start dabbling in nightlife.

750
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,840
So you've got all this stuff going on.

751
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,040
I'm at NYU part-time.

752
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:48,640
I'm working at Sam Ash and then the guy that booked out my band convinces me just by way of watching him that I was always on the wrong side of the equation because our band would turn up.

753
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:59,540
We'd bring a hundred people to the club paying customers and they might throw us a 20th of that or a 30th of that and say, hey, here's a couple hundred bucks.

754
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,940
Go split it up six ways.

755
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:13,640
You know, it wasn't even enough to pay for gas or, you know, the guitar strings, but I, I love the idea of the nightclub owner, you know, the person on the other side of the rope deciding who got in and who didn't.

756
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:23,040
So I, I try my hand at that and I joined this guy and say, you know, he starts throwing me a hundred bucks a week or 200 bucks a week and I'm just his sidekick.

757
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,640
And what's your actual job?

758
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,540
The job is to fill the venue with beautiful paying customers and then you get a cut.

759
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,340
And how do you go about figuring out who's beautiful and paying and get them into said club?

760
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:42,840
Is it literally going out to a lineup on the street and trying to identify in the line who should jump up?

761
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,340
That's a great problem to have.

762
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,140
Now you got to actually get the line.

763
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,040
You got to get the line.

764
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,140
So that a lot of that is just networking.

765
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,440
It's being out meeting people, getting their phone numbers, you know, later getting their email addresses.

766
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:01,040
But if you were a club promoter today, starting at zero, you'd have to be out seven nights this week and you'd be striking up conversations.

767
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,340
Hey, how are you?

768
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,340
I'm Pete.

769
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,940
What do you do?

770
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,540
You know, I'm in New York City and I'm living in a couple different places.

771
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,740
Oh, Hey, would you want to want to come to a party sometime?

772
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,540
I've got this amazing fashion party we're going to be doing for Prada during fashion week.

773
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,940
And you'd say, that sounds great.

774
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,040
I'd say, Oh, cool.

775
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
I'll, I'll put you on the list or I'll, I'll email.

776
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,040
And you might say, well, I want to actually put together a group of friends.

777
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,240
Great.

778
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,940
I'll sell you a table.

779
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,540
You know, it's going to cost a couple thousand dollars, but I'll give you prime seating in the club.

780
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:33,240
And I'll leave this amazing DJ flying in from Paris and you know, he'd throw his parties at hotel costs.

781
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,540
Like, you know, you may not have even heard of any of this stuff, but we make it sound so great.

782
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,840
It's a party that you have to be at.

783
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
So we're promoting.

784
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,040
We're constantly out there promoting.

785
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,540
And now I have Peter on the list and maybe you come and you bring a few friends.

786
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,540
So what did you do before email was around because this was phone pre-email.

787
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,840
All just dialing.

788
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,440
But then you don't have cell phones.

789
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,240
Like, how are you?

790
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,940
It was home phones.

791
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,940
It was office.

792
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,040
It was voicemail.

793
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,940
It was beepers.

794
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,840
We'd beep people.

795
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,740
They'd call us back.

796
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,240
Email, believe me, the minute that took off, we embrace though right away.

797
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,640
And then we started building, you know, one of the first email lists in clubs and open rates were 100%.

798
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,140
I mean, it was it was extraordinary.

799
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,240
Meaning everybody opened your emails.

800
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,440
Everybody would open an email, even a form email like that.

801
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,040
Or a short.

802
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,440
What would that open rate be?

803
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,940
5%.

804
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,440
1%.

805
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,840
You know, maybe, I don't know.

806
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,040
So imagine the next time, you know, Airbnb or you know, Google sends out an email or app.

807
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,540
Okay, Apple's a perfect example, right?

808
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:33,840
Apple sends an email new event coming new iPhones, maybe 5% to 8% would actually open it.

809
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Yeah, you're you'll delete it or I'll see it later.

810
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,640
It just sits there.

811
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,440
So back then, you know, imagine Apple send something in every single person is like, oh my gosh, I got an email.

812
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,340
This is so cool.

813
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,240
So we start a list and you know, I just get good at this.

814
00:44:51,240 --> 00:45:06,240
And I leave my partner I go start producing a live RMB open mic night at pretty legendary club called Nells on 14th Street that you know, is in Brett Easton Ellis books and you know, place that Mick Jagger used to always hang out.

815
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:20,140
So I'm I somehow, you know, this this skinny white kid from Philadelphia, New Jersey winds up helming this really impressive R&B show.

816
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,340
So Stevie Wonder would come and perform.

817
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,840
Chaka Khan would perform.

818
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,240
Prince used to come in and perform for free.

819
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:27,740
Prince?

820
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:31,140
Yeah, I used to have some fun Prince stories.

821
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:38,040
He's to always this was a kind of dark lounge, almost Victoria setting, Victorian era setting.

822
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:44,040
So they're the old mirrors and the little sconces on the wall, you know, with almost a candle lights.

823
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,540
And whenever Prince came in, I would have to go and unscrew the light bulbs.

824
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,440
He liked to sit in the very specific area, but he wanted it dark.

825
00:45:54,140 --> 00:46:00,940
And you know, then his bouncer would just he would sit alone and then his bouncer would block off.

826
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:07,440
He would he would sit backwards in a chair and kind of just tell everybody they couldn't see him or couldn't doctor him.

827
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,640
And he would just sit there taking in the music and then sometimes he would actually jump up and perform.

828
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,440
That's so interesting.

829
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,640
So he really was there for the music.

830
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,940
You know, you get the impression a lot of celebrities like they like being there because they want to be the celebrity.

831
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,940
But he was the opposite.

832
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:26,440
Yeah. And I remember we would say at the time, I don't even know that I was that insightful as you just were.

833
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,040
We're like, why would the guy come to a club if he doesn't want to talk to anyone?

834
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,040
If he doesn't want to be seen and doesn't want to talk to anyone?

835
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,740
Well, of course, it was the music because we had these unbelievably talented keyboard players and drummers.

836
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,240
And a lot of them had gigged with Brian McKnight and Stevie Wonder.

837
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,740
So that's how the people were coming.

838
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:52,040
You know, if your drummer has a residency at Nels every Tuesday night, your drummer is like, hey, what are you doing on Tuesday?

839
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,940
And you'll come by and you recognize people and you just it's fun to jump up.

840
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,040
So I got to actually play piano for Stevie Wonder on stage a couple of times.

841
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,340
I remember I was playing overjoyed and Stevie wasn't even playing.

842
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,740
He was just standing up singing while I'm playing keyboards.

843
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,540
And it was a it was an amazing experience.

844
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,140
It was called Voices at Nels.

845
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:18,840
Move from there over into the more fashion model scene of clubs because there's more money to be made there.

846
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,640
We would call it models and bottles.

847
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:34,740
So this was the advent of bottle service when I guess a few of us promoters and club owners realized that instead of charging people $18 at the bar for a vodka soda, you could take the same $18 price point

848
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:41,440
and charge them $500 for a bottle of absolute vodka at their table and they wouldn't have to keep going up and getting refills.

849
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,940
And oh, by the way, the $500 bottle of absolute cost you what?

850
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,340
$16.

851
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:58,840
Yeah, sort of amazing to me when you look at like the high-end clubs like One Oak and things like that, like what you'll pay for a bottle there relative to the wholesale cost.

852
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,540
It's there can't be a bigger margin in any business in the history of civilization.

853
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:11,640
But it but the value if you actually figured out how many drinks you could get out of a bottle of Stoli, let's say, and then how much you'd have to pay at the bar.

854
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,040
It's it's commensurate because they're charging you 20 bucks for a vodka soda at the bar anyway.

855
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,240
So 30 drinks and you're at a $600 bottle.

856
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,740
Yeah, wouldn't you rather have it at the comfort of your table?

857
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,140
Yeah.

858
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,740
So yeah, the whole thing was just kind of crazy models and bottles.

859
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:36,940
So the way that the scene worked is we would have to figure out how to get beautiful girls inside the nightclub and then very wealthy guys would pay for the pleasure of sitting around beautiful girls.

860
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:56,640
So you'd have all your finance guys, you know, the Goldman guys with their Amex black cards and they'd come they'd we'd off them at the door, you know, we'd swipe the card for five or 10 G's and then try and they would buy tables and then we would populate the tables with cool people, you know, often models who would drink for free.

861
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,740
And we party for free.

862
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:08,840
And I mean, was there any interest in knowing or did it matter if these were professional girls or meaning professional girls, meaning women that were going to basically take, you know, money for sex.

863
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,640
No, no, it wasn't like that.

864
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,640
It actually wasn't like that.

865
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,440
And there was no official kind of process.

866
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,440
It wasn't like that.

867
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,440
No, we would because I feel like today that's sort of pretty normal.

868
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,240
I have a lot of friends who are single and they talk about this.

869
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,440
They're like where people get paid with the women get paid.

870
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,240
Yeah, we never did.

871
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:33,340
Yeah, the women are paid to be there and you know, it's just understood that like there's a way to plus up on what you're going to pay to go home with her.

872
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,240
Yeah, that's that was foreign to us.

873
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,540
I mean, this is many years ago.

874
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:41,740
No, we would make friends with the modeling bookers and the heads of the modeling agencies.

875
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,840
We would give them a great experience and then they would come out with the girls.

876
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,540
So a Booker from a modeling agency might take out 12 of his models.

877
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,640
We would make sure they had a great time.

878
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,140
You know, everything was free from the food to the booze.

879
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,640
But now you have 12 beautiful girls in a club.

880
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:04,640
So it's like their bait to get these guys in who are basically like the sharks, right?

881
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,440
For the they're they're chum for the guys who are sharks.

882
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:15,240
But a lot of these girls would love to date the Goldman guy living in the 12,000 square foot Soho loft, you know, who might be a gentleman.

883
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,940
Let's go with best case scenario.

884
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,640
Right, right, right.

885
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,440
So you've got the so everybody's potentially winning.

886
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:28,840
Because this is a matchmaking service basically where you're doing the first layer of screening based on wealth and beauty.

887
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,540
Exactly.

888
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,640
But that's all we did.

889
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,240
So then the rest would just happen.

890
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,940
And if and if you got a guy who was a jerk or was too handsy, you just wouldn't let him in anymore.

891
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,840
So we would be blacklisting the bad actors all the time.

892
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:48,940
And at the end you wind up with a group of really cool young rich guys who are fun.

893
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,440
The girls love being around them.

894
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,240
They're funny.

895
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,640
They're spending money.

896
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,840
They might be even good looking, you know, I mean, they're they're kind of the life of the party.

897
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:06,040
And the next thing you know, you know, you're in Saint Bart's with the same people or you're in Milan with the same people or you're in Paris like the party would travel around the world.

898
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:14,940
So the way we got paid as nightclub promoters, we would just said that the beauty of the business, at least for a while, is that your asset light.

899
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,940
So you just take a cut of the total business of the night.

900
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,340
So it might be 15%, let's say.

901
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,740
Let's say it's 20%.

902
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:28,640
So you walk into a nightclub and what were the best clubs back in?

903
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,740
So we're now talking kind of late 90s, right?

904
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,440
So I can only speak to my experience.

905
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,940
The first night I went out was at Club USA and there was this famous slide there.

906
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,240
The earliest clubs I worked at, there was the limelight.

907
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,440
I worked for Peter Gation.

908
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
There was the tunnel.

909
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,440
There was the Roxy.

910
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,640
There was Twylo.

911
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,640
Lotus was a big club for us.

912
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,740
I was there for many years.

913
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,840
Pangea, Halo.

914
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,140
I mean, you know, some of the names and people will say them and I'm like, oh my gosh, I actually worked there.

915
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,340
So I worked at 40 different venues over this almost 10 year period.

916
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,040
How many of those clubs are still around today?

917
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,740
None.

918
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,140
So what's the half-life of a pot New York club?

919
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,240
Maybe five years.

920
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:14,840
Now, some of the clubs exist because the liquor license is so valuable, but they'll just get re-skinned or repurposed.

921
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:21,940
So some of the same liquor licenses are there in the same building, but it's now just a new look, new feel, new name.

922
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,440
And there might have been six of those since I left.

923
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,940
Six change of brand or even ownership.

924
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,840
So that's kind of a blurry time to be quite honest.

925
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:32,940
Yeah.

926
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,740
So we've gone.

927
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,640
What we've skipped over is band in high school.

928
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,140
You're still not doing drugs.

929
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,240
You're not drinking.

930
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,940
You're not debauching.

931
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,240
By this point as a nightclub promoter, have we slipped into some of that?

932
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,040
For sure.

933
00:52:48,340 --> 00:53:05,540
Smoking was first, then drinking, then lots of sex, then gambling, then Coke started with Coke, then marijuana, the next to see Special K, MDMA, you know, anything short of heroin that we could get our hands on as pure as we could.

934
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,440
Why don't you decide to draw the line of heroin?

935
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,940
We'd seen people OD and die.

936
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,340
You know, that was and I'd seen it firsthand.

937
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,340
My business partner snorted heroin once by mistake and almost died.

938
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,640
You know, emergency room.

939
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:24,240
He was out cold unconscious on a floor inside, you know, the kitchen of a nightclub.

940
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,640
So I just I'd seen really bad heroin trips.

941
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,240
Coke, you know, I'd never seen anyone die of Coke or die from, you know, ecstasy.

942
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:39,240
So I pick up all the all the dark habits of, you know, what you might imagine would come with the territory.

943
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,540
I mean, our lifestyle wasn't a picture of health.

944
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:48,740
We'd go to dinner at 10, you know, so the very late dinner at the trendy restaurant, we'd head over to the club around midnight, 1215.

945
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,740
And do the restaurants comp you guys as well?

946
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,940
Yeah, because we're bringing beautiful people.

947
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,740
So it made the restaurants look like a scene.

948
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,340
And you know, it was the beautiful and they would do this for a few tables.

949
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,640
I mean, it's the eye candy.

950
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,440
Sometimes we'd bring in guys who would who would just sponsor the whole dinner.

951
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,840
It depended on the model.

952
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,240
And the point is you never had to buy a dinner.

953
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
I wasn't paid for dinner.

954
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,140
During this period of time, how often were you going home to check on mom and dad for that matter?

955
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:24,440
Every couple months, every couple months and I would do a quick 48 hour trip and I same as always I'd turn up with my clothes.

956
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,340
I'd walk into the garage.

957
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,140
I would strip down naked.

958
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,340
I'd put on the clothes that they'd left out for me.

959
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:44,340
There was a period of years where it was medical coats or these gowns that they had gotten from, you know, a hospital that were sanitary and walking around like lab coats, you know, hospital scrubs in the house.

960
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,540
You know, my parents were your parents concerned.

961
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,440
They were.

962
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,140
I mean, I was living out their worst nightmare.

963
00:54:51,140 --> 00:55:02,240
I was the prodigal son that had flipped them and church and you know, all shred of morality virtue, the bird and said going to New York City.

964
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,840
I'm going to make it rich and famous.

965
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:03,940
Okay.

966
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,840
The band didn't work.

967
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:10,540
I'm going to be the biggest nightclub promoter in New York City and I'm going to sleep with every hot girl that I can get my hands on.

968
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,540
I'm going to do every good drug.

969
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,840
Get my hands on and I'm going to live it up.

970
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,440
I'm going to party.

971
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:25,440
I mean, it was so opposite of the, if you think about the basement of the Christian school with nine people and the uniform, right?

972
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,640
This was living.

973
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,140
I'm on I'm out of my own.

974
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,940
I'm flying to Paris for fashion week and dating girls that are walking in the shows.

975
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:45,240
I'm staying at the nicest hotels, you know, drinking the best wine, going to Paris nightclubs that are, I mean, it was just, it felt amazing.

976
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,140
Were you happy?

977
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:52,240
I thought I was for a while because I was collecting the markers of happiness.

978
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,840
So, you know, I'll just take most promoters.

979
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:01,340
You know, one of the first things you need to do is you need to get the top model girlfriend to just have to figure out how to do that.

980
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,740
So, you know, collected that.

981
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,940
So kind of check bark.

982
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:15,040
Then, you know, I got the car, the BMW and you know, then I got the Rolex and then I got a nice loft and rented a grand piano and the great speaker

983
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:24,040
system. And so I was kind of, you know, as we would have a little more success, I would buy the things that I thought came with success.

984
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,840
And there was always an emptiness in that.

985
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:35,940
I think the more it just got really old, the banality of having to do the same thing over and over again.

986
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:44,940
And I guess what I mean by that is you would change clubs, but there were periods where we would hate emailing and then

987
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,740
getting on the phone because the email was one way to get people to turn up.

988
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:56,240
But if you called them in a much better shot, right, if I actually say, hey, Peter, you got to come tonight, it's going to be amazing.

989
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,740
We would still have to call hundreds of people to every week to invite them to the parties.

990
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,840
And I remember just hating.

991
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,440
So what was it?

992
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,040
So did you do it was basically seven nights a week?

993
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:11,040
You're trying to get people to go working three nights a week and then you're out networking the other, you know, three or four.

994
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:22,840
So you're almost you're out most nights a week, but I would only be doing three parties, maybe a Tuesday night, a Thursday night and then a weekend, a bridge and tunnel kind of Saturday night party, let's say.

995
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,840
And you got to this a moment ago before I interrupted you, but dinner's at 10.

996
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,640
So by the time I'm going to bed, you're having dinner.

997
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,140
Yep.

998
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,740
Then what?

999
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:41,440
Then the club at 12 15 till three 30 and then maybe home by four and then half the night, you're at after hours.

1000
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Well, hey, let's keep going.

1001
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:52,540
Let's go back to somebody's loft with a bunch of coke to stay up because then you need that to you're tired because it's four in the morning and coke's not good for sleeping is my recollection.

1002
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,440
Correct.

1003
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,340
Not from personal use.

1004
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,240
Actually, I've never used coke, but just from the pharmacology of it.

1005
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,340
I reckon it probably isn't too good for sleep.

1006
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,940
That's right.

1007
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:10,440
So then but if you start doing cocaine or if you were doing it all night, you're amped up so high that at some point you will you have to come down.

1008
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,040
So then you might take an ambient.

1009
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
Yeah, again, so it's not exactly.

1010
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,740
Not actually good for sleep, believe it or not, despite the fact that the FDA seems to think so.

1011
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:27,140
Yeah, and you might be trying to go to sleep, you know, on a hard raging night that included after hours or a party at somebody's loft.

1012
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:33,840
You're you're stumbling home and you really are stumbling home because you've been drinking all night and it might be vodka Red Bull.

1013
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,240
If you're trying to stay up, it might be coke.

1014
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:46,940
It might be you might be on ecstasy, which would have a, you know, maybe a three to five hour run, maybe even longer and, you know, it's 10 or 11 and you're walking home in broad daylight.

1015
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:57,740
You've been up since, you know, dinner at 10 was your starting point and you're looking at all these healthy people just going about their business and see you're watching their runners at seven in the morning.

1016
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,940
Feels disgusting.

1017
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,440
Actually, it feels and you know, you're not a doctor or a surgeon on a midnight shift doing noble work.

1018
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,640
You know, you've just been trashing your body and the bodies of all those around you.

1019
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,240
So it really started to take its toll on me emotionally on me physically.

1020
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,040
I write about this actually in the first chapter in the book.

1021
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
I just go numb half my body.

1022
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:29,440
I lose feeling in it inexplicably and I start seeing neurologists and getting in my eyes and tons of diagnostics and they can't find anything actually wrong with me.

1023
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:38,040
It's sort of interesting to the irony of this after all your mother's gone through and you know, my business partner says, well, why don't you lay off the three packs of cigarettes?

1024
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,940
I mean, I was I was such a fiend when it came to smoking.

1025
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,840
I had smoked marble Reds to was the baseline.

1026
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,140
But if it was a long night, I'd smoke 60 cigarettes in a day.

1027
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:47,640
It's amazing.

1028
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:56,740
I'm even here and I start trying to knock back all this stuff and and then now this leads into really the the epiphany and the change.

1029
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:07,740
So the first thing that happens is I have a physical full-on numbness that is not diagnosed and I remember running my left hand under boiling hot water.

1030
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,540
I remember exactly where I was in my loft and I couldn't feel it.

1031
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,540
I was terrifying.

1032
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,240
Yeah, I thought something was very very wrong with me.

1033
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:24,340
This then leads to a internal to an internal conversation about my mortality and my belief system and the life that I'm living.

1034
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:37,140
So I imagine that I have a brain tumor and you know, or some some horrible disease because why else would have my you know, have my body the parasthesia was it's never good.

1035
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:42,440
You know, if you go online and start looking at you know, half or full body parasthesia like it's bad stuff.

1036
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:54,840
So interesting, you know now with perspective perhaps this was more I don't know spiritual is the right word, but I think there was more going on than just the physicality of you know, maybe the drugs had caught up with me.

1037
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,940
I don't know the smoking the drinking around this time couple months later.

1038
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:07,440
I go to point to the Leicester for New Year's Eve and we would always spend about two weeks every New Year's fleeing New York City.

1039
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:14,040
We hated New York around New Year's is just the whole just didn't like the tourist the Times Square the tourists this everything was wrong.

1040
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,340
I mean anybody that was fun or interesting got the heck out of town.

1041
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,340
They went to the Caribbean.

1042
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,440
They went to you know, they would go anywhere warm.

1043
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,140
So warm for us was typically in Brazil.

1044
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,840
We go to a place called busios.

1045
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,440
We'd go to Argentina.

1046
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,740
This year we went to Uruguay to put to the Leicester.

1047
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:43,940
We rented this amazing house and remember the house came with servants who would cook and follow after us picking up our towels and my girlfriend came down who I was sure was the most beautiful girl on the compound.

1048
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:54,740
She was on the cover of fashion magazines in Europe at the time and it was 6 1 and Danish just beautiful and I just remember we said all right.

1049
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:55,840
Let's go to the fireworks store.

1050
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:12,240
Let's spend a thousand dollars on fireworks and then we blew them up next to the pool and let's buy all the magnums of Dom Perignon that we can and then there's just champagne flowing and then there was a party that wouldn't end and it started on New Year's Eve 2003 2002.

1051
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:19,640
This is yeah, 2004 January 2004.

1052
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,740
So it's the turn between 03 and 04.

1053
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,240
We have a New Year's Eve party.

1054
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:31,840
This is be the last day of 2003 and you know, there's a DJ that's come in and it's going to be on our compound.

1055
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:50,440
So we rented the sound system and people from the town people from other houses that we knew we're going to party on our pool and you know, I remember just getting lit that night and taking actually went to sleep for a few hours woke up popped an ecstasy pill, you know, 9 or 10 in the morning and sometime in the afternoon.

1056
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,340
I really wanted the party to stop.

1057
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,040
I wanted all these people to leave.

1058
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,540
It's not a good look when a party goes on for a day.

1059
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:06,740
It's people look pretty ragged including myself and it just you know, I started having these realizations.

1060
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,040
This is not how life was to be lived.

1061
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,140
This actually wasn't how a beautiful compound like this was supposed to be enjoyed.

1062
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,440
I mean we had wrecked the serenity of the place.

1063
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:21,740
You know, the furniture was strewn all over, you know, glass bottles broken by the side of the pool.

1064
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:29,740
I mean, this was just kind of gross and I just started doing some when everybody eventually did leave.

1065
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,740
I started doing some soul-searching.

1066
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:37,140
I realized that I you know, I certainly wasn't in love with my girlfriend and I don't think she was in love with me.

1067
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,940
This was almost a relationship of convenience.

1068
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:48,740
You know, I started reading a deep theological book called The Pursuit of God that my father had given me at Christmas

1069
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:55,640
and you know, my parents for 10 years had been trying to get me back in church, get me back on the right track, preaching at me,

1070
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,940
sending me different translations of the Bible.

1071
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:04,540
I mean, this was all just falling on deaf ears, but there was something about this moment, the paresthesia,

1072
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:09,440
that just really caused me to take stock of my life both spiritually and morally.

1073
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,940
And just begin to kind of say, where am I?

1074
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,940
And what have I done in a way?

1075
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,940
And I realized that there would never be enough.

1076
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:25,940
As I looked around, the interesting thing was almost everybody at the compound was richer.

1077
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,440
They were older.

1078
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,440
They had the plane.

1079
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,940
They, you know, had the better car.

1080
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:35,440
They had more money and they weren't that happy either, Peter.

1081
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,440
I mean, this was, there was so much brokenness.

1082
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,440
There was so much wreckage.

1083
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,440
I mean, many of our top bottle buyers, the guys who would spend 10 or $15,000 paying for the booze,

1084
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,440
you know, they'd run off on their wife.

1085
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:54,440
Sometimes their kids didn't talk to them because they were dating models younger than their kids.

1086
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,440
And there was a lot of brokenness.

1087
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:04,440
So this week for me, I remember just having a change of heart saying, I'm not on the right path

1088
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:14,440
and I want to find my way back to the spirituality, the virtue, kind of my heritage, you know, the moral foundation of the way that I grew up.

1089
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,440
This isn't working anymore.

1090
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,440
This sucks.

1091
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
This feeling sucks.

1092
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,440
I feel dirty.

1093
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,440
I feel degenerate.

1094
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,440
I feel like a hedonist and something needs to change.

1095
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:30,440
Did you think of that in sort of a moral way or did you think of that more in just an absolute way?

1096
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:39,440
I don't even know if that's the right way to describe it, but because, you know, I think you could objectively say all those things without applying a moral judgment too, right?

1097
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,440
Yeah.

1098
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440
I mean, I think it was through a spiritual lens.

1099
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:48,440
You know, I was trying to find my way back to God or what I believed that meant for me.

1100
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,440
And that was virtue.

1101
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,440
That was purity.

1102
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:59,440
That was blessed are the peacemakers, you know, blessed are those who look after the poor and who give of themselves in the service of others.

1103
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,440
You know, loving your neighbor.

1104
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,440
I mean, I wasn't doing any of this stuff.

1105
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,440
So that was that was the sacred text that I had been brought up with.

1106
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:11,440
And I think I started to wish is really the way a lot of, you know, a lot of religion has lost that.

1107
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:18,440
And a lot of religion has, you know, we don't want to go down that rabbit hole because we could spend another four hours on that.

1108
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:26,440
But, you know, the virtues you mentioned are sort of the virtues that I think people would uniformly agree are wonderful with or without religion.

1109
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,440
Right.

1110
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,440
Yeah.

1111
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
And, you know, we were talking about this.

1112
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:53,440
I mean, I guess as a 28 year old adult at the end of myself, I came to see Jesus very differently, actually, as someone who was challenging the establishment, who was fighting against the religiosity and the oppression of the leaders of the church in quotes, I guess, at the time, and preaching a very different message of purity, of service to the poor, of absolute love.

1113
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:00,440
I mean, I remember he called basically all the church leaders the worst names that you could ever call anybody at that time.

1114
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,440
So I just I rediscover kind of my faith or softly.

1115
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,440
Now, this is still so you get back to New York in January.

1116
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,440
Still partying at the clubs.

1117
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
Yeah. So, yeah. So that's what I was going to ask.

1118
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,440
So you come back to New York, you're you're back to day job.

1119
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,440
But I really have a heart change.

1120
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,440
So I start trying to go to church again and I start trying to do less of it all.

1121
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,440
So I quit Coke for a while, for example, and I'm trying to cut down to one pack a day.

1122
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,440
And then there's times where I just OK, I'm going to quit smoking.

1123
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,440
And I go into the nikoret and the patch.

1124
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,440
And so there's a my heart has really changed.

1125
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,440
The intention has changed.

1126
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,440
I know that I'm going to have to break up with my girlfriend and have the heart.

1127
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,440
Like there's who were you able to talk with about this?

1128
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,440
This is a huge internal struggle.

1129
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,440
No one.

1130
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,440
I didn't have a best friend.

1131
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,440
I was just about to say, you don't sound like you have real friends.

1132
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,440
No.

1133
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:56,440
You have a lot of acquaintances, but they're not they're not part of your soul right in the way that a great friend would be.

1134
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,440
And I wasn't going to give my parents the satisfaction of letting them know that I might be turning back around.

1135
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,440
Change of heart.

1136
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,440
Or, you know, God forbid that I read dad's book on theology that he sent me.

1137
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,440
I mean, that would just be I had too much ego at the time.

1138
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,440
So this is a really solitary experience.

1139
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:23,440
I'm going, you know, at 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning and sitting at the very back pew of a church on my own, not telling anyone that I went to church.

1140
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,440
I'm wrestling with all these demons myself.

1141
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:31,440
What's interesting is coming back from that trip, even your girlfriend doesn't realize what you're going through.

1142
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,440
We had a really shallow relationship.

1143
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,440
We didn't talk about things.

1144
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,440
We didn't talk about hopes and dreams or or suffering.

1145
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:44,440
So around this time, I remember it was interesting coming back a couple months later, the incidents of numbness, they just stop.

1146
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,440
They stopped as quickly as they started.

1147
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,440
And that was great.

1148
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,440
I didn't have anything to directly correlate them to.

1149
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:59,440
I mean, I had ratcheted back all the partying, but I was still drinking and, you know, still smoking just less of everything.

1150
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:06,440
So, you know, I remember throughout this whole period of time, you know, I was clearly I mean, I was praying.

1151
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,440
So I was like, God, I need to get out of nightlife.

1152
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,440
This sucks. You know, it's not it's not for me anymore.

1153
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:24,440
And, you know, I remember just hating the fact I remember feeling like I couldn't my day job kept me in the way of the life that I wanted to build for myself.

1154
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:30,440
So it'd almost be like if you wanted to stop gambling, you probably need to stop working in a casino.

1155
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:35,440
But you probably can't be a blackjack dealer if you're also a degenerate gambler.

1156
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Even though you could do your job, right?

1157
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,440
And you're around gambling all day and maybe you don't go to the sports book that night.

1158
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,440
But it's just like the environment was was still so unhealthy if you're struggling with that.

1159
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,440
So that's how it felt for me.

1160
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,440
And, you know, I remember there was just like this cry for help.

1161
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,440
And the only person was to God, like, God, get me out of this.

1162
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,440
Show me what I'm supposed to do.

1163
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,440
Show me how I'm supposed to to live differently.

1164
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:04,440
There's a scene I read about in length of the book, but something happened one night at a club and it involved a gun and involved a bouncer and a threat.

1165
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:09,440
And I have this, you know, really clear opportunity to take a couple weeks off.

1166
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:17,440
And I remember renting a cobalt blue Ford Mustang telling my business partner, look, I'm out of here for a couple weeks.

1167
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,440
You handle the clubs.

1168
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:22,440
And I remember riding north like that's where I was going.

1169
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,440
He's like, where are you going?

1170
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,440
I'm like north. I mean, maybe I wind up in Canada, you know, in Montreal or Toronto.

1171
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,440
I grab on that trip.

1172
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,440
I pack my, you know, iPod.

1173
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,440
I bring a bottle of Dewar's and I bring a Bible.

1174
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:43,440
And in some ways, you know, there's just I was kind of wrestling like with the faith and virtue piece, but I'm still drinking and smoking.

1175
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,440
And I start just driving north.

1176
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,440
I wind up in Vermont and New Hampshire.

1177
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,440
I eventually wind up on Maine and I'm having this conversation with myself.

1178
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,440
Again, there's just me.

1179
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,440
And I'm saying, what would it look like never to go back?

1180
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,440
What might the opposite of my life look like?

1181
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,440
What's the clean break look like?

1182
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,440
Like, what could I do?

1183
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,440
And it almost like hit me.

1184
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:16,440
The opposite of your life would be to walk away from all of these vices and go serve others instead of yourself.

1185
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:22,440
Go serve the poor, you know, which is something that I'd never even, it never even conceived of before.

1186
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,440
I hadn't given a single gift to a charity.

1187
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,440
I wasn't a giver.

1188
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,440
I wasn't throwing parties for charities.

1189
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:35,440
Something compels me from an Internet cafe on Greenville, Greenville, Maine on Moosehead Lake.

1190
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,440
It was a dial up Internet cafe.

1191
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,440
I remember there were a bunch of gray Dell computers there.

1192
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:46,440
And I start filling out applications to volunteer at all the humanitarian organizations I'd heard of.

1193
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:54,440
And I just, you know, there are 10 page applications and I'm willing to consider going anywhere, doing anything.

1194
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,440
To completely change my life.

1195
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,440
So it's UNICEF.

1196
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,440
It's the Peace Corps.

1197
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,440
It's World Vision.

1198
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,440
It's anybody I'd heard of.

1199
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:09,440
And I go from there back to my parents to tell them that I'm going to do a year of humanitarian service.

1200
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:14,440
And there's a kind of biblical concept that I've been brought up with of a tithe where, you know,

1201
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,440
my parents had always given 10% of their money to the church and to charity growing up.

1202
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,440
And for me, I saw this almost as a time tithe.

1203
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,440
Like I'd spend 10 years living for myself.

1204
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,440
What does it look like to give one back and completely give it to others?

1205
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,440
So to donate 10% back.

1206
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,440
So I go to my parents and I tell them this.

1207
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:40,440
And then there's this place in one of my first club partners was a British guy that had a very popular band in the 80s.

1208
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,440
And he took all the money that he made.

1209
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,440
They were called Transvision Vamp.

1210
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:53,440
And he bought this beautiful Maison Forestier, a house in the Pyrenees Mountains of France in a little village, maybe of 60 people.

1211
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,440
And I had been there over the club years, maybe 15 times.

1212
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,440
I'd taken girlfriends there.

1213
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,440
It was just like my happy place.

1214
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,440
And I knew where the key was.

1215
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,440
You know, I wouldn't even need him to be there.

1216
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:09,440
I knew how to open up the house and lock the house and deal with all the water and the electricity and all that stuff.

1217
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,440
So I asked him around this time, hey, can I just go hang out in France while I'm waiting for the year?

1218
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:22,440
And he said, of course, you know, you know where the key is, which was in this little rusty saucepan in and out building.

1219
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,440
So I go to this town.

1220
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,440
It's called Lapar del Puy Laurent.

1221
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,440
It's near Jinkla.

1222
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,440
And I'm alone again.

1223
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,440
And the rejection letters start coming in.

1224
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,440
So maybe this isn't a surprise, but no one will take me.

1225
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,440
Actually, it is a surprise to me.

1226
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,440
I mean, I can't imagine that.

1227
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,440
Are there that many people that are lining up to offer a year of their life free of service?

1228
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,440
I think the resume scared him, Peter.

1229
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,440
I mean, what had I done for the last 10 years?

1230
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,440
I'd gotten people drunk.

1231
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,440
So basically they're worried that, one, this is not real.

1232
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:00,440
And two, you're going to show up in two weeks leave and you're going to have taken a spot from somebody who could have stuck it out.

1233
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Sure.

1234
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,440
Like who wants a party boy on their mission?

1235
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,440
You know, I wasn't a serious person.

1236
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,440
Serious people don't promote nightclubs for 10 years.

1237
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,440
Do they?

1238
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,440
Right?

1239
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,440
I mean, if you're the person reviewing the application at HQ.

1240
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:17,440
So nobody has a spot for me or anything good to do.

1241
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,440
And, you know, never forget.

1242
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:27,440
I actually didn't have, I didn't write about this in the book, but I'll never forget this one moment where there's no cell phone reception in this village.

1243
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:34,440
And I was riding my bike maybe 10 miles down the mountain from where the, this little house was.

1244
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:41,440
And I'm going through the main town and my Nokia phone rings, which kind of dates this.

1245
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,440
And I pick it up.

1246
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,440
The brick?

1247
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,440
It was like the little one.

1248
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,440
Yeah.

1249
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,440
The junior brick.

1250
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,440
Junior brick, little LCD screen on the top, little square.

1251
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,440
Oh, I love that phone.

1252
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,440
They were kind of contoured.

1253
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,440
Yeah.

1254
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,440
Indestructible.

1255
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,440
I mean, the QWERTY.

1256
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,440
Just great folks.

1257
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:01,440
So I specifically remember this thing was in my pocket and I almost felt like I was going to be in a little bit of a situation.

1258
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:08,440
I specifically remember this thing was in my pocket and I almost fell off my bike because I know he had called me and oh my gosh, my phone is ringing.

1259
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,440
And it was one of the organizations called Mercy Ships.

1260
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,440
And they said, hey, we've got your application here.

1261
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,440
And I'd applied to be their photojournalist.

1262
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:21,440
And this is kind of wonderful how this does come full circle because I dust off for this one.

1263
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:28,440
I dust off my NYU degree and I'm like, I have a communications degree from New York University and let me come on your ship.

1264
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:33,440
I will write stories about the amazing work that you're doing with a hospital ship and I'll take really good pictures.

1265
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:41,440
So I put up pictures on my blog of like my girlfriends over the years and beautiful buildings and in Prague, like my Labrador Retriever.

1266
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,440
And, you know, they're like decent photos.

1267
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,440
You know, my travels around the world.

1268
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:53,440
So they call me on the phone and I'm in this village and they say, well, we're a little worried you might not be a culture fit for us, but we've agreed to meet you.

1269
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,440
And I said, where are you guys?

1270
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,440
And they said, well, the ship is in Germany.

1271
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,440
I'm like, well, I'm in France.

1272
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,440
I'll see you tomorrow or the next day.

1273
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,440
The ship was in Bremerhaven.

1274
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,440
Quite a while.

1275
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,440
It took me two days to get there on the train.

1276
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,440
But I said, I mean, this is amazing.

1277
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,440
So I take the train all the way up.

1278
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:23,440
And I remember walking aboard this five hundred and twenty two foot hospital ship, this huge hulking white ocean liner that had been converted, gutted effectively and turned into a state of the art hospital.

1279
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:32,440
And I have a meeting with what would be my future bosses and I convince them that I'm in this for all the wrong reasons.

1280
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,440
I believe I'm talented.

1281
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,440
I believe I can do this job.

1282
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,440
I am not going to throw wild raves and corrupt the rest of the humanitarian staff.

1283
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,440
Like I'm I'm in this.

1284
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,440
I've had the life change.

1285
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,440
I've always been pretty good at getting people to like me.

1286
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,440
That's it. That's a skill in nightlife.

1287
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,440
You know, if you're building a list, I was a good host.

1288
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,440
I was I was always trying to make people feel comfortable inside the club.

1289
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,440
And who do you want to meet, Peter?

1290
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,440
Oh, no problem.

1291
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,440
Come with me.

1292
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,440
You know, hey, is everything OK?

1293
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,440
Is your drink OK?

1294
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,440
You know, I would know people's names.

1295
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,440
I was so I was turning on all the charm.

1296
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,440
Basically what I'm saying.

1297
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:09,440
So I'm up in Bremerhaven on the ship saying, I will be your best photojournalist that you've ever had.

1298
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,440
Oh, and by the way, guys, I also come with a built in list.

1299
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,440
I've got fifteen thousand emails.

1300
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,440
You know, I have a list of fifteen thousand people.

1301
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,440
I have been getting drunk for ten years.

1302
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,440
Fifteen thousand wealthy.

1303
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,440
Some of them were influential.

1304
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,440
I mean, Mick Jagger was on the list.

1305
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,440
President of Chanel, right, or people in fashion and publishing and entertainment.

1306
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,440
So they say, OK, they say, we'll take you.

1307
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,440
And I said, when does the mission start?

1308
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,440
Three weeks.

1309
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,440
You report for duty.

1310
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,440
So I go back.

1311
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,440
I remember going to the decathlon in France and buying flashlights and, you know, whatever

1312
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:47,440
I thought I would need for Africa because we were sailing into a country called Benin.

1313
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,440
And then shortly we'd be going to Liberia, which was a country I'd never heard of.

1314
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,440
Actually, I'd never heard of either of these countries, if I'm honest.

1315
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:59,440
But I'd learned that Liberia had just finished a brutal civil war that had lasted fourteen

1316
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:05,440
years and was led by the evil, evil dictator and warlord Charles Taylor, who had used children

1317
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,440
for a decade and a half to slaughter an extraordinary amount of people.

1318
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:13,440
So I report for duty actually on the island of Tenerife.

1319
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:19,440
So the ship was going from Germany to pick up people in Tenerife, an island off the coast

1320
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,440
of Africa, and then we would sail into West Africa.

1321
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,440
So I joined the ship a couple of weeks later in Tenerife.

1322
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,440
I get there first.

1323
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,440
I know that the ship is sailing in the next morning and I'm going to walk up the gangway.

1324
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,440
I'm going to surrender my passport and I'm going to officially join this mission.

1325
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,440
I mean, I'm going to have a boss.

1326
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:41,440
I'm going to effectively lose my independence because I've been self-employed for this

1327
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,440
time, I guess outside of the music store ten years previous.

1328
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:52,440
And, you know, I just was thinking about the ship and this idea of sailing, I guess it

1329
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:57,440
was five days to Africa, sailing away to a new continent that I'd never been on and sailing

1330
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,440
away into a new life.

1331
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:05,440
And I realized that the best way to do that would be to go all in and just try and quit

1332
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,440
everything in one go, to figure out how to quit gambling.

1333
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,440
Well, I mean, I imagine you didn't have a choice.

1334
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,440
You weren't going to be able to gamble, drink and smoke on it.

1335
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,440
I could smoke and drink.

1336
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,440
You know, I probably wasn't going to get illicit drugs.

1337
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,440
Well, I mean, I could always gamble online, which I used to do.

1338
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:25,440
I mean, I used to gamble on women's soccer games in Czechoslovakia that I couldn't even

1339
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:30,440
see televised just because I needed the rush of winning or losing.

1340
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,440
So I have this moment.

1341
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:37,440
I was staying at the Sheraton in, I think it was Santa Cruz, the town of Tenerife,

1342
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:43,440
and the night before, and I just sat in my hotel room alone and I drank seven or eight

1343
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:48,440
beers, Amstel Lights, smoked well over two packs of Marlboro Reds.

1344
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,440
And I'm like, this is it.

1345
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,440
I'm just going to go out with a bang.

1346
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:58,440
And I woke up the next day with a brutal hangover and I walked up the gangway of the ship.

1347
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:04,440
And it's funny in doing some of the interviews for the book, people actually remember me

1348
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,440
freaking of alcohol.

1349
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:12,440
Like, did this guy just come from a bar at 7.30 a.m.?

1350
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,440
And I actually didn't have the awareness of that.

1351
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,440
It was just so funny, you know, I'm sure they were saying, did we make a mistake?

1352
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,440
And that was it.

1353
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,440
Like, there was something about, you know, the gangway was going to come up and I was

1354
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,440
going to leave all of this stuff on land and sail away from it.

1355
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,440
And it was a clean break.

1356
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,440
So from that moment, this is now 14 years ago.

1357
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,440
I've never had another cigarette.

1358
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,440
I've never touched Coke or any of that stuff.

1359
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,440
I've never gambled again.

1360
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,440
I haven't looked in a pornographic image in 15 years.

1361
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,440
Like, I walked so far away from my former life.

1362
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,440
I drink a little bit.

1363
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,440
I like craft IPAs and, you know, red wine.

1364
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,440
What was the withdrawal like from the nicotine in particular?

1365
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,440
So hard.

1366
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,440
So hard.

1367
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,440
And I had failed attempts at smoking.

1368
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,440
I mean, there was, there was, I think, a certain grace of being around medical professionals,

1369
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,440
which probably made it feel like the new norm was not smoking.

1370
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,440
The new norm was being healthy and helping people.

1371
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,440
I used a bunch of the gum at the time and I think I used the patch.

1372
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,440
But I just did it.

1373
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,440
And there were, by the way, there were the engineers that would smoke.

1374
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,440
Yeah, I was going to say, I'm guessing there were, you could have got a cigarette.

1375
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:21,440
Sure, sure, sure.

1376
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,440
There was still a ship subculture of the people that worked in the engine room and they'd

1377
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,440
all be, you know, having a cigarette on the deck or there were authorized smoking places

1378
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,440
for them.

1379
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,440
But that was it for me.

1380
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,440
And that allowed me to, it really felt like a do over.

1381
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,440
It felt like 28 years, you know, I could close that book.

1382
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:44,440
And I was starting on page one of a new blank book.

1383
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:50,440
And I got to really create a completely new life and a new story for myself as a humanitarian,

1384
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,440
of all things.

1385
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,440
So what was that?

1386
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,440
What was that you're like?

1387
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:58,440
I mean, in terms of, did you develop relationships or friendships that where you could start

1388
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,440
to share the stuff that had been previously just completely an internal monologue?

1389
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,440
Yeah, it was an amazing place, Peter.

1390
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,440
And someone asked me recently during an interview, they said, look, so many people, you know,

1391
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,440
struggle with these addictions and they can't get out of it.

1392
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,440
What do you think it was that allowed you to walk so cleanly?

1393
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,440
I think the environment had a lot to do with it.

1394
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,440
I went from an environment where all that was the norm to an environment of like Christian

1395
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:28,120
doctors, you know, who were helping people get well, the best surgeons and nurses in

1396
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:32,840
the world that had given up their vacation time to use their skills in the service of

1397
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,840
others.

1398
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,160
So that really helps.

1399
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,560
And I love the new norm.

1400
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,760
Like I embraced the new norm.

1401
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,000
The new norm was healthy.

1402
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,720
It was up early.

1403
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,640
It was saving people's lives.

1404
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:49,520
I mean, it was in the most profound and visually evident way possible.

1405
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:55,400
So we specialized in max low facial surgery.

1406
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:01,120
So these doctors would look for people with tumors, with cleft lips, with cleft palates.

1407
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:05,160
We did a lot of cataracts and people who were completely blind and, you know, we could remove

1408
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,520
the cataracts and put it in the lenses.

1409
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
You had an OR on the actual ship.

1410
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
42 beds.

1411
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,520
Yep.

1412
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,520
Wow.

1413
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,520
There were three or four operating theaters.

1414
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:17,120
I remember when we sailed into Liberia, it was the only, we had the only CT scan in four

1415
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,480
neighboring countries.

1416
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,040
The only working CT scanner.

1417
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,960
What an amazing organization.

1418
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:27,080
So you had these and even better, the quality of the medical staff was so extraordinary

1419
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:33,760
because you'd have these doctors flying in from London or Berlin or New York or Los Angeles

1420
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,860
who would do, I don't know, three weeks, often three months.

1421
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,160
And they would just say, I can do this.

1422
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:43,880
You know, I could go to the Maldives and stay at the Four Seasons, or I could fly to Liberia

1423
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:49,840
and I could operate on 46 cleft patients and give 46 people their lives back.

1424
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:56,520
So it was, and my job, the amazing thing is that I have the best job on a ship of 350

1425
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,520
volunteers.

1426
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,360
I would say my job is better than the chief medical officer or the surgeons because I

1427
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:06,160
get to document all of the life-saving wonder that is happening.

1428
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:12,440
It is my job to photograph every single person that goes through the operating theater and

1429
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,000
document that transformation.

1430
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,100
So the way that we would find patients was in some ways not unlike how some club promoters

1431
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,600
would fill clubs.

1432
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,880
We flier the country.

1433
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,480
We made thousands of flyers.

1434
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:31,460
The flyers had the pictures of the facial tumors, the cleft lips, a lot of the burn reconstructions

1435
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:34,540
that we were doing and seeing after the war.

1436
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:39,440
Stuff like flesh-eating disease, canker morris, no, no, these really horrible diseases, which

1437
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,400
I later learned some of them were caused by water.

1438
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,840
And it was like a casting call.

1439
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,580
We'd say, if you look like one of the people in these pictures or if you know someone with

1440
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:51,760
these afflictions, turn up on this day and our doctors will see you and we'll triage

1441
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,760
you.

1442
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:57,200
So the profound moment for me was my third, and this happens quickly.

1443
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,000
So we sail in to port, I've been in, patient screening.

1444
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,680
The triage day is three days later.

1445
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:07,560
So everybody's prepping and I learned that the government has given us a football stadium,

1446
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:11,160
the soccer arena in the center of the city.

1447
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,880
And it was called Les Aldes Arts.

1448
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,240
And I know also that we have 1500 surgery slots to fill.

1449
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,120
So in a best case scenario, we are going to hand out 1500, hey, come on this day at this

1450
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:28,320
time and we'll run 1500 people through our surgery hospital over four months.

1451
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:32,280
And then we'll pick up and we'll sail to Liberia where we'll spend eight months in Liberia.

1452
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,560
So actually we'll spend a year.

1453
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,720
Third day there, I remembered very vividly.

1454
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,440
It was five in the morning.

1455
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,840
I couldn't sleep the night before.

1456
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,360
I was so excited to see who's going to turn up.

1457
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:49,360
I mean, is it possible that there's 1500 people in this country with these radical, crazy

1458
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,680
afflictions and conditions?

1459
01:25:52,680 --> 01:26:00,800
And I grabbed my two Nikon cameras, my wide angle lens, my portrait lens, all my batteries.

1460
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:05,560
And I put on hospital scrubs and I jump in this convoy of Land Rovers, maybe 20 Land

1461
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,200
Rovers, all heading towards the stadium.

1462
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:13,320
And as we turn the corner to actually see the stadium, I see the parking lot and there's

1463
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,840
5,000 people waiting to get in.

1464
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,400
In the early morning, 5,000 people have gathered in this mass.

1465
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,720
And it just hits me, look, we're going to turn thousands of people away.

1466
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,840
The need is so much greater than our response.

1467
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,840
We don't have enough doctors.

1468
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,840
We don't have enough money.

1469
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,200
Are there local doctors there that could be trained?

1470
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,200
They are.

1471
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:37,160
And that's something that the organization has done, but there aren't the medical facilities

1472
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,160
of the quant.

1473
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,960
So I'll give you an example in Liberia.

1474
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:46,000
Liberia has one doctor for every 50,000 of its citizens at the time.

1475
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,400
I believe our number here is one for 300.

1476
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,400
So for every 300 Americans, there's a doctor.

1477
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:59,120
For every 50,000 Liberians, there were two surgeons that we'd heard of in a country of

1478
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,880
a few million people, but nowhere to operate.

1479
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,040
So the surgeon, you know, even if you were a surgeon, like you'd have to operate out

1480
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:10,880
in the bush, there was no working medical facility or operating theater.

1481
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,960
So we had the best hospital going, you know, on our ship.

1482
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:21,160
So just, that was a really, really hard moment for me throughout that first triage day.

1483
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:27,280
I felt like I wept 40% of the day because the stuff that I saw, I just wasn't prepared

1484
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,400
for kids choking to death on four pound, benign, fleshy tumors.

1485
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,560
People with their faces completely rotting from disease.

1486
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,400
People who had been burned so badly by rebel soldiers often who had poured, you know, oil

1487
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,200
over their bodies or the bodies of their children.

1488
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:49,120
It was, I was in no way prepared to see it, like to smell rotting flesh and have to take

1489
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,920
a photo of someone six inches from their face.

1490
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,000
I mean, it felt like I was violating them, but these were the medical photos.

1491
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,320
These were the befores that hopefully would have amazing after story.

1492
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:03,520
So my first friend who I write about in the book was a little boy named Alfred and he

1493
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:11,200
was joking to death on his face with an amelio blastoma, big fleshy pink tumor that had just

1494
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,720
grown and grown and grown and grown over four years.

1495
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:19,240
And his mom had actually taken him to witch doctors and they had cut him with knives and

1496
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,240
with sharp stones.

1497
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:24,240
They'd put pastes and concoctions on the tumor.

1498
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,640
They had chanted to, you know, spirits and the tumor just keeps growing.

1499
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,800
That's what tumors do.

1500
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:36,560
How did you guys triage was the, if you only had 1500 slots for 5,000 people, was it based

1501
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,160
on medical need?

1502
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,720
Nurses were just rolling through the line.

1503
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,920
I will say some people came with conditions that we couldn't treat.

1504
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,280
Some people just came to see a doctor.

1505
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,480
They heard the doctors were coming.

1506
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,300
Some people came with broken feet.

1507
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:52,680
Some people came with terrible cancer that had metastasized all throughout their body.

1508
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,560
And we weren't able to help.

1509
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,800
There was a, I remember there were some boys that came with Burkett's lymphoma.

1510
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,000
We didn't have a good way to treat.

1511
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
You can't operate.

1512
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,880
You need medical treatment.

1513
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,480
We weren't in the business of chemotherapy.

1514
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,800
We were in the business of operating on the benign stuff.

1515
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:14,120
So poor Alfred is just this terrified little boy and I just determined that he's going

1516
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:18,280
to be my first friend and I'm going to see his story all the way through.

1517
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:22,360
And he's going to be the first story that I share with the 15,000 people from my former

1518
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:25,680
life of what we're really doing here.

1519
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:30,360
So thankfully for me, he was, I think he was first in line that day and he gets a surgery

1520
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,600
date three days later.

1521
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:37,720
So we just get to work, triage two days and then the next day surgery starts and people

1522
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:41,520
start turning up and the operating theaters are just scheduled out.

1523
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,960
And then the recovery ward had 42 beds.

1524
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,020
This is a proper hospital.

1525
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:52,500
So I'm there as Alfred walks up on the ship, his father, Besson brings him and I'm documenting

1526
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,500
his surgery.

1527
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,940
So I'm in the operating theater all the time.

1528
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:57,220
I just love, I love the blood.

1529
01:29:57,220 --> 01:30:02,940
I loved like just the visceral like change, seeing someone, seeing a surgeon open up someone's

1530
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,380
face and then fix it and then put it back together.

1531
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,220
I just, it was the most fascinating thing.

1532
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:14,100
So I probably documented 50 surgeries in scrubs with my cameras right there.

1533
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,180
They would allow me to get sterile and then just be there documenting it.

1534
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:23,140
So Alfred's was my first and they just take this giant tumor and they cut it out and they

1535
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:27,860
put in a titanium plate cause his jaw had been completely moved, blown out really by

1536
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:29,740
the tumor.

1537
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:34,780
And a couple of weeks later I got to take him home to his village and I'm falling behind

1538
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:40,180
him with my camera and he's in his best clothes and I'm watching the village surround this

1539
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:44,380
little boy that they thought was cursed, that they thought was written off for, for

1540
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:48,900
dead and they're looking at him and they're touching his face and you know, he's, he's

1541
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,780
like a celebrity in the village.

1542
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:56,460
And that was my first kind of all the way through, oh wow, we're going to be able to

1543
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,500
do that 1500 times.

1544
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,980
We're gonna, we're gonna so transform people's lives.

1545
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:05,820
When you write a book after two years, you see some of these little parallels, you know,

1546
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:11,100
as radical as my life change was, you know, from the dirty degenerate, you know, drug

1547
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:16,100
addict to, you know, now this like humanitarian photographer trying to tell stories of these

1548
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,300
incredible doctors and patients.

1549
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:24,740
You know, we were, I remember a woman soon after named Marguerite and she had gone blind

1550
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:29,260
in her twenties so she, she could see her whole life and then exposure to the equatorial

1551
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,460
sun with no UV.

1552
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:32,820
She had these huge cataracts.

1553
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,340
I mean, you could see them.

1554
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:39,460
They were giant opaque white cataracts.

1555
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,740
And so she'd gone completely blind.

1556
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:43,300
She couldn't see her family, couldn't see her kids.

1557
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:47,540
So I remember being in the operating theater as this, one of the surgeons, a guy named

1558
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:50,580
Glenn Price makes a little slit from what I remember.

1559
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:53,740
He like just sticks tweezers in and he pulls out the cataract and then he pops in the new

1560
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:54,740
lens.

1561
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,580
The thing took like 15 minutes, right?

1562
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,420
I remember thinking I could totally do that.

1563
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:01,900
Like you could train me to be a cataract surgeon right now.

1564
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:07,340
I mean, it just seems so simple, you know, scalpel, make the slit, pop it out, pop it

1565
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:10,060
in and then put a bandage on.

1566
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:14,100
And there's probably some surgeons now that are like, if there's way more to it than that.

1567
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:17,980
But it felt so simple as a, as a documentarian.

1568
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:21,780
Did this sort of rekindle that thing that you had when you were 13 and you wanted to

1569
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:25,820
go to Johns Hopkins and you wanted to become a doctor, did you now find yourself saying,

1570
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:29,860
wait a minute, I'm definitely, I don't want to go back to being a club promoter.

1571
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,860
I want to be a doctor.

1572
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:33,140
Well, I almost got to be a doctor.

1573
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:36,620
I was living vicariously through all the doctors all the time.

1574
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:42,340
You know, in a way I felt like I was a part of all these patient stories and the doctors

1575
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:43,500
would come and go.

1576
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,260
And I was the constant.

1577
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:50,220
This one woman made such an impression on me because I think it was actually, it might

1578
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:55,180
have been two days later, we were going to remove the bandages and you know, there's

1579
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,620
a little bit of healing that took place.

1580
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:02,700
So I just, I saw the moment that I wanted to capture because I'd met her blind, I'd

1581
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,180
interviewed her, I'd seen the surgery and documented that.

1582
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:12,140
So I go down there when they start taking off the bandages and I'm just snapping stills

1583
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:14,340
like click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

1584
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,340
And she starts screaming.

1585
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,540
Just the flash.

1586
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:24,180
She tackles me, dancing, screaming, you know, glory, glory, like tackles her sister that

1587
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:26,020
she can now see.

1588
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:28,620
And it was just this euphoric moment.

1589
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:34,140
I mean, there's, you know, going from being blind to being able to see.

1590
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,140
It's hard to imagine.

1591
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:36,140
It's hard to imagine.

1592
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,940
I can't imagine what that would be like.

1593
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:42,420
Like I can still, I can put myself in that tiny little room where it all happens.

1594
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:48,260
And I think, Peter, I wanted to share these stories with people in the same way that,

1595
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:51,220
you know, there was a period of time where I wanted to share a story that if you got

1596
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:55,700
past my velvet rope and spent thousands of dollars on booze and you were seen with the

1597
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:58,660
beautiful people or maybe you went home with the right beautiful people, then your life

1598
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,260
had meaning.

1599
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,900
This was real meaning.

1600
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,900
I mean, this was life transformation.

1601
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:09,580
This was real sacrifice and generosity by these doctors, by the donors that were paying for

1602
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,200
these surgeries.

1603
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,020
And I think I wanted to, I just wanted to share every story.

1604
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:19,420
So I just start blasting my club list with Alfred's story, with Marguerite's story, with

1605
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:24,980
the picture of the five or the 3000 people that we turned away when we closed the doors

1606
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,060
of the stadium and the triage was finished.

1607
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:30,460
And these people who are getting these emails, they don't know what's happened.

1608
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:34,340
The last thing they remember is Scott was our hookup and then Scott kind of vanished

1609
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:36,660
because I don't imagine you sent a retirement letter.

1610
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:37,660
I actually did.

1611
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,500
I sent a, I did send a retirement letter.

1612
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,220
I went back and saw it recently.

1613
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:43,660
It was, you know, it was a little high and mighty.

1614
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:48,980
Like I'm leaving nightclubs behind to go explore a humanitarian journey.

1615
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:54,140
You know, I mean, definitely some eye rolling now, looking back on an email, but I did announce

1616
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:57,740
what I was doing and I said, you know, you are all going to come along for the ride.

1617
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:02,460
I mean, I, I teased that you're going to come on the journey with me and what I see, you're

1618
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,820
going to see.

1619
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:10,180
So what they started seeing was giant fleshy tumors and some, you know, leprosy and just

1620
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,540
some crazy stuff.

1621
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,820
And you know, of course there's a few unsubscribes and people said, take me off this list.

1622
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:19,500
I enjoyed the Prada party that you threw once, but I'm not down with the tumor party

1623
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:23,620
or like don't need to see someone's face eaten by leprosy.

1624
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:27,300
But the response that I got from most people was this is amazing.

1625
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,020
I didn't know that this ship existed.

1626
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:34,220
I didn't know that there were doctors who cared so much that they would, they would

1627
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:35,700
even do this.

1628
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,100
How do I get on the ship?

1629
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,340
How do I give money?

1630
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:40,340
How much did the surgery cost?

1631
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:41,340
Oh, about $400.

1632
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:42,340
How do I send in $400?

1633
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:44,460
Well, here's how you do that.

1634
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:49,020
So I remember this one woman writes me and she says, it's the middle of the day.

1635
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:51,540
I'm sitting here at Chanel headquarters.

1636
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:55,620
I'm in a brightly lit office and tears are streaming down my face.

1637
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:58,900
I can't believe what I've just seen and what I've read.

1638
01:35:58,900 --> 01:35:59,900
I need to do something.

1639
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:02,380
I need to be a part of this.

1640
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:08,340
And so I have this immediate feedback loop that my stories are moving people.

1641
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,260
The photos, the images are moving people.

1642
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,420
I think what I learned there that it wasn't just the writing.

1643
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,060
It was actually the images I saw.

1644
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:20,980
I came across a quote this week that I love so much that I have never, I'd never heard

1645
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:27,100
of before until this week, but it's from Carl Jung and it says transformation can only take

1646
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:29,980
place in the presence of images.

1647
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:37,260
And I think there was something so arresting or disrupting about these photos, you know,

1648
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,460
just the extremity of a huge tumor.

1649
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:44,460
And then the tumor is gone of cataracts, like saucers that you can see.

1650
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:48,180
And then gone that really worked along with the stories that I was writing.

1651
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:51,780
If I just said, Hey, Alfred's this 14 year old boy and he's been suffocating on his face

1652
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,740
with a big pink fleshy tumor.

1653
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,740
There's one way to do it.

1654
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:00,460
But when you see it, when people saw it, it really, it moved them.

1655
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:04,060
So I do this for a year and I'm just telling story after story.

1656
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,460
My list actually starts to grow a little bit.

1657
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:11,500
The other thing I forgot to mention is that I had to pay $500 every month to volunteer.

1658
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:16,500
So this was, you talk about the, if the dream or the prayer was to create the opposite of

1659
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:23,240
my life, I actually wound up in the poorest country in the world paying money to volunteer.

1660
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:26,260
And this was how Mercy Ships helped support the organization.

1661
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:31,580
They got all the crew to raise their own support for room and board and, you know, for food.

1662
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:34,360
And that was a big income stream for them.

1663
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:37,480
So I'm basically going broke on the ship.

1664
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:41,120
Not only am I not earning an income, it costs me money to be there.

1665
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:45,320
And you're learning back to a point we had earlier, you're learning about what a really

1666
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:48,040
efficient nonprofit can do.

1667
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,040
Sort of pieces.

1668
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,160
Both on the positive and the negative side.

1669
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,160
Sure.

1670
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:58,320
I'm getting an inside look at a nonprofit and for sure the medical work was amazing

1671
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,320
and transformative.

1672
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:02,480
But I also got to look at a little bureaucracy.

1673
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:06,280
How a big charity might work in some of the blockers.

1674
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:12,160
And one of the amazing things for me was that my boss on the ship, he didn't know how to

1675
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,160
handle me.

1676
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:19,840
He didn't know how to handle this New York City crazy guns blazing 80 hour a week worker.

1677
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,320
So he just gave me an incredible amount of rope.

1678
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:28,040
I mean, I took over a photo office and I made that my own.

1679
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,960
And I was really like this lone ranger.

1680
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:34,080
He would initially assign me to take the photos and then someone else to write the

1681
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,080
story.

1682
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,120
I'm like, no, I'm doing it all myself.

1683
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,600
I have to be a one stop shop.

1684
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:41,680
And I think, gosh, that drove me.

1685
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:48,040
I think he just knew that I needed some element of autonomy to feel like I could own the whole

1686
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:51,480
experience and I worked around the clock.

1687
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,640
I mean, there was nothing else.

1688
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,640
There was no dating.

1689
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,440
There was no, it was just all work.

1690
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:58,760
When did the pangs start to go away?

1691
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:03,960
I'm sure at some point initially when you got on that ship, you were still missing the

1692
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:08,440
sex, the girlfriend, the booze, the drugs, the cigarettes.

1693
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:14,360
I mean, was there a day when you sort of woke up and realized like, actually, I'm happier

1694
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,240
now than I was back then.

1695
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,600
It felt almost instant.

1696
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,600
Wow.

1697
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,520
Because I was so busy in a different direction.

1698
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:27,400
Every single intention, every single task, every, you know, everything I was reading,

1699
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,520
it was the whole community, everything changed.

1700
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:37,240
You know, it's like I went from being on the Death Star to, I don't know, being around

1701
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,240
the people of light.

1702
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,080
Well, it's a very good point you brought up earlier.

1703
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:44,560
I used to have a slightly different way of explaining that to patients.

1704
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,880
When I was at Hopkins, we would see a lot of folks in the ER who were using IV drugs.

1705
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,760
So heroin was a pretty rampant in Baltimore at the time.

1706
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,280
It might still be actually.

1707
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:58,160
Whenever we'd get a patient in there, usually it was to debride an abscess or something

1708
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:02,520
like that, you sort of had to explain to them, look, you don't get an infinite number of

1709
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,880
shots on goal here.

1710
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,320
This is going to kill you really soon.

1711
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:06,600
You're going to get endocarditis.

1712
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,980
You're going to get an infection that's not going to be, it's going to kill you before

1713
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:12,040
we get to it.

1714
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:15,200
You can't just go back to where you came from.

1715
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,000
To kick a heroin habit, you need a new life.

1716
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,680
You need a new group of friends.

1717
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,280
You need a new place to live.

1718
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,400
It's a year later, do you come back to New York?

1719
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,680
I do come back to New York.

1720
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:31,760
That was probably the hardest part because then all the temptations are there.

1721
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,980
The old girlfriend was still around and hadn't moved on yet.

1722
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,080
The party was still there.

1723
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:45,440
I would say, look, I felt during ... When I come back, I put on an exhibition of my

1724
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,880
photos in order to raise money for Mercy Ships.

1725
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:49,880
I get a calendar.

1726
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,840
You're gainfully unemployed at this point.

1727
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,400
You're in the crowd.

1728
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:59,120
I'm crashing with my old club partner and kindness of strangers really at this point.

1729
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,440
Because nightclub promoters, okay, I can only speak for myself.

1730
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,720
I was not good at saving money.

1731
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:09,440
I was fantastic at spending a little more than I made every single year.

1732
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,440
I came back broke.

1733
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:14,240
I'd been giving all my money to Mercy Ships, the people that I met along the way.

1734
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,680
Many of these patients I'd wind up supporting afterwards.

1735
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:22,480
I mean, Alfred, I'm actually still supporting 15 years later because I've helped him become

1736
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,840
a plumber and it's been a joy to be able to do.

1737
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,160
I was definitely broke.

1738
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:33,240
I come back and I said, well, what can I do that would be useful?

1739
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,920
I could bring people into the story in a space.

1740
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,280
We got a gallery donated in Chelsea.

1741
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,280
It was a milky white gallery, so it felt like a hospital.

1742
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:47,720
I hung up these sheets and created different rooms, almost like operating theaters or the

1743
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:48,720
ward.

1744
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:54,640
Then I put 100, I think it was 108 images together, creating light boxes and TV installations

1745
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,840
of patients morphing back and forth.

1746
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,080
At the end of the gallery show, I asked people to donate the cost of one surgery, if they

1747
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,080
could.

1748
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,160
It was 380 bucks or whatever they could.

1749
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:10,400
My goal was to raise as much money for Mercy Ships as possible and then go back and follow

1750
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,560
the money.

1751
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:14,640
I actually come back to New York on a mission, which is great.

1752
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:15,800
The mission is continuing.

1753
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,240
It's just the venue has changed.

1754
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,520
The context has changed.

1755
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:24,040
I remember my friends thought that I wasn't as much fun.

1756
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,200
I'm not doing coke with them.

1757
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:30,920
I'm not staying out late, but I still was in the clubs trying to raise money and trying

1758
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:35,840
to get people to donate catering for the exhibition or donate printing.

1759
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,400
I'm still working the network.

1760
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,200
I guess I just felt like, look, there are going to be all these opportunities for me

1761
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,640
to slip back into my former life, especially now.

1762
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:50,160
There would be grace for that.

1763
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:51,680
What if I didn't?

1764
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,640
In some ways, the analogy of...

1765
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:58,920
I personally love this parable, the prodigal son from the New Testament, where the son

1766
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:06,000
basically flips everybody off, takes his inheritance, goes very, very far away and winds up gambling,

1767
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,640
drinking, sleeping with prostitutes.

1768
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,720
He winds up in a bad place at the end of himself.

1769
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,320
He says, I want to come home.

1770
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,680
He says, actually, that the servants in my father's house are living a better life than

1771
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,680
I am now.

1772
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,720
He comes home.

1773
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:27,240
What I love about that is the father in the story sees his son across a distance and runs

1774
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,520
out towards the son.

1775
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:33,880
In that culture, a man would actually never run and reveal his ankles in that way.

1776
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,920
It shows the passion.

1777
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:40,520
He throws his arms around his son.

1778
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,560
There's no admonishment.

1779
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,240
Imagine the lecture that's been 10 years in the making.

1780
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,640
Prostitutes, really?

1781
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:48,640
Drugs?

1782
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,960
Three packs of cigarettes?

1783
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:52,360
There was no lecture.

1784
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,640
He puts on a robe.

1785
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,400
I love that detail in the story.

1786
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:00,200
He gives his son one of the finest robes in the house, and then he throws him a party.

1787
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,200
I love that.

1788
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,200
He says, my son is home.

1789
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,360
My son who was lost has been found.

1790
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,360
Let's throw a party.

1791
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,200
I love the idea of the change of clothes.

1792
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:15,080
You got a sense of this kid who had just soiled his clothes far away, like with the pigs.

1793
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:18,320
In some ways, I felt like I had changed my clothes.

1794
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,080
I almost had on like, imagine if the robe was white.

1795
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,760
I didn't want to get it dirty.

1796
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,760
I could get it dirty.

1797
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,160
I could stain it.

1798
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,320
Then, I'd go to the dry cleaners.

1799
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,120
Maybe I couldn't get it all the way clean.

1800
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:35,240
I had gotten a new set of clothes, and why not keep them clean?

1801
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,520
I just kept coming back to that idea that what if I did keep them clean?

1802
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,360
How would the story continue to play out?

1803
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:47,240
What if I didn't get back in a relationship and start sleeping with my old girlfriend?

1804
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,320
What if I just stayed completely pure or clean?

1805
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:54,160
I was actually able to do that.

1806
01:44:54,160 --> 01:45:01,080
How did you decide to start your own charity, which is really the cherry on this story,

1807
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:07,400
which is it's one thing to realize that you can do amazing work for an organization that's

1808
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,400
already up and running.

1809
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:15,520
It's quite another thing to say, I'm actually going to take all that I've learned and create

1810
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,840
an organization to affect change.

1811
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,840
Sure.

1812
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:24,280
The next part of the story goes, I learned something because my exhibition is effective,

1813
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:27,040
and I raised about $100,000 for Mercy Ships.

1814
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,040
Wow.

1815
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,000
I tap into all my old relationships.

1816
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,840
PR companies are donating.

1817
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,240
Jeffrey Chowderal is donating the food.

1818
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:38,840
I just went Prada and Gucci are donating handbags that we auctioned off.

1819
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:43,400
We raise $100,000 through the gallery and through an event for the closing night.

1820
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,960
All that money goes to Mercy Ships.

1821
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,400
I then go back and follow the money.

1822
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:53,960
What I realized was that a lot of my friends were really skeptical when it came to charities.

1823
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,920
I could be this guide.

1824
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:01,600
They had trusted me, certainly not before, but through all of the communications and

1825
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,320
the photos and the stories, I was so prolific over that year.

1826
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:07,200
You felt like you were living in my head.

1827
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,760
If you were reading it and you were taking it in.

1828
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,080
I wrote, oh, maybe 50,000 words.

1829
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,680
I was just churning out content, like meet the patient of the day.

1830
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:17,680
She's amazing.

1831
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,640
I can tell you her story.

1832
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:25,000
I'd be going into these villages and staying overnight and documenting video snippets of

1833
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
the welcomeings.

1834
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,760
I think a lot of people felt like they were really along the journey.

1835
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,760
I raised the money.

1836
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:34,960
I'm like, okay, wow, I can actually raise money for the cause, not just be a passive

1837
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:35,960
documentarian.

1838
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,360
It's a very strange thing.

1839
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:40,480
Most photojournalists would only ... They would never get involved.

1840
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,480
You're just telling the story.

1841
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,480
I'm like, I'm going to get involved.

1842
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,920
I'm going to take pictures and I'm going to use those photos to raise money to affect

1843
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:48,400
change.

1844
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,800
I realized that I have a gift for that.

1845
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,840
Then I go back for another eight months to Liberia.

1846
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,440
This is year number two.

1847
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,440
Still volunteering.

1848
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,200
We're now until like middle to late 05.

1849
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,200
Yep, exactly.

1850
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,040
I come across the water crisis.

1851
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,560
Which you alluded to a little earlier.

1852
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,120
Some of the diseases.

1853
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,760
This time I got off the ship.

1854
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,600
Back in Liberia, most of my time had been ... The first time had been spent in Monrovia

1855
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,960
on the ward.

1856
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,400
Now I said, I want to understand a little more of the context of this country.

1857
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:24,280
I bought a motorcycle from a deckhand and that bought me some autonomy and some freedom.

1858
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,720
Again, my boss was great.

1859
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,600
He would let me stay in the bush.

1860
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,800
Overnight I would have to sign permission slips.

1861
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,960
I started exploring the country.

1862
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,800
Going up to the Guinea border and the Sierra Leone border, the more time I spend in these

1863
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:42,960
villages I see the water that people are drinking.

1864
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:50,160
It just never occurred to me that people would drink out of swamps or brown, viscous,

1865
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:52,000
muddy rivers.

1866
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:58,120
I learned that 50% of the people living in Liberia didn't have clean water to drink.

1867
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:03,480
Half the country was drinking contaminated, filthy water.

1868
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,520
I started taking pictures of it.

1869
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,960
Children drinking from swamps with algae and bugs.

1870
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,920
You could actually see fish and worms in some of these swamps.

1871
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,960
Little kids are just drinking straight from them.

1872
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,200
My mentor on the ship was a guy named Dr. Gary Parker.

1873
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,400
I just started sharing some of the images with him.

1874
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,000
Look at the pictures that I'm taking out there.

1875
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
You see what's going on out there?

1876
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
The war zone.

1877
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,680
It's a water war zone.

1878
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:36,680
The doctors and the surgeons that I show these photos to all just start saying, you're like,

1879
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:38,000
duh, kid.

1880
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,440
Water makes people sick.

1881
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:44,040
We know that so much of the disease that we're seeing is caused by unsafe water and lack

1882
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,720
of sanitation and hygiene.

1883
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:53,640
I get encouraged by the doctor that I most respected, this guy named Dr. Gary Parker,

1884
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:58,200
who had a personal back, sorry, if I pause for one second just to tell his.

1885
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:03,360
He was a California surgeon that had signed up for three months, just like many.

1886
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:08,040
When I walked up the gangway of the ship for the first time, he'd been there 21 years.

1887
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,040
He became a lifer.

1888
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:10,880
He just never went back to his practice.

1889
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:17,360
Another real piece, I now have a guide mentor that kind of like me, I'm going to tie the

1890
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:22,200
one of the 10 years, but he never went back to his former life.

1891
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:23,720
What might that look like for me?

1892
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:25,600
He encourages me.

1893
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:28,800
He says, well, you seem pretty passionate about this water thing.

1894
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:35,160
If you really wanted to bring health to the world, if you really cared about impacting

1895
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:40,240
the health of millions or the time of billion people, you would make sure everybody had

1896
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,520
clean water. And that would be a great issue.

1897
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,520
You want to play doctor to the world.

1898
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:49,600
Don't help raise money for another 60 million dollar hospital ship that can do a few

1899
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,280
thousand very effective surgeries.

1900
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,280
Go get go make sure everybody in this country has clean water.

1901
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:56,280
Maybe we wouldn't even need to pull into port here.

1902
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,160
So I start thinking about this.

1903
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:03,440
And at the time, I actually wanted to continue working for Mercy ships.

1904
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:08,320
So I'm thinking about water and what I might do on my own that I finished the second

1905
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:11,160
year and I try and work for them.

1906
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:16,680
Like, hey, what if I did my exhibition model all around the world, Berlin and Prague and

1907
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,440
in Paris and in London?

1908
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:20,600
And, you know, let's raise huge awareness.

1909
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,000
Let's make your organization and your doctors famous.

1910
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,560
Let's raise millions of dollars.

1911
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,840
And they basically said, no, thanks, which I don't blame them.

1912
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:34,040
I mean, this was a very conservative organization based out of a dry town in Texas,

1913
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,120
Lindale, Texas.

1914
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:40,680
And some New York club promoter wants huge budgets to fly around the world, putting on

1915
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:46,480
huge exhibitions of tumors and light boxes and the stuff, the ideas I had were just

1916
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:50,960
crazy. So the door closes and they say, thanks, but no, thanks.

1917
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,240
You know, you've really helped us.

1918
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:55,760
It's amazing. I think I helped them get 20 or 30 media items.

1919
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,560
You know, I got my photos published in the Wall Street Journal and the Independent in

1920
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,960
London. So I thought I brought a lot of awareness and money to them.

1921
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:06,680
But that door shut and I said, all right, well, I'm not going back to my former life.

1922
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:13,400
Two years in. What if I just take everything I've learned and start the water thing?

1923
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,480
Let me go work on water.

1924
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:20,560
And what would it look like if I dedicated 20, 30, maybe the rest of my life to helping

1925
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,720
people get clean drinking water?

1926
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:22,960
What kind of impact could I make?

1927
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,520
So I just started and that was I had my issue.

1928
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,320
Like, let me try it.

1929
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:28,880
People need clean water.

1930
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:35,480
So I was living at that time on a walk-in closet floor on Spring and Mercer in Soho, New

1931
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,880
York. My club partner had taken me in.

1932
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:42,360
It was an unideal situation because he was doing heroin at the time with his friends.

1933
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,440
But it was the only place I had to live and it was free.

1934
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:49,080
And he says, well, you know, you can use my living room and my couch as your office.

1935
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:54,040
And I did have, you know, a spare bedroom and then the closet floor when I got bounced from

1936
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,160
the little bedroom in the back.

1937
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:00,040
And I was on a mission here like from from day one.

1938
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:02,120
I'm like, I'm going to be the clean water fighter.

1939
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,440
I'm going to fight for clean water.

1940
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:09,000
And therefore I'm going to be potentially the most effective doctor that the world has

1941
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,520
ever seen. If I could get millions, tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of

1942
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,800
people, the most basic need for health.

1943
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:21,120
And I'd be working right alongside Mercy Ships and eliminating the need for, you know, a

1944
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:23,160
lot of those conditions that we were treating.

1945
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:26,480
So how did you get smart on this topic?

1946
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:31,760
Like there's it's one thing to take sort of what I would call the first order observation,

1947
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,760
which is these people are drinking a bunch of dirty water.

1948
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,960
Dirty water is making them sick.

1949
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,840
That's bad. But then there's like the second, third, fourth order insights that are

1950
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:42,640
necessary, which is like, what's the root cause of this?

1951
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,520
What are the non-linear implications of this?

1952
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,560
How do you actually fix this problem in the most leveraged way, in the most scalable way?

1953
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:54,120
Like, I mean, obviously today, you know the answer to all of those things, but that's an

1954
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:59,400
overwhelming task for some guy sitting in a closet in Soho to figure out.

1955
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:02,440
Thankfully, it didn't feel like that at the time.

1956
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:08,640
I started flying around meeting with water organizations, started reading everything I

1957
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,960
could on the global water crisis.

1958
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:14,240
Then I started traveling around to Africa and to India.

1959
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,760
I'm you don't have any money.

1960
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:25,960
So I I file for a 501 C3 and I'm raising money then on the idea that our organization is.

1961
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:31,000
So this is sort of like you're taking Angel's VC early dollars on your charity.

1962
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,720
You got it. It wasn't even tax deductible.

1963
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:37,320
And a lot of those early dollars were buying me a eight hundred and seventy two dollar coach

1964
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:41,960
flight to Ethiopia, where it was very inexpensive to run around for two weeks.

1965
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:47,280
And often I'd be hosted by the local partner who's covering room and board and food.

1966
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:53,120
So I'm both trying to fundraise for my organization, which has a very clear mission.

1967
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,160
We're going to bring clean drinking water to everybody on the planet.

1968
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,760
OK, we're going to figure out how to do this as we go along.

1969
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,840
But we are getting clean drinking water to everybody in need.

1970
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:09,800
I have a huge observation at this time and I realize that this isn't going to be easy

1971
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:15,000
because the lack of trust that I had sniffed out a little bit during that first exhibition

1972
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,720
when my club friends were coming in and giving surgery money to Mercy ships, it was real.

1973
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,160
Meaning the lack of trust amongst the donors.

1974
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:23,360
Yeah, the donor.

1975
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:27,800
The donor faith that you're actually doing what you say you're doing, or at least you're

1976
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,040
doing it reasonably well.

1977
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,200
People didn't trust charities.

1978
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:33,400
I would hear stories of I don't know where my money goes.

1979
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,280
Charities are big black holes that eat money.

1980
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,240
You would hear stories of high overheads.

1981
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,840
I don't know the impact.

1982
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:44,080
You know, charity CEOs probably paying themselves millions of dollars.

1983
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,960
I mean, everybody seemed to have a scandal that they could readily pull out of their

1984
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:51,880
back pocket to say, this is why I don't trust, you know, the big philanthropy, the big

1985
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,400
charities. And I actually found data behind that.

1986
01:54:55,440 --> 01:55:00,920
So USA Today had polled Americans and found 42 percent of people said they didn't trust

1987
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:05,800
charities. And this is this is probably actually shocking to some people that are listening

1988
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:10,000
because who is more generous or philanthropic than Americans?

1989
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:15,280
We have this heritage, this cultural reputation of being some of those generous people on

1990
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,440
Earth, if not the most generous.

1991
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:20,960
Certainly my research when I was in the business of fundraising was that not only were

1992
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:24,800
Americans the most generous, but New Yorkers were the most generous amongst all Americans.

1993
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,560
People always ask me, why am I in New York now?

1994
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:31,680
And I say in many ways, they could trace it back to my days of fundraising.

1995
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,400
There's a Willie Sutton quote, right?

1996
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,280
Why do you rob banks?

1997
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,200
That's where the money is.

1998
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:37,480
Why do you raise money in New York?

1999
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:38,840
Because that's not just where the money is.

2000
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:41,680
It's where the people are who are the most generous.

2001
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:48,680
And I I remember being really surprised by that, but also felt like, you know, New Yorkers

2002
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,320
really get a bad rap sometimes.

2003
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:54,840
People sort of think of all these sort of wealthy people in New York or even, you know,

2004
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:59,160
whatever. Just the average person in New York is sort of a hard person and, you know, sort

2005
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,480
of fast living and blah, blah, blah.

2006
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:06,360
But in many ways, I again, I don't want to take knocks at people, but I just would have

2007
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:09,920
expected at the outset that other parts of the country would have been much more generous.

2008
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:14,200
And I was constantly amazed at the generosity of New Yorkers.

2009
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:20,080
Well, there you go. So I and that's where we started really from that closet floor and

2010
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:23,800
from the couch of the drug den and so you know, not ideal conditions, I guess.

2011
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:30,400
But so to combat that cynicism or that skepticism, I'd come across a guy called

2012
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,800
Paul Tudor Jones, who was a hedge fund billionaire and he'd started the Robin Hood

2013
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:35,840
actually co-founded Robin Hood.

2014
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:41,960
Yep. Robin Hood Foundation. And, you know, in what I understood from his story, he also

2015
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,320
realized that donors didn't trust charities. And he said, cool, tell you what, I'm rich

2016
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:50,600
enough. I'll pay for all the overhead of the charity so that 100 percent of anything you

2017
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:56,560
give to my charity goes directly to the programs, which was education in the inner city.

2018
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,440
And to this day, the entire board of Robin Hood does just that.

2019
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:03,520
So now it's him and his board. It's gotten too much probably for him. But, you know,

2020
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:05,840
initially you can imagine the idea of that impulse. I'll fund it.

2021
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:11,040
OK, now what's your excuse? What was your next excuse of why you wouldn't give to help the

2022
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,640
poor here in New York City if you knew that all your money was going?

2023
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:17,520
So I write him a letter. He doesn't write me back. And I guess why would he?

2024
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:25,480
But I wondered, it just felt so clean, so extreme, so elegant. Two bank accounts.

2025
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:29,920
What if I open up two bank accounts and I promised the public that all of the money

2026
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,880
they would ever give to charity water? I wasn't very creative in the beginning.

2027
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,560
The charity that helps people get water. Charity water.

2028
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:43,640
What if all the money that they give goes directly to fund water projects that directly

2029
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:47,800
help people get clean water? And in bank account number two, somehow I'm going to figure

2030
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:52,440
out how to raise all the overhead separately. No idea at the beginning, but I love the model.

2031
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:58,960
Two bank accounts audited separately and this this public promise that whether someone gave a

2032
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:02,560
dollar or a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars or a million dollars, it would all reach the

2033
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,480
100 percent programmatic. 100 percent.

2034
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:10,560
So can I interject one thing on my high horse here? I applaud you for doing that, but I also

2035
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:14,640
want a listener to understand something. Overhead is not a dirty term.

2036
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:17,320
Absolutely not. And there's a great TED Talk.

2037
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:20,760
Damn it. A lot of unshareable. That's right. And I believe everything you say.

2038
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:27,600
Yeah. And after two things, one, his talk really impacted me, which is probably five, six years ago.

2039
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:33,760
And then my own experience of realizing the same thing you did, that what my wife and I have decided

2040
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,160
going forward, we support only 100 percent overhead.

2041
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:44,560
So every dollar we give, we give directly to salary supportive people we believe in doing

2042
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:50,280
charity. And we do that because we know it's much easier to raise money on the programmatic side.

2043
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,640
It's much easier to say, give me a thousand bucks to go and build a well.

2044
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:58,240
But my interest is, well, who's paying Scott salary?

2045
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:00,320
Because I'd much rather pay Scott salary.

2046
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:05,920
We do the same thing. You know, we maybe seven years ago, my wife and I just decided, hey, we're going to write on the

2047
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,840
check, you know, 100 percent overhead.

2048
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:13,080
Yes. Use this for the, you know, or even use it for what nobody else wants to pay for.

2049
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:19,560
That's what we say. We'll write a note and say, you know, I mean, go fix the roof of the building, go pay the phone bill, go take

2050
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:23,240
the extra trip home from the orphanage to go with your family around the holidays.

2051
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,320
Right. Don't have the orphan.

2052
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:26,760
Write me letters.

2053
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:30,840
That's the easy thing. You're going to go get somebody else who doesn't trust to do that.

2054
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:33,760
Yeah. So OK, so I'm totally with you.

2055
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,000
And I know Dan Plata and really like what he's saying.

2056
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:39,000
However, it's been an uphill battle.

2057
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:41,440
He's been preaching that message for 10 years.

2058
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:45,120
And the data hasn't showed that it's moving people.

2059
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:47,880
So I was like, I'm going to fight a different battle.

2060
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:49,520
I'm going to go and raise all the overhead separately.

2061
01:59:49,520 --> 02:00:01,400
I'm going to go find Peter and his wife, a different set of donor, a builder, an innovator, you know, who actually gets or could get excited about the salaries, the office.

2062
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:09,120
You know, in many ways what it comes down to, in my opinion, which you've already figured out is you have to find people who believe in you versus the mission.

2063
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:11,080
And those are two slightly different things.

2064
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:12,440
They can often go hand in hand.

2065
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:22,920
But in the end of the day, when I think about the sort of salary support that we provide to people, it's because like, yeah, I believe in that individual and I trust that individual.

2066
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:28,440
And all I want is their life to be easier because indirectly, what you realize is their life is easier.

2067
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:29,480
They're doing better work.

2068
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:34,600
And what I think is elegant about the way you've done it is you've literally separated the financial stream.

2069
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,800
And they get audited separately.

2070
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,680
Yeah, that is different numbers.

2071
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:38,560
That is so brilliant.

2072
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:39,200
It's not fungible.

2073
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,520
No, that is so brilliant.

2074
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:46,520
And we took it a step farther than Robin Hood because I just I love like black and white before and after.

2075
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:49,280
Like I just I don't do well with gray.

2076
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:52,760
So I said, well, if we're going to be out there, that is the theme of your life, Scott.

2077
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:53,520
You do not.

2078
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:59,240
Despite the fact that you're sitting there in a gray sweatshirt right now, you do not do well in gray.

2079
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:00,440
So you'll like this.

2080
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:07,000
I say, well, I can't be up there talking about 100 percent unless we also pay back all the credit card fees.

2081
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,800
So from day one and to this day, if you went online right now, you pulled out your American Express and you go to charity, what?

2082
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,720
I don't know. You give 100 bucks.

2083
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:17,440
And it's three percent of you got it.

2084
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,120
So I get ninety seven.

2085
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,440
But what did you give?

2086
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,640
I have a hundred.

2087
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:22,680
So what do you expect?

2088
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:23,960
A hundred dollars to go to the field.

2089
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:28,680
So in the other bank accounts and I can talk about how we do that later and all the trials and that.

2090
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:31,960
But we actually pay back that three dollars and we send your hundred dollars.

2091
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:33,640
You're intended hundred dollars to the field.

2092
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:35,360
So that was pillar number one.

2093
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:46,640
Pillar number two was then when you have two bank accounts, I just realized, OK, we've just created a non fungible, non black hole scenario.

2094
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:52,600
So why can't we use technology to track these dollars as they go out and just show people where they landed?

2095
02:01:52,600 --> 02:02:00,720
So if we were going to build a well in Malawi, you know, we could say your money went here or to Bangladesh or to India or to Cambodia or to Bolivia.

2096
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:07,560
And, you know, I looked into meeting the Google Earth founder when I was starting Charity Water.

2097
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:10,960
I met him at a conference and they were building Google Earth and Google Maps.

2098
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:19,680
And I just realized I was going to be able from day one to geolocate every water project using their free platform.

2099
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:24,040
And all it was going to cost me was 50 dollar handheld GPS devices.

2100
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:25,600
I think they were Garmin devices at the time.

2101
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:27,440
You could go buy a Best Buy.

2102
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:38,600
And we would be able to fund a water project that helped people get clean water, turn on a GPS device, take a picture of the GPS, take a picture of the project and then upload it and say, this is proof.

2103
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:42,120
You'd be able to see a satellite image of your well.

2104
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:50,000
So if 100 percent was the first pillar, proof then became the second pillar and proof would look very different in many different ways.

2105
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,680
We would have hopefully myriad ways of being creative and connecting people to what their money did.

2106
02:02:55,680 --> 02:03:06,320
The third thing that I wanted to do differently was I wanted to I wanted the brand to feel unlike any other charity that I'd ever encountered.

2107
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:13,080
I wanted to build an epic brand, a beautiful brand and an imaginative, inspiring brand.

2108
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:18,360
And when I saw most charities, I saw marketing that I didn't want any part of.

2109
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:22,960
I saw shame and guilt and almost toxic marketing.

2110
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:35,720
And you may remember the commercials from the 80s and the 90s with Sally Struthers and the flies that land on the kids faces in slow motion as they look up and lock their sad eyes with the camera.

2111
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:42,520
And then the 800 number slowly creeps across the screen and you give and you give out of the.

2112
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:49,360
You give out of like shame often or guilt for feeling that you're in your comfortable living room and these kids in Africa flies crawling on their face.

2113
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,760
Dude, that is so amazing that you brought that image up.

2114
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:54,080
Like I remember the commercial you're talking about.

2115
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:58,920
I would have I would have never pulled that out of my recesses of my brain.

2116
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:02,360
Had you not mentioned that that's literally thirty five, forty years ago.

2117
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:05,560
I just went and watched them recently to make sure that they were as bad as I remember.

2118
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:18,840
And they're worse. So to me, the vestiges of shame and guilt and even the the language, by the way, this this is still pervasive today, the language giving back.

2119
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:27,720
This is unhelpful. If I snatch the mic from in front of you, you know, you'd say, give it back as if I've taken it from you.

2120
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:34,160
And the language implies we have, you know, we've pillaged and plundered to such extent.

2121
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:37,400
We should probably throw a few scraps back to the poor.

2122
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:40,280
Let's give a little back that we've taken.

2123
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:46,920
And it implies giving out of debt or obligation, all unhealthy things without.

2124
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:57,160
And I come across a quote by Nick Kristoff in The New York Times, and he said, toothpaste is being peddled with far more sophistication than all the world's lifesaving causes.

2125
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:04,880
Charity brands suck. Doritos will spend hundreds of millions of dollars cleverly marketing stuff that kills us and our children.

2126
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:12,840
But the most important lifesaving humanitarian efforts often have an anemic brands where they guilt and shame people into giving to them.

2127
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,720
And by the way, this comes back in some way to the overhead problem.

2128
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:24,800
And this is sort of one of the challenges in the nonprofit world that I think is really toxic, which is we have this belief that we shouldn't be able to pay people in a nonprofit.

2129
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:29,240
Talent should be free. People should be willing to work for under market.

2130
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:37,480
The reason Doritos can sell Doritos like you can't imagine, the reason they can push these things on you is not just because, well, they taste great.

2131
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:44,280
It's because they can afford the best talent to figure out how to test all of these different things.

2132
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:54,440
And I think a lot of nonprofits haven't really figured out that there is a bit of a war for talent and nonprofits are generally losing it in a big age demographic.

2133
02:05:54,440 --> 02:06:02,840
And my experience, nonprofits can do a really good job getting really young people fresh out of college who want some experience before going to grad school.

2134
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:12,200
And they can do a pretty good job getting really talented sort of gray beards that are at the end of their careers and looking to quote unquote give back with respect to time.

2135
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:24,440
But it's pretty tough to get an ultra talented 40 year old to go into a nonprofit when the alternative for many people, even those who are mission driven, is to go and serve a mission in a for profit setting versus a not for profit setting.

2136
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:29,000
Absolutely. And that that is a real challenge even to this day.

2137
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:36,120
You know, give you an example that we had posted a job for receptionist at Charity Water recently and 1300 people applied.

2138
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:43,480
So that's great. Young. It's a really young talent pool. But you're right. The executive hires have been having much harder.

2139
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:49,560
People like their charity people poor. And Dan has been fighting this for a long time.

2140
02:06:49,560 --> 02:07:01,880
You know, I joke all the time that even now, you know, I'm 43 years old, I've got a wife, I've got kids, I could drive a $60,000 Toyota and not a $20,000 Mercedes because of the perception.

2141
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:07,080
Forget about the cost of the car. Right. People are totally happy with me in a, you know, what's the big the Toyota Highlander, right?

2142
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:15,480
I got to like load that thing up. I could probably have a $70,000 Toyota SUV or a GMC, but not a $24,000 BMW.

2143
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:20,920
Oh, he's reaching. That's why we were even talking about the watch. I mean, I'm not wearing a watch today. All this stuff matters.

2144
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:27,240
You know, the perception becomes reality. So, okay, let me go back just to that bit. So the brand, so our brand would feel different.

2145
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:34,120
It would be imagined if it inspired to be hope based. The last analogy I just want to make, I think Nike is such a great analogy.

2146
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:44,200
If Nike were a bad old charity, their marketing might go like this. Hey, Peter, you're fat and you're lazy.

2147
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:53,240
Turn off the TV, put away the junk food. Why don't you go for a run? Why don't you exercise? Now, instead of just doing it.

2148
02:07:53,240 --> 02:08:02,040
Oh, and buy our stuff. Yeah. Yeah. No. So Nike for years has been telling inspirational stories of people overcoming adversity, overcoming impossible odds.

2149
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:07,320
Right. Nike believes that if you've lost your legs, you can complete a marathon and get over the finish line.

2150
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:13,640
You know, you, you lost your arm. You can still be a shot putter. Right. I mean, they, they kind of for years have said,

2151
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:28,520
we believe there's greatness within you. Right. And then you want to buy the shoes and then you want that symbol next to your heart that says, you know, just do it because the company believes that about you in their marketing.

2152
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:39,480
So charities, you know, don't do that. So we wanted ours to be like, we believe you have a mind blowing capacity for compassion, for empathy.

2153
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:54,440
We believe your capacity to be deeply generous and to extend your arm across an ocean and help people. You don't have to help. You don't have a debt or an obligation to help, but you can end the suffering because you choose to.

2154
02:08:54,440 --> 02:09:03,720
And you'll be blessed in the process. And, you know, you might even find yourself redeemed in the process of moving from selfishness and accumulation to helping others.

2155
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:14,840
So there was, there was a lot of soft stuff. I mean, now I have language to it years later, but I just, I want to charity wanted to feel very different. I wanted to feel like Apple or Virgin and have a personality and have a brand.

2156
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:24,280
And then the fourth pillar was, I was not going to send anybody that looked like some white guy from New York city to Africa to go drill a well or to India or to Southeast Asia.

2157
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:32,600
I believed in my travels, just what I'd seen in Benin and Liberia and then Uganda and Kenya as I traveled around looking for water partners.

2158
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:38,760
I just believe that for the work to be sustainable and culturally appropriate, it had to be led by the locals.

2159
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:50,840
So our job would be to find the local organizations who could go and build these water projects. Our job would be to scale them, maybe buy them more drilling rigs or trucks or help them hire the hydrologist they need.

2160
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:58,120
But they would be the ones getting the credit. I just, I love that idea that our role could be let's raise awareness for this important issue.

2161
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:08,840
Let's build a movement of people who say we can and will bring clean drinking water to everybody on the planet. Let's raise money as efficiently as possible and as transparently as possible.

2162
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:14,680
And then let's have all the work be done by the locals, leading their communities and their countries forward.

2163
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:24,600
Yeah. And the irony of that is when you understand these problems, as you do, you realize that is the better solution. That's the sustainable solution.

2164
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:34,280
Of course, on the flip side of that, it potentially deprives someone of the experience that you were so fortunate to have, which is your volunteers.

2165
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:37,080
I assume you don't have that same body of volunteers.

2166
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:41,400
People ask me all the time, can I go drill a well in Africa? Now, I didn't drill a well.

2167
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:48,680
So I wasn't the doctor working in the rural area or the well drill. I was the documentarian. I was the storyteller.

2168
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:58,280
So when I do take donors and I've taken about 350 people, including 50 kids over the last 12 years, they are there to learn.

2169
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:03,080
They're there to listen and then come back and become advocates, not to drill a well.

2170
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:09,880
I just don't need them in the ground. I don't need them standing on the drilling rig, pretending like they're doing something that the local does that anyway.

2171
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:11,720
That's a liability, potentially.

2172
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:17,320
Exactly. So yeah, we are not a good volunteer organization if you want to go and get your hands dirty.

2173
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:23,960
So it's funny when I say this stuff, like give away 100% and just build a hyper transparent money flow,

2174
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:31,240
prove to people what you do with their money and show impact, build an inspiring hopeful brand, and then work through locals.

2175
02:11:31,240 --> 02:11:39,960
It all sounds like common sense. I mean, you know, but this was so unique 12 years ago that we exploded.

2176
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:46,200
I mean, people were throwing money at us. You know, I think we were $2 million in our first year from that couch.

2177
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:53,320
I mean, it was just it was just working. And there was a flurry of activity. We were shooting public service announcements.

2178
02:11:53,320 --> 02:12:00,840
We were convincing luxury retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue to give us their windows for a week and get their employees involved and their vendors involved

2179
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:08,680
and their customers involved. We were doing outdoor exhibitions showing putting dirty water from the East River and the Hudson River and ponds

2180
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:15,720
in these big plexi tanks and getting people to sponsor these exhibitions and getting MTV set builders to donate it with their time.

2181
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:21,720
And it was just it was startup. What could we do to get people to care about this issue, to know about it and then raise money?

2182
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:29,800
You know, Scott, I know we both decided before we got on this this doing this interview that we sort of had to stop at a certain point in time,

2183
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:35,960
which I know we've now gone past. There's so many more questions I want to ask you about Charity Water for the listener.

2184
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:44,200
Let's wrap this thing up in the following way. If somebody wants to learn all of these details about Charity Water, besides going to Charity Water.org,

2185
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:49,720
are there other talks that you've given that we can be linking to other places where they can learn?

2186
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:57,720
Obviously, you've got a book that just came out. Yeah. Yeah. And there's so many amazing stories of the 100 percent model definitely came under trial.

2187
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:07,080
And there were moments of almost insolvency. And the organizations now raise $330 million from over a million people around the world.

2188
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:16,520
And there are so many stories of heroism and courage from the community and failure. And yeah, so there's I think that's that's one place to start.

2189
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:21,480
There certainly are some talks online that we could we could link to. All right. So we're going to make sure we have lots of links.

2190
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:25,640
You've given a TED talk as well. Not specifically a TED, but similar.

2191
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:33,080
Oh, OK. I thought was it TEDx or no, wasn't it? I might do TEDx this year. Yeah. Well, you should be giving a TED talk. That's for sure.

2192
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:41,160
So we'll link to that. So your book is called Thirsty. Thirst. Thirst. Yep. A little double entendre there, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2193
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:49,800
And all the proceeds, all my proceeds go to the organization. So I won't make a penny off it. And I was telling you, I just found out yesterday it's a New York Times best seller in the first week.

2194
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:56,320
So that's cool. Fantastic. Congratulations. My wife was planning on that money to go towards our kids college funds.

2195
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:15,080
But like, oh, this is this is not the right thing to keep. And I want this book to go out and really spread the story and hopefully inspire, inspire a lot of people, maybe to start their own causes, maybe to join us, maybe to give them the courage and the inspiration that no matter what they have done in their past, they're probably not as bad as me.

2196
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:40,480
Where can people find you on social media? I'm just my name, Scott Harrison and Charity Water. Any books that you recommend when you talk about your journey, not just maybe what you went through, you know, 15 years ago, but even today, like what you give me three books that have been not necessarily transformative, but but have have moved the needle for you in some way in terms of how you've thought about either what you're doing today or how you got here.

2197
02:14:40,480 --> 02:15:09,280
There's an interesting book on the subject of poverty and approach called White Mans Burton guy named Bill Easterly at NYU that kind of talks about approaches to aid, you know, and good aid and bad aid. And that's, that's one of the beauties of doing clean water is nobody tells you to stop. I mean, no one is saying that taking a human being from a swamp or a dirty river, you know, to providing a sustainable source of clean water is, is harmful in any way. But that's, that was a really good read for me.

2198
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:30,680
You know, on a personal level, when I got on the ship, I was reading this tiny little book written by a monk called practicing the presence of God, which was just this kind of idea of surrendering yourself to others and trying to live a pure and virtuous life. This guy lives a very simple life. He was cutting carrots in the kitchen and was just talking about really a life of virtue.

2199
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:59,880
You know, with kids now, there's a book I really love the name escapes me right now. I just I'm on my second time around. I think it's letters to a God son by this guy, Stanley where of us and he talks about he writes a letter to his God son every single year teaching him a different virtue. So I'm trying to build character about teaching about kindness, teaching about generosity, teaching about integrity. And it's a really, it's really beautiful thing as a father, as I just think about

2200
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:03,280
it's a book more for us as the parents.

2201
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:14,880
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But just thinking about how he conveys this and you know, knowing that the child will age into these letters. This is called letters to a God son.

2202
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:28,280
Scott, you're one of the people that I think even I remember by the time we got to the airplane, you know, that on that drive back that day, which again, it was like a 30 minute drive of which we wasted seven minutes talking about watches.

2203
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:44,380
I remember thinking, my God, this this is not a normal dude and dialogues a pretty impressive crowd of people. I mean, by definition, everybody had dialogues kind of cool, kind of interesting has done, you know, they're not just selecting the smartest or the richest or the most whatever.

2204
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:57,580
They're trying to select people. They're trying to curate people who are really, really interesting. And so even after three days of being around those people, I remember thinking this guy stands out. You're a real inspiration. So thank you for what you're doing.

2205
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:03,680
Thanks for having me. Time time flow. Oh, my gosh. We didn't even we didn't talk about probably half the stuff we wanted to.

2206
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:15,080
I it's funny because I read most of your book before we spoke and it was like I remember thinking, yeah, we're never going to get through all this. So but look, I want people to read the book too. So we got to we got to leave some stuff out.

2207
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:17,580
Thanks for coming by. Thanks for having me.
