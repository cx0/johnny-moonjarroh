00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:17,160
Alex, thanks so much for making time today to sit down and be part of our inaugural video podcast

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,400
here. This is, I hope it's not a long run for a short slide. So far it's been a long run,

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,080
but I have a feeling it's going to be a long slide too.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,600
Well, thanks for having me on Peter. I really appreciate it. And yeah, this is going to be fun.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,040
So about two years ago, was it two years ago? Yeah, it would have been. It would have been

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,440
like February of 19. I read your book Endure, which I literally couldn't put down. I think

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:49,960
I read it in two days. And I was just, I mean, it was, it was fantastic. And since that time,

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,160
I've become such a huge fan. You're a very prolific writer. I don't know how you do it.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,160
If you just go to sort of, you know, search your name and go through all the magazine articles,

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,240
you're right. It's just a wonder you can do so much. There are so many things I want to talk

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,720
about today. But I want to kind of start with just a bit of your background because you know,

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,360
you don't have a typical background, right? You have a PhD in physics.

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,320
Yeah, yeah. Probably the least useful PhD in physics anyone has ever, ever attained. But yeah,

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,840
no, I come from a different place in some ways, I would say.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,360
You're a collegiate runner and we actually have some friends in common because I think we're of

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,160
the same generation. Remind me, did you go to, did you go to Waterloo? Did you go to Guelph?

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,880
Where did you go to? I went to McGill for undergrad and then grad school in England.

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,760
Okay. But yeah, we come from the same, same part of the world. It's a, it's a, it's a small pool.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,840
So I think we've interacted with a few of the same people.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,800
Yeah. And I think some of my friends probably ran cross country against you and, you know,

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,760
ran track and stuff like that. So for how long was track sort of your passion?

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,240
I would say it was the most important thing in my life until I was 28. At that point,

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,240
and until that point I was still, I would have put anything and everything aside if it meant,

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,560
like, you know, I mean, I'm embarrassed to say it now. I made my brother reschedule his wedding

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,160
for, for a track meet. After 28, I kept training seriously until my early thirties. I still run

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,920
six days a week, train, race, all that. But yeah, 28 was, it was, until then it was the most

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,360
important thing in my life. And when did that start? What age were you? Was this like sixth

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,960
grade? You know, I mean, how serious were you in grade school? Yeah. I mean, I like to say,

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,040
I did win a race in senior kindergarten. I beat Stephen Mills, who's a nice kid, but a big kid.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,680
And I was like, wow, I beat the big kid. So I've always been the guy who liked to run around. Then

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,040
I ran elementary school cross country, which involved showing up for a race once a year. And

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,720
I did well in that. I started, I joined a track club when I was 15, the University of Toronto

34
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,640
track club with the idea that I would train for three months because I was in a lucky position

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,640
because my birthday was after September 1st. So I could compete with the people a year younger

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,600
than myself. And I thought, well, let's, you know, let's use leverage every edge I've got. I'll train

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,120
hard for these three months, see if I can stomp on these grade nines. And it worked. I ran well,

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,240
and I kind of got hooked and realized that I wasn't going to quit after three months.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,800
Where did you go to high school in Toronto? I went to a school called University of Toronto

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,480
Schools, which is a very, very small school. It's academically focused. From an athletic

41
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,160
perspective, the really nice thing is if you want to be on a team, you're on the team. Like it's,

42
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,200
the qualifying process for school teams was going right through the hallways and basically like

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,080
press gangs trying to get enough people for a team. So when you went to college, obviously

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,560
McGill is a great academic school in Canada. They don't have athletic scholarships. Was it a

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,320
difficult decision to say, Hey, I'm going to stay in Canada for university or try to go to a US

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,840
school where I could sort of parlay some of my running talents to actually get some money for

47
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,240
school. Yeah, there's a couple of factors that played into that. One is that I got mononucleosis

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,320
in my last year of high school. I missed basically my entire final year of high school.

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,480
So I was a very, very good grade 11 runner. And then back then in Ontario, there were 13 grades,

50
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,480
but the high school I went to only went up to grade 12 basically. So I graduated from high

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,280
school without ever having competed as a senior in high school. So I wasn't good enough to,

52
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,680
that's a long rambling way of saying I wasn't good enough to get a scholarship to any reasonable

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,240
place in the United States. So that discussion wasn't even really open to me. Whether I would

54
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,600
have, it's an alternative scenario that I would have been attracted by the idea for sure,

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,280
but that door wasn't open to me anyway. And when you showed up at McGill, what was sort of your

56
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,120
specialty? I know you were a miler. How competitive were you at the 800? How competitive were you at

57
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,280
5K and other distances away from the mile? I was a 1500 meter runner when I showed up and with the

58
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,480
assumption that I would be moving up to 5,000 any minute now, that I didn't have a lot of sprint

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,080
speed. I was a strength oriented 1500 meter runner. As it turns out, the coach at McGill was an X400

60
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:14,040
meter, 400, 800 guy. And his training was very sprint oriented. It was long recoveries and

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,720
all out intervals. And so I actually ran better at 800 than I expected I would, but it was pretty

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,360
clear that 1500 was kind of the low end of my sweet spot. I had so many friends who ran,

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,320
and many of them said that the 800 was the most painful race there was. And I guess in swimming,

64
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,600
that's comparable to the 200. And I think there's something to be said for that, that sub two minute

65
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,000
all out effort is really an unpleasant physiologic existence, which we're going to talk a lot about

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,760
that physiology. But would you agree with that having run so many distances?

67
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,360
A hundred percent, a hundred percent. The most painful race that I could run was the 800. And

68
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,560
I also think about this in the context of workouts, specifically at McGill talking about more sprint

69
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,920
oriented workouts, longer rest, these sort of hard two minute efforts. If I wanted an easy workout,

70
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,120
the intuition would be like, oh, you want to ask your coach for more recovery or whatever. And it

71
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,760
was the opposite for me. It's like, if the workout seemed too hard, can we cut the rest in half?

72
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,160
Because then I know we're not going to be in that very high lactate regime, which is, you know,

73
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,040
a two minute all out effort is the single way to get the highest possible lactate levels. And so

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,200
and to me, that's synonymous with extreme suffering. I'd rather run a marathon than an

75
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,960
800 in some ways. Yes. I found when I used to tweak around with lactate levels, I found that

76
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:50,200
my personal best best as the highest lactate was doing a 200 I am in swimming. So 200, 200 individual

77
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,400
medley, because it's upper and lower body with all four strokes. It's that 200. So, you know,

78
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,480
two minutes of unbearable pain you could get your your personal best lactate could be achieved with

79
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,240
that. Personal worst call it. And yeah, I think that's something a lot of people don't. There's

80
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,680
a there's an assumption that the longer equals harder. And it's like, man, no, there's a whole

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,520
different world of pain that you can get into in the if you're willing to push yourself hard in

82
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,760
those those two minute efforts, two to ten minute efforts. Now, in your book, Endure, you talk about

83
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,640
a very interesting almost a throwaway meat, you know, we would call these dual meats and swimming,

84
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:35,080
right? And it was sort of, again, I don't know if this was the turning point for you, but but it's

85
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,280
sort of as you read it, it comes across as a moment when you first realize there's more to this than

86
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,400
just the numbers, like there's something going on in my head that is changing the speed that I run

87
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,440
in. Was that I mean, I want to hear the story. I want people to hear the story. But was that a big

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:00,040
aha moment for you? Or was that just the first of many steps along a pathway? I'd say it was a huge

89
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:07,000
aha moment for me at the at that time. But I'm not sure I understood what the aha was. I knew that

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,560
there's like, this is strange. And in hindsight, I realized that this is what was that I'm sure

91
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,960
we'll dig into this. But it was, you know, this this started my movement away from just like,

92
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,600
we can calculate everything from physiology that that endurance is a little more complicated than

93
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,360
the equations that you might start with. Well, tell the story because it's, I mean, again, you

94
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,200
write about it so eloquently, but it's, it's kind of hard to believe, especially as someone who I'm

95
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,520
not a runner, and I'm not, you know, I'm not good at anything. But I still understand physiology

96
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,520
quite well. And as the story is unfolding, you're thinking there's a mistake. So so yeah, walk us

97
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,480
through that night. So yeah, as you said, totally meanings meaningless meat. Didn't have any big

98
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,960
goals. But I was at that point, this was third year university. And for about four years, almost

99
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,640
three and a half years, I'd been running between 401, 402, 403 for 1500 meters, 1500 meters is

100
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,920
about 17 seconds shorter than a mile. So we're talking like, as it's kind of like the poor man's

101
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,360
four minute mile, it's a significant barrier for runners, but it's not at the level of a four minute

102
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,560
mile. And so for me, it was like, that was kind of a career goal. I wanted to break four minutes,

103
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,800
if I could get into the threes, I felt like, okay, I could, I would have achieved something

104
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,400
significant. And but like I said, ever since high school, I'd been running very close, couldn't quite

105
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,880
do it. And at this meaningless meet, there was no competition whatsoever, it was going to be, I was

106
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,520
going to win the race no matter what. And it's sort of at the last minute, I said, well, I might as

107
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,200
well go hard and just see what I can do. And it's unlikely to do anything special in this context,

108
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,320
but I'll go hard. And indoor track is 200 meters long. So you get splits every about 30 seconds.

109
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,160
And I came through the first lap, and the timekeeper called out 27 seconds for 200 meters,

110
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,160
which is, it's about five seconds faster than four minute pace, which is an eternity, an absolute

111
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,160
eternity. 27 seconds is extremely fast. And it's a terrible way to start a 1500 meters race,

112
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,160
if you're trying to run sub four minutes. And so I had conflicting motions of like, oh, God,

113
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,600
you idiot with, oh, I actually feel surprisingly relaxed, but I need to dial it back. Because

114
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,640
presumably, Alex, you'd run 27s in practice as splits, and you know what 27 feels like. And so

115
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,640
on some level, you're thinking, I feel really good, because this doesn't feel as fast as 27, right?

116
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,640
Yeah. So you absolutely have a, you're dialed into what 27 should feel like. But you, and this is

117
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,720
maybe an early clue, that you also know that nothing feels the same in a race, that there's

118
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,520
some magic that happens in a race, and something that should have felt impossible will feel relaxed.

119
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,160
And so you can kind of dismiss those discrepancies and say, well, this is the magic of the race. We

120
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,280
don't know where it comes from, but it's the magic. And same thing in the second lap, I came through

121
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:13,640
in 57 seconds, which is way too fast, but I still felt relatively like, good. And third lap, 127.

122
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,160
And so at that point, the two things were happening. One is that I realized I was having a

123
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,400
really good day. And two, I realized that the splits were no longer meaningful to me,

124
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,080
because you memorize the splits for the races you think you're going to run. At that point,

125
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,720
I didn't know what 127 extrapolated to. And so the best decision I maybe made in my racing life

126
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,680
was like, stop listening to the splits. This is a special day. Run, put your head down and go for

127
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:47,960
it. So I did stop listening to the splits and I hammered home and I ran 352, which was nine seconds

128
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,360
faster than my personal best at the time. And again, you really have to emphasize that a one

129
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,960
second personal best would have been a huge victory for me. And you know, you don't know

130
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,040
what he PBs by nine seconds after they've been training hard for four years, five years. So

131
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,160
it was just absolutely mind boggling. And you know, to cut to the chase, the postscript of the story is

132
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,960
chatting to one of my teammates afterwards who had taken my splits for me so that I could,

133
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,000
as you do, you put them in your training log and you plot them in Lotus one, two, three,

134
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,360
and you analyze them obsessively for months. So I wanted to get my splits and he's like,

135
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,440
yeah, pretty good race. And I was like, yeah, I can't believe I went out in 27 seconds. He's

136
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,040
like, he didn't go out in 27 seconds. You were like 30 seconds. What second lap, 60 seconds. What?

137
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,360
So at the time, my theory was that this was a meat in Quebec in Sherbrooke. And so it was like,

138
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,280
oh, the guy was maybe translating from French to English. And there was a three second lag.

139
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,040
Maybe he just missed the start with his watch. I don't know what happened, but he basically

140
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:56,040
tricked me. He fooled me into thinking I was having this amazing day. And then I did. And so

141
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:03,800
that was what, and in itself, that was like a very bizarre circumstance. And then the question

142
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,680
is what happens after that? Do I become a four minute runner again? Or can I run 352 again?

143
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,520
And the answer is neither. I ran 349 in my next 1500 and I ran 344 in the race after that,

144
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,080
which qualified me for the Olympic trials that summer. So that's why I say you asked,

145
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,160
was this an aha moment? And it's like, I knew right at the time, it's like something has changed.

146
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,640
And somehow, so I knew it changed my career as an athlete. But then in hindsight, I realized it

147
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,800
also changed my understanding of what this whole endeavor was about and what we were trying to

148
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:40,280
optimize. Yeah, that's I mean, I still I still sort of struggle with that. And of course, you want to

149
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,880
extrapolate that does the same thing apply to strength sports? Well, presumably it does,

150
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,520
right? Could you easily trick somebody into thinking, you know, someone who thinks, oh,

151
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,920
I could just never break 500 pounds for a deadlift and they're sort of forever stuck at

152
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
four hundred ninety five pounds. But is there anything really preventing them from deadlifting

153
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,120
550 pounds, which would be as much of a breakthrough if they simply believe that that's how much weight

154
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,160
was if they simply believed that it was only four hundred seventy five pounds on the bar.

155
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,120
So I should add a postscript here is that the book came out my old coach from high school who I've

156
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,760
you know, I continue to stay in touch with. He's a very big influence in my life.

157
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,760
He read the book and he's like, show me your training log, like which lots of people have said,

158
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,120
right? Like, come on, this wasn't all in your head. And I was like, OK, here's my training

159
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,200
log. You remember it. Check it out. You tell me, was I ready to run three fifty two?

160
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,920
Because there wasn't a big discontinuity in my training. It wasn't like I knew I was fitter.

161
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,800
I knew I should be able to break four minutes. But there wasn't like I suddenly

162
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,760
was doing workouts way faster. And he looked through it. And his conclusion was, you know,

163
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,480
Alex, you were in shape to run mid three fifties for sure. You were not in shape to run. You were

164
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,040
not doing workouts that predicted three forty four. So in a way, the first breakthrough might have

165
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,800
been a lot in some ways, just catching up to the ways I was holding myself back the way, you know,

166
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,840
I was I was overthinking things, stressing out all these things that people do in in competitive

167
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,480
scenarios. I caught up to what I should be doing. And then that gave me so much confidence that I

168
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,400
kind of slingshotted right past where I should have been. And I was able to, you know, there's

169
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,680
always a conversion between what are you doing in in workouts versus what can you do in races?

170
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,720
Everyone should be able to do more in a competitive scenario than they can do on a rainy Tuesday night

171
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:28,040
in Stoke or whatever. And I think the best conversions I ever had, the time when I was

172
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,200
competing the farthest above my sort of baseline workout fitness was in the months after that

173
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,520
breakthrough because I was just riding that high. And I believed I was, you know, semi invincible.

174
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,080
And then this is ninety six, right? Yeah. So you go to the Olympic trials for the fifteen hundred.

175
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,960
How did you run there? It's on YouTube. It's the worst. It's horrible. I came.

176
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,440
I can't remember if it was dead last or eleventh in the final. I made the final, which was OK.

177
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,720
And, you know, when I look back to it, you can see me on I'm on the standing line next to Graham

178
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Hood, who's the Canadian record holder at the time. And so the camera lingers on Graham Hood.

179
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,720
So you can see me the whole time. And I just look I think I might have written this book.

180
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,200
I can't remember. But it looks like I'm like waking up from a dream and looking around and,

181
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,520
you know, in my pajamas or something like that. I just you know, I don't belong. I'm there.

182
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,240
You know, I don't believe I belong there. A year later, I came back to to the national

183
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,640
championships. And by that time, I'd had a year to consolidate. No, I belong. I'm a guy who runs

184
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,400
in the low three forties. And that time I ran. Well, I ran. I ran. I came forth. That was probably

185
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:43,240
my that was my best finish at outdoor nationals. And it was it just took a while for my confidence

186
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,440
to fully catch up to me, I think that was so that there was. Yeah, that was how that played out.

187
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,920
And did you end up running the actual mile, the like the 1604 or whatever that the sort of the

188
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,680
non-metric mile? Because you would have by that point broken the four minute mile, right?

189
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,280
If you're poking your finger into a raw wound. Oh, God, I'm sorry.

190
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,880
If you take my best fifteen hundred and you put it plug it into the official conversions tables,

191
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,680
it suggests that I would have run four flat point zero one. I I I deprecate those that entirely. I

192
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,440
don't believe it at all. I'm confident that on that day I'll go to my grave saying I would have

193
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,280
run three fifty nine point nine that day. But in terms of miles, you know, the thing is there aren't

194
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,320
the miles just not very frequently run. I ran two competitive miles in my career, one, an indoor

195
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:36,200
mile indoor like early season when I was in college. And then about four years later, so

196
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,920
ninety seven, I ran my best. I was that I got a knee injury was out ninety eight, ninety nine,

197
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,040
two thousand two thousand one. I was trying to come back and it was a slow process. And I ran

198
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,920
a mile in Oregon at Hayward Field, which is the sort of most famous place. It's a good place to

199
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,000
go sub four, but I did not. I ran like four or six. I just wasn't back to my to my champion.

200
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,120
Those are the only two miles I ran in my career. You also and I regret it. It's a big thing like

201
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,520
four minute miles. It's a very big thing. How many people have broken four minutes for the mile?

202
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Roughly in history. It's a good question. I'm going to say I think it's a few thousand. It's

203
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,000
it's fewer than more people have stood on top of Everest. I think is the thing that people tend to

204
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,400
say. I think that's still true. I think there's something like eight hundred or nine hundred

205
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,480
Americans and globally two to four thousand. I could I could be wrong, but that's my my gut

206
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,440
gut memory. So by the time you're you know, into the mid to late 90s, you're now a PhD student,

207
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm guessing. Did you go straight into the program? I went straight there and I did a PhD in Britain

208
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,480
where PhDs are it's kind of a PhD light. There are it's not as rigorous as a full North American PhD.

209
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,720
I mean, it's it's hard in many ways, but it's it's different. So I did a three year PhD

210
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,080
from ninety seven to two thousand. And what what was the issue we're scratching there?

211
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,320
Were you a PhD student in undergrad? I'm sorry, were you were a physics student in undergrad?

212
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,640
Yeah. Yeah. So I studied at McGill. You have to choose pretty early. And so I declared from I did

213
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,640
pretty much all physics in second, third and fourth year. Not necessarily. I mean, I enjoyed it.

214
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,320
But this was one of those things for me that I didn't know what I wanted to do. And one of the

215
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,000
pieces of advice I got coming out of high school is if you don't know, want to don't know what you

216
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,680
want to do, do the hardest thing possible, because you can study physics and then become a journalist,

217
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,120
but you cannot study journalism and then become a physicist or, you know, in it's there. There's a

218
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,720
gradient and you can't you can you can only slide in one direction. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So

219
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,920
that, you know, and the memory that I have, I have a brother who's who's five years older than me.

220
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,080
So he was finishing university when I was finishing high school and I had actually applied in

221
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,680
I think I applied to McGill in history initially, but my brother had a friend who was finishing up

222
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,720
in physics at McGill. And she she told him that in her class, there'd been like 60 guys and five,

223
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,320
60 men and five women starting the program. And they graduated four men and four women. I thought,

224
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,520
that sounds hard. I'm switching my my major to physics. So that that's kind of how that started.

225
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,160
And then coming out of undergrad, I really just didn't know what I wanted to do. I applied to a

226
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,040
bunch of things, again, in a variety of fields. But because I'd studied physics and undergrad,

227
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,520
the best opportunity I got was to go and do a PhD in physics. And I thought it would be a

228
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,760
reasonable way of allowing me to continue my running career. And it would be a chance to go

229
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,200
overseas and see a new culture and have fun. And, and, you know, and I was, I was certainly

230
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,560
willing to give physics a shot. I was considering physics as a career, but my decision was, was

231
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,200
framed in a way that even if I left physics, which I did end up in, in the end doing,

232
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,480
I had zero regrets about spending three years in England, studying physics.

233
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,520
How did your training change when you went to England versus

234
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,440
Canada? What were the, what were the sort of most, what were the biggest changes you experienced?

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,480
Yeah, that's actually a really interesting question, because there's some huge culture

236
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,960
changes in terms of the actual, like how much do you run and stuff? Not as big a deal, but

237
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,160
you get to Cambridge and I, you know, I show up for that first meeting with the team and I meet

238
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,440
the, the, the training secretary and I'm like, what do you mean training secretary? Well,

239
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,360
he's the guy who's going to set our workouts. Like, what do you mean? What about, we don't have

240
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:19,400
a coach? It's like, no, the, the student, the, the athletic scene there is student run. So there's,

241
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,320
there's a kind of a continuum in, in many things between the U S at one extreme,

242
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,120
Britain and the, at the other extreme in Canada is often in the middle. And so sports in the U S

243
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,280
collegiate sports are a big, big deal as, you know, as you know, and, um, sports are not collegiate

244
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,560
sports or a medium deal in Canada and they're not a big deal in, in the UK. And so going there was,

245
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,560
you know, an eye and open opener in many ways. It's like, we're going to the national

246
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,320
championships. So we have to hire, you know, we have to rent a van and then arrange a youth

247
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,640
hostel where we can sleep the night before the championships. Like that's not how collegiate

248
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,160
sports work in the U S it's not even how they work in Canada, but the, the, the flip side is you,

249
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,640
you have a lot of autonomy and you take responsibility for your training and your

250
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:12,520
success. You, you're not, uh, a sort of acolyte or, or baby just being sort of fed what to do from,

251
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,120
from day to day. And so I, you know, I don't have a systematic study to, to support this,

252
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,640
but I think the, the retention in terms of the lifelong retention, the people, the way,

253
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,040
the extent to which people develop lifelong habits and lifelong love of sport and activity

254
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,440
and competition, I think is much higher because you learn to be autonomous in university as

255
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,320
opposed to the classic thing in the U S is you're there for four years, you're representing your,

256
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,600
your, your college and then college ends and it's like, all right, I'm going to go work a job. And,

257
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:48,280
and there's no feeling that you haven't, there's no encouragement to stay involved in, in sport

258
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,960
and you haven't developed the skills required to self motivate, self organize, you know, book that

259
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,120
youth hostel or whatever the case may be. So, um, that was the, that was the biggest change I'd say.

260
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,800
So as you're wrapping up your, your PhD in physics, um, you have to make another decision,

261
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,400
right? Which is, am I going to go back to the U S or Canada, do a post-doc and then get on

262
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,160
presumably an academic track? Um, do I want to take this and move into industry where I can

263
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,000
utilize this? Cause obviously at the time there was probably no shortage of things that PhD in

264
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,200
physics could have been doing in Silicon Valley or wall street, right? Both would have been the

265
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,560
hay days. Um, what, you know, or do something altogether different. So how did you, how did

266
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,160
you approach that decision? Yeah. So, I mean, you're right. This was, you know, making these

267
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,720
decisions in 99 and early 2000, and my PhD was in semiconductor physics. It was, you know, it was a

268
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,160
good time to be in semiconductor physics. And, and there was also, there's definitely the pull of

269
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,960
both consulting and finance, which is, you know, just the same way that it happens with Ivy league,

270
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,240
students in the States in Britain. If you're at Oxbridge, they're, they're lining up to,

271
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,560
to offer you vast sums of money. Um, like I said at the top, running was the most important thing

272
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:05,560
in my life until I was 28. So, uh, I considered some job offers, um, but I wanted to focus on

273
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:12,040
running and I was very, very fortunate to, uh, I have parents who, who, who had a house, they were

274
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,840
willing to have me move back in and see what happened. So I spent, and at this point I was

275
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,680
coming back from this three year injury process. I was, so I had been on a trajectory that I thought

276
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:29,400
was pointing, you know, favorably by in 98, but then by 2000, when I was finished my PhD early 2001,

277
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,040
um, I'd been out for a few years and it wasn't clear. And I just wanted to give myself one year

278
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,040
to see if I could get back on that track of someone who might have a shot of making the Olympics.

279
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,600
So I moved back home. I did some tutoring of high school students, but basically I, uh, I ran and I

280
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,560
went to the library and I checked out, they had, they had a couple racks of, uh, world classics.

281
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,280
So I basically went through their entire rack of classic books, you know, 19th century literature,

282
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,920
20th century literature, all the stuff that I didn't get to do as a physics student as,

283
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,920
you know, as an undergrad, this is not a, this was not a liberal arts program where I had,

284
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,760
had time to pursue a bunch of things. It was all physics and math. So I spent a year

285
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,280
running. It was fun. I qualified for some national teams. I read a lot of books and I did a lot of

286
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,160
thinking about what I wanted to do. And after a year, I hadn't made the progress running wise

287
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,720
that could justify like, well, that could pay for an apartment, for example. So I was like,

288
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,480
yeah, okay, I'm 25 now it's it's or 24, whatever it was. Um, I need to do something else. And I,

289
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,800
so at that point I ended up applying for some postdocs and I ended up taking one

290
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,880
at the university of Maryland, uh, sponsored by the national security agency.

291
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,080
In quantum computing. And, uh, you know, again, it was sort of a hedge bets. It was like, I'll,

292
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,640
I'll take this and because the research sounds really interesting and the people are fun and

293
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,120
it may lead to a physics career, but it sounds fun enough. And the one thing about academic life is

294
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,520
if you're, if you choose, you can make other things like running your priority. And so I, I,

295
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,920
I went and I trained with a very, very good training group led by a guy named Matt Centrowitt senior

296
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,720
whose, whose son went on to win the Olympic gold medal in the 1500 in 2016. And, uh, so I spent

297
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,320
two and a half years there in physics, kind of giving physics and a shot, but also be as a way of,

298
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,000
you know, as much as I say running was the most important thing in my life until I was 28,

299
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,720
it was never the only thing in my life. And I also always wanted to be continuing to develop

300
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,400
in other ways and sort of, um, making sure that my CV wasn't going to be too empty, uh,

301
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,640
at the inevitable point when I, when I had to move on. So, so yeah. So I took a postdoc at that

302
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,680
point and went back into physics. And then when you get to the end of that period of time,

303
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,200
presumably is that when you pivoted to journalism as the next step? And if so, I mean, how in the

304
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,040
world did you gain the confidence to do that? Because, um, that's, I mean, we've, we've

305
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,800
established that the gradient generally points in one direction and physics might be harder than

306
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,080
journalism, but I don't know that that's necessarily true at the individual level. Right.

307
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,640
And yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't impress anybody that you can, you know, solve the

308
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,200
Navy or Stokes equation if you, if you're, if your job is to write an article. Um, so it's,

309
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,560
it's always hard to kind of write history in retrospect because you, you see the patterns

310
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,720
that you didn't see at the time. And so I'm never sure how accurately can I can explain

311
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,560
why I decided to do this. But there were a couple of things I did have, uh, the starting of an

312
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,120
interest in journalism. I hadn't pursued it earlier. I wasn't like doing student newspapers in college

313
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,920
or anything, but I liked the idea of writing and I'd actually, this is one thing that marks me as

314
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,000
unusual. I think as I had enjoyed writing up my PhD, everyone else was like, Oh, I love doing

315
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,920
experiments, but I hate writing it up. I was like, man, those experiments were hard, but it's kind of

316
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:51,240
fun trying to explain why I was doing what I was doing, which is very hard to explain. Uh, so I

317
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,640
kind of thought I might like writing and I'd written a couple of it's, it's a stretch to call

318
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,960
them freelance pieces because they're basically like I'd written a back of the magazine piece for

319
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,360
physics world. And I'd written a piece for athletics magazine, which is a track magazine in

320
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,680
Canada. And then I apply. And so I thought I'd like to give journalism a shot. So I applied for

321
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:15,160
a bunch of internships. And as you were saying, um, you know, it actually doesn't work as clearly

322
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,720
as you might think. I didn't get any of these internships. And I thought, okay, this is my,

323
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,520
my hopes of trying journalism or stalling. How am I getting, you know, do I need to sit up late at

324
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,280
night and write articles and prove that I can do it? And I ended up kind of deciding that it was a

325
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,680
credentialing issue and both a credentialing issue and an urgency issue. I needed to jump into the

326
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,360
deep end and force myself to survive as a journalist and also have some way of showing people that I

327
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,000
wasn't just a dilettante, even though I was at the time, but I needed to show them that I was serious

328
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,600
about journalism that, that, that I had decided to do it. And then I was going to learn the basic

329
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:57,160
skills. So from while I was in, while I was doing my postdoc, I applied to a few different

330
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:04,040
journalism schools for, for master's programs. And, uh, uh, that was helped along by the fact

331
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,960
that this was 2004 by this time. And, uh, I was, uh, it was gonna, I was timing it in such a way

332
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,280
that it's like, well, I'm going to give one last shot to make the Olympics. And if it doesn't,

333
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,840
Olympic trials are ended July. I'll start journalism school, uh, right after that. But

334
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,440
what ended up happening is I got a stress fracture in my lower back three months before

335
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,440
the Olympic trials. Um, which meant I was out for 10 weeks and then I did about two weeks of jogging

336
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,720
and then went to the Olympic trials and just sort of as a farewell to running. Um, but that made it

337
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,320
easier because I knew that at that point my Olympic dreams were over, were officially over,

338
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,720
you know, some might say they were, they were over before they even started. But, um, so the,

339
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,560
you know, I'd been deciding that I didn't want to continue on with physics and I was considering

340
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:53,320
journalism and then the end of running marked a natural transition for me, or at least the end of

341
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,880
that part of that, my, my track career, um, left something that I wanted something else to be

342
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,800
passionate about to be, um, to, to sort of pour that part of myself into. And I guess the one other

343
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:13,640
story I'll, I'll relate is that I actually remember at some point that year we were working long hours

344
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,480
in the lab, you know, sometimes it was 12, 14 hours in the lab and I would leave to do my runs

345
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,160
or whatever. And I remember coming into the lab one morning, you know, after we'd been there late,

346
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,480
we'd all been there late the night before. And one of the guys asking me like, Oh, did you see that

347
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,200
story in physics today about, you know, whatever? I was like, no, no, I was in the lab for 16 hours,

348
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,800
you know, 14 hours or whatever it was yesterday. I went home. I did not think about physics. I had

349
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,240
zero interest in reading about physics when I got home and I kind of realized, Oh, wait, that's what

350
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,400
some of these other guys do. They love it. It's their passion. And then that's great,

351
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:54,680
but it's not mine. And so I needed to find something that, uh, or I wanted to find something

352
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,800
that, that, that I wanted to keep doing where the, you know, where the work and the play

353
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,640
overlapped a little bit. And I, you know, I thought about things like music that I care about a lot

354
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,600
and about running that I obviously care about a lot. And I thought, what is the possible way

355
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:15,560
that I can have a chance of maybe pursuing some of these interests of mine in a professional way.

356
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,800
And journalism seemed that that's what I think what pointed me to journalism is that it wouldn't

357
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,640
be easy, but there may be a chance that I could end up writing about running or travel or music

358
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,640
or something like that. Now, at this point, Alex, you've obviously got tons of athletic

359
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,800
experience as a runner. Your background in physics means you're, there's nothing quantitatively you

360
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,920
can't understand. Had you at this point delved into the physiology of running or was that not

361
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,280
yet something you had really fully explored the depths of yet? By the standards of what I would

362
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,440
say now is no, I didn't have a clue. I knew nothing. Now I was the kind of guy who when I got into

363
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,520
running in high school, I got books about running. And, you know, one of the first books I got was

364
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,480
Tim Nokes is the Laura or Tim Nokes is Laura of running, which is 900 and something pages. And

365
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,440
the first 300 pages or so or physiology. I didn't really understand the physiology when I went

366
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,720
through it, but I was familiar with the terms. And there's some other, I'm looking over at my shelf

367
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,840
right now. I can, you know, I've still got my original 1990 copy of Laura of running right there.

368
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,440
And there's a book called Better Training for Distance Runners, which is written, co-written

369
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,120
by a physiologist, which, so I had read all that stuff and I had this, so I could talk this sort of,

370
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:39,720
I don't know how to put this. I could talk about VO2 max and lactate threshold with other people

371
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,480
who were interested in this stuff, but I wouldn't say I had a deep understanding of where it came

372
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,800
from. I had a superficial acquaintance with the concepts. So begins another apprenticeship,

373
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,760
basically, which is now you're getting to learn physiology as you start to write more and more

374
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,720
about these topics. Yeah. And then there was, you know, this was not right away, I will say. I did

375
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,920
one year of journalism school, and then I had 16 months as an intern at a newspaper called the

376
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Ottawa Citizen, which had a great internship program at the time. And I was, you know, covering

377
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:15,000
car accidents and dog fashion shows and, you know, what have you. I learned to write. I learned to

378
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,560
write on deadline. I wrote, you know, 250 stories or something. You mentioned being prolific. Like

379
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,120
when you're the lowest man on the totem pole at a daily newspaper, you learn to write fast, you know,

380
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,880
multiple stories a day. And then, you know, my internship finished and I became freelance,

381
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,320
not because I had a bold vision, but because there were no jobs. And, you know, initially,

382
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,880
my first contact through a friend was with the bottom line, which you may, your subscription

383
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,160
may have lapsed, but it's Canada's accounting monthly. So I went to some conferences on like

384
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,440
forensic accounting and stuff like that. And so I didn't immediately, because in a sense,

385
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,440
I was running away from physics and running was still a bit of a, you know, a tender spot. I sort

386
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,600
of poured so much into it. So I wasn't looking to necessarily immerse myself right away in these

387
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,760
things. And it's only, I would say it was about 2008. So a couple of years after I finished

388
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,840
journalism school and after I finished my newspaper internship that I started to get into writing about

389
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,440
the science of running to sort of bring those two interests together.

390
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,640
Go back to that internship at the Ottawa Citizen. I want to understand a little bit more about

391
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,160
what you learned in journalism school as it pertained to teaching you how to write. And then

392
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,360
what you learned sort of during that internship where you're, you know, you're, you're on the

393
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,200
ground, right? It's the, it's the, it's the rubber meeting the road, so to speak. What were the two

394
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,640
different skill sets there? And how can somebody, I'm asking this for purely selfish reasons,

395
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,120
by the way, how can somebody who's constantly interested in improving their writing learn from

396
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,920
that, if they're neither able to go to journalism school nor take a formal internship for a

397
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,080
newspaper where they have an editor that's giving them feedback constantly, presumably.

398
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:07,160
Yeah. So I would say what I got out of journalism school was an understanding of the jargon for one

399
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:14,920
thing, but also the forms. We tend to think of writing as, as a, you know, you think of what you

400
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,200
want to say, and then you write it down. In high school, a lot of us learned the, you know, the,

401
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,520
the hamburger essay. There's five paragraphs and introduction. Then there's three main points and

402
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,280
there's a conclusion. And in each, you have a topic sentence in each paragraph, yada, yada, yada. So

403
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:39,880
there's this really rigid structure. And what I don't think I realized until I went to journalism

404
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:47,160
school is that there are underlying forms for most of the articles we read. And a news story

405
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,880
has a very specific form. It's called the inverted pyramid and a feature article with the kind of

406
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,400
thing you read in the New Yorker or something. It also has a certain form. Now, for good writers,

407
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,960
that form is invisible and that form is also played with and your expectations are, are,

408
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,880
you know, dashed. Sometimes you, you think, you know, where the story is going and then it goes

409
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,320
somewhere else yet. And so on and so on. The point isn't that you need to be slavishly

410
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,960
sort of following those forms, but you need to understand what the forms are. So you can

411
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,040
understand when you're deviating from them, you're doing it on purpose and you can understand

412
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,200
what a reader's expectation is, even if the reader himself or herself doesn't realize what that

413
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:39,560
expectation is. And so there's things like, yeah, you need to have a billboard paragraph that tells

414
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,600
the reader what to expect. And it depends. Anyway, I'll just sum up by saying that I learned about

415
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:54,520
form. Now learning about form is not the same as, as mastering the form. And so you go to, to an

416
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,520
internship at a daily paper and actually, you know, good internships, hopefully you're getting an

417
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,280
editor who's looking at your stuff and you're getting a little feedback, but the real, the

418
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,000
reality is it's, it's a, you know, it's a daily beast. And there's not a lot of time for that,

419
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
but you're writing sometimes three stories in a day, but certainly typically a story a day,

420
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,400
you're rarely getting more than a day to write a story. And you're getting a sense from, from

421
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,000
editors and from other people of what's working and what's not. And you can see what's working

422
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,400
and what's not. And so there's the just doing it part of it. But I think that would have been

423
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,760
harder to benefit from if I didn't have a sense of, of, of what the structures are

424
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:42,120
that, that you're, that you're trying to transcend. You're trying to be more than just

425
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,960
plugging in the pieces of a, of a jigsaw puzzle. But I mean, I, I give a talk on science writing

426
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,400
a while ago to some, some postdocs and, and some grad students. And I was, you know, really the,

427
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,920
the main point I wanted to get to them is that every piece of writing has form, whether it's a,

428
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,480
you know, a grant application or a, you know, a scientific publication, or particularly,

429
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,520
particularly a lot of scientists are interested in communicating their, their, their results to

430
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:15,240
a wider public. And they have to understand what the, you know, if they're writing for a newspaper

431
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,840
op-ed page, what, what is the form? And I, and I guess the other thing I say said in that context

432
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,600
is also understanding who the audience is. So, and that those two things are interlinked. If you,

433
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,880
if you understand who the audience is, you understand what their expectations are in terms

434
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,120
of what the piece is going to flow like. So anyway, that's what that boils down to is,

435
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,280
is obviously doing lots of it, but also trying to look at the writing that you like, the stuff that

436
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,360
when, if you, if you see a book or an article that, that, that you like, or that explains things

437
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,160
clearly, trying to, trying to break down like, so what are they doing here? What, what makes this

438
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,480
work? You know, did they have a particular, you know, a particularly good introduction section or,

439
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,920
you know, whatever the case may be. So reading critically, I guess is what I'm saying.

440
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,160
I almost wonder if it's somewhat like athletes where you could have the same debate about good

441
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,120
writers being born versus made, you know, I, in terms of scientific writers, I, I think

442
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:18,680
Sid Mukherjee is incredible. And I read his stuff and I, I, it's no different than, you know,

443
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,400
watching a remarkable athlete do something and you sort of think to yourself, there's probably

444
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,960
no way ever that I could write like that. Even if I devoted the every waking moment of my remaining

445
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,360
life to this study, any more than I could swim or bike or run as well as, you know, the most

446
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,120
amazing athlete I see doing those things. Do you, do you think that there's a parallel there?

447
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,000
I think there's a parallel and I would extend the parallel, which is that

448
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:54,360
we can look at Michael Phelps swimming and say, I will never be able to swim like that. But it's

449
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,760
a mistake to then say swimming is all, all genetic and therefore I am doomed not to get better at

450
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,360
swimming than I am right now. And, and most people don't come anywhere close to fulfilling their

451
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,800
quote unquote genetic potential. So for sure. And I, you know, especially when I read fiction or when

452
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,840
I read nonfiction by good fiction writers who know how to write nonfiction, if it's not to get too

453
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:25,000
confusing and the level of language and just imagery, to be honest, it's sometimes a little

454
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,920
depressing to me because it's, I feel the same as you. I'm like, yeah, there's nothing, there's no

455
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,640
amount of, you know, workshops or practice that it will make me write like that. And so I think

456
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,600
another thing is just to kind of, I don't know, this, maybe this is to defeat us, but own who you

457
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:47,560
are. And so I know that for me, I'm not a poetic writer, but what I hope to be is a very clear

458
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,800
expository and explanatory writer. So I will never paint the picture that I really admire in some

459
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:00,360
other writers writing, but hopefully I can, I can excel at it at another aspect of it.

460
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:06,520
Yeah, no, that's actually a great way to compare the two. So with that, let's, let's go into some

461
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,720
of this stuff around, well, let's just start with sort of something you've already alluded to.

462
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,280
Let's explain what it is, talk about how much it matters, and then kind of get into some examples.

463
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,760
So let's, let's start with a term that many people have heard before, but I don't think most people

464
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,760
understand what VO two max really means. And eventually we're going to talk about running

465
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,680
efficiency and lactate threshold, and we're going to get into all this stuff. But let's, let's make

466
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,640
sure people understand what VO two max is both in an absolute term, and then in a manner that we

467
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:42,280
normalize it by, by weight and what it is and what it isn't, how it's measured and how it matters.

468
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,240
And maybe we'll even talk about some notable exceptions. Sure. Yeah. So VO two max is the

469
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,360
one physiological parameter that anyone who's involved in endurance has heard of and, and has

470
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,200
some sense of, and the, the sort of the first order analogy is it's kind of the size of your engine.

471
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:08,680
So physiologically VO two max is telling you how much oxygen or how quickly you can take oxygen

472
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:14,200
from the air into your lungs, pump it, get it into your blood, pump it to your muscles, and then have

473
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,040
your muscles use it in the metabolic processes that will provide energy to move you to do whatever

474
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:27,480
you want to do. So it's, it's a rate. It's how much oxygen per unit time can you process absolutely

475
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:36,360
flat out. Now the sort of backstory here is it was, it was first sort of discussed or measured

476
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,960
in the 1920s by a guy named AV Hill, who was actually a very good runner. And the observation

477
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,240
that he made is if you have someone, you ask someone to go out and run at a, at a gentle pace,

478
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,400
they'll consume, let's say two liters of oxygen per per minute. Then you tell them to speed up. Now

479
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,120
they're doing three liters of oxygen per minute. Tell them to speed up again. And now they're going

480
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,120
pretty much, maybe not as fast as they can, but they're going fast and they're using four liters

481
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,600
of oxygen per minute. And so you tell them to speed up again and you measure it and they're like, oh,

482
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,240
they're only using four liters of oxygen a minute. Just like last time. So speed up again. And they're

483
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,160
still just using four liters of oxygen a minute. There's a plateau. There's a point at which even

484
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,520
though you're working harder, you're not using any more oxygen. And so this plateau looks like

485
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,320
it's a physiological limitation and it probably is in some sense, you know, it's a controversial

486
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,320
thing, but basically you've reached a point where no matter how hard you push yourself, you can't

487
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,200
get more oxygen. And so you can still go faster because you're starting to use other forms of

488
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,840
energy, but this is the limits of your aerobic system. This tells you, well, what it tells you,

489
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,160
we can get into, it's not clear what it tells you, but it tells you, it tells you exactly what

490
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,200
I just said. It tells you how much, how much oxygen you can use. Does that tell you exactly

491
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,720
how fast you can run? No, there's a, there are a lot of other factors, but it's, that tells you

492
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:02,600
what sort of aerobic engine you have to play with. Now people have, you know, I mean, as I remember

493
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,560
in high school, I mean, we would sort of talk about, well, which athletes have the highest VO2 max?

494
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,120
Is it the Norwegian cross country skiers? Is the professional runners and cyclists and things like

495
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,960
that. But people are usually used to hearing these numbers reported, not in liters per minute,

496
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,720
but in milliliters per minute per kilogram. So give an example. So people understand those

497
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:33,160
differences. Cause we usually talk about the outliers is a, is a number that's a bigger number

498
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:39,000
than two liters or five liters. It would be, you know, sort of 75, 80 milliliters per year. Just

499
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,440
explain to people how, how those are different. Sure. So I'll use my own numbers. When I, you

500
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,480
know, typically when I was tested, I could get about a little bit more than five liters per minute.

501
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:57,240
So 5.1, 5.2, if I remember correctly. Now, if you compared me to a rower, the row would make me look

502
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:05,320
pathetic because the rower would be using seven liters a minute or more. But the rower is also

503
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,960
huge, you know, twice my size or whatever. And, and, and so that doesn't necessarily mean that

504
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,240
that rower is better at using oxygen for me because the rower has way more muscle. And so the

505
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:24,600
rower is, is, is the amount of oxygen reaching any given muscle cell may be lower. So if you want to

506
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:31,000
compare apples to apples between athletes of different sizes, you divide at least for a crude

507
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,520
approximation, you just divide by weight. And so the numbers we usually hear are rather than

508
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:43,320
liters of oxygen per minute, it's milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight.

509
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:51,240
So for me, five liters of oxygen per per minute works out to something like 80 milliliters

510
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:59,000
of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight. So, and, and, you know, there's a whole rabbit

511
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,160
hole to go into is to say, well, why are we dividing by whole body weight? Because, you know,

512
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,080
there's a bunch of things like skeleton, you know, there's not an organs and stuff that don't scale.

513
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,160
The adipose tissue doesn't matter. I mean, you could argue a better comparison would be

514
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:19,320
total liters per minute divided by lean mass divided by time or normalized to time. And then

515
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,560
you're, you know, you're at least getting the metabolically active tissue, presumably.

516
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,840
Yeah. And, and, you know, there's papers where they do things like let's divide by weight to

517
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:35,800
the power of 0.68 or 0.7, which is another way of getting it effectively. It's a way of approximating

518
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,640
just the lean mass, the metabolically active tissue. So, and you can go down that rabbit hole,

519
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,840
but as, as, as I suspect what you'll want to get to is like at a certain point, it, it, it doesn't

520
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,640
matter that much anyway. So we don't need to, to like view, you can't just measure someone's view

521
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,680
to max and know how fast they're going to race. So it's, it's, it's useful, but it's not, it's

522
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,440
especially for comparing between people. Now comparing within yourself, it tells you something

523
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,600
if you've increased or if your view to max has decreased, but in that sense, it doesn't matter

524
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,880
what, what you're dividing by. I remember there was a guy that I used to ride with, and this was

525
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,840
not that long ago, maybe five or six years ago when I was still, you know, somewhat competitive,

526
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:22,520
at least with myself. Um, and, uh, actually it's funny. My number was just like yours,

527
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,800
except I was heavier. So I was about 5.1 to 5.2 liters, but I weighed more. So that worked out to

528
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:38,040
about 70 mils per MiG per KIG was my VO two max. His was 55 to 60, but I, there was never a day

529
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,640
that I could ride faster than him. Not one there simply. And I always felt like, although we did

530
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,920
the test so many times, I kept feeling like the machine must've been broken on him. Like I knew

531
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,960
my 70 was about right because I'd been tested so much. And that was lower than it had been when I

532
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,600
was younger. So it seemed appropriate, but I was always convinced that that there's no way he's

533
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:04,360
only 55. The reality of it is he may well have been, and he may have simply been a far more

534
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:12,520
efficient athlete, which we're going to get into. Um, before we get to the story of Oscar Svensson,

535
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,400
let's talk a little bit about historically what people have believed the limits are of VO two max.

536
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,960
Yeah, you know what? We don't, I mean, we don't even have to go very far historically to get into

537
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:29,880
a whole mudslide of, of confusion and debate and, and, and disagreement. Um, there's, there's a lot

538
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,520
of places along the, the way that, that could in some circumstances be the bottleneck. Uh, normally

539
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,120
people tend to assume that, um, so what, what is it that causes VO two max to plateau is essentially

540
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,880
I think what we're talking about. And, and, and just one thing I should add here, it's like,

541
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,280
why is that interesting? It's because you think, well, if you want to measure endurance,

542
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,680
just have someone run a mile or whatever, you know, as hard as they can. But any test like that

543
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,400
depends on motivation, depends on whether you pace it right. There's all these factors that come into

544
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,880
it. The nice thing about VO two max is that in theory it's independent of, uh, of motivation.

545
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,320
That's why people, that's why scientists like it. Cause it doesn't matter if, if, if, you know,

546
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,320
the, the, the subject doesn't really care about the study. If you see a plateau, you know,

547
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,920
that's, that's a property of their body and not a product of whether they were excited about

548
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,680
the study. So the question, yeah, the question is this plateau, what is it that causes it? And

549
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,800
it could be in the lungs, it could be the heart, it could be the circulation, it could be the

550
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:37,640
muscles ability to extract it. And I don't want to pretend that I know the answer because it's

551
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:44,760
still controversial that the picture that emerges is that almost every part along this cascade

552
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:51,400
is engineered right to the point more or less to what it needs to be. And so if you perturb any of

553
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:58,200
those, uh, those elements, it could, you can get limitations. So for example, the conventional

554
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,280
wisdom is that your lungs are not a limitation. You can always breathe enough in. And so then

555
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:09,000
the question is, can you, uh, uh, diffuse enough oxygen from your lungs into your bloodstream and

556
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,320
so on and so forth. Um, there are situations where, and it's been for decades, it's been

557
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,000
conventional wisdom that the lungs don't respond to training because they're overbuilt. Uh, there

558
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,760
was just a paper published a big review, uh, in the last month or two, arguing that, you know,

559
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,920
in some cases the lungs aren't overbuilt. And one of the situations is highly trained endurance

560
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,960
athletes. They can be limited by their ability to, uh, to, to get enough oxygen in. And you can also

561
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:43,320
run into situations where an athlete is so fit, their heart is so strong, it can, uh, it pumps

562
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,480
blood past your lungs so quickly that it doesn't have time to fully stock up on oxygen. You get

563
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,920
something called exercise induced arterial hypoxemia. So this, this is usually an issue

564
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,040
at altitude, but in elite endurance athletes is actually about half of them exhibited even at sea

565
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,680
level. So they're already running into a limitation just in getting oxygen from their lungs to their

566
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,720
bloodstream. And then at every stage of the way, there can be limitations if anything is knocked

567
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,480
off kilter, uh, and, and certainly right down to the ability of the muscles to first extract the

568
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,680
oxygen from the bloodstream and then to, to make use of it metabolically in the, in the mitochondria.

569
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,240
So it's there, there isn't one single answer, which is why you get these debates because everyone is

570
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,680
going to say, I have evidence that this is the limit. It's like, yeah, but I have evidence that

571
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,440
this is the limit and that's the limit and they're all the limit. Yeah. I've always wanted to see the

572
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,240
experiment where you took a group of athletes and maybe this has been done. Um, and you, you run them

573
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:42,120
all to max and then you reduce the FIO two of the incoming oxygen. So normally we do it with room

574
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:47,880
air. So you're getting a fractional inhalation of oxygen is 21%. And the way, of course, just for the

575
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,120
listener, the way these things work is the way they're calculating how much oxygen is being

576
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:57,000
consumed as they're measuring the, uh, the concentration of oxygen on the way out. So you're

577
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,160
calculating the Delta. And so I've always thought, well, wouldn't it be interesting to start

578
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:11,720
selectively dropping FIO two 21%, 20%, 19%, 18%. Now, presumably if the lungs aren't the limitation,

579
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:17,000
you should still see the same absolute Delta and you could at least start to eliminate one of those

580
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:24,040
variables, which would be FIO two and capillary exchange. And then you start pointing to some of

581
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,000
these other variables. Again, I'm sure somebody has done this experiment, but, uh, I don't know

582
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,120
what it yielded. Yeah. Probably not with the fine tooth comb that, that, that you're suggesting

583
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:40,600
people have compared, you know, 21% to 10% or whatever and 15%. And, uh, yeah, it's hard. I

584
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,160
mean, it's interesting. It's, it's interesting when you go to altitude or, or, you know, or the

585
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,440
equivalent, when you reduce the amount of oxygen, uh, funny things happen. Like there's, you know,

586
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,080
the, the first thing you would think would happen is like, you can't get enough oxygen. So you're

587
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,400
going to go anaerobic sooner. You're going to produce more lactate. And yet the opposite happens.

588
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,200
There's something called the lactate paradox. If you, if you try and exercise to exhaustion

589
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,120
at lower levels of altitude, you actually give up when your lactate levels are lower than you

590
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:11,080
would at sea level. And so, and, and there's debate about what causes this and even whether it's a

591
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:18,520
real thing. But the, the picture that, that makes sense to me is, is that it's, these things are not

592
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,400
just about how much oxygen is making it to the muscle. It's also like, what is the, what is your

593
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,480
brain oxygen level? And so you're, you're getting these other circuit breakers that are starting to

594
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,960
come down. They're not even on this path from mouth to lungs to, to blood to, to muscle. There,

595
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,040
there's other factors that are saying, whoa, wait a second. Oxygen is getting a little low. So we're

596
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,040
going to actually cut off the supply to the muscles or reduce it in order to make sure that

597
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:47,480
we don't get stupid. So prior to Oscar, how, how, because I want to talk about this kid,

598
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,360
his story is so interesting and you wrote a, you wrote a great article about it. And I've,

599
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,680
I've read many articles about him, including articles in, you know, physiologic journals.

600
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,520
You'd had a couple sort of freaks in nature out there in the nineties, right? So

601
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:11,560
90 plus milliliters per per kilogram per minute of a VO two max. What happens in

602
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:17,000
sort of a garden variety day of December, 2012, do you remember, do you remember when this,

603
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
when he shows up to a training lab, he's what, how old is he? He's like 17 or something.

604
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,800
It's like 17. I think he was, he was a former downhill skier who had taken like a talent

605
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,640
screen to see whether he'd be suitable for something like cycling. And he'd, I think he'd

606
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,800
scored just untrained just off, off the downhill slopes. He was 74 or something like that,

607
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:45,160
74 milliliters per kilogram per minute. And, and so that he passed. And so he started training as

608
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:51,080
a cyclist as a teenager and then, you know, pretty quickly scored 83, then 85, then 92.

609
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:58,280
And then he ended up scoring the initial reports that was he, were that he scored 97.5. But I think

610
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:04,280
when the science scientific journal came out, they said it was 96.7. Yeah. Which either way

611
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,800
was still higher than had ever been recorded in human history. And well, and so, and you know,

612
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:15,720
one thing we should, we should say is there are reports of people in their nineties, but reports

613
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:23,800
VO two max high, high VO two max numbers are they, they sprout very easily because it's hard to do

614
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,440
these tests. Right. And in fact, a lot of the tests that people, the garden variety machinery

615
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:35,560
used to do these tests is not designed to handle seven liters of oxygen per minute. And so you get

616
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:42,040
spurious results and you get, so the, the, the previous King was a guy named Bjorn Dally, a Norwegian,

617
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:48,600
the greatest cross country skier in history, who in the late nineties reputedly tested 90s, 96, 96.0,

618
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:54,040
or 96.6, depending on who you ask. This was never published in a journal. This was basically,

619
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:02,120
the, the Norwegian ski team leaked it to the press as a kind of PR move. And I asked a guy who,

620
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:08,680
who was working in Norway at the time and he said, they didn't believe the machine. He, he,

621
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,200
he didn't believe the machine was correctly calculated, calibrated, but he, he think he

622
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,760
figured they decided that it was a good PR move anyway. So, so when we're talking about high

623
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,120
numbers and there's, you know, Matt Carpenter, 92, Kelly and journey, every, there's a lot of people

624
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:28,200
who have high numbers, virtually none of them are published in the scientific literature.

625
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,960
The highest values, you know, you go back to the seventies where, uh, some, some of the great

626
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,080
runners were tested and you get, you know, Steve Prefontaine was 84 and there aren't a lot of

627
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:45,080
published values above the high eighties. So 96.7 is like, it's higher than the rumors,

628
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,160
but it's way higher than the verified numbers. So the first thing they did the next day is

629
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:54,040
they disassemble the machine, the metabolic cart and send it back to the manufacturer to get it

630
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:00,040
calibrated to find out if they, you know, are we nuts? Is this real? Is this true? And it came back

631
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,880
that yeah, it's working and all the other tests that Matt did.

632
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,320
Yeah, exactly. All the other tests that were done in that day were all within line.

633
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,080
Yeah. So, you know, so they figured this is real. And so they, they eventually, I mean,

634
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:19,640
this, the story is longer after his retirement, they, they, they published the data and shared it,

635
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,760
which was pretty cool. Well, I think the other thing it was very compelling was he was tested

636
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:29,640
again several months later. He put on two and a half kilos. So his number came down into the

637
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:36,200
eighties, but his absolute level of maximal oxygen consumption had barely come down. He went from

638
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:43,640
something like 7.2 liters to 7.1 liters. But the number came down from, you know, call it whatever

639
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:50,440
it was, 96 and change to 89 and change, which was accounted for by the gain in weight, which again,

640
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,880
is effectively like repeating the test and getting the same result.

641
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,720
I agree. To me, to me, that's the, actually the number one piece of data is that, that test,

642
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,000
that off season test a few months later, later in that year, it's like, okay, well,

643
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,400
he's doing the same amount of oxygen. We understand that people can put on weight and lose weight,

644
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:11,240
but the absolute value of 7.2 or whatever is suggests that this was a real number. And,

645
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,840
and, you know, the other thing to say is after he, as at 17 or whatever it was, after he clocked

646
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,560
that 96 couple of weeks later, he goes to the world junior championships and wins the time trial

647
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,480
there. So on the surface, it's like that goes to show if you have a big engine, you're going to be

648
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,400
a superstar. But of course the flip side of that and where I, the reason I brought this up was to

649
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,000
say, why do most people listening to this who might even be able to recognize the, you know,

650
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
the best time trialists in the world, the Bradley Wiggins of the world, you know, no longer active,

651
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,360
but you know, the, the, the people who go on to win grand tours and stuff, why don't we know this

652
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,960
guy's name? Yeah. So he turned pro, you know, when he turned 20 with an, he was with an under 23 team

653
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:53,080
called Joker. He was an okay cyclist. He did, he had some good results. He had some bad results.

654
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,040
I think it probably didn't help that, you know, he got a lot of attention for this VO two max

655
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,040
value. So I think the expectations were probably out of line with, with what was reasonable, both

656
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:09,640
from his own expectations and, and other people's, and he ended up retiring. I think he was 23,

657
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,080
maybe like he took a break and then he officially announced his retirement when he was around 23,

658
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:21,640
went back to university and he's done. He's, he's gone. So the aftermath was that there was a,

659
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:27,480
a paper published, I don't know if I think it was about a year ago that sort of reanalyze or responded

660
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,960
to when they published his data and said, well, let's look at not just his history of VO two max

661
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,240
values. Let's look at his efficiency at each point along the line. So over the course of three or

662
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,000
three years or whatever it was where he had multiple VO two max tests. And you see this

663
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,360
expected pattern, he starts at 74 and he goes 80 something, 80 something, 90 something, 96.

664
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,640
And then he comes back down the ladder. He, you know, by the time he, after he retired from

665
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,200
cycling, he was back down to 77. So he's right back where he started. That's it. That's a simple

666
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,080
story. But if you look at the efficiency, you get a much more interesting story, which is that

667
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,600
he started out at his most efficient when he was untrained. And the more he trained,

668
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:08,280
the less efficient he got, meaning that he could, he could deliver more oxygen to his

669
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,000
muscles. He could, he could deliver more aerobic energy, but he, he used more aerobic energy

670
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,960
in order to maintain a given pace. So, so let's, let's make sure folks understand how that's

671
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:23,640
calculated. So now you look at a different graph where on the X axis you show wattage,

672
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:30,440
which is the universal metric of output in cycling. And on the Y axis, you show oxygen consumption.

673
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:36,600
And so now you're looking at a graph that says for a given output, how much oxygen, how much

674
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,480
input do you need to get this output? And an athlete over time should get better and better

675
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:49,000
for a fixed wattage. You want to see what's called PVO to come down. So power at a given VO2

676
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,440
should actually come down as you get better in running. This would be the V VO2 you want to get

677
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:00,760
faster as, as, so for a given oxygen consumption, you want velocity to go up just as you would want

678
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,720
power to go up. I might've said it backwards earlier, but I think you know what I'm saying.

679
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,960
And, and so I gotta be honest with you. I was actually very surprised by that. I would have,

680
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,200
I wouldn't, I would have been less surprised if it had been unchanged, but I was very surprised

681
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:19,480
that it deteriorated. Yeah. And there's, there's lots of debates about whether you can improve it,

682
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,720
but to actually see it get worse was, was so clearly and so kind of monotonically, there was

683
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:31,880
inverse relationship was definitely surprising. And it actually plays into a longstanding debate,

684
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:37,960
which is the question of, is there an inverse relationship between VO2 max and economy or

685
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:44,120
inefficiency? So if you, if you build your engine bigger, do you necessarily end up with a less

686
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,920
efficient engine? And this debate has been going on for a couple of decades now and there's still

687
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,200
no consensus. And one, so one way of, because if you look at, if you just take a bunch of elite

688
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,960
athletes and you measure their economy, whether it's runners or cyclists and you measure their

689
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,760
VO2 max, you tend to see an inverse relationship. The people who have the highest VO2 max tend to

690
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:11,160
have slightly lower, slightly worse economies and people, and the people who have the best economy

691
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:18,200
tend to have slightly worse VO2 max. There's a lot of possible explanations for this. One is that

692
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:25,320
you don't tend to hit the lottery twice. So if you happen to have a VO2 max that's 92, then

693
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,560
you're not, you're, you're, you're not that lucky. You're not going to have the best possible economy.

694
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,400
And if you're only looking at elite athletes, that means that everyone else there is going to

695
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,240
have something special. So if they don't have the best VO2 max by definition, they have to have a

696
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,640
great economy because they have to have something that's exceptional. And so you see this inverse

697
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:48,360
relationship that either you have good economy or you have good VO2 max.

698
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,440
Just to be clear, that's because we've selected for people whose dot product of those two things

699
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,560
is the best in the world. Yeah. To be in this, if you're looking at elite athletes, they have to

700
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,520
have won at least one lottery, but they're unlikely to win two lotteries because we're already looking

701
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:09,080
at the 0.001%. So it's, it's, it's, it's highly unlikely that you're going to have hit the lottery

702
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:16,680
twice. But so what the Oscars Fenson data points to is, is a different explanation, which is that

703
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,160
there's actually a trade-off that if you're optimizing one physiological parameter, it may

704
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,720
come at the cost of the other physiological parameter that the training he did, which we can

705
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,280
sort of surmise must have been pretty good for increasing VO2 max because he got such a high one,

706
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,880
may have actually been bad for his economy, not in the sense that his, you know, his legs were

707
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:44,120
wobbling or he was had bad, you know, motion, but at a metabolic level that, and there was a paper

708
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:51,720
published. So the, again, in response to the Fenson case study, reanalyzing his data and pointing to a

709
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:58,520
potential cell level explanation of what's happening to certain enzymes at a given point.

710
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:04,200
The biochemistry, frankly, is beyond me, you know, to, to, to fully understand. But basically what

711
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:11,560
they're saying is if your mitochondria are being stressed to the, if you're, if you're doing a lot

712
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:19,000
of training that requires very high, like VO2 max level outputs, your metabolism, your cells need to

713
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,520
make choices to produce high output instead of to be as efficient as possible. And over time,

714
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,760
that's what you'll get better at and you'll lose that efficiency. And so you'll, you'll pay a slight

715
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:34,120
penalty for, for optimizing your training for VO2 max. Yeah. So that was, that was, that was

716
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:40,680
kind of my take, which was not knowing more about his training was what would happen if you took

717
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:48,360
that engine, if you took that, that genetic gift and instead of maximizing on VO2 max and pushing

718
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,240
him from, I mean, a guy that gets out of bed in the morning or falls off a log at 74 is a freak

719
01:04:53,240 --> 01:05:02,040
of nature. But instead of pushing him to 96, you train him and he'd, he'd get up to 85 or 90 maybe,

720
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:09,880
but you put much more effort into sort of zone two where you're right at lactate of two. So you push

721
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,680
him. And by the way, for him, that would be like, if you looked, I remember looking in the paper and

722
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:21,400
applied physiology, I mean, you know, he's spending a lot of time in the three to 400 watt range,

723
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,640
but he could have probably been in the sort of 300 to about the 300 watt range where he's still

724
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:33,000
just under two millimole of lactate, but he's dramatically increasing mitochondrial efficiency.

725
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:40,200
And if that represented two thirds of his volume, yes, he'd have a lower VO2 max,

726
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,280
but he might've been a better cyclist. Yeah. I think certainly putting on the hindsight

727
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:49,400
spectacles, I, you know, a hundred percent agree, but whatever he did, he paid too high a price

728
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,080
for that VO2 max. I mean, but just by definition, it didn't work out. And it certainly, again,

729
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:00,120
we don't know exactly what his training was, but that makes a lot of sense to me. And I think,

730
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:07,960
and I think it sort of agrees, and you've talked a lot about this, but with the sort of prevailing

731
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,760
wisdom among endurance athletes is that yeah, you know, 80% of your training should be easy,

732
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:22,760
conversational pace and, you know, what means you use to figure out what pace that is may depend,

733
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,840
or may vary, but yeah, he needed to be doing something that was going to,

734
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,680
at worst, not penalize his efficiency as much as he did.

735
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,440
I mean, I just remember even as an adult, like whenever I wanted to go and have a VO2 max test

736
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,600
just for ego, you wanted it to be as high as it could. Like I would alter my training for four

737
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:47,560
weeks and lose a couple kilos. Like it's lose two kilos and start doing four to six minute

738
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:54,760
all out intervals. That was the recipe for raising VO2 max. So abandon all low end and it's

739
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:01,800
four minutes all out, six minutes mild. And, but those are killing workouts. Those really crush you.

740
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,040
So yeah, there was just like kind of a formula to make it happen. So, so let's,

741
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,480
let's pivot now and talk about something you've also written about that I find

742
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,680
completely amazing from a physiologic standpoint, which is the sub two attempt

743
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,640
and the incredible effort of Kipchoge. So I don't even know where to begin this story,

744
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:26,040
but again, let's just assume for a moment that listeners aren't familiar with who Kipchoge is,

745
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:31,320
aren't even familiar with the difference between an official marathon versus a contrived Nike

746
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:39,240
marathon. Start from the beginning. Okay. So the very beginning, I'll give you the, the,

747
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,840
the medium long version of the story. The very beginning is that in 2014, I wrote an article

748
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:48,360
for runners world. It was like 10 pages long. I spent months on it analyzing the prospects for

749
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,000
a sub two hour marathon and, you know, talking to a bunch of experts, crunching data, blah, blah,

750
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,200
blah. What would it take? And at the end of that article, my prediction was that it would be

751
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,680
physiologically possible to run a sub two hour marathon and that it would happen sometime around

752
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:09,880
2075. So that, that was my context and the con, you know, the, I'll, I'll, I'll take ownership of the,

753
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,520
of the prediction, but that's, that's the general sense was that, yeah, it's possible, but it's not

754
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:18,440
going to happen for a long time. And just to be clear, Alex, what was the world record at the time

755
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:26,200
and did your prediction speak to an official marathon or any form of marathon? Yeah. Yeah. So

756
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:31,640
I was thinking about marathons as they are currently run. Although in my article, what I

757
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,560
said is, look, if, if we're going to, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen on an optimized

758
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,640
course. You're not just going to go to any old course. So you're going to choose a course that

759
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:48,200
optimizes temperature. It optimizes terrain. It optimizes curvature. So there's a lot of things,

760
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:54,520
you know, you knew right away the way marathons were run and mostly continue to be run. There's

761
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:59,800
fat on the bone in a way that there isn't in sports like track or, you know, if you look at

762
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,320
the Tour de France, there's fat on the bone, but no one cares about the time compared to track

763
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:09,080
cycling where everything is optimized. So marathons is, are this kind of anomaly where they're run in

764
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:13,880
a Tour de France style in a very uncontrolled environment with, which differs from, from race

765
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:20,040
to race. And yet we care about time. So, and I think that's maybe an anachronism that's going

766
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,880
to fade away a little bit as we realize that, you know, you can, you can run a lot faster if you

767
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,600
optimize the course. But anyway, to answer your question, the world record was 202 57 by a guy

768
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:34,440
named Dennis Camato. So we're talking three minutes away from a sub two. If you say, how long did it

769
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:42,840
take us to come down three minutes? Well, when in the mid eighties, I think it was 1986, the world

770
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:51,160
record was 206 50 by a bologna and in symbol. So we're talking a timescale 86, 90, 30 years to go

771
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:59,240
four minutes. Yeah, or, or yeah, exactly. So we're looking at, and, and of course the, the things are

772
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,480
getting optimized as we go. So the cur, you expect the curve to be leveling out, the, you know,

773
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:09,800
there's less and less low hanging fruit to get. So in 2016, uh, I, I heard, I got an assignment

774
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:15,160
from runners world to, to go report on this top secret Nike project, um, which ended up,

775
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,560
it was, it was something they called breaking to it's a race they held in spring of 2017.

776
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:26,120
And their mission was basically they'd spent about two or three years, 20 people full time

777
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:32,520
working on it, trying to, uh, I don't know how to say it to engineer a sub two hour marathon.

778
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:37,560
And so they had a started with a huge talent search. They, they sponsor a large fraction of

779
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,360
the world's best runners. So they brought 20 something of their best runners to labs to

780
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:48,760
measure their VO two max and their economy and various other things and, uh, pick three runners.

781
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:54,760
And then they, they, they went around the world, uh, testing possible courses. They ended up

782
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:00,600
settling on a formula one racetrack in Northern Italy. It was Monza. It was, yeah. With, with,

783
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,560
which, which I think is where they, the, the highest speed ever reached that's on a,

784
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:10,760
yeah. So, so if you, I'm obsessed with formula one. So if you, uh, if you're interested,

785
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:16,200
Monza is the fastest formula one circuit. You don't look at the maximum speed. You look at the

786
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,240
fastest average speed. So Monza has the fastest average speed of any formula one circuit. There

787
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,560
are other characteristics that make formula one circuits interesting, which have the highest G

788
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,600
forces, which have the highest straightaway speeds, those things, but yeah, Monza has the fastest,

789
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,640
highest average speed. And of course, doesn't have much elevation change, which is probably even more

790
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,920
important, right? Yeah. So they use the junior loop, I think it was called at that at Monza. So

791
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,640
not the full one, because that was the straightest possible with just the barely perceptible curves.

792
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,800
I think it was about a mile and a half loop or something like that. Um, it's also like that,

793
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,880
you know, the, it doesn't have much elevation change. It's, it's close to sea level, but it's

794
01:11:53,880 --> 01:12:01,000
not close to the sea, which makes the weather a little more predictable. Um, they, they optimized

795
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,280
a lot of different things. You know, they're trying to optimize the nutrition, the in-race

796
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:09,960
nutrition, the aerodynamics, they're like doing things like sticking bump adhesive bumps onto

797
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,960
the legs of the runners to try and reduce the air, the drag when they're swinging their legs back and

798
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:23,000
forth. Some of it's a little ridiculous. Um, some of it was significant. Uh, the two significant

799
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:29,400
things were they were going to have, uh, I think it was one, two, three, four, five, five pace,

800
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:36,040
it was five or seven pacemakers running, running in front of the, the, yeah. So basically, uh, yeah,

801
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:42,840
uh, blocking the wind for the chosen runners for the whole way. Now you can't hire someone to run

802
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,280
at sub two hour marathon in order to run a sub two hour marathon. So they had to have

803
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:51,880
runners dropping out every couple of laps and new runners swapping in. That's not allowed according

804
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:57,640
to, uh, the rule, the official rules of marathoning. So that's the main reason that this race that

805
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:04,040
Nike had planned was it was not and is not considered a world record. Um, because it

806
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:08,600
doesn't obey those rules. And then the other, the other factor, the big factor is they introduced

807
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:15,320
a new, uh, a whole new type of shoe that had a curved carbon fiber plate embedded in the sole

808
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:19,960
that improves running economy. In other words, it allows you to burn less energy

809
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:26,840
to sustain a given pace by about 4% on average. So put all these things together and all of a

810
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:32,040
sudden it's like, we don't actually need the runners to be that much faster than two or two

811
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:37,320
57. If all these things we've come up with work, we should be able to slice three minutes off the

812
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,000
time with the shoes and the drafting and the course and the weather and all these sorts of things.

813
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:47,720
Um, the three run of the three runners, they ended up selecting Elliott Kipchoge is,

814
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:52,600
was the reigning Olympic champion. And he was also probably the most consistent in the best

815
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:57,400
marathoner in the world at that time. He was, I think he had the second, second or third fastest

816
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,640
time in history at that point. And then they had a couple of other guys who had good, good lab

817
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:06,440
values. One of them had the best running efficiency ever measured. Um, but neither of those guys

818
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:12,600
ended up being a factor. Kipchoge ended up running two flat 25 at this Nike breaking two race. So 25

819
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,720
seconds, uh, two and a half minutes faster than the world record didn't run sub two, but was that

820
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:23,160
was considered a victory because it was like nobody thought anyone would even with all the

821
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:29,000
sort of science and tech, nobody thought that it would actually add up to a human running that fast.

822
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:36,360
So then there was a, a sequel in, in 2019, uh, funded by the petrochemical company in EOS instead

823
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:43,480
of Nike in, in Vienna, which basically replicated most of what breaking two had done. They only

824
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,800
brought Kipchoge in. They had a few different things. They had a new pair of shoes, um, which

825
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:54,680
is what became a very, very controversial. And this time Kipchoge ran one 59 40. Um, so he ran

826
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:00,040
a sub two marathon and it, and it, it, uh, has, has sort of galvanized and polarized the running

827
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:06,440
world because, uh, Kipchoge is the greatest marathoner in history, I would say, but these,

828
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:12,760
these events, uh, left a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of people, both for their, the sort of

829
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:19,160
circus like quality, but also because of the shoes, the shoes became, uh, very controversial

830
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:25,880
because it's not clear whether shoes that make you 4% more efficient with a carbon fiber plate

831
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,640
embedded in them are, are within the spirit of the sport or within the rules of the sport.

832
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:35,320
I mean, this sounds an awful lot like where swimming was in 2008 and 2009, when the tech

833
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:42,520
suits from basically 2000 to 2008 had gotten so quick that by 2009, Fina said, this is going to

834
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:48,360
be the, this world championships in 09 will be the last time there are technical suits and away

835
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:54,520
they went. And actually there are still some world records that stand, you know, 12 years later, uh,

836
01:15:54,520 --> 01:16:01,400
nearly 12 years later from, from those two. The surprising thing to me is that, is that all,

837
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,800
not all of them stand because I am at the time I remember interviewing some swimmers and saying,

838
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,640
so, you know, how does it feel? Do you think you will never again set a personal best? There was

839
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:15,640
this sense that, uh, banning those suits would, would just completely, uh, change the record book.

840
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,200
But it has turned out that swimming has continued to advance. I guess there's advances in pool

841
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,920
technology and stuff like that, but, uh, um, but yeah, it's exactly analogous debate. You know,

842
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,960
what role should the equipment play in a sport that is not like formula one that is,

843
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,920
whose, whose inherent, uh, attraction is its simplicity.

844
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:41,640
But to play devil's advocate, right? I mean, um, would, would the current running shoes you

845
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:46,040
would wear if you were out to, if you were to go out and run a marathon, would they offer a 4%

846
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:50,760
efficiency over leather you would strap to your feet? It's a good question. I,

847
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:58,280
I think they would, they would raise my chance of getting to the finish without injuring myself

848
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,240
because cushioning is, is the big advance. The better or maybe the more, the more sort of pointed

849
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:09,640
analogy is, um, cinder tracks in the, were common until the sixties. Then you have all

850
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:16,520
weather tracks. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's apples to, to, to, to pairs or whatever. Um, so I think

851
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,600
Yeah. Or look, we're looking at cycling, right? I mean, consider a bicycle today versus a bicycle

852
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:30,520
20 years ago, not a hundred years ago, just look. I mean, if you look at the, the, the, the, the,

853
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,720
the bikes written in the late nineties versus today, they, they're not even the same thing.

854
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:41,000
I mean, they're, they're not even close. Well, the hour record is such a classic example of that

855
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,400
because cycling did try and say, you know what, let's make it about the cyclist, not the cyclists.

856
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:52,040
We're going to all ride the 1972 Eddie Merck special and for the hour record and the response

857
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:56,280
to the cycling world was like, okay, we're not interested in the hour record anymore. Forget

858
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:02,200
about it. It's, it's, it's uninteresting to us to go ride this stupid 1972 bike. Um, and until they

859
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,800
changed the rules again in whatever it was, 2015 or something. And all of a sudden everyone's like,

860
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:11,160
Hey, all right. Now we're, now we're interesting. And so yeah, yeah. I mean, I think the, the key

861
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,760
that, that, that I would say in agreeing with you is that anyone who thinks that

862
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:24,680
the progress of the sport over the last 10 years, much less 50 years, much less a hundred years

863
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:29,400
is all about, well, we've learned more and we're digging deeper is kidding themselves. Technology

864
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,800
is baked into the improvement curve changes in circumstances, environment, and technology are

865
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:38,200
baked into those curves right from the get-go. Now you can still, you can acknowledge that and

866
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,520
still say, yeah, I want the, I understand the curves going like this, but I don't want it to go,

867
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:50,520
to drop off a cliff. And the world records have been absolutely knocked silly in the last two

868
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:55,480
years since the issues have become common. I still think it's, you know, I think it was a

869
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,720
tough call to, I don't think it was obvious that you could ban them until they'd already been used

870
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:04,360
enough to realize that, Oh, wait, this is real. Uh, this is a big advantage by which time it was

871
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:08,920
kind of too late to ban them. Because the thing is, I mean, as a guy who follows this stuff

872
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:16,600
relatively closely, I'm used to press releases every year, if not every day that promise to

873
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,360
upend the sport, and this is going to be the newest, greatest, latest, best thing. It's, you

874
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:28,280
know, so you ignore that stuff. And so even if Nike had said, Hey, by the way, um, just a heads up

875
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:32,600
to world athletics, we've got these shoes and they're crazy. Are they, you know, is it okay that

876
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,600
we introduce them? And all the ingredients of the shoes were, had been, are things that had been

877
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,880
used before. So there was nothing like, there was no like coiled spring in it. Carbon fiber plates

878
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,040
had been used before, including to set world records. So there was nothing, it's just Nike got

879
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:52,440
the recipe, right. They got it so right that it, it changed the sport and it in the long run,

880
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:56,680
things will settle back into parody and we won't worry about it. But there was a period about 2016

881
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:01,720
to 2019 where it's like, if you didn't have the right shoes, you probably weren't going to win

882
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:07,480
the race. And that, that is a little unfortunate. So where do you, I mean, where do you think this

883
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:16,120
all fits into your prediction, whatever year that was 2014, I mean, where do you, when do you think

884
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:21,560
two hours will be broken on a legitimate road course with full marathon rules that will

885
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:25,560
constitute a world record? So that means it also has to be a marathon that ends and starts in the

886
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,920
same place. It can't be a, you know, one and done downhill like Boston or something like that.

887
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,480
Um, is that, do you, do you revise your estimate of whatever year you gave?

888
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,560
Oh yeah, for sure. No, it's not going to be 2075, which coincidentally was going to be my

889
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:45,000
hundredth birthday. So maybe that was subconsciously influencing me, but the answer depends on what

890
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,640
you define as legit. Is there something illegitimate about holding a marathon on a loop course?

891
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:55,320
I don't see it. I mean, marathons, you know, it used to be, they were a big deal in like Madison

892
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:00,360
Square Garden back in the late 1800s. You know, there's nothing inherent about saying

893
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:06,280
you shouldn't run it in a circle. Um, yes, we love the big city marathon experience and it brings

894
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,560
the people together, yada, yada, yada. But if you're trying to break the two hour marathon,

895
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:16,840
the goal is not to, you know, be inclusive. Um, so there's things like that. Uh, here's another

896
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:21,640
thing they did. They said, we don't have a start time. We're not, we're not starting Saturday at,

897
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:29,240
at 7am. We're starting sometime between Friday at 7am and Sunday at 7am or whatever. And we're

898
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,560
going to look at the weather forecast and we're going to make a call the day before,

899
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:37,240
like 12 hours before, so we can get the absolute optimal weather. Is that cheating or is that

900
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:42,280
smart having a launch window? So there's a lot of things like that. The key thing I think is,

901
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:48,920
um, two key things. One is pacemaking. You can't have people jumping in halfway. That's the number

902
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,160
one thing they have to change for me to consider it like a legit sub two hour marathon. So you're

903
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:59,720
going to have to attract like the second best runners in the world to go and to have them work

904
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:05,320
together so that, you know, one group is leading through halfway. And then the second group is

905
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:10,920
going to lead, uh, you know, to 30 K or something, something, and then they're going to drop out and

906
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,480
and the chosen runners do it alone. So you're going to have to optimize that to do that. You're

907
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:20,120
going to need a ton of money. And more generally, you're going to need a ton of money to put on it.

908
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:23,640
I would estimate Nike spent tens of millions of dollars on its breaking two race.

909
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:30,360
So my 20 75 prediction did not bake any of that stuff into it. But now that we've had a sub two

910
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:34,680
and now that the official world record is two Oh one 39, if I'm remembering correctly,

911
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:40,200
you know, we're within shouting distance of the two hour. I think some of those other factors may

912
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:46,600
come together that someone tries to put together a breaking two style race that still falls within

913
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:51,400
the bounds of legitimate. So I would say that could happen anytime in the next 10 years.

914
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,440
When's it going to happen? Just like it's a race. We showed up to Berlin or Boston or New York or

915
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,760
whatever. And someone happens to run sub two. I think that's still a long way away because

916
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,200
again, the progress has not been in humanity. The progress has been in understanding where the fat

917
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:15,320
on the bone is and cutting that away systematically. So if you take away all technology, what is the

918
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:22,040
difference between Roger Bannister and the fastest Myler today? Again, get rid of shoes,

919
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:30,200
get rid of all of that. As a species, we have not evolved. So how much of that difference is

920
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:36,520
technology? How much of it is training, nutrition, everything else you'd bake into it? I mean,

921
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,600
what would be the buckets you would you would classify as the improvements? And what is the,

922
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:45,800
I don't even know what the mile record is today. Mile records 343. So 17 seconds.

923
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:53,320
Yeah. So for Bannister to today, the biggest bucket bar none is training.

924
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:02,120
Bannister is reputedly an under reporter. There was this sort of whiff of amateurism where admitting

925
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:08,840
you were training too hard was not done. But even if you take with a grain of salt as reports,

926
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:14,840
it was sort of half an hour a day, go out and do 10 by 600 or 10 by 400 meters. So we're talking

927
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:21,080
four or five miles a day, five, six days a week. Maybe he was doing more than that sometimes,

928
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:29,080
but he was training at a level, a very, very light level. And even one of his contemporaries was

929
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:38,280
Emil Zatapek who was a check runner. Just a legend. I mean, yeah, absolutely. Arguably the greatest

930
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:44,360
runner ever. Yeah, exactly. He was starting to push the boundaries of how hard you could train.

931
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:50,040
He was a guy who was going out and doing 60 by 400 instead of 10 by 400. And so it's not like

932
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:55,800
nobody understood that training worked, but Bannister versus today, it's training is the difference.

933
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,320
Cinder's maybe a second to lap, like the track quality, the quality of the spikes,

934
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:08,280
negligible and nutrition for a mile. It's not just not that big a deal for a four minute race.

935
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:15,480
If you fast forward to the sixties, by the sixties, you've got people like Jim Ryan who ran 351 for

936
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:23,000
the mile as a teenager. He's training like a beast. Most people could not handle, even modern

937
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,040
milers would not dare to train as hard as hard as he trained. He survived it as a result.

938
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,840
He was doing, so when I say, so Roger Bannister was 10 by 400 meters. Emil Zatapek was 60 by 400

939
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:40,680
meters, but they were mostly really slow. It was like another form of endurance. Jim Ryan was 40

940
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:47,640
by 400 meters, but they were all hard. They were all as close to as hard as Bannister was doing.

941
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,440
On what recovery?

942
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,120
I don't want to claim that I remembered, but we're talking like one to two minutes,

943
01:25:54,120 --> 01:26:05,160
probably or 400 meter jog. It was a very interval based program, but hard, really, really hard.

944
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,160
What would he run those 400s in? How many of them would be sub 60 seconds, all of them?

945
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:20,120
No, not sub 60. He'd probably be doing those in like 66, 64. I don't know the exact times,

946
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:27,960
but it's at that volume in the context of high mileage, he was doing them at a pace that was

947
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:35,080
extremely challenging, not the Zatapek style of just let's get tough and not worry about the pace.

948
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:40,280
Zatapek's the guy who's in the laundry tub, just doing high knees in the laundry tub,

949
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:48,040
or holding his breath between phone poles on his run. He was all about just making stuff hard,

950
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:52,280
whereas Ryan was taking that to a systematic level. We're going to train hard, but we're going

951
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:59,400
to do it systematically with his coach, Bobby Timmons. I'd say you can't make much distinction

952
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:04,920
between the training of the 1960s and the training of today. There were people who were training

953
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:12,440
probably as hard in the 60s. If you take Jim Ryan's mile, 351, Cinder's subtract four seconds, 347,

954
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:19,240
the American record's 346.8 or something like that. By the 60s, training was mature.

955
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:27,480
All the other stuff that we worry about, all the nutritional aids and pneumatic compression devices

956
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:34,920
and ice baths and stuff, I'm not saying it doesn't help on an individual basis, but you can't see it

957
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:40,040
in the record curves or anything like that. Those things don't show up. Those don't leave a mark

958
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:45,400
in the big statistical picture. Do you ever follow horse racing at all? Do you ever follow

959
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:51,720
the times that horses run and things like that? That's exactly the comparison I was thinking of,

960
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:58,440
which is that they've stagnated since the 50s, right? Secretariat is hands down the fastest horse

961
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:04,040
that's ever run. I read a very interesting argument on, I don't know, it was probably on

962
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:08,280
Tate Silver's 365 a few years ago that actually made the point that we're getting further from

963
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,920
Secretariat now because we're actually seeing less diverse breeding of horses.

964
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:20,520
You're just bringing less genes to the gene pool. Of course, Secretariat's genes were pretty unique.

965
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:28,520
It was an X-linked, so it was a sex-linked X chromosome gift that he had genetically. That's

966
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:35,240
why his male offspring didn't do anything special, but his female offsprings that would go on to pass

967
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,640
X chromosomes to males a generation later actually were somewhat special.

968
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:47,320
Secretariat's times were unbelievable. When you think about it through the lens of even running,

969
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:54,440
to run a mile and a quarter and to negative split by mile, all five miles, the winning Secretariat's

970
01:28:55,080 --> 01:29:03,000
winning times at Belmont, I don't think any horse will come close to that.

971
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:09,800
It's important to note that whatever amount of money we have in the running world that is

972
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:15,080
compelling us to or allowing us to optimize nutrition and training, and yet there's way

973
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:20,040
more running in horse racing. If there were physiological advances that allowed us to run

974
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:27,960
faster, they would be using those on horses. The post-training massage or whatever, if that helped

975
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,040
horses, they'd be getting it, or they probably are.

976
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:38,840
Going back to your experience, let's bring it back to this idea of what you're now learning

977
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:45,000
about endurance. You are back as a journalist now, and you're fully ready to go back and visit your

978
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:51,640
running roots. In the research for your book, what are you learning about your experience

979
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:56,680
on a rainy night in Quebec? How are you able to put that in the context of

980
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:01,720
what the limits of endurance are? I guess the start would be, maybe to pick up the thread even

981
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:07,720
a little earlier, is I finally started to write about running, and I was doing it in a very

982
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:13,800
conventional way, the sort of what heart rate should you do your tempo run at and things like

983
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:22,280
that. What it meant is that I was starting to look at the literature and reading some papers.

984
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:29,480
I came across a paper, and again, maybe 2007, 2008, it was a debate, and I think it was in

985
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,280
the Journal of Physiology. The topic of the debate was, does dehydration impair endurance

986
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:40,120
performance? I just remember being like, what is this like April Fool's? Of course, dehydration

987
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:47,240
impairs endurance performance. It was a pro and con, and the con was Tim Noakes arguing. It was

988
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:53,720
a very notable contrarian scientist, let's say, from the University of Cape Town.

989
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:59,160
He was arguing that, no, we have not shown that dehydration itself impairs performance,

990
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:04,600
thirst impairs performance if you're thirsty, but if you drink enough that you're not thirsty,

991
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,880
and even if you're dehydrated, even if you've lost a bunch of weight,

992
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:12,200
that doesn't impair performance. He went through all the literature, all the famous studies that

993
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,960
show dehydration and there's performance going back to the Second World War. You look and it's

994
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,200
like, well, they were all thirsty. They were all stuck in a sauna and not allowed to drink.

995
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:26,280
Anyway, all of which is to say, all of a sudden, I was like, oh, wait, one of my fundamental tenets

996
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:33,240
or one of the things that I thought was beyond debate is debatable. I started reading a little

997
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:40,440
more and following this thread, and I discovered that Tim Noakes had proposed this idea called

998
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:46,520
the central governor model, which was in a nutshell, it's that when you run as hard as you

999
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:51,560
can or exercise in other forms as hard as you can, the reason you stop or the reason you slow down

1000
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,560
or the reason you aren't able to go faster is not because your legs aren't capable of going faster.

1001
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:01,000
It's because your brain is protecting you. It's putting on the brakes before you push so hard

1002
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:09,000
that your heart runs out of oxygen or whatever the case may be. This was highly controversial. It was

1003
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:17,960
a fringe theory at the time, but that's when I started to make the connection to my race in

1004
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:24,120
Quebec, my 1500 breakthrough and the whole career of why do I have a good race one week and a bad

1005
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:29,080
race the next week, even when physically there's nothing different? Why does it feel like sometimes

1006
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:33,800
I'm able to dig deeper? If it's just multiply your VO2 max by your running economy, divide by your

1007
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:39,800
lactate threshold or whatever, there shouldn't be any change. These things don't change from week

1008
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:45,720
to week. That got me interested in the role of the brain. Now, let me just jump ahead and say the

1009
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:51,880
central governor model, people don't really talk about that anymore. It was a model that emphasized

1010
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:56,600
the importance of the brain in understanding the limits of endurance, which has then led to a whole

1011
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:02,440
bunch of further research, which is what captivated me because it's like nobody needed another article

1012
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,920
on VO2 max is oxygen or whatever. Although I shouldn't say that because I've written a few

1013
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:13,080
articles about VO2 max. But what struck me as interesting and what even in by 2009, I was like,

1014
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:19,400
this should be a book about this that tries to explain this to all the people like me who I know

1015
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:23,720
are interested in this stuff, but haven't, don't realize that there's this debate going on in the

1016
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:30,200
literature about how do we bring the brain in, not just in a sense of like you have to really want it

1017
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:37,240
to try really hard, but to understand how the brain is influencing or controlling or playing a part

1018
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:45,320
in determining the limits of endurance. Where do you think this fits into health?

1019
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:53,240
So there's, I mean, this is clearly an important topic when we're talking about sports, right? When

1020
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:58,680
we're talking about endurance sports, like running and cycling and swimming, the purpose of the sport

1021
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:04,600
is to be fast, is to have endurance and speed at that right combination. Many of the people

1022
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:09,560
listening to this podcast are no longer competing. You know, you're still competing, but most people

1023
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:17,080
aren't. I don't compete at anything anymore. But I hate the term, but quote unquote cardio exercise

1024
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:22,760
or endurance based exercise, we would still agree is still an important pillar of health.

1025
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:30,280
So how do you, how do you think about that? And more importantly, how do you think about what you've

1026
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:35,880
studied applying to health? And one of the things I want to talk about, because it's so interesting,

1027
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:41,560
of course, is at some point is exercise become counterproductive and maybe even what are the

1028
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:47,560
benefits specifically, you know, for example, energetics efficiency with metabolism and how

1029
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:52,360
that can fight disease. So in any way, you want to start that discussion, like how do you start

1030
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,960
to think about it both scientifically and even personally? Yeah. So that's a big bite that you

1031
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:04,600
want. That's you you've mapped out the next three hours of our conversation. Yes. So one thing I

1032
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:09,240
would say is, I mean, look, I don't want to oversell it and say, you must understand, you know, your

1033
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:14,120
your absolute limits in order to be healthy. But I do think in terms of,

1034
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:20,920
if we think about the barriers to exercise, the barriers to being physically active, I think for

1035
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:31,080
a lot of people, there's a if you interpret the distress signals you feel when you start exercising

1036
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:39,160
as signs that your body is reaching its limit, that's a very distressing thing. You know, if

1037
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,200
you're like, I'm going to start an exercise program, I'm going to start brisk walking, I'm going to

1038
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:46,040
start running, and you feel you're panting, you're out of breath, your legs are burning, you know,

1039
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:54,840
I'm going to die, and you stop. And so I think understanding that these, it's not so much about

1040
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:58,840
how to change your limits, but understanding what those limits represent understanding that they are

1041
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:07,080
not signs that you're going to die. These are just, this is just information. This is because I would

1042
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:11,800
say, and I haven't thought this through, maybe it's not true, but I would say, off the top of my head,

1043
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:15,720
any meaningful form of exercise that's going to do you substantial amounts of good is going to involve

1044
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:22,680
dealing with discomfort in one form or another. And if you can get to a place where you understand

1045
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,920
that the feelings of discomfort are not signs that something is going wrong with your body,

1046
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:31,800
but they are just information, they are telling you where you are on the road to reaching your

1047
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,200
limits, and you don't have to go to your limits, but you also don't have to stop, you're allowed to

1048
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:41,880
just interpret that as information and say, okay, understood, I'm out of breath, but I can keep going.

1049
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:49,960
So I think, to me at least, that's a useful insight to take from this. Now, we can get deeper

1050
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:55,720
than into, you've raised some very interesting and controversial questions about how much exercise

1051
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:59,240
is good, what kind of exercise do we need to do? I don't know where you want to start with that.

1052
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:07,880
Well, let's, because we don't have three hours, although I mean, when we meet in person and share

1053
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:13,960
a meal, we certainly will take those three hours. But let's start with two opposing points of view

1054
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:20,280
with respect to exercise. So one point of view says the exercise longevity curve is J-shaped.

1055
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:29,320
So at the far end of the spectrum, no exercise is a really bad thing for mortality.

1056
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:35,800
As you increase exercise, mortality improves, improves, improves, improves, improves, improves,

1057
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:41,160
and then it kind of gets to your best all-cause mortality. And if you continue to increase

1058
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:46,680
exercising beyond a certain volume, this is generally discussed in volume of exercise,

1059
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:51,800
you actually see a little uptick in mortality, suggesting that once you go beyond a certain

1060
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:57,000
point, again, I want to stress this is in volume of exercise, you don't get any more benefit and

1061
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,560
you may actually have more harm. And a lot of times this is harm that comes in the form of

1062
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:07,960
cardiac dysrhythmia, it could be even atherosclerosis through endothelial damage, fibrosis,

1063
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:13,640
things like that. There's another body of literature that says, no, it's more or less a

1064
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:19,080
monotonically improving curve. And again, we all agree that at one end of the spectrum,

1065
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:25,160
having, you know, really poor cardiovascular fitness, again, we could measure this in VO2 max

1066
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:30,440
or something like that, as that improves, and you get fitter and fitter and fitter and fitter,

1067
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:34,920
all-cause mortality goes lower and lower and lower, and there is no J to that curve.

1068
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:40,600
How do you think about reconciling those? And I want to point out at the outset,

1069
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:47,800
this is a discussion that only really impacts like 1% of the population, because 99% of the

1070
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:52,120
population are on the side of the curve where they could always benefit from exercising more.

1071
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:57,720
But you know, you, for example, might be one of those people who's in the 1% where, I don't know,

1072
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:02,920
what's your weekly mileage right now? Unfortunately, it's only probably about 20

1073
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:10,040
miles. So even James O'Keefe would give me a pass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So walk me through how you

1074
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:16,280
think about that, because I have to be honest with you. I've seen examples of, you know,

1075
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:21,880
those athletes who go a little bit too far, who probably have a genetic susceptibility to

1076
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:28,360
dysrhythmia, and then they go on and get these dysrhythmias. But at the same time, they're few

1077
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:32,440
and far in between. So I don't, I don't, I'm still a bit on the fence about this one. Again,

1078
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:36,040
just purely from an intellectual standpoint, I don't think it applies to me anymore. It probably

1079
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:41,800
did at some point. So it's a good question. And it's an important one. And there's a couple,

1080
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:47,640
a few things I want to say first, I'm a runner, right? So take, take what I say, understand where

1081
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:51,640
I'm coming from. I'm also a human, like I don't want to die. So I'm trying, I try to look at this

1082
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:58,280
data as impa as dispassionately as possible. So, but, but I, obviously I, my knee jerk reaction is

1083
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:05,480
like, let's find holes in this data that suggests running is bad. So I get that on the table. Second,

1084
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:13,240
there's no doubt that there's a reverse j curve. If you try to run 2820 hours a day, it's not going

1085
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:19,480
to be good for you. So like it's nothing is good for you if you push it far enough. So the real

1086
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:28,280
question is where do the extremes or where does the uptick happen? Third thing I want to say is

1087
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:36,200
this, this, the data on this, this showing that, you know, you do a little bit, you get some benefits

1088
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:40,920
and the more you do that it gets worse and worse. One really interesting thing that came out of that

1089
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:46,840
and there were a few studies in about eight years ago that showed that is that actually the dose you

1090
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:51,400
need to get most of the health benefits is very small. And I do think that's an important message.

1091
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:57,640
You do not need to train or for, or run marathons in order to be optimally healthy, at least to within

1092
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:02,920
the 90% or whatever, you're going to get most of what you get from a very modest amount of exercise.

1093
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:08,760
And so that's a great message. So, okay. Now then, can you quantify that by the way, in terms of,

1094
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:14,360
in terms of running, let's, let's put some numbers to that. If you're talking about a person who

1095
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:20,680
maybe was active in high school and college, but you know, they're, they're 10 or 20 years out of

1096
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:25,000
that. They've been caught up in the challenges of starting their career, starting their family,

1097
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:32,360
et cetera. They wake up, they're 40 years old and their waist is five inches bigger. They've got

1098
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:37,240
metabolic syndrome. They're not in dire straits. It's not like they're going to die in the next

1099
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:42,360
10 years, but they've got the message which says, Hey, the one thing that is really missing is your

1100
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:48,360
exercise. What, what would you say if they see him to you and said, Alex, just tell me the minimum

1101
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:54,680
effective dose. I don't want to run any weekend races. I like running. I used to love it or rowing

1102
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:59,400
or whatever their activity is. How many hours or how many miles do I need to do a week to just get

1103
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:03,320
the benefit that some of the, you know, 80% of the benefits with 20% of the efforts.

1104
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:09,560
Yeah. So, so the Cooper Clinic study, which was like 50,000 people or so, uh, that came out

1105
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:17,080
four or five years ago, their number was five to 10 minutes a day. I don't fully believe that,

1106
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:21,560
but that, that was their number. So they're talking, you're talking like an hour a week.

1107
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:28,440
And that's just, you know, going out for a run. I personally, maybe we can get into this.

1108
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:33,720
That's not my definition of an optimal exercise routine. I would include some high intensity

1109
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:38,840
stuff, you know, and strength is another thing. But, um, so there, there's making some claims

1110
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:44,200
that would have very, very low minimum effective dose. Personally, I would say, so I, like I said,

1111
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:48,440
I'm probably running about 20 miles a week right now, which is six days a week, you know, half an

1112
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:54,520
hour with a couple of hard days. I think that's on the, to me, that's on the low end of, of, I,

1113
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:59,400
I think I would be healthier if I did more at this point. Um, and it's just, you think you would,

1114
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:03,240
you would actually be healthier. I know you'd be a better runner, but would you be a healthier,

1115
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:07,080
would you, would you live longer? I think, I think I would now. I think if I, if I had to,

1116
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:11,960
the first thing I would do, if, you know, if I was, if I had instant motivation powder that I was

1117
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:16,520
going to dust on myself, I would get, I would up my strength, my, my strength training routine.

1118
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:22,440
That would be the first thing I do if longevity was my first priority. Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

1119
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:27,480
So you wouldn't necessarily run more. You would take extra time and add it in the weight room or

1120
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:32,520
do something else? No, I would run more. Like if I was prioritizing, I would prioritize strength

1121
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:38,360
first, but I think if I could also, if I also changed, you know, I think for me, because,

1122
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:43,400
because I'm come from a background where I'm already, I'm used to running 20 miles a week,

1123
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:49,400
doesn't stress me very much. You know, it just slows down my decline. I think I could benefit

1124
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:54,520
from, let's say one long, longer run a week or something like that. This is gut feeler. Let's

1125
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,880
not, you know, I don't want to, this is not supported by anything other than my gut,

1126
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:02,360
but the, so the five to 10 minutes a day, it might be, it's definitely the right place to start

1127
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:07,800
if you're the 45 year old, you know, sedentary, you know, getting back into it, but I think you,

1128
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:13,320
you might want to push something a little higher, a little higher than that. Or certainly if you're

1129
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:17,400
doing, if you're doing 60 minutes a week, I wouldn't do it in five to 10 minute chunks. I would do some

1130
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:21,160
20 minute chunks or whatever. And what do we know about injury prevention in that person?

1131
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,720
That probably they're going to get injured because they're going to, because they're going to find

1132
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:30,280
that they're no matter how metabolically unfit they are, they're probably going to find that they

1133
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:37,000
gain metabolic fitness more quickly than they gain, you know, tendon stiffness and, and, and muscle

1134
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,200
strength and things like that. So in a sense, that's an even more reason to, to sort of take that

1135
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:47,640
guideline seriously. I mean, I'm talking about running, which, because I love, you're less likely

1136
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:51,320
to get injured if you go cycling or something like that. That's obviously, there's other,

1137
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:59,480
other ways of mitigating the, the injury thing. But yeah, from, so, but let me, let me just

1138
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:06,360
cast some doubt on the, on the J shape thing. There, there were two main studies on which this

1139
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:12,760
whole J curve hypothesis was founded. One was the Copenhagen study and, and one was the

1140
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:17,800
Cooper Clinic study. The Copenhagen study initially, it came out saying running is great and more

1141
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:22,760
running is better. And then they reanalyzed it with a new co-author and, and they concluded that

1142
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:28,280
running too much or too fast was bad. That was based on, there were two deaths in the,

1143
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:33,160
in the group that ran too fast. Like this is not the, the confidence interval was essentially infinite,

1144
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:39,960
like, but there's a more serious problem and that, and it's one that affects the Cooper Clinic

1145
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:44,440
data too, which is that when you're, when you have a big study of 50,000 people who were just

1146
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:48,520
randomly selected, they're not all the same. They all have different characteristics. So you have

1147
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:53,160
to find some way of adjusting for various characteristics. And without going too far

1148
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:59,320
down the rabbit hole, basically they statistically adjusted initially at least for things like

1149
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:04,760
cholesterol levels, weight, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, because you want to, you know,

1150
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:09,800
it's meaningless if you compare like we had this, you know, the non runners died sooner than the

1151
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:14,600
runners, but they were also 20 pounds heavier and had all these other risk factors. So you want to

1152
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:19,240
equalize it. But there's a problem that if you equalize it, you're a bit, you're, you're

1153
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:23,240
essentially saying, well, what are the health benefits of exercise if you don't do any exercise?

1154
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:27,640
Because the health benefits are of exercise are precisely in helping you regulate things like

1155
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:31,560
blood pressure and blood sugar and controversially, but I would say weight also.

1156
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:39,160
So essentially, I mean, to me, that was statistical misconduct, like that, that, so you're,

1157
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:45,000
you're saying if you take the people who exercise and you subtract, you basically penalize them for

1158
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:51,960
having lower weight, better lipids, better blood sugar, better blood pressure, sure. So you, you

1159
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:56,120
bring them in line so that they're just as overweight and just have all the other risk

1160
01:46:56,120 --> 01:47:01,560
factors. Then you see this J curve. Now, when they actually published the data in a peer-reviewed

1161
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:07,160
journal two years after it was presented, they'd eliminated that, that statistical method and the

1162
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:13,480
J curve had disappeared. You no longer saw the J curve. Now, you know, I don't, I don't want to

1163
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:18,280
just dismiss and say, therefore there's nothing to see. I'm just saying that if we're talking

1164
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:23,400
about where the curve happens, if you do that kind of statistical adjustment, which is the equivalent

1165
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:29,480
of saying like, I want to know whether smoking causes cancer, but I can't compare those smokers

1166
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:33,880
and non-smokers because the smokers have more lung cancer. So let's artificially equalize it

1167
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,120
and pretend that the smokers just have just as much cancer that, I mean, that you can't basically

1168
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:42,760
in statistical terms, you can't adjust for a variable, a mediating variable, a variable that's

1169
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:48,120
affected by the thing you're trying to measure. So, sorry, I mean, as you can tell, this is,

1170
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:51,320
this is a topic I get excited about. No, no, it is. And I've read what you've written about it,

1171
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:56,920
which is why I wanted to bring it up. I have a slightly different take on it, which is less about

1172
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:00,920
everything you've said and more of the practical issue. Because the practical issue is the one I

1173
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:05,800
get asked about a lot, which is, am I exercising too much? Right? This is the person asking the

1174
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:13,560
question. And so again, let's pause it for a moment that 99% of people are not exercising too much and

1175
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:20,760
don't even possess the fortitude to exercise too much, right? They don't, the pain tolerance isn't

1176
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:26,200
there, the obsession with exercise isn't there. So for 99% of people, we'd like to get them to

1177
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:31,800
exercise more or stay the same. We're dealing with 1% of the population, many of whom I know and one

1178
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:37,880
of whom I used to be, that we're kind of the hyper exercisers. Here's the bigger point I would make.

1179
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:44,360
It's probably less relevant, whether or not they're spending too many hours cycling, swimming,

1180
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:50,600
running, etc. Usually people in this sense, it's not the number of hours they're spending.

1181
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,600
It's the portfolio allocation of how they're spending it. That's the bigger problem.

1182
01:48:55,240 --> 01:49:01,160
It's that they're not well rounded, and they're not actually in pursuit of longevity. So the

1183
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:05,720
reality of it is, is training for the Tour de France going to increase your longevity?

1184
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:15,160
Absolutely not. No way. Like those guys finished the tour anemic, osteopenic, their upper bodies

1185
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:22,120
are emaciated, their posture is horrible. There's nothing about that that is setting you up to be

1186
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:29,640
an octogenarian that kicks ass. Nothing whatsoever. So their physiologic marvels, but their health

1187
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:36,200
span sucks, right? So that's using that as an extreme. What do I would be extrapolate that to

1188
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:42,840
the 40 year old who just can't hang up the dreams of being a professional athlete who's out there,

1189
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:49,560
running or riding or doing all of that stuff nonstop, but at the expense of maybe not doing

1190
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:53,640
some pilates to work on core strength. I hate the term, but you know what, and just for people

1191
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:57,400
understand what I'm saying, like not working on stability, not spending any time in the weight

1192
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:02,040
room, really working on strength, not varying the intensity of their workouts to work different

1193
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:06,440
energy systems. So to me, that's the bigger issue with people who are exercising too much. It's

1194
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:11,640
probably not that they're at that little tip of a J that may or may not exist. It's that they're

1195
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:16,360
squandering their time. It's like having all of this money, but you're invested. You have a lousy

1196
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:24,200
portfolio. Yeah. Okay. I agree with a lot of that. One thing I'll say is the important question

1197
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:28,920
you're implicitly asking there is what's your goal, right? Like what are you training for?

1198
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:31,880
Well, that's what I said, longevity. This was all predicated towards living a longer,

1199
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:35,800
healthier life and meaning not winning races or whatever.

1200
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:44,360
I would 100% agree. If someone comes to me and says, I want to optimize my exercise program for

1201
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:48,520
longevity, like I said before, there's no way I would tell them you should be training for a

1202
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:53,080
marathon. That's not because I think training for a marathon is bad, but like you said, it's an

1203
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:59,000
opportunity cost of other things you could be doing that a lot of other things you could be

1204
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,480
doing that would probably work better. So I think it's really important to disabuse people of the

1205
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:12,840
notion that in order to optimize your health, you should run a marathon. But where I bridle

1206
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:21,880
with the media coverage of that stream of research is that that's different from saying

1207
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:25,560
that people who are training for a marathon because they want to run a marathon or because

1208
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:31,800
they want to run a marathon as fast as possible should stop because that's bad. So it's like,

1209
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:39,000
of the category of people who have unhealthy behaviors who we should intervene to save them

1210
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,120
from themselves, it's like people who are training for a marathon to me are not even close to being

1211
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:48,760
in the same category as people like me who are sitting at a desk for eight hours a day or whatever

1212
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:55,080
the case may be. So it's like there's a difference between optimizing and avoiding serious problems.

1213
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:01,560
The one other thing I should acknowledge is, and you alluded to it, is there are other issues

1214
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:06,600
potential issues with lots of endurance training and arrhythmias is one of them and there's better

1215
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:19,480
evidence that that's a real thing. So there may be downsides to training really hard. On balance,

1216
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:24,760
overall, I would say I don't lie awake at night worrying about people who are running

1217
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:30,680
50 miles a week. Yeah, you're right. You should worry far more about people who are

1218
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:35,800
eating poorly, smoking, who are stressed out of their minds and don't have coping mechanisms for

1219
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:42,520
them. Yeah, there's not many people that you should be worrying about more or less rather.

1220
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:48,600
And if I think of the people I know who, let's say, run the equivalent of 50 miles a week or more,

1221
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:55,240
I can't think of any of them who would say, I'm doing this because I think this is what I need

1222
01:52:55,240 --> 01:53:02,440
in order to optimize my health span or lifespan. They obviously hope it's healthy, but I think if

1223
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:07,960
you're training for a marathon, most of them are doing it for competition or not self-competition

1224
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:12,520
in a way. And it sort of reminds me of some, you discussed this a little bit, I think, in your

1225
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:17,960
conversation with James O'Keefe, the sort of what's great about tennis and badminton and volleyball or

1226
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:23,640
whatever, it's the social element of it. And I think, sure, on average, running is a solitary

1227
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:29,880
sport, but for me, it's my primary social outlet. It's where I meet my friends, it's where I get

1228
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:36,440
together and catch up on the week on an easy run. So I think that's true for a lot of people who,

1229
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:41,160
once you get into that 50 miles a week, not for everyone, but for a lot of people, it's a social

1230
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:49,160
element. It's pleasurable, it's a stress reliever. So it goes beyond the... If you take that away,

1231
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:52,680
I'm not sure it nets out as positive.

1232
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:57,560
You know, one of the things that I think is... I don't know that we'll ever know an answer. I

1233
01:53:57,560 --> 01:54:00,440
don't know that we'll ever have an answer to the question, but I think one of the challenges of

1234
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:05,080
trying to reconcile all of these disparate data sources is it's all apples and oranges with respect

1235
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:13,080
to the metrics, right? It's you're comparing hours of exercise a week to mileage run to true

1236
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:19,960
measures of fitness like VO2 max. I guess the question is, and I've thought a lot about this,

1237
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:27,960
I'd be very curious to your thoughts. If you could reverse engineer where you want your VO2 max to

1238
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:34,520
be when you're 90, what would it be? Because if you have a sense of what your VO2 max should be

1239
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:40,920
when you're 90, you kind of know what it needs to be when you're 80, 70, 60, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1240
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:46,920
all the way back. And, you know, at that point, it's not necessarily about how fast you want to

1241
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:51,080
run a mile, though you may say, look, when I'm 90, I still want to run a nine minute mile. I don't

1242
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:56,280
know. But it really starts to get into the activities of daily living and how much pain

1243
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:00,120
are you willing to tolerate to walk up two flights of stairs with your groceries?

1244
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:08,360
And I suspect... So I know for me, and I don't know for me, I hypothesize for me that when I'm 90,

1245
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:14,120
the real risk is that I won't be able to get up out of a chair more than that I won't have the

1246
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:18,280
VO2 max. And there are people that they've... I don't remember the exact numbers, but there are

1247
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,920
thresholds of VO2 max below which they hypothesize that you can't... I can't remember if it's like

1248
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:28,280
18 or maybe it's nine or something like that, where it's like, at this point, you've crossed

1249
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:31,320
the sort of mortality news where we think you're going to die in a few years because you can't do

1250
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:37,080
activities of daily living. So there is some research into that. But for me, as just my personal,

1251
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:43,400
I can look at myself and say, you know what, Alex, far before your VO2 max is too low,

1252
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:46,920
you're going to be the guy who falls on the floor and can't get up. And so, again,

1253
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:54,120
from a health perspective, that's why I said, the next thing I... If I had magic motivation dust,

1254
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:58,280
it would be like, you need to put on some muscle mass. And for other people, it would be totally

1255
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:02,760
different. There are people I know who don't necessarily exercise a lot, but who just have

1256
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:09,080
a lot more muscle mass than me. And it's like, you need to make sure your aerobic fitness is

1257
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:13,560
taken care of. And maybe you don't need to worry as much as me about muscle mass. So there's...

1258
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:17,880
Yeah, but I mean, I agree. You figure out where you want to be. And for all those different things,

1259
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,920
so I'm doing exactly what you said, except I'm doing it for muscle mass. And I'm like,

1260
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:25,080
ooh, this trajectory is not good. And of course, part of that's predicated on the idea that we

1261
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:29,080
know there's an inevitability of decline. So if you do nothing, you're going to lose X pounds of

1262
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:35,800
muscle per decade, if you're lucky, with a tailwind. If you train really hard, you might be able to

1263
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:41,400
reduce it to this amount of loss. And if you really go crazy, you might even be able to keep it flat.

1264
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:48,680
But here's the scenario under which that occurs. What do you think is the... I mean, I assume there

1265
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:54,280
are pretty clear tables on what the decade by decade drop of maximum aerobic output is.

1266
01:56:54,280 --> 01:57:01,240
There are. I mean, the problem with the tables is that they draw a nice smooth line. You lose,

1267
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:06,440
I think it's 9% per decade or something like that, at least in the... Once you get into your 70s,

1268
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:13,000
it gets steeper. There's an inflection point. The sort of revised thinking is that that works

1269
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:19,960
on a population level. But what actually happens is the decline is not that steep for any individual.

1270
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:22,600
But what happens is you have certain events in your life. You have an...

1271
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:26,600
You get an injury and you stop training for six months and then you're hosed.

1272
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:31,400
Yeah. So either you have reduced activity for six months or you have bedrest for a week,

1273
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:37,720
which can be disastrous, and you lose 7% in the course of a week and you only get 2% back.

1274
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:44,040
And so it's this punctuated decline. And so, I mean, that puts a lot of emphasis. It sort of

1275
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:49,480
points to the idea of really taking care to avoid, to the extent possible, obviously, to avoid these

1276
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:55,960
events. Because you can actually, in the absence of those events, the decline doesn't have to be

1277
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:59,800
that steep. You can hang on probably better than people used to think.

1278
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,600
Can you say more about that? Because I don't think this point can be stressed enough.

1279
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:12,280
Realistically, how much aerobic capacity, maximal aerobic capacity, can a person lose with a couple

1280
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:19,640
weeks of inactivity? And what's the difference between being bedridden versus going on vacation

1281
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:23,160
to Europe where you're not, quote unquote, training, but you're still walking every day?

1282
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:29,160
Like neither of those is exercise per se, but one is active and one is complete inactivity.

1283
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:35,960
Bedrest is terrifying. There's a guy named Luke Van Loon in the Netherlands. His focus is muscular

1284
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:40,280
strength, but he's done a bunch of bedrest studies. And I saw him give a talk once and he had this

1285
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:46,520
great anecdote about, it's really hard to get old people to put on muscle, but they just managed to

1286
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:50,840
finish this two and a half year study where they got, I can't remember, some fairly large number of

1287
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:55,240
septuagenarians, octogenarians to do strength training. And they'd put on like two and a half

1288
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:59,080
kilograms of muscle, which is a huge victory. And they were feeling really good about it.

1289
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:04,840
And then the results came in for their one week bedrest study and they'd lost like 2.6 kilograms

1290
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:10,920
of muscle in one week. So it's like they did this like Herculean effort to shepherd these

1291
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:17,640
people through strength training for a long period of time with full support. Man, whatever it is,

1292
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:23,560
grandma gets pneumonia and is in hospital for a week, bam, she's lost a year of training or

1293
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:28,760
whatever the case may be. So I don't have the numbers at hand for V2 max. I think it's like

1294
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:35,720
up to 20, maybe 10 to 20% in that range if you stop training for a month. It depends where you're

1295
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:41,320
starting though. If you're well-trained for a short period of time, you'll lose it quickly.

1296
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:45,720
If you haven't been training, then resting doesn't make any difference. And if you're well-trained

1297
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:49,400
for a long, long period of time, then you have structural adaptations that are going to take

1298
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:57,320
a lot longer to disappear. So there's no one number for anyone. And the one thing I would add

1299
01:59:57,320 --> 02:00:02,280
is that this is not a recommendation that you should never take a break from exercise,

1300
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:07,160
that you should be obsessive and train 365 days a year. Certainly if you're training hard,

1301
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:15,560
if you're training as a marathoner, say, man, you should take a week or two off. And off doesn't

1302
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:19,960
mean bed rest. It means play a couple of games of tennis, go for walks, chill out, go for some bike

1303
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:26,840
rides or whatever. So you shouldn't be terrified of missing a day, but you should be terrified of

1304
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:33,480
bed rest. Luke Van Loon, one of the things he said is like, if you're on bed rest, hospitals

1305
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:39,560
should be forcing you, if you're at all possible, to walk down the hallway to get your meal. Even

1306
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:45,000
just walking down the hallway is infinitely better than not moving at all. Got. Never more

1307
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:50,440
sort of relevant than what we're seeing today with so many people in hospitals and a lot of the

1308
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:56,680
isolation stuff that's going on. Let's go back to something you said about strength. What do you

1309
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:02,680
think matters more, strength or muscle mass? So there's a study I wrote about recently,

1310
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:08,680
I would hesitate to claim it as the absolute truth, but that analyzed, I think it put together

1311
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:14,840
like six different cohorts with a total of about 50,000 people. So pretty good data. And they found

1312
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:21,800
that strength was actually a better predictor than muscle mass. So it's better to have the

1313
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:26,520
functionality to be able to push yourself up out of the chair than it is to have a bunch of muscle

1314
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:30,760
if you're not good at using it. I'm sure that's maybe not true at the margins. If you lose enough

1315
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:37,640
muscle mass, then you become limited by your actual muscle mass. But I think for a lot of

1316
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:41,480
people, they have enough muscle mass, but they're untrained. The neuromuscular connections are not

1317
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:47,320
optimized. And so they're not strong, even though they have enough actual flesh there.

1318
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:54,600
And was that for all cause mortality or yeah. So that's interesting. I mean, that doesn't sound like

1319
02:01:54,600 --> 02:02:01,160
a crazy conclusion. I generally try to say, look, I think both of these things are important for

1320
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:05,320
different reasons. I think of strength as you described that it's that functional, it's the

1321
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:09,640
difference between the person who slips down the flight of stairs, but has the strength to grab the

1322
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:15,160
rail and prevent that from being a lethal injury or the type of injury that puts them in the hospital

1323
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:21,320
for a month. You know, grip strength is just so highly correlated, at least with survival. And I

1324
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:24,840
think a lot of it has to do with that kind of stuff, getting up out of the chair, getting up off

1325
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:30,120
the floor at the same side or the flip side of that is I think muscle mass speaks to some of the

1326
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:37,000
other physiologic things like glycogen stores and glucose disposal and glucose homeostasis in general

1327
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:44,840
and insulin sensitivity. So again, I, you know, I rail against the idea that, you know, people say,

1328
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:49,240
I just, I'm okay being strong. I just don't want to be big. And it's sort of like the myth of

1329
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:53,480
accidental muscle, you know, I wish I had that problem. It's like, Oh, I looked at a gym and I

1330
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:57,560
accidentally put on 10 pounds of muscle. I hear people saying that. And I'm like, I wouldn't worry

1331
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:04,040
about that. Anything else about injury? I mean, you've written a lot about this in terms of

1332
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:08,680
different, you know, competing theories around injury. And do you think, how much do you think

1333
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:14,920
it varies by sport? And I guess most importantly, what is the implication for people who tend to

1334
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:19,720
get injured in life? Not, you know, they're, they're walking down the street and they pull a calf

1335
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:27,320
muscle versus they're, you know, out there doing your tempo run. Yeah. So for me, so I've been,

1336
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:31,880
willingly run, willingly embroiled in lots of debates about injuries over the last

1337
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:37,000
decade and a half. And a lot of them focus on things like running shoes, the proper running

1338
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:43,640
form, you know, it's, is, is the height of your insole going to affect your risk of injury. And

1339
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:52,440
that stuff's fun. And it's, it's not, it's not zero impact, but I think to me, there's a guy

1340
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:58,120
named Ben O'Nig, who's a sort of famous biomechanist who's done a lot of work on running injuries and

1341
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:04,520
stuff. And his take in one of his studies was that, look, 80% of running injuries are

1342
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:09,720
what he would call training, are originally a result of what he would call training errors.

1343
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:15,640
So yeah, it's nice, you know, there's 20% to work with on, you know, shoes or whatever, you know,

1344
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:22,520
prehabilitation and balance, yada, yada, yada. Most of, most of what we need to worry about is

1345
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:27,640
doing too much too soon. That's an, you know, and that's an oversimplification. But certainly when

1346
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:31,640
we're talking about overuse injuries, you know, I'm not talking about like getting tackled on the

1347
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:38,920
football field. So I mean, I really think, especially for people who are, so for people

1348
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:47,480
who are starting out or ramping up an exercise program, just that, that, that, that patience is

1349
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:52,040
so important and that understanding that you will probably overestimate what you can accomplish in

1350
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:55,800
the short term. And you'll probably underestimate what you can accomplish in the longterm.

1351
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:01,000
But if you do, and if you fall into that trap, you're dramatically raising your injury risk,

1352
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,040
because you're going to try and ramp up too quickly. Because again, you can gain metabolic

1353
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:08,760
fitness more quickly than you can alter the structure of your joints and ligaments and

1354
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:14,520
things like that. So I mean, that's, if there's one takeaway message, it would be like,

1355
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:23,320
it's not about the magical gadget or the new way of running or the, you know, the measuring device,

1356
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:29,400
it's like, just be patient, be smart. You know, you get home, you have something that's aching,

1357
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:33,640
you don't want to miss the next day's session and you don't want to become, it's always a,

1358
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:38,520
a balance, right? Between being, am I being lazy or am I being safe? Well,

1359
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:45,880
you want to err on the side of safe, certainly, until you start getting a better handle on which

1360
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:50,760
aches and pains are normal and which ones aren't. I mean, there's a whole other,

1361
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:58,360
you know, we can get into things like, you know, balance training or training load monitoring.

1362
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:02,360
Well, let's, yeah, let's talk about acute versus chronic load training. I mean, I used to have a

1363
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:07,160
program called training peaks that would track this for me. So it saw every single day,

1364
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:12,120
how many miles I rode and it actually did it more by kilojoules than miles. So it was total energy

1365
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:18,840
expenditure. But if you were giving someone some guidance, some rules of thumb, if they were

1366
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:23,720
becoming active and we'd have to get into the formulas, but just using the principles of acute

1367
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:28,920
versus chronic load balance, how would you help them think through everything you just said with

1368
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,720
these metrics? So the background is that the rule of thumb that they used to teach runners is the

1369
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:38,680
10% rule, never increase your mileage more than 10%. And it's a rule that makes no sense at the,

1370
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:42,440
at the margins. Like if you, if you start by running one mile, then you know, you're never going

1371
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:48,760
to get above five miles in your lifetime or whatever. But yeah, so I think that's a really

1372
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:54,760
basically idea is trying to avoid the too much too soon problem. Now, this idea of an acute to

1373
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:59,160
chronic workload ratio is a sort of more sophisticated version of that. And the idea is,

1374
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:06,600
how much are you doing now versus how much is your body used to? And, you know, the way that

1375
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:11,960
the papers, the academic papers do it is what's your weekly load, whether you do it in joules or

1376
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:17,080
miles or minutes, and what's your average weekly load over the last four weeks. And this is when

1377
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:21,320
they started publishing this, I was like, Hey, that's, I designed my own training log back in

1378
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:25,960
the nineties and printed it out. And that's the two things I had at the bottom was kilometers that

1379
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:31,480
week and average four week average kilometers. And it's not because it gets you. Why did you settle

1380
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:35,240
on four weeks, by the way, as opposed to three weeks or five weeks? How did you arrive at that?

1381
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:40,440
Do you remember? Yeah, you know, there was no deep thinking involved that it was basically a week

1382
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:45,880
versus a month. And, and, you know, you can, you can argue it that, yeah, you need at least, you

1383
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:49,800
need a decent amount of time because otherwise you have one week where you miss a couple of days

1384
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:53,320
due to injury. And then all of a sudden your four week average is totally skewed. Or if it's a three

1385
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:57,320
week, you know, if there are something and five weeks at a six weeks, you know, at a certain point,

1386
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:01,480
you're moving so far back that your body don't no longer cares what you were capable of doing

1387
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:06,440
eight weeks ago, or at least not as much. So four weeks, it's just a, you know, that it's kind of a

1388
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:13,880
four, if you've done something for four weeks in a row and you're feeling okay, then you can,

1389
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:19,640
you kind of assume that yeah, your body's able to handle that load. And so then this allows you,

1390
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:26,040
it's just a quick way of seeing if there's any deviations. It's like, Oh, my, you know, my,

1391
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:34,280
this week I did 50% more than my four week average. That's, that's a bad, bad song. It doesn't

1392
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:39,080
mean you're going to get injured. There's all sorts of contextual things you have to consider

1393
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:43,960
in it. But having that as one input into your larger matrix of all the things that you're

1394
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:49,800
considering, like, do I feel any aches and pains? Am I what's my absolute load, not just the ratio,

1395
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:55,800
but is this more than I've ever done before? And, you know, all the, you consider all those things.

1396
02:08:55,800 --> 02:09:02,760
And I think that acute to chronic ratio, or just to put it more simply, keeping track of how much

1397
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:07,560
you're how hard you're going now versus how hard you've been going in the previous month,

1398
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:13,320
or how much you've been doing, let's say, is useful. Now, I should add that there's controversy

1399
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:16,760
in the literature. There's a bunch of people who say that the supposed predictive value of

1400
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:24,040
acute to chronic workload ratio is a statistical artifact. It may be, it may not be, I'm not too

1401
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:30,920
worried about that. To me, this is not about statistical predictive power. It's just about

1402
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:37,080
keeping an eye on, on trends and knowing if you're, if you're way out of whack with what you've been

1403
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:45,320
doing before. And as a general rule, you know, let's say if you're 20% higher, that's time to

1404
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:49,960
start making sure you know what you're doing. Yeah. Or just, you know, and backing it off,

1405
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:55,320
maybe that next week. Yeah. I mean, you know, unless you have some compelling reason to think

1406
02:09:55,320 --> 02:10:03,080
that you can handle that, if you're, if you're exceeding 20%, then probably, yeah, be cautious

1407
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:07,720
and ideally back off. So you alluded to it earlier, but let's talk a little bit about high

1408
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:15,480
intensity interval training. It's getting a lot of attention today, obviously. You know, most

1409
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:20,680
people are familiar with what a Tabata is, though Tabata himself is not the guy that actually designed

1410
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:28,840
the protocol, but everybody still refers to it by his name. Where do you think this fits into the

1411
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:35,560
hierarchy of, again, not a specific athlete who's, you know, training to run the mile or the marathon,

1412
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:42,920
but a person who's trying to be healthy. How much of a, how much of a shortcut efficiency gain is it?

1413
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:48,600
Again, let's, let's use the Tabata interval as an example, where you're going all out for 20 seconds,

1414
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:55,480
resting for 10 and repeating it eight times. And by the way, wouldn't we argue from your research

1415
02:10:55,480 --> 02:11:00,200
and endure that you can't technically go all out for 20 seconds, that you're, you're really,

1416
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:06,440
I've started when I do all out intervals, I now limit them to 10 seconds because I

1417
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:12,600
actually started paying attention and realizing I was subconsciously pacing myself at 20 second

1418
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:18,440
all outs. But anyway, that's, that's, I don't know what you think about that, that, that idea,

1419
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:24,120
but I remember reading in your book that, that wasn't the case that we technically can't go all

1420
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:29,960
out for 20 seconds. It certainly doesn't seem that way. And, you know, like, look, Usain Bolt

1421
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:34,280
or world-class sprinters don't go as fast. I mean, it's complicated by the curve, but they go,

1422
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,800
they don't set world records en route to 200 meters. They're pacing themselves even for 20

1423
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:48,680
seconds. I just have to tell one quick story about Tabata. I was at a conference and at the

1424
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:51,560
poster session where the researchers are in front of their posters talking about it. And I was, it

1425
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:57,640
was a research on the, from the McMaster group, which has popularized high intensity interval

1426
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:01,160
training. And one of the postdocs was there explaining his interval, high intensity interval

1427
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:06,920
training research. And someone came up and asked him a question and handed him his business card

1428
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:10,760
at the time. And I noticed the postdoc, he looked down as he was answering the question, he glanced

1429
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:14,440
at him with the business card and his eyebrows just went like halfway up his forehead. And I

1430
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:18,040
peeked over and it was like, Oh, that's Tabata. That's cool. I didn't realize this was a real

1431
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:24,040
person. So he was, he was there, you know, asking questions about intervals. Anyway, where do I

1432
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:30,440
think intervals fit? I think they're super important. When circa 2008, when high intensity

1433
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:37,320
intervals started to be a big buzzword, I was like, how is this a buzzword? That's how runners

1434
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,880
train. Like one of the studies out of the McMaster group was like, let's do 10 times a minute. It's

1435
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:46,760
like, that's the Roger Bannister. That's what, that's how he broke the four minute mile in 1954.

1436
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:50,520
What's new about this, but it was new to a lot of people. A lot of people were like, I need to go

1437
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:57,480
45 minutes. I need to go an hour and to do this, I need to die. So there is, let me put it this way.

1438
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:03,000
I guess what I was really good at is the compression of that, right? It's the, I don't know if you saw

1439
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,840
this, well, I'll let you finish this, but then I'll bring it to where I'm going, which is what

1440
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:16,280
are the limits of how much you can shrink. Yeah. Well, I'll just, I'll just say that as two general

1441
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:22,680
points. One is that as a runner, one thing I know is that you will never ever run fast relative to

1442
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:28,840
your abilities if you don't do interval training. The second thing I would say is you probably won't

1443
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:33,480
run as fast as you could if you only do interval training. Now, some people do do only interval

1444
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:38,120
training, but that's usually they're doing it so slowly that it's not different from just doing a

1445
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:42,520
sustained thing. So to me, when you look at the studies, it's like, let's compare eight weeks of

1446
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:49,880
three interval workouts a week to eight weeks of three 45 minute sustained sessions. It's like,

1447
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:57,160
okay, that's interesting. It's useful to know, but I really don't think that's what is optimized and

1448
02:13:57,160 --> 02:14:01,320
what we should be comparing it to. What about one short sprint interval session, one medium interval

1449
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:07,960
session, and one 45 minute session? That's, or some portfolio is to me, because there's pretty

1450
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:13,800
clear evidence that you can get to the same or some of the same health outcomes. You can get the

1451
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:19,800
same improvement in insulin sensitivity say, but the mechanisms may be different if you're doing

1452
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:24,760
a sprint interval session versus, or if you're doing sprint interval training versus sustained

1453
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:28,200
training. And so it's like, well, if you've got two different mechanisms, let's hit them both

1454
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:31,960
because presumably we're going to get a little one plus one is going to be at least equal to,

1455
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:39,720
1.2 or something like that. So I think interval, I would 100% recommend to anyone that they should

1456
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:44,200
be including some form of interval training in their routine. If they're interested in health

1457
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:48,920
or performance, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It's the only thing unless they, that's what

1458
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:53,480
they want to do. I would put it as part of a portfolio. And as far as the sprint stuff goes,

1459
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:59,000
we can talk about this, but it's like, it has been funny to watch the, it's not like one upmanship,

1460
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:04,040
it's one downmanship. How short can we make this? Like, okay, I thought about interval training for

1461
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:09,240
a millisecond last night. Look, I got fitter. It's amazing. Well, that's only a, it's only a,

1462
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:15,880
a slight exaggeration from a study that came out recently from actually from, from here in UT

1463
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:23,320
Austin, um, Ed Coyle, who is a, is a physiologist and published a study looking at four seconds

1464
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:30,440
all out 56 seconds of rest. So it's on the minute, every minute on the minute, but only four seconds

1465
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:36,040
all out. And this was done, I believe for 15 minutes. And then they progressed to basically

1466
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:44,120
four seconds all out twice a minute. So you go four seconds all out, 26 seconds of rest, repeat,

1467
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:51,400
you know, for 20 minutes, something to that effect. Um, again, I, you know, here's my take on these

1468
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:56,200
things. It comes down to a concept you raised earlier, which is there's an opportunity cost to

1469
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:03,240
them. It, they're usually comparing that to doing nothing. And is that better than sitting on the

1470
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:10,120
couch? Yes. But if you gave a, if you gave me 40 minutes a day, could I come up with a more

1471
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:16,280
efficient way to get a benefit? I probably could. And then it becomes a question of what's the

1472
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:21,080
efficacy versus effectiveness of this intervention. And I think that's the other piece of this,

1473
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:29,480
right? Which is, I think people like you and I like exercise so much that we get to focus all of our

1474
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:37,400
effort or interest on efficacy. What is actually going to do the best, produce the best results

1475
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:43,640
when adhered to perfectly. But I accept the fact that many people don't enjoy exercise. And therefore

1476
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:49,080
the real world applicability of a problem becomes its effectiveness. It's not what can be done in a

1477
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:55,480
laboratory for six weeks when you're a paid subject. It's what are you going to be willing to do on your

1478
02:16:55,480 --> 02:17:01,960
own when you have to rely on your own sprinkling of motivation dust day in and day out. And so

1479
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:07,720
I guess on some level, that's where I've become a little bit more accepting of the fact that, hey,

1480
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:13,720
if people are willing to do shorter interval workouts, provided they don't get injured,

1481
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:18,840
that's always the fear I have when people jump right into these high intensity interval workouts

1482
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:24,840
without any of the foundational strength that goes into it. If the alternative is doing nothing,

1483
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:30,040
well, then it's better. But I guess secretly, I just hope that I can convince people that they're

1484
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:35,000
better off learning to love exercise, which again, I think is why a book like yours is so great,

1485
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:41,960
right? It explains like how we evolved and, you know, the more we can think about reconciling

1486
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:48,440
what we are today with what we spent a million years becoming, perhaps the less foreign that feels.

1487
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:55,640
So I think you've put your finger on exactly the issue, which is it's yeah, it's not about

1488
02:17:56,360 --> 02:18:00,120
what does better in this lab context. It's what will people do. And I actually,

1489
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:08,520
I'm a little bit skeptical that four seconds at the intensity that you have to do those intervals

1490
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:16,360
is more acceptable to the average person than, then let's say one minute. So

1491
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:21,400
going back to a little history on the hit stuff, the first hit protocol was windgate test,

1492
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:26,360
which is like 30 seconds all out. And anyone who's done a windgate test, you know,

1493
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:29,560
if you do it in the lab, they're screaming at you. It's like, you know, we're going to shoot your

1494
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:34,680
mother. If you don't go as hard as you can and you get every people puke after windgate tests.

1495
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:40,280
So the original protocol was four windgate tests with seven minutes rest. Because that's how hard

1496
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:44,280
they are going back. It's like what we were saying earlier about how hard an 800 meter race,

1497
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:49,240
a two meter, two minute race can be compared to like a marathon. You can really suffer in those

1498
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:54,920
30 seconds. And so when they're like, well, okay, it works in the lab, but in real life,

1499
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:58,920
what's, what are people going to do? Their answer initially wasn't like we should make it shorter.

1500
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:03,000
It was, well, the intensity that people can actually get to in real life, we should,

1501
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,760
that's where the 60 second on 60 second off protocol came from. Because it's like,

1502
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:14,040
it's easier for people to accept 60 seconds pretty hard than it is to expect them to imagine the,

1503
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:19,080
you know, homicidal drill surgeon behind them yelling at them to get all of it out of themselves

1504
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:23,000
in 30 seconds. Now you're going down to let's say there's been 20 seconds, there's been 10 seconds,

1505
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:28,760
there's been four seconds. It takes, it's hard, it takes a lot of motivation, you have to be

1506
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:35,880
a hundred percent on to get the most out of this four second or 10 second or whatever interval. So

1507
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:42,600
there's a lot of debate understandably about like, okay, well, which is it that people will do? Would

1508
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:49,160
they rather do 20 minutes at medium or, you know, 40 minutes easy or four seconds hard? I think

1509
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:52,280
there's a lot of debate because there's different, there's a lot of different people, people like

1510
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:57,480
different things. And some people are, love that, that, that power thing and that that's great. And,

1511
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:01,720
and again, like you said, it's, I don't think it's as good as doing a mixed portfolio of things.

1512
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:08,200
But I think it's, it's pretty good. And if they'll do it, that's great. But I think the, the, the

1513
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:12,360
assumption of this race to the bottom of how, how short can you make the interval is that people

1514
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:17,400
like it more. And I'm not sure that's true for everyone. I love your comment about, I thought

1515
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:23,960
about high intensity intervals for a second last night. I will say this, one of the things that I

1516
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:29,080
think is a big challenge here is most people aren't clear on the, the why they just want to

1517
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:34,360
do the what, you know, this is sort of the going back to my pet peeve of people confusing strategy

1518
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:40,520
for tactics. And I don't, I think if people don't understand the benefits of the different types of

1519
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:46,360
exercises and the why you're doing them, you know, actually reverse engineering what the purpose is.

1520
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:52,280
So you're thinking about the 90 year old version of you in a chair, he needs to get up. Well, that

1521
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:56,600
gives you the motivation to do strength training. And if you didn't have the aerobic conditioning,

1522
02:20:56,600 --> 02:21:01,720
you'd start to think, well, once I get up out of said chair, what do I want to do? Oh, I might

1523
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:07,560
actually want to go and walk around the block with my grandchild. Oh, well, what would that involve?

1524
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:12,360
Well, at my house, there's a hill and that hill goes from here to there. And what if I want to

1525
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:17,640
stick them in a wagon and pull them like that's actually going to require aerobic capacity. And

1526
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:22,120
that hill is pretty short. So it's actually going to be pretty intense. Like it actually requires it

1527
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:27,800
near maximal effort for me. And so I just think that the more people can tether what it is they

1528
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:34,680
are doing this for to something real, it becomes a little easier to do these abstract workouts.

1529
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:38,840
Because otherwise, like, what are we doing? Right? Like once you stop competing in something,

1530
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:43,800
which is, you know, a fraction of the percent of the population, all this exercise stuff becomes

1531
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:50,040
abstract. And frankly, you know, the practice of medicine doesn't do a great job communicating the

1532
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:55,000
why. Right? I mean, most, most people know they should exercise, but I don't think they've really

1533
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:02,120
had a great explanation as to, you know, for example, fighting cancer, when you're fit is

1534
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:07,320
probably a lot easier than fighting cancer when you're not fit, simply based on the energetics of

1535
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:13,080
your immune system. Most people don't know that. And therefore, it's a bit abstract why they should

1536
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:18,280
be exercising so much. Yeah, I mean, you could say the definition of insanity is telling people

1537
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:22,280
that exercise is good for them yet again, and hoping that that on its own is going to convince

1538
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:27,160
people to exercise it. It's clear that doesn't work. So I think, you know, what you say is right,

1539
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:34,280
you need to make it visceral and to relate to things that people care about. And so that

1540
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:38,440
people care about different things. So you have to understand what each person cares about,

1541
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:43,240
and then find out what the right exercise for them is that's going to connect for them.

1542
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:49,560
Last thing I want to ask you about Alex is basically the merger of the two careers you've

1543
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:57,320
had. I've probably been pretty critical of your profession, which is science journalists,

1544
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:03,640
or journalists who cover science, let's put it that way. Because truthfully, I think most of them

1545
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:10,680
are really bad. And I think many of them actually border on negligent and I think they cause,

1546
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:19,160
on some levels, more harm than good to the public. I mean, obviously, I don't put you in that category

1547
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:22,440
and there are many people I don't put in that category who I think are excellent at science

1548
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:30,280
journalism, but they're really in the minority. So most of the sensationalized headlines,

1549
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,520
you know, and frankly, even the news stories that just don't have the detail that I think

1550
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:43,400
should at least be covered in a news story, given the understanding that very few people

1551
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:47,800
are going to go back to the primary source and read it, places an enormous responsibility on

1552
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:53,320
scientific journalism. Do you think there's a systematic way to make this process better?

1553
02:23:54,760 --> 02:24:03,080
Oh, that's a that's a heavy question. The problem is, are these my perception is the

1554
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:06,280
problem? And this is self-serving since I'm a science journalist, is that

1555
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:15,560
journalism now follows the audience. And I started out in 2006, let's say, just at the point where

1556
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:21,400
news organizations were first starting to be able to see how many people clicked on a story.

1557
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:29,080
And this was one of the great catastrophes of journalism in some ways, because it's terrifying

1558
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:35,400
to find out what people click on. It's unhealthy for the news organizations to find out what people

1559
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:41,400
click on. I can remember so that the big newspaper in Canada is the Globe and Mail. And, you know,

1560
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:46,440
early on, as newspapers went online, they started to, you know, people realized it's kind of nice to

1561
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:51,240
have what are the top 10 most clicked on stories. So then you can go and, and I remember when the

1562
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:56,120
Globe, as far as I remember, I don't know the exact timeline, but shortly after they introduced

1563
02:24:56,120 --> 02:25:02,120
this feature, I was like, how is it that the top 10 stories on the Globe and Mail website,

1564
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:07,480
like three of them are about Britney Spears, two of them are about like, you know, it was just like,

1565
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:12,840
I thought the Globe and Mail is supposed to be the kind of highbrow newspaper in Canada. And it

1566
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:18,040
looks like it's a bunch of simpering morons who are clicking. But then I look at what I click on

1567
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:22,200
sometimes, and sometimes you're just tired and you click on this sort of craziest thing. So anyway,

1568
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:30,760
sorry, I'm drifting off the point here, which is that to fix science journalism, you need,

1569
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:37,640
or to encourage good science journalism, you need people to read good science journalism. And

1570
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:43,720
I think newspapers are realizing that following the audience has turned out to be a bad move,

1571
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:47,960
because they've ended up losing the trust in audience. But by giving people what they thought

1572
02:25:47,960 --> 02:25:54,280
they wanted, you ended up basically giving them crap and then having people recognize that they

1573
02:25:54,280 --> 02:26:03,000
were being fed crap and then kind of rebel against it. So like, where I started my journalism, my

1574
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,440
science, my sports science journalism career, in some sense was I started a blog on WordPress in

1575
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:13,880
like, I don't know, 2008 or something, where I was just like, you know what, I can't write this in a

1576
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:18,680
newspaper article. But on this blog, I know there are people who are interested in the details of

1577
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:22,680
what the study says. I'm going to have the key figure from the study. And I'm going to say how

1578
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:26,280
many people were in the, you know, how many subjects there were and what their characteristics

1579
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:33,400
were and what the intervention was. And that's the blog that became, it got taken on to Runner's

1580
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:37,880
World in 2012, and then moved over to Outside in 2017. It turned out there was an audience for that,

1581
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:45,080
which is encouraging. So I think, I guess I'm not answering your question at all, which is how do

1582
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:57,000
you fix it? But I think that the finding an audience that appreciates it is, or at least having some,

1583
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:04,360
I don't know, let's see, what am I trying to say here? That the news organizations aren't going to

1584
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:17,480
insist on scientifically qualified journalists, unless there's repercussions or feedback when

1585
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:22,120
there's bad journalism. And I think the initial signals were the opposite. They were actually

1586
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:29,160
getting feedback that the less complicated it was, and the more sensational it was, the more feedback

1587
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:34,760
they got. So maybe, you know, to try and actually give one concrete answer to your question is that

1588
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:42,680
the move away from advertising and towards subscription based models, I think has helped,

1589
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:48,440
and hopefully will continue to help move away from like, just let's do what's most sensational to

1590
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:51,880
let's do what's most, let's give people a filling meal that, you know, that they're not going to be

1591
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:57,560
hungry 10 minutes later. So maybe that trend is a good one in some ways.

1592
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:03,160
Yeah. And look, I don't know that I expected you to have an answer because this is a question I've

1593
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:10,680
thought about for a decade, actually, probably around 2011 is when I started really becoming

1594
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:16,440
frustrated with journalism and science, which is not to say that's when it started. I think that's

1595
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:21,640
just when I began to notice it enough and realize that the signal to noise ratio had fallen to

1596
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:29,720
zero. And I, you know, and of course to this, you know, if you ask my friends, there's no better way

1597
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:34,760
to drive me nuts than just a forward me a headline and without even a question, like as though somehow

1598
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:39,480
I'm supposed to read this idiotic headline and know what your question is of me. But, uh, yeah,

1599
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:44,040
look, I still get three of those a day. So, um, anyway, Alex, this has been, this has been awesome.

1600
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:48,360
I have, like I said, I've wanted to sit down with you for a couple of years since I read Endure and

1601
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:53,480
I can't recommend it highly enough. I find it riveting. Um, I think you're a, you're a, you're

1602
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:57,800
a great writer and a great storyteller. And that that's to me, I think one of the gems of reading a

1603
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:02,040
book like that is you, you're reading about science, but you're also reading it in the context of

1604
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:07,080
amazing stories, personal stories, stories of other, uh, individuals. So thank you very much for

1605
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:11,720
that contribution and, and, and all of your amazing stuff on outside, which I, I, again,

1606
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:15,400
I can't get over how prolific you are. And it's just, it's, it's gem after gem.

1607
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:20,920
Well, thanks Peter. It's been a real privilege to have a chance to talk to you and I've, I've

1608
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:25,480
appreciated your work over the years and I really, I'm glad we had a chance to, uh, to talk and I'm

1609
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:30,760
just sorry, my answers were so rambling. Not at all. Thanks Alex. Thanks Peter.

02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:28,440
of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and

1621
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:34,200
necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I believe in, but for which I'm not

1622
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:38,920
getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in

1623
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:43,000
as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member only benefits, you can head

1624
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:50,440
over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. You can find me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook,
