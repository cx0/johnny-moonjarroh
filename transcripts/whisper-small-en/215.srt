00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,160
today's episode. My guest today is Dr. Mike Gershon. Mike is a professor of pathology and

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,640
cell biology at Columbia University, where his research focuses on the neural control of the

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,560
gastrointestinal tract and the role of serotonin in the gut as a neurotransmitter. Mike earned his

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,080
medical degree from Cornell University, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at Oxford. Mike has

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,640
received numerous awards and honors over the years, published hundreds of peer reviewed papers on the

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,080
nervous system, and even authored a book on the role of the brain and the GI system. This episode's

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,920
different from I think a lot of our episodes. Truthfully, I think it comes across more as a

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,560
bit of a med school lecture, which is how it felt to me. It was really interesting, but I think at

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,360
the surface, doesn't really come across as highly applicable. I think the reality of it is you just

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,280
have to get through some of the embryology, anatomy, and neurophysiology of the gut and the

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,600
brain to understand how these things coexist. I just want to be honest and set expectations.

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,560
If you're coming into this thinking that this is going to be a podcast that's about how to eat this

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,200
and not that and affect your gut biome, it's really not about that. This is a much more basic

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,000
discussion and I mean basic not in simple, but I mean basic in more elemental explanation of how

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,200
this system works. Truthfully, I learned a lot in this episode, much more than I normally do. A lot

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,160
of times I go into podcasts knowing the subject matter pretty well and maybe increasing my

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,760
knowledge by 20% or something like that, but I think this was pretty different. I think what

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,440
I would just say is rather than give you a blow by blow of everything we talked about here,

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,960
which would probably take me 20 minutes, I would say go into this assuming you're not going to know

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,240
much of what we talk about and you'll come out of this with a much greater appreciation for how your

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:42,880
gut and your brain are connected. Unfortunately, I think we're only now beginning to think about

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,600
how to translate that to clinical utility. In other words, I think that we don't yet have all

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,640
of the insights. I don't come away from this episode saying, oh, all you need to do is eat

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,600
this and your gut's going to be healthier and if your gut's going to be healthier, then your brain

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,000
is going to be better or vice versa. Maybe you'll come out the other end of this podcast feeling

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,480
like you've got it figured out. I certainly don't, but nevertheless, I feel like I have a much better

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,640
foundational knowledge to evaluate half of the snake oil stuff that is out there, which I mean,

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,320
I got to be honest with you, most of what's out there on this topic is utter nonsense. Commercial

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,560
tests that promise miracles that don't make any sense and supplements that just don't make any

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
sense and I think you'll come away from this kind of understanding how difficult it is to try to make

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,680
the claims that are out there. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Mike

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:41,320
Pershing. Hey, Mike, thanks so much for making time to speak with me today about a subject matter

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,960
that I know very little about, but know enough to know that it probably matters and I think that's

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,600
why we're going to talk about it. Okay, I'll do my best. Let's kind of start with what is it that has

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,160
brought you so much curiosity in an area over what I'm guessing 60 years now is probably how

44
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,080
long you've been studying the GI system. Yes, I guess that shows you it's a very difficult

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,160
subject because I've been studying it for 60 years and there's still more to study. In other words,

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,760
I haven't gotten very far. Or as the saying goes, the further you get from shore, the deeper the

47
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,360
ocean gets, right? I love that. Yes, I haven't heard that before. You know, this is one of those

48
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,160
subjects that and I've been thinking a lot about this and trying to figure out how to frame our

49
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,480
discussion today, because there's just so much fundamental foundational knowledge that I think is

50
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:39,240
necessary to at least have a basic understanding of before we can get into kind of the nuanced

51
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,640
stuff around the GI system. So does it make sense to maybe just start with some of the real basics

52
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:54,480
of the human GI system, including frankly, its embryology, anatomy, vascular supply. And ultimately,

53
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,840
I think we're going to want to talk of course, about its nervous system, which is quite distinct

54
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,640
and unique relative to even the peripheral nervous system. Would that be a reasonable place to start?

55
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,480
Absolutely, it would. All right. Well, let's start with the embryology of this. So what is it that

56
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:19,160
takes place during our development as embryos that leads to the system of the gut? Well, before I

57
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,440
mention exactly what that is, let me just define it. Because I think that some people don't really

58
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:34,200
know what we mean by the GI system. So basically, it's a tube, it begins at the mouth, and it ends

59
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:44,120
at the anus. And as TS Eliot said, we are hollow men, and I will add, and women. So the inside of

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:53,640
the GI tract is really outside the body. It's internalized external space. If you bleed into

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:01,880
your GI tract, you lose blood. It's no longer in you, even if you can't see the blood. So one of the

62
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:09,560
major crises in medicine is hidden bleeding in the GI tract, which can be very damaging, even if

63
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:18,280
you don't see any blood. The inside of your gut is outside of your body. And as such, you can have,

64
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:28,840
and you do have inside the gut, space for the existence of a community of extra organisms that

65
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:38,840
is immense. And so the inside of your gut is dangerous and has to be kept separate from you.

66
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:48,120
So it's a major problem for the GI tract to keep a barrier and a surface to defend the body,

67
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:55,720
and yet allow food to be digested and absorbed and food stuff to come in.

68
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,480
So it has to maintain the communication with the lumen, which is what we call the inside of the GI

69
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,440
tract, and yet at the same time be protected. That's a really good point, Mike, which is that

70
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,080
we think about this all the time when we think about our skin, which is the other part of us

71
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,560
that is exposed to the outside world. And I think most people would be familiar with how many

72
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,520
bacteria we have colonizing our nasal passages, skin surface, et cetera. I guess most people would

73
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,120
probably understand that bacteremia is a bad thing when bacteria enter our body, and they can do so

74
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,720
through many of these pathways. It's problematic, but you're right in that the GI tract has a

75
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:50,760
particularly unique challenge, which is it must still do a lot of transmission across its surface,

76
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,920
obviously all of nutrients. In that sense, for example, the respiratory system only has to be

77
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,480
serving for gas exchange, and not to minimize that, but you could make a case that that's an easier

78
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,880
problem to solve to allow gases to exchange, but not to allow organisms to go through. So I think

79
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,480
that's a very interesting way to begin this discussion. Of course, I don't want to denigrate

80
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:23,000
the importance of the respiratory tract in an age of COVID. Let me tell you, it's important that gas

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,960
exchange be easy and proper. Anyway, to get back to the GI tract, the gut has a further problem

82
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,160
in that the food we eat is not ready for absorption. It doesn't come in. Food that you eat has to be

83
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:44,760
digested, so that you eat complex products, and then you have to digest it into small molecules

84
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:53,960
that can be absorbed. So that not only does the gut have to absorb a variety of things, it has to

85
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,000
have a particularly awful witch's brew to turn the same kind of thing that we're made of

86
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,520
into juice, essentially break it down without dissolving the body. The lining of the gut is

87
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:15,000
absolutely remarkable. So it's complex molecules that are not sterile as well, entering a non-sterile

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,200
environment, and somehow we have to only allow sterile nutritional building blocks to move across

89
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,280
the border. Yes, and those nutritional building blocks have to be made from the same kinds of

90
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,960
things that we're made out of, which we have to break down and digest. Without breaking down

91
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,680
ourselves. Correct, so we don't want to self-digest. It's a major problem, and the gut manages to solve

92
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:50,040
all that. Now you ask where it comes from. Well, during development, the body forms a disc, a flat

93
00:09:50,040 --> 00:10:00,120
disc, and that disc undergoes a series of folds from head to toe and from side to side, and the

94
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:09,240
lateral or side folding produces the tube from which the gut forms, and so the flat disc folds

95
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:16,920
around to create an internal space, and that tube becomes the gut. How many weeks, can you remind me

96
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:24,520
post-fertilization, does that fold take place? The folding takes place during the first trimester,

97
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,800
and the gut is fully developed during the second trimester, and is between the second and the third

98
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:42,760
trimester when you're born. The gut is modeled and achieves its ability to do the kinds of thing that

99
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:51,320
we were just talking about, digest and absorb. The first part of development is called embryogenesis.

100
00:10:52,200 --> 00:11:00,920
That is, the fertilized egg forms the disc, the disc folds, the organs of the body form,

101
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:08,280
and that's the embryonic period. The fetal period follows that, and the fetal period

102
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:16,120
models the organs into their final, or not necessarily final, because some development

103
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,920
continues to take place after birth, but appropriate development so that it becomes

104
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:31,320
functional enough to support a baby. In my recollection, which is about 26 years old now,

105
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,840
is that when that tube, that fold turns into the tube which will become the entire length of the

106
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,720
GI system from, as you said, mouth to anus. There are also these little outpouchings that come

107
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,280
along later that become things like the pancreas and the bile duct and things like that, which form

108
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,360
other things that drain into the GI system that obviously perform essential functions for digestion.

109
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,600
Yes, that same fold gives rise to lots of things, some of which drain into the gut,

110
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,800
like the pancreas, the gallbladder, which you mentioned, but it also forms the lungs,

111
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:12,680
which do not drain into the GI system, and the liver, which has a component that drains into the

112
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:21,000
gut through the bile system, but those are all derivatives of the gut. So the foregut forms the

113
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,400
stomach, the first part of the small intestine, the lungs, the pharynx, pancreas, gallbladder.

114
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,400
The midgut is the business of small intestine, and the first part of the large intestine,

115
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,640
and the hindgut is the end of the large intestine.

116
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,800
And my recollection, Mike, was that the foregut, midgut, hindgut basically tracked with the three

117
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,320
vessels coming off the aorta, the celiac, the superior and inferior mesenteric. Is that correct?

118
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,360
That is correct.

119
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,920
So maybe tell folks a little bit about that blood supply, what makes it unique,

120
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,160
which is, of course, we have a portal system, which is very important. We'll go from there

121
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,760
into the nervous system, which is perhaps the most complicated of the bunch.

122
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,520
As you've said, the foregut is defined as the part of the gut from the celiac artery.

123
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,160
The celiac artery is the first of the, or the most, rostral or anterior or...

124
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,360
Closest to the head.

125
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Yes. I'm trying to put it into terminology that the entire world can understand. There

126
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:36,840
is also the terminology that the aficionados understand. So the celiac gives rise, or the

127
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,520
foregut, the celiac branch supplies the pancreas, the stomach, the first part of the duodenum,

128
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:53,800
and the liver, and the gallbladder. The superior mesenteric artery supplies the midgut,

129
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,760
and that's the longest part of the gut, and that goes roughly to the mid-transverse colon.

130
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:09,960
The colon has three parts. It folds. It has an ascending colon, a transverse colon going sideways,

131
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,080
and a descending colon, which goes down to the rectum and anus, which is out.

132
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:25,320
The inferior mesenteric supplies the end of the gut. When the celiac gives rise to the stomach

133
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,840
and first part of the small intestine's arterial supply, that then breaks into capillaries,

134
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:44,520
absorbs materials from the gut. Those capillaries drain into veins in the gut, and in a unique way,

135
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:54,040
those veins then form large vessels, which then move into the liver. They then break into capillaries,

136
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:02,680
small vessels within the liver called sinusoids. So the venous system that supplies the liver

137
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:11,080
is actually acting like it as if it were an artery, but it begins in the gut. And so the liver

138
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:20,200
depends for its oxygen on blood that the gut has had a first crack at. And to keep the liver going,

139
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:29,800
it gets a second arterial supply from the hepatic artery so that it gets a little bit of arterial

140
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,680
blood. And basically the liver is perfused with blood coming from the gut, and when it's about to

141
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:46,440
asphyxiate, a sphincter shuts that down, opens up, and it gets a breath of fresh air or fresh blood

142
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,040
and gets some oxygen, and then it goes back to dealing with what it gets from the gut. And the

143
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:00,760
reason it does that is the liver is the first step in the body's ability to use the nutrients

144
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:08,040
that the gut absorbs. So when the gut absorbs fatty acids, the liver turns them into

145
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
chylomicrons, which can go out and supply energy to the body. So the liver is a major center of

146
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,720
metabolism working on products from the gut. So it gets the first crack at what the gut has absorbed.

147
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Now how about the nervous system of the gut? How is the gut innervated?

148
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,640
Well, as you've said, and I'm glad you've given your audience a warning,

149
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:44,120
it's complex and different. The gut has its own intrinsic nervous system, and I've called that

150
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:51,400
the second brain, and that's the title of the book, by the way. And the reason I called it the second

151
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:59,320
brain is that like the brain in the head, the nervous system of the gut is able to function

152
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:09,720
and control reflexes and behavior independently of any influence from the brain or spinal cord.

153
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:19,000
So it is the only nervous system of the body that can work on its own. So if you completely isolate

154
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:28,520
the gut from the brain and the spinal cord, it will function. You're not dead. Years and years ago,

155
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:38,040
in the days when peptic ulcers were thought to be psychogenic, surgeons used to cut the vagus

156
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:45,640
nerves, which are the major conduits that connect the brain and the gut. And after they cut the

157
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:53,400
vagus nerves, the gut continued to soldier on as it would have to. Unfortunately, it never did

158
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,360
all that much to fix peptic ulcer disease, and that turned out to be because peptic ulcer disease

159
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,920
is mostly an infectious illness caused by helicobacter pylori.

160
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,040
So you're saying before the discovery of H. pylori, it was believed that stress was driving

161
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,600
peptic ulcer disease. And the idea was that the central nervous system would communicate

162
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,120
the stress to the gut via the vagus nerve. That's correct. Now, that wasn't all wrong.

163
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,960
The central nervous system can communicate stress to the gut via the vagus nerve.

164
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,400
But that was not the cause of peptic ulcer disease. And it did help to show that the gut could,

165
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,200
in fact, be cut off from the brain and still work. But that observation was made long ago.

166
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,880
The nervous system of the gut has been known to be present for a long time.

167
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,320
It was discovered about the time of the American Civil War. Our back in Germany

168
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,480
noticed an extremely large nervous system in the human gut at that time. He didn't know what it did,

169
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:19,320
but later around the turn of the last century, that is 19th to 20th, in what I know to have been

170
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,840
a very cold, chilly laboratory in England. The reason I know that is I worked in England. I did

171
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:34,360
my post-doctoral training there. Laboratories were not heated. Even when I was there, we used to crack

172
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:41,080
the ice off the organ bath to get started in the morning. And I'd wear gloves with just

173
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,480
fingertips open so you could do experiments. Anyway, at that time, Bayless and Starling

174
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,120
cut all the nerves to the intestine of a dog. This is the same Starling from whom we have

175
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:01,720
Starling curves in cardiac physiology? That's the Starling. And so when they cut all the nerves to

176
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,680
the gut and then increased pressure inside the gut in the lumen, the gut would respond with the

177
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:17,720
stereotypic behavior of oral contraction, anal relaxation that they called the law of the

178
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:26,440
intestine, which was a name that I liked very much and sounded very poetic in a sense. 17 years later,

179
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,960
while armies were paralyzed during the First World War, crossed trenches that cut Europe

180
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:43,320
from the Swiss border on the way down to the English Channel in France and Belgium. Behind

181
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:50,840
the lines in Germany, another German scientist by the name of Trandellen Berg had tuberculosis.

182
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,360
And that kept him out of the army, even the German army at that time. But he had to keep busy.

183
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:07,160
So he strung up a loop of guinea pig intestine in vitro, that is in a test tube, on a J-shaped

184
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:14,280
tube. And he blew into the J-shaped tube, which raised the pressure inside the intestine, very

185
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,680
much like Bayless and Starling had done. And he found that even in a test tube, when he did that,

186
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,200
the gut blew back at him. And it was a very profound observation because it showed that

187
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,520
with nothing there but gut, the gut could respond, sense the pressure, and show a coordinated wave

188
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:44,920
of activity in response to it, indicating that the intestinal nervous system is able to function

189
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:51,880
independently of the CNS, the central nervous system. No other nervous system outside the

190
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:58,440
CNS can do that. And even the spinal cord can't do that. It works in conjunction with the brain.

191
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,760
How preserved is that, Mike, across other species? Is that kind of a universal finding?

192
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:13,480
Yes. It begins with a little organism called amphioxus, which undergoes metamorphosis,

193
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,280
turns into a vertebrate. So it's a vertebrate invention, and all vertebrates have it. You do

194
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:28,280
not find it in invertebrates. So it's a vertebrate invention, and it gets more complex as vertebrates

195
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:35,480
become more complex. So a fish has only one layer of enteric nervous system. Humans have two.

196
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:42,600
Actually, some people would say three. And the two that we have are between which layers? I guess

197
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:49,560
we didn't really finish our GI anatomy. So when you go from the lumen at the very inside all the

198
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:56,440
way out, you have a mucosal layer, a submucosa, a muscular layer. Is that where these different

199
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:05,240
bundles live? Yes. So the lining of the gut is called the mucosa. It has a superficial lining

200
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,840
that is in contact with the lumen called an epithelium. Underneath that is a loose nervous

201
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:21,720
system called the lamina propia, but together that's the mucosa. Below that, there's a dense

202
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,320
layer of connective tissue, which allows gut to be used for stringing tennis rackets,

203
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,400
allows gut to be used to suture material. It's tough. You can't pull it out. The next layer

204
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,960
is a circular layer of smooth muscle, another layer of smooth muscle, a second one called the

205
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:51,560
longitudinal layer. And then if it's in the peritoneal cavity, another layer of very thin epithelium.

206
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,200
The major parts of the nervous system of the gut are the submucosal plexus,

207
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:05,880
which has the epinim meister, but it's submucosal plexus. And that's in that dense layer of

208
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:15,560
connective tissue. And that's the smaller of the two. The larger one by far is the myenteric plexus,

209
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,160
and that is in between the two layers of smooth muscle on the outside of the gut.

210
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:31,560
The two plexuses communicate with one another, and they both really do get input from the central

211
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:39,160
nervous system and speak back to the central nervous system. So although they can function,

212
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:46,680
as I've been emphasizing, independently of control by the brain, in practice they don't.

213
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:56,360
They communicate, and there is constantly a bipolar or two-way communication between the

214
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,760
brain and the gut. The gut receives input from the brain and sends back information to the brain.

215
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:12,360
And in that function, bi-directional communication, the brain acts very much like a CEO.

216
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:21,000
That is, it gives general commands. The detail of what the gut actually does, that behavior,

217
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,280
is controlled by the bowel itself. Let me try to summarize that. You have these two muscular walls,

218
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:34,840
one of them runs longitudinally, so runs in the direction of the lumen, and one runs orthogonal

219
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,920
to that. It runs circularly. This is one of the things I remember from anatomy, was that you have

220
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,240
these things where if the circular inner layer contracts, that shrinks the lumen, and the

221
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,240
longitudinal one, as it contracts, shortens it along its long axis. And I think that's what permits this

222
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:01,000
remarkable, peristaltic, rhythmic contraction of the gut. Yes, I can talk to you about the behaviors

223
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,440
of the gut, but the behavior of the gut is not so simple as to have just one peristaltic movement.

224
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,040
When you look at it, it seems to be moving rhythmically, but it's much more complicated

225
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:20,680
than that. It doesn't do that all the time. Interesting. So that first part of the enteric

226
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:27,400
nervous system, which is the myenteric plexus, sits between those two layers, correct? That's correct,

227
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:35,400
yes. And then beneath those muscular layers is when you get into that very tough submucosal layer,

228
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,920
and it's between that circular muscular wall and the submucosa that you have, the submucosal plexus.

229
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:50,360
That's absolutely right. And then of course, inside the submucosa, you have the mucosa, and then

230
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,320
ultimately the lumen on the very inside with the enterocytes that form the endothelial lining of

231
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,680
the gut. Give me a quick sense of the epithelial turnover. What is the, I don't know, median

232
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,560
residence time of an epithelial cell in the gut? They vary depending on the type of epithelial cell,

233
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:14,360
but you turn the epithelium over about once a week. Interesting. And when you say it varies,

234
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,520
I assume you mean from, say, the proximal jejunum to the ilium to the colon? Is that

235
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,680
what you mean in terms of location? No. What I was talking about is that you have certain cells

236
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:35,160
in the lining of the gut, such as a cell called the paneth cell, which is in the base of the crypt,

237
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:41,640
which is getting into the weeds here, but it's a part of the folding of the lining of the gut.

238
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:49,960
But the paneth cell has two major functions. One is that it's defensive, and it puts out

239
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,160
a number of antibacterial proteins that keep the lining, particularly of the small intestine,

240
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:05,240
sterile or close to sterile, only a few thousand microorganisms per cubic milliliter. But the

241
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,680
large intestine doesn't have those, but it has cells that put out the equivalent kind of

242
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:19,560
antibacterial product that helps to fend off the bacteria from getting too close to the lining of

243
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:28,760
the gut. The other function of the paneth cell is to nurse the stem cells that turn over all of

244
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:36,440
the cells. So the paneth cell lasts perhaps three weeks. You also have in the gut endocrine cells,

245
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,680
these endoroendocrine cells that produce hormones that are in the lining of the gut,

246
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,000
and they're a little bit longer lasting. The endorocytes that you talked about

247
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,680
turn over very rapidly. Well, we're going to come back to those endocrine cells pretty soon,

248
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,720
because that's a very big part of this gut-brain connection I want to explore. I do have kind of a

249
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,040
random question for you though, Mike, which is, in some ways it's not surprising that the colon

250
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:15,640
is so susceptible to neoplasia, to the formation of cancer, because it has at its surface a cell

251
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,720
that turns over so frequently, and therefore it's turning over constantly, and as a result you

252
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,440
probably have more and more chances for genetic errors of replication that produce mutations that

253
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:35,080
are oncologic. I find it interesting that the small intestine, which presumably turns over at

254
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:42,040
roughly the same pace, is almost void of cancer. Do you have a thought as to why that's the case?

255
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,080
Well, people have speculated on that. One part of the answer is that microbiome, to which the

256
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:58,200
large intestine is exposed, is orders of magnitude larger than that of the small intestine,

257
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:06,200
and the other part of it is that the products that sit in the lumen of the large intestines

258
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,920
sit there for much, much longer. Small intestine digests food and it just goes by very fast.

259
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:20,600
So in terms of being exposed to environmental toxins, or toxins produced by organisms, or

260
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:28,440
toxins that are split off from what you eat, the large intestine, which acts as a sewer,

261
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,160
really is exposed to very much more. My recollection is most of the nutrient absorption

262
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,400
is taking place in the small intestine and that the large intestine is mainly reabsorbing water.

263
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:48,120
Is that right? Yes, but not quite, because what the large intestine does is conserves sodium.

264
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:58,680
So it absorbs sodium and secretes potassium and water follows the sodium as it's coming back into

265
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:09,400
the body. So the colon acquired that function and it enables organisms to live on land. When organisms

266
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:17,800
lived in the water conserving sodium and water was not such a problem, living on land makes itself.

267
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:25,880
The bulk of the water that the gut absorbs, however, is not in the large intestine. It's

268
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,680
done in the small intestine together with the bulk of most of what else you absorb.

269
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:40,120
Still the final 100 milliliters or so per day of what you absorb is polished off in the colon,

270
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:48,680
and it is important in maintaining the body's fluid content. If you lose it, as one does in

271
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:57,080
cholera, where cholera toxin turns sodium absorption into chloride secretion, water flows out,

272
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:06,200
and you can die of dehydration in about four hours, and people do with cholera. So it's a great plague.

273
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,960
Perhaps three million people a year die of cholera even today. Three million people a year

274
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,160
die of cholera today? Correct. I had no idea. Where is this primarily happening? Is this in

275
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:24,760
Africa and Asia? At the moment it is, but there have been major league outbreaks in our hemisphere.

276
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:33,800
One began off the coast of Peru with contaminated crab. That led to cases that were as far north as

277
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:41,960
New Jersey, as people ate contaminated crab. Haiti, of course, is the most famous one. There

278
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:49,480
was a great earthquake in Haiti. It destroyed a lot of their infrastructure. They had a group of

279
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:57,000
peacekeepers from the United Nations from Nepal that was stationed there, and they brought cholera

280
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,080
with them, put it into the water system of Haiti. It got into the rivers and streams, and is now

281
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:11,000
endemic in Haiti. So it reduced the population of Haiti considerably, but it is mostly in Asia and

282
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,880
Africa. Are there direct treatments for it, or is the only treatment supportive care to prevent

283
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:24,520
dehydration? Well, it's a very simple illness. All one has to do is keep track of the water,

284
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,120
so you put a patient on what is known as a cholera cot, a gurney with a hole in the middle,

285
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:37,880
for the anus to be positioned over. You put a bucket under it. The nurse puts a ruler into

286
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:45,400
that bucket periodically to see how much fluid is coming out. You replace it intravenously and orally.

287
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:54,280
The great life-saving discovery was that although cholera blocked the absorption of sodium,

288
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:01,160
it does not block the absorption of glucose in the small intestine. And so adding a little bit

289
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:08,760
of sugar to the fluid that you're using for oral rehydration has saved countless millions of lives,

290
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:16,680
just that simple thing. So antibiotics have no use at all in color, zero. Does the immune system

291
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,360
basically, if given enough time, fight it off, and all you're doing is just supporting the hydration

292
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,720
status of the person until your immune system kicks in? Correct. I want to go back to something

293
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,160
you said earlier. You made a point to talk about the intrinsic innervation, and I realized that

294
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,640
there are going to be people listening who might not know the difference between intrinsic and

295
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,800
extrinsic neurons. Can you explain what that means in the context of the gut, please?

296
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:49,160
So the intrinsic nervous system of the gut is a term representing the nerve cells that live within

297
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:58,040
the gut. We've described them, the two plexuses. The extrinsic innervation includes the brain,

298
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:07,640
which sends fibers to those neurons, and the sympathetic nervous system, which projects from

299
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:16,440
outside the gut into it. And it also includes the spinal cord and the ganglia associated with the

300
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,840
spinal cord, sensory ganglia, and dorsal root, which provide a sensory innervation of the gut.

301
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,480
So those are all extrinsic nerves. Intrinsic means that the cell body of the nerve cell resides

302
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:39,320
within the gut. Extrinsic means that the cell body is outside the gut, wherever.

303
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,960
Mike, one of the things I'm sure anybody listening to this can appreciate is the incredible pain

304
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,480
that one experiences with distension of the bowel. I used to be a general surgeon, so when

305
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,040
patients present with bowel obstructions, it can be as painful as a bowel perforation, and it's so

306
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,560
important to be able to put a nasogastric tube in them and decompress them. And again, even if you

307
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,000
haven't had a bowel obstruction, just if you're bloated or something like that, it can be incredibly

308
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,720
uncomfortable. So explain to people how that pain of distension in the gut is being communicated

309
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,840
to their brain, where they're obviously conscious of the discomfort. Let me make two points. One is

310
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:27,160
that essentially pressure of the kind that which you're speaking, whether very severe, as you've

311
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:35,640
mentioned, or much less so, the only way the gut feels pain is in response to dilatation or pressure.

312
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:44,600
You can cut the inside of the gut with impunity. So surgeons are constantly doing that, taking

313
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:51,720
biopsies from inside the gut, and that can be done without anesthesia. So it's differently

314
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,840
innervated from the point of view of pain than the skin, for example. The skin feels pressure, but it's

315
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:09,400
much less of a painful stimulus than cutting. The gut is exactly the reverse. Most of the fibers

316
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:16,440
that get excited when you press increased pressure are located in the dorsal root ganglia.

317
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Those are pain fibers that relay the signal to the brain by way of the spinal cord. The vagus nerve

318
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:33,880
has some pain, but not much. Mostly the vagus nerve carries information back to the brain

319
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,920
that has to do with signaling what is called homeostasis, which means we don't know for

320
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:48,120
exactly what it all is, but you need it. Before we leave kind of the anatomy and

321
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,400
innervation of the gut, you mentioned the CNS functions kind of like the CEO providing

322
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:02,120
broad instruction, but not necessarily minutia driven operational instructions. Can you give

323
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:10,120
an example of what type of information is conveyed by the CNS and how that information is enacted

324
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:18,760
locally? Let me give you an illustration this way. One of the things we do as scientists is depend

325
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:28,120
for our funding on the NIH, and we send in grant applications in which we try to give our research

326
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:36,040
its best look. Under goes peer review, and then the government decides on the basis of the peer

327
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:44,920
review on two levels, whether to fund it or not. So when I wait to hear how my grant has done on

328
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,400
peer review, I become acutely aware of the kind of effect the CNS can have on my gut.

329
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:59,800
After three trips to the John, I will go and open the computer and find out.

330
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,840
So what I'm saying is most people can resonate with that because they felt it, this feeling of

331
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:15,640
butterflies, this feeling of tension-induced diarrhea. That is all coming by way of the CNS.

332
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:25,800
Similarly, some people when they're frightened or traveling just completely lose the ability to

333
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,440
defecate. They become constipated. I always assumed that that was due to the dehydration

334
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,160
of air travel, but it sounds like you're saying there's more to it. There may be, yes, I think

335
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,880
there is. Well, what it seems to come to is, for example, the sympathetic nerves can slow the gut

336
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:52,840
and make it less likely to defecate, and that is in response to, as opposed to anxiety,

337
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:01,720
to true fright. So for example, if you're fleeing a foxhole because the enemy is coming,

338
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,200
it's best if you don't have to stop to defecate along the way.

339
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,000
You've alluded now to the sympathetic and parasympathetic overtone of the CNS.

340
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:18,360
So it communicates that via acetyl-CoA and acetylcholine, things like that. But at the

341
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,800
local level, how does the gut receive that message? And then let's use the example of

342
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:31,400
anxiety-induced diarrhea. The actual action taken by the gut is presumably more rapid

343
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,160
peristalsis and less absorption? That's correct. And that's all has to do with the

344
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:46,040
enteric nervous system functioning. One theory, which I believe, is that there are nerve cells

345
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:53,000
in the gut called command neurons, and they receive the input from the CNS. So it turns

346
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:00,920
out that the number of fibers in the vagus nerve that are running to the gut are pretty small in

347
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:08,600
humans, three to five thousand. It's been estimated. And the number of nerve cells within the gut are

348
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:15,960
in over a hundred million. So the intrinsics outnumber the extrinsics by three orders of magnitude,

349
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:23,160
if not more. So that raises the question, how do these nerve cells control it? As I've said,

350
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:30,920
as a CEO, they can get to command nerve cells and start reflexes going, keep things moving more

351
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,240
rapidly. The gut has a number of different behaviors. It's not just propelling at all times.

352
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,600
If the gut were propelling, as I described it with oral contraction, anal relaxation,

353
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,880
as it's capable of doing, then social discourse of the kind we're having right now would become

354
00:41:49,880 --> 00:42:01,480
impossible. The gut has to sometimes stop. And so one type of behavior is just essentially parisis.

355
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:11,480
The gut stops moving. A second type of behavior that the gut shows is mixing in which it allows

356
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,680
the enzymes that it puts out to do digestion. And anyone who's ever taken time in an organic

357
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:25,000
chemistry laboratory will tell you nothing very much happens unless it's stirred. So the gut has

358
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:35,080
a mixing process in which it just goes back and forth, back and forth, no propulsion. And then

359
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:43,240
it's able to sense what goes on. And when digestion has occurred sufficiently, it propels it on.

360
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:51,240
It can also, during night while you're sleeping, a cleaning process goes through the gut

361
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:59,000
in which a wave begins. The stomach goes down the small intestine, down the large intestine,

362
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,280
and cleans the gut out. Open sphincters, so the things that would ordinarily be much too big to

363
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:16,280
pass can go through. So a little kid can swallow a paperclip, a dime, sometimes an open pin. And all

364
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:23,160
those things are passed. And miraculously, I don't know how the gut manages it, but if an open safety

365
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:31,080
pin goes in, somehow it manages to propel it all the way down with the small end down and it almost

366
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,520
never gets stuck. So let's pivot a bit to appetite. Obviously the gut plays a very important role in

367
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,080
the regulation of our appetite. And this, I suspect, is an area where the gut and the brain

368
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,520
are in a high level of communication. Can you walk us through what that looks like?

369
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,920
And let's assume we're talking about this in a non-pathologic state, because obviously there's

370
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:01,080
going to be things that I assume can hijack this process. A number of factors play into it.

371
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:11,080
Distention of the stomach being one, so that as the stomach is pushed out, it tends to cause

372
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:19,800
satiety and decrease your urge to eat. Another factor is not the level of blood glucose, but the

373
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:29,320
rise of blood glucose, the ascent of it. And these factors are sensed, one by receptors within the

374
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:38,200
gut, which send signals to the brain, and the other are cells within the brain that are chemosensitive

375
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:45,480
and detect nutrients within the gut. Another factor, which you alluded to before, are the

376
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:54,120
endorheal endocrine cells within the gut, which make hormones such as cholecystokinin, which can

377
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:02,600
signal to the brain by going through the blood-brain barrier to be received by neurons

378
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:10,840
leptin within the gut. So there are a large number of hormones, hormone receptors in the brain,

379
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:18,600
that can trigger your urge to eat, as well as nutrients that you absorb, as well as

380
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:28,040
distention of the bowel itself. So that the gut has receptors in it, and the brain has signals

381
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,520
within it that trigger the urge to eat. So basically, mechanical and chemical are the two

382
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,400
big means through which this is communicated? That's correct. That summarizes it well.

383
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:47,640
So the mechanical are both in the actual stomach, but also in the small bowel? Yes, to a lesser

384
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:55,160
extent. And those are transmitted back from the gut via the vagus nerve? Correct. The glucose

385
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:02,920
rate of change, as opposed to absolute level, is that directly sensed in the CNS? Yes, it is.

386
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,320
And that's fine, because of course glucose easily traverses the blood-brain barrier,

387
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:14,200
so the gut doesn't need to be involved in that decision. The blood vessels that provide blood

388
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:22,280
to the brain have transporters that allow certain chemicals from the gut, such as leptin and

389
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:30,120
cholecystokinin, to be transported so that they can affect the CNS directly. Where does ghrelin

390
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:37,240
fit into this? Ghrelin is another hormone from the gut that works in the opposite way to what

391
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,760
we've been talking about. I've been talking about things that decrease food absorption. Ghrelin

392
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:50,360
is a gut hormone that promotes it. So what amplifies ghrelin? You mean what makes ghrelin

393
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:56,280
be secreted? Yes. Well, there are certain chemicals in food that you eat that can do that.

394
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:04,440
Mostly it's nutrients that come into the body that suppress, like amino acids and fatty acids,

395
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,360
can suppress ghrelin secretion. Does that mean that ghrelin's natural state is to be secreted,

396
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:17,400
and it's the presence of nutrients that simply turn that down? Yes, it's secreted at a constant

397
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:25,160
rate, and it can be upped or downed so that inhibiting it is important to prevent the

398
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,400
development of ghrelin effect. And what about the type of meal? So if you took, you know, and this

399
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,640
is the kind of stuff that's done, of course, all the time in research models. I think Rudy Leibel

400
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,880
and Mike Rosenbaum have done a number of these experiments where you'll take mixed meal shakes

401
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,440
versus solids. What are some of the differences in the way that those things would affect

402
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,960
satiety? And is it all done purely through change in the speed of absorption, or are there

403
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,840
other factors between liquids and solids that might factor into that? Well, there are a number

404
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:01,480
of factors. I just want to mention while we're on it that Rudy Leibel is just across the street.

405
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:09,640
He's a colleague over here of Bonnet, Columbia. The rate at which the stomach empties varies

406
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:18,440
tremendously depending on what you put into it. So for example, if you just eat a saline meal, the

407
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:26,920
stomach will empty much more rapidly than if there's protein in it, and even protein will empty much

408
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:36,040
more rapidly than if there's fat in it. So the stomach senses the nutrients, and the speed at which

409
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:43,320
it empties regulates the dilatation of the stomach and the signal that the stomach is sending back

410
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:53,080
to urge satiety on the brain, which means that if you're eating protein and fat, you will

411
00:48:53,080 --> 00:49:02,200
reach satiety much sooner than if you're eating just salt and sugar. In terms of solids, solids

412
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:09,960
do the same. Particles can't get through the pyloric sphincter unless they're ground down

413
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:19,960
to be millimeter or less in diameter, so only tiny things can get into the small intestine.

414
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:28,120
So solids will delay gastric emptying. The stomach has a particular form of behavior,

415
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:36,680
which is amazing when you watch it, but one part of the stomach contracts massively and suddenly

416
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:44,280
and forces the bolus that's in the stomach up against the pyloric sphincter, which is the exit

417
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:52,120
of the stomach, which is shut tight, and this ramming action breaks up solids into the small

418
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:58,840
particles that can get through. At the end of it, if you still have some solids that are too big to

419
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:07,000
reach that level, they can get through, but during sleep when cleaning process operates, and then

420
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,240
the sphincter is open. So solids will slow the emptying of the stomach, and anything that slows

421
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:22,600
the emptying of the stomach will tend to induce satiety and reduce the length of time during which

422
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:29,320
you feel hungry and want to eat. The point here you make about the particles needing to be sub-1

423
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:34,840
millimeter to get past the pylorus is kind of remarkable and gives you a sense of how much

424
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:40,200
mechanical digestion the stomach is doing. I mean, the pH must be helping that, but really there's

425
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,000
just got to be a lot of mechanical shearing that goes on of food stuff, correct? Absolutely right.

426
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,120
The stomach doesn't get its recognition in this story. When you think about how small a sub-millimeter

427
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,880
particle is, and yet how big things of food that make it into your stomach are, and to think that

428
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,520
it does this without fine instruments, it wouldn't be hard for me to make a bunch of 1 millimeter

429
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:06,040
pieces if you gave me a knife, but it's doing this basically inside a soft reservoir using

430
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:12,520
contraction and acid. And some enzymes. It is a remarkable structure, but you can live without

431
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,560
the stomach. Given everything we've just learned about the stomach, let's talk about an operation

432
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,600
where we bypass it, right? One of the most successful operations for the treatment of

433
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:28,520
both obesity and type 2 diabetes is a gastric bypass. What happens in a patient, and this is

434
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:36,200
kind of a remarkable operation in the sense that in an instant their upper GI tract is rerouted.

435
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,880
It's not like they had months and months to adapt to something new. I mean, there obviously is an

436
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,240
adaptation post-op, but it's an immediate change. Explain to folks what's actually happening in that

437
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:54,440
procedure and how it might explain some of the benefits we see most universally in post-obesity

438
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:01,880
and post-type 2 diabetes. Well, for one thing, why does the stomach just put all those little tiny

439
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:10,120
particles through? That's because if they were to get into the small intestine, it would set up

440
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,080
a lot of emergency, don't do this kind of apparatus. In other words, satiety, stop eating

441
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:29,800
signals, go into high gear. And what the gastric bypass is doing is it's triggering that emergency

442
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:37,960
procedure so that you're getting that satiety signal a lot. In other words, the kind of thing

443
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:46,760
that the stomach has evolved to keep in reserve is now coming to the foreground. It's no longer

444
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:54,200
there as an emergency to stop eating because I'm getting overwhelmed with signals. Usually you get

445
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:01,880
this because people, as in the Roman Empire when they would overeat, would force the system. The

446
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:09,800
stomach would dilate so much, they just overwhelmed the body and they ignored the signals. And so

447
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:17,640
the small intestine is there to back that up and get them to stop by making eating just so

448
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:24,920
objectionable that it stops. What the gastric bypass is doing is to make eating so objectionable

449
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:33,400
that it stops sooner and you eat much, much less. That's the goal of it. Another way to do this is

450
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:40,520
to put a band on the stomach and interfere with that process of grinding the food down so large

451
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:48,360
particles do come through the banded stomach and the same thing happens. And that would explain,

452
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:56,520
Mike, why both of these procedures can fail if a patient continues to consume very high-calorie

453
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:03,160
liquids. That's right. High-calorie liquids are the way around it. One of the things I always say to

454
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:08,120
people that are trying to lose weight is a pretty obvious insight, but this provides a better

455
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:14,760
mechanistic explanation for why is try not to drink any calories. Drink water, drink tea, drink coffee,

456
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,520
etc., but minimize the number of calories that are coming in via liquid, which includes alcohol,

457
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:26,680
by the way. Yes, and last I saw alcohol is a liquid. Let's talk now a little bit about the role

458
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:32,680
of neurodegenerative diseases and the gut. How long have you personally been interested in this

459
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:39,240
connection between diseases of the CNS and the gut? Oh, probably about 30 years or so.

460
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:48,040
I've recently become, if I might digress for just a second, even more interested in the sense that

461
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:55,560
I've discovered with my wife that the gut is a source of infection by varicella zoster virus,

462
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:03,400
which is the virus of chickenpox and shingles. And so shingles of the gut can occur. That can

463
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,840
be very, very serious. So I've never heard of that. Let's give people a bit of background on

464
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,280
how varicella zoster remains dormant after you have chickenpox and comes back as shingles. I think

465
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,000
people are probably somewhat familiar with that, but maybe worth re-explaining. And then of course,

466
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:26,120
bringing in this new idea that you've just brought up. The word that is generally used is latent

467
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:33,320
rather than dormant, but people get the picture. It's because it's essentially there, but not

468
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:40,360
sleeping. It's just quiet. Anyway, so when you get chickenpox, you clear the virus

469
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,240
and it forms what is known as an episome in neurons and just sits there

470
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:53,320
latent without causing infection for years and years and years. And essentially all of us die

471
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:59,560
with the virus that gave us chickenpox. It just stays with you for life. For reasons

472
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:10,520
that are unknown and only be speculated upon, they reactivate. And reactivation gives rise to

473
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:17,160
the re-emergence of active virus. And it always starts in a nerve cell because it's been latent

474
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:24,360
in a nerve cell. That's the site of latency. We know the virus becomes latent when it's in dorsal

475
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:32,680
root ganglia because then it goes down the axon or the process from the dorsal root ganglia into

476
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:42,200
the skin and causes a rash. And because you have immunity, it stays just in the nerve and in the

477
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:50,120
skin and doesn't give you a systemic disease like chickenpox was because when you had chickenpox,

478
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:57,400
you had no immunity. So it stays localized. And because the nerve cells die and become extremely

479
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:05,160
active and they're pain nerve cells, it can be an extremely painful rash. In 15% of people in which

480
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:13,000
that happens, there's a condition called postherpetic neuralgia or PHN in which pain persists for years.

481
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:20,680
That is very difficult to treat. And some people are driven to suicide because of this uncontrollable pain.

482
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,360
Mike, is that not something that's amenable to nerve killing? You know, for example,

483
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,840
they can sclerosis the dorsal root ganglion from which the pain is emanating?

484
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:37,240
No, there's no good at all. It's pathological pain. And the virus isn't there. The nerve cells

485
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:44,200
are no longer causing the pain. It's coming from within the CNS. It's sort of like a phantom limb

486
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:50,440
in which people cut off a limb and people have the feeling the limb is still there, but it's not.

487
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,920
So it's very difficult, as I've said, to treat. There are some drugs that do some good like

488
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:04,600
gabapentin, but nothing is wonderful. What is it about the varicella zoster virus that produces

489
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:11,240
this very peculiar inability to die even after the immune system gets ahead of it? Back when I

490
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,800
was a kid and you were a kid, we all got chicken pox. I think today they even vaccinate kids,

491
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,720
don't they? Yes, my wife developed that vaccine. She's famous for that.

492
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:26,680
Oh, wow. So despite either natural immunity or vaccine induced immunity, when this virus comes

493
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:32,040
into you, it stays, as you said, and remains latent in the dorsal root ganglion. Why is that

494
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:37,000
the case? Why doesn't the immune system completely eradicate it like it does in virtually every other

495
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,160
virus we encounter? Because when the virus is in a nerve cell, the immune system can't see it.

496
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,960
I see. So this is more of an artifact of where this virus likes to spend its time

497
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:54,120
or where it retreats to maybe is a better way to describe it. Let's call it a sequestered virus,

498
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:01,480
and it sits as a piece of DNA inside of your body and your immune system can't see it because it's

499
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:07,160
not expressed on the surface of the nerve cells that have it. The immune system has a very good

500
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:13,720
look at it when it re-emerges and you attack it, kill the cells in which it re-emerges,

501
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:20,440
but pain can continue in a small number of people, even so. What we've discovered,

502
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:29,000
much to our chagrin, is that the enteric nervous system can be infected by this virus when you

503
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,440
have chickenpox or when you get the live virus vaccine. It can establish latency within the

504
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,960
intrinsic nervous system of the gut, in the enteric nervous system, and when it re-arises,

505
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:51,320
even if it gets killed by the immune system, it's killing nerve cells. And so you get diseases such

506
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:58,200
as pseudoobstruction in which the gut loses the ability to work and just becomes totally paralyzed,

507
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:04,680
or if the virus emerges and gets into the mucosa, the gut can perforate.

508
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,560
And what's the frequency that this happens in?

509
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:14,200
We don't know. It's just been discovered. The most shocking thing that we've just published on with

510
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:21,800
this is that it gets into the nerve cells and re-emerges in the esophagus and causes a disease

511
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:29,240
called acholasia. And the ability of the esophagus to deliver food to the stomach is lost.

512
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,160
The esophagus can't open, so you can't swallow it all.

513
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,920
And just to be clear, this can occur during primary infection or reinfection,

514
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,680
or is this just during reinfection?

515
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,040
Just during reinfection.

516
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,280
What triggers the reinfection? I mean, I think most people understand that...

517
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:51,720
If I could answer that question, I believe I could get an all-expenses-paid

518
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,360
trip to Stockholm in December.

519
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:02,280
And if not there, at a minimum, you would probably get free dinner at Red Lobster every Tuesday for

520
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,560
the rest of your life. That's the second prize after the Nobel Prize. Yeah, it's interesting.

521
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,480
I mean, we know it's a disease associated with aging, or the reactivation is associated with

522
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,720
aging. And we know that things like weakened immune system can see it, I think, in the early

523
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,040
days of HIV, we would see patients. A weakened immune system is part of it,

524
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:26,040
and that's how you get to aging. That sets the stage. It seems likely that the virus

525
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:33,640
keeps reactivating periodically throughout your life, and that when you have shingles,

526
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:42,040
just exceed a threshold because the immune system has receded just enough to let it out,

527
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,200
reach the clinical threshold. That's the idea.

528
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,960
And the current vaccine that we have, Mike, the shingric vaccine, the two-shot separated by six

529
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,480
months, this has been kind of a step forward, correct? That has been a giant leap forward.

530
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:04,040
That's been amazing. And the purpose of that vaccine is just to prime our immune system

531
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:13,320
to the virus once again, to either catch it more quickly if it escapes the RG or...

532
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:21,480
Even more important, the enteric dose, it's about 97% effective. Remarkable vaccine.

533
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:27,400
Yeah, I got mine early. I'm not quite 50 yet, but I was like, ah, what the heck am I waiting for?

534
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:33,000
And the other thing I'll tell you is what a kick in the chops that vaccine is. That makes you sick.

535
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:39,720
Actually, interestingly, the older you are when you get it, the less likely you are to be bothered

536
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:46,360
by the injection. I'm reaping the benefits of my young immune system as I get butchered by the

537
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:55,640
shingric shot. What about diseases like autism? Children with autism seem to have, as the severity

538
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:01,000
of their illness goes up, an increase in the prevalence of gastrointestinal illnesses.

539
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,920
How well acknowledged is that? Is that loosely accepted or is that now becoming more accepted?

540
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,160
It's so accepted. What does that tell us? Right.

541
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,080
What can we take from that? What does that suggest potentially?

542
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:22,760
Well, autism is a disease involving probably synaptic transmission. It occurs in the CNS,

543
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:29,560
the well-known behavioral effects. It occurs also in the enteric nervous system

544
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:38,920
with small effects on the GI tract, some of which are constipation but more frequently diarrhea.

545
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,360
There also seems to be a higher degree of food sensitivities and allergies, doesn't there?

546
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:52,120
Yes. That's not so well understood, but it does seem to be related to activation of mass cells.

547
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:59,480
Spoken with many parents of kids with autistic children and a lot of them are pretty convinced

548
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:05,560
that if they pay more attention to what their kids eat, they can reduce the severity of their

549
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:13,960
symptoms. This would not seem like an entirely unreasonable idea given the simple observation

550
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:21,480
of this association, correct? It wouldn't seem to be unreasonable, but having said that, I would

551
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:29,080
like to point out to you that there's no regularity to the symptoms that you can point to. It's hard

552
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:36,680
to back it up and people have been unable to produce any sort of rigorous background for that,

553
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:42,920
so that when you put controls and constant observation, you just can't document it.

554
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:49,720
There must be so much variability that it almost seems like you have to be kind of empirical in

555
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,920
approach and probably no hate the term, but no one size fits all here, which is stating the obvious,

556
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:03,080
I suppose. I should also point out that the area is a bit fraught because in 1991,

557
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:10,200
a British gastroenterologist by the name of Andrew Wakefield published a study

558
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:16,600
in for a large number of children, not a large numbers. Yeah, it was actually a very small number.

559
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:22,280
We actually did a podcast on this entire subject matter, Mike. Oh, did you? Yeah, yeah. But by all

560
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,440
means, go ahead and tell the story because not everyone will have heard that podcast with Brian

561
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:35,240
Deer. Oh, well, he knows much more about it than I do. But in any case, Wakefield associated it with

562
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:44,760
GI inflammation. And his idea was that if you ate gluten containing material, you could produce

563
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:53,560
from what you were eating, what he called endorphins. That is, you'd eat an opiate like material.

564
01:05:54,280 --> 01:06:00,600
Magically, the enzymes, the digestive tract would liberate opiate like products.

565
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,880
You'd absorb these opiate like substances and they would go to the immature,

566
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:15,560
developing nervous system and cause autism. That is not the case. And his idea was that if you got

567
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:23,240
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, it would cause the defect in the gut, which could lead to the

568
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:34,520
absorption of these products. That was also incorrect. You can't train an enzyme to cut

569
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:41,400
something differently than the way the genes have programmed it to. So that trypsin looks for

570
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:48,760
particular amino acids and cuts proteins there. It doesn't care what kind of endorphin is sitting

571
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:55,560
somewhere else. Nothing can ever make it cut that out. And then when it gets peptides out,

572
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:02,920
peptides are essentially not absorbed. The only thing that's absorbed are amino acids, maybe

573
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:10,600
dipeptides, tripeptides. So tiny little molecules are absorbed. Yeah, let's make sure people

574
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:16,040
understand the difference there. Amino acids are the building blocks of peptides. A peptide is a

575
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:22,680
string of amino acids, but the amino acid is the smallest functional unit that makes up a protein.

576
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:27,400
So we have these 20 amino acids and you can string them together in thousands and thousands to make

577
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:34,440
complex proteins. But small peptide of 9 to 11 amino acids, for example, would be what the immune

578
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,280
system recognizes. And what you're saying, Mike, is from a GI standpoint, they have to be even

579
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:45,720
smaller than an immunogenic peptide if they're only sort of single amino acids or maybe two

580
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:51,720
peptides or two amino acids joined. That's correct. That gets absorbed. But even if there was some

581
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,800
miracle happened and they got absorbed, they couldn't get to the blood-brain barrier. They

582
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:03,400
wouldn't, in fact, go past the liver. So I testified, actually, to Congress on that subject.

583
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,680
Yeah, it's funny. Now that I think about it, Mike, I think you were actually mentioned in Brian Deere's

584
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:15,960
book. I might have been. There was an exhibit at the Science Museum in London called The Autism

585
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:24,280
Files. And I had a section called Mike's Miracles. And Mike's Miracles had to do with the way I was

586
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:31,720
phrasing it when I testified to Congress. And I was threatened then by Congress.

587
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,160
You were threatened?

588
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:40,040
Yes. I was told that if I didn't recant my testimony, I would be charged with perjury.

589
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,160
I'm not sure I understand.

590
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:50,040
So I testified at the Congressional Committee on Government Oversight. And the chair of the

591
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:57,800
committee did not like my testimony in a major way. In fact, he had to be restrained from throwing

592
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:05,320
a gavel at me. And after that, when I went cringing into the cloakroom afterward,

593
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,520
Congressman Waxman from California came over to me and gave me a high five.

594
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:16,920
Remind me the name I've forgotten now. What was the name of the congressman who was adamant that

595
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,040
Wakefield was right?

596
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,120
You've got me. I can't believe it. I'm trying to think of the name. I was afraid you were going

597
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,720
to ask me that question.

598
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,640
Yes. Now this is all kind of coming back to me like a horrible bad dream.

599
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:37,240
His grandson had autism and he was sure he got it from his vaccine. He said he could see this

600
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:42,360
wonderful child develop autism before they even got the needle out of his arm.

601
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:48,920
I know it'll come to one of us as we continue this discussion. Let's talk about serotonin before we

602
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:56,840
go further because serotonin levels are higher in at least a subset of kids with ASD.

603
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,400
And most people when they think of serotonin, they associate it with a hormone in the brain

604
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:10,600
that is responsible for mood. Can you say a little bit more about serotonin and in particular the role

605
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,880
of serotonin in the gut?

606
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,280
Well, serotonin is a molecule that I've been working on since college. I did my senior thesis

607
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:27,720
on serotonin when I graduated from Cornell in 1958, probably when dinosaurs roamed the

608
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:36,680
earth when I was young. In any case, serotonin was discovered actually in the gut.

609
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:42,680
Enterochromosin cells, which are an endocrine cell of the gut, are responsible for making about

610
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:50,520
95 percent of the body serotonin. The brain produces about two to three percent of the body

611
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:59,240
serotonin. So although the brain serotonin is probably what makes life worthwhile by that is

612
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:06,440
living and is responsible for happiness among other things, in terms of amounts it's a little

613
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:15,960
afterthought of evolution. So within the gut, serotonin is made in two places. The bulk of it

614
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:23,000
is made, as I've just said, in the endroendocrine cells, which are the small endocrine cells that

615
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,880
are part of the GI epithelium. It's a minor component of the epithelium, but a major component

616
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:36,840
functionally of what the gut does. About 80 percent of the endocrine cells make serotonin.

617
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:43,320
The other source is serotonin containing nerve cells within the enterochromosin system.

618
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:51,880
So it is a neurotransmitter and an endocrine substance in the gut. It's very important in

619
01:11:51,880 --> 01:12:01,000
feeling pain in the gut. It's very important in triggering nausea. So in sending signals

620
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,840
from the gut to the brain, serotonin is an important transmitting substance.

621
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:17,800
During development, serotonin is very important as a growth factor. The first nerve cells to form

622
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:27,400
in the gut make serotonin. Subsequent nerve cells depend on serotonin, triggers them to develop.

623
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:34,920
So if you knock serotonin out of the nervous system, the gut winds up with too few neurons.

624
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:42,040
It doesn't have enough and it doesn't work very well. If you knock serotonin out of the epithelium,

625
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:51,960
then there's problems signaling back to the brain. The peristalsic reflex is impaired.

626
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:59,560
It's not stopped, but it's impaired because the enteroendocrine cells in the gut can trigger

627
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:07,240
peristaltic waves that are propulsive. But if you lose that, then in order to trigger it, you have

628
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:15,000
to press harder and harder and dilate the gut and get the nervous system to do this directly.

629
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:22,120
It's highly involved within the gut and it also talks to the immune system. So it triggers

630
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:28,760
inflammation. As you might imagine from the amount of it that's in the bowel, it does everything.

631
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:36,520
It's a pan function, multifunctional molecule. Now there's a class of medication, of course,

632
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:42,600
that are used to treat the symptoms of depression and in some cases anxiety. And these medications,

633
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:49,720
SSRIs, prevent the reuptake of serotonin, this neurotransmitter in the brain, presumably leaving

634
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:57,080
more of it around to exert positive effects. What are the effects of SSRIs outside of the CNS?

635
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:05,640
Do they impact the gut specifically? Yes, they tend to cause nausea by enhancing the ability

636
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:13,160
of serotonin to talk back to the brain to trigger nausea. Drugs that are used in cancer chemotherapy

637
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:20,520
also trigger the release of serotonin within the gut and trigger that reflex. Same one.

638
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:30,360
The SSRIs also first make the gut go a little bit faster, but then when the gut keeps doing that,

639
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:38,920
the receptors, that is the molecules upon which serotonin acts, desensitize. One way they do that

640
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:46,360
is to internalize and so they can actually block the effect of serotonin and transit.

641
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:53,400
So in terms of motility, they can make the gut go faster and ultimately they stop the gut

642
01:14:54,360 --> 01:15:01,720
and give rise to long-term constipation and have to be stopped. So they're nauseating,

643
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:09,880
they change motility, and during development if you give them to a mouse during fetal development

644
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,360
that is given to the mother during fetal development, you get an abnormal nervous

645
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:20,840
system in the mouse's nervous system because of the effect during fetal life.

646
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,680
Are SSRIs contraindicated in pregnancy?

647
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:32,680
They are used frequently and in large numbers, large amounts in pregnancy because pregnancy is

648
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:39,400
very often associated with depression. Fortunately, most commonly, postpartum, but even then it's a

649
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:47,640
problem because SSRIs can be communicated to the child in breast milk. But there is evidence that

650
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:55,080
a number of conditions are increased, such as irritable bowel syndrome in the offspring of

651
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:02,360
mothers who are treated with SSRIs during pregnancy. Is that understood by the physicians

652
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:07,320
that prescribe them? And obviously there were going to be scenarios where those risks are worth it.

653
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:15,320
Yeah, people worry about it. But let me tell you, depression is a potentially lethal illness.

654
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:22,440
And if you've got something in which to treat it, sometimes you just have to use it.

655
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,880
Yeah, I just wonder if, because there are alternatives, right? I mean SNRIs

656
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,000
can also be very efficacious, presumably they don't have the same effect.

657
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:39,320
They do have some of the same effects because the SNRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine,

658
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,320
we have taken here, but they're just less.

659
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,680
Less serotonin.

660
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:49,160
Not less serotonin, less selective for serotonin. They include norepinephrine as well. So that

661
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:54,840
doesn't get you anywhere. Let's talk a little bit about leaky gut. This is a term I think a lot of

662
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,480
people have heard of, and I think they sort of maybe get the gestalt of. But in the context of

663
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:06,200
everything we've been discussing where we now have a pretty clear sense of what these

664
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:11,400
enterocytes are up against on their one side, on the luminal side, they've got just

665
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:20,760
never-ending barrage of toxins, microorganisms, bacteria viruses, food stuff that have to be

666
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,440
absorbed. At the same time, they can't be digested by these things. We didn't talk about tight

667
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,880
junctions specifically. Do you want to maybe tell people what the tight junctions are that

668
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,840
sit between these things?

669
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:39,400
Epithelia are the cells that line cavities. Epithelia have three types of junctions that

670
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:48,120
hold the cells together. One type is called a desmosome or a spot weld, just very tenacious,

671
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:55,640
hard to pull out connection between the cells. Another one is called the tight junction.

672
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:04,280
Tight junction has protein in the membrane on one cell, forms an attraction to the membrane across

673
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:12,600
the cell, transmembrane, and it obliterates the space between two cells. So the function of tight

674
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:20,520
junctions is to prevent material going through the channel between two epithelial cells. It's a plug

675
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:26,840
in the bathtub. There's another junction called an adhesion junction, which is essentially like

676
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:34,280
the spot weld, but it also is contractile. But let's concentrate on the tight junction because

677
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:40,680
that's what we're now talking about. And the more of these tight junctions you have between two

678
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:51,400
epithelial cells, the less leaky or permeable that connection is between them. So anything that

679
01:18:51,400 --> 01:19:00,360
interferes with tight junctions can make the channel open and allow material from the lumen

680
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:08,760
to get into the body, but at the same time allow material within the body to get into the lumen.

681
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:17,400
And material going into the lumen is very dangerous because, as I've told you,

682
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:24,280
anything going into the lumen is lost from the body. And so if you open tight junctions

683
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,160
in the lining of the gut, you can essentially flow out into your bowel.

684
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:36,200
And Mike, besides the obvious, which would be water or electrolytes, is there ever

685
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:42,440
scenario where nutrients that were actually absorbed now go back into the lumen?

686
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:49,800
Absolutely. And worse than that, protein from the body. It turns out that underneath the lining of

687
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:58,360
the gut, capillaries are very permeable, and there's a lot of protein in the lymph, the fluid,

688
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:05,160
underneath the lining. And so if you open the lining of the gut, that protein gets into the GI

689
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:12,760
tract, and that's a disease called exudative enteropathy. You lose protein, and people with

690
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:19,640
that disease can blow up and look like balloons because edema goes all over the body. It's a

691
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:26,360
terrible thing. So Mike, what would you say is the most common cause of leaky gut? Allergy.

692
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:32,840
Okay, so meaning there is hypersensitivity. That is, the immune system is reacting

693
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:39,960
and causing tight junctions to open. Is this an allergy in the food specifically because the

694
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:48,920
allergen is in the lumen? Not always. For example, bee sting can cause this or can be injected,

695
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:55,160
or some other way that you can get a toxin that can do this. I want to ask a question going back

696
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,920
to something you said earlier that I never really have thought about until now, but I've never

697
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,320
thought this deeply about the gut. You know when they say a shark, like great white sharks have

698
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:07,720
multiple rows of teeth so that they're kind of constantly just pushing forward so when teeth

699
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:12,840
fall off, you kind of have new ones that have already grown into place. How does this epithelial

700
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:20,120
layer replace itself while preserving the tight junction? We're talking about every week or so

701
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:25,320
these epithelial cells slough off and new ones are present. Does that mean we have

702
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:31,560
several rows of them ready to sort of spring into action already tightly bound to their neighbors?

703
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:39,080
Or how does that happen to preserve the integrity? The gut is arranged lining the small intestine

704
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:45,240
and to a lesser extent the large intestine so that the gut lining is highly folded.

705
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:54,520
And there are projections that come up from the surface of the gut that look like fingers.

706
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:02,600
These are called villi. So most absorption occurs on the surfaces of these villi.

707
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:12,360
Now between the villi there are clefts called crypts and at the base of crypts there are stem cells

708
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:19,720
and the stem cells which live next to this other cell that I mentioned earlier called the paneth

709
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:28,280
cell can give rise to each of the cells that form the villi or line the gut. And there's an

710
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:36,360
escalation of those cells. The progeny of the stem cells keep rising so as new ones form

711
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:45,640
other ones move up. In part the proliferation in the crypt produces a pressure that causes cells

712
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:53,240
to rise as they differentiate but they're also mobile so they crawl a little bit as well. And if

713
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:59,880
you wound the lining of the gut then adjacent cells can crawl over the space and cut it off.

714
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:08,680
At the tips of the villi there's a zone called the extrusion zone and so the cells are born

715
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:15,320
at the base of a crypt climb up the crypt up the villus reach the tip of the villus

716
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:24,280
die and are poofed off at that point. So they stay in contact with one another

717
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:32,280
and the tight junctions are finally lose it when the cells die or the desmosomes and they pop off.

718
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:40,200
So the mechanism of death is called apoptosis so they're programmed to die.

719
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:46,520
We talked about the importance of toxins, allergies, things like that playing a role in

720
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:54,600
leaky and inflamed gut cells. Are there any reputable assays that can identify what these

721
01:23:54,600 --> 01:24:01,000
are in an individual that has otherwise vague symptoms? If somebody has a substantially leaky

722
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:11,720
gut you would guess it from making a determination of the serum protein albumin. If the gut is leaking

723
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:19,800
albumin will be low and so if you see a low albumin you can look for it. If you think it's true

724
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:30,200
you can look for an enzyme called alpha 1 antitrypsin. Tripsin is produced by the pancreas

725
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:38,840
antitrypsin blocks it, its action and it gets into the lining into the gut. It should not be

726
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:45,480
absorbed. It's a measurement that will tell you whether the gut is leaking or not. By the way

727
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:51,240
there's an alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency disease isn't there it's a hereditary condition? Yes.

728
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:57,400
What do those patients present with? Usually vascular and lung disease because there's too

729
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:05,720
much digestive action damaging in those organs. I think I said it wrong. Alpha 1 antitrypsin is on

730
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:14,040
the luminal side, sorry, on the vascular side and if it gets into the stool that's the problem.

731
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:20,440
I see. So we shouldn't be seeing it in the stool? Correct. Do you have to see low albumin to make

732
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:26,120
the diagnosis of leaky gut? Because that's a very significant leaky gut. I mean if a person is

733
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:32,680
exuding protein to the level where it shows up in their serum albumin that would strike me as a

734
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:38,120
lot of leak correct? Correct. Are there milder leaks that don't allow something as massive as

735
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:47,240
albumin to escape but do allow toxins and microorganisms in? That is now getting onto the level

736
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:54,920
of controversy but it has probably not toxins in, at least not to a great extent.

737
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:03,080
Maybe a little bit, yes, and take it back a little bit and you can look for those by giving

738
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:13,400
various peptides or fluorescein or dyes that measure it by oral that should be excluded

739
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:20,840
from the blood and seeing if the fluorescence gets into the blood or you can measure it with

740
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:27,400
certain sugars that should not be absorbed and if the non-absolvable sugar gets into the body,

741
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:34,840
then you assume this is slightly of the kind you're talking about. And do we think that there

742
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:41,400
is a causal relationship between leaky gut and autism spectrum disorder or do we think that

743
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:47,240
these are things that move together for a similar underlying pathology? The problem in

744
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:54,760
the gut in autism spectrum disorder is a disorder of the nervous system. It has nothing to do with

745
01:26:54,760 --> 01:27:01,480
leaky gut. That's part of the Wakefield hypothesis, leaky gut, no evidence that that's correct.

746
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:07,320
Let's go back and explain again now that we've talked more about serotonin. What do we think is

747
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:14,760
the relationship between, do we see more leaky gut in ASD? Not really. Let me give you an

748
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:26,920
illustration. My collaborators and I have produced a mouse called G56A. This mouse has a mutation

749
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:36,120
in the serotonin transporter. The serotonin transporter is the protein that you spoke of

750
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:46,280
before that is the target of SSRIs. It is what the SSRIs inhibit and which remove serotonin

751
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:55,160
from the circulation or from the synaptic cleft when it's a neurotransmitter. What this mutation

752
01:27:55,160 --> 01:28:04,280
does though is not inhibit CERT but make it more active. So CERT becomes what I like to call the

753
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:13,080
super CERT mouse. This animal has essentially a deficiency of serotonin. It is so effective at

754
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:22,040
inactivating serotonin after its release that it doesn't have a chance to act. So that animal has

755
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:32,520
a smaller nervous system in the gut, too few neurons, and it has slow transit, and it has a

756
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:40,840
problem in the gut. In the brain, it doesn't socially interact with other mice. If you put

757
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:48,920
them in a tube, two mice convene. One with the mutation backs out and lets the other mouse through

758
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:56,040
all the time. And it has repetitive behaviors. It keeps tapping its foot, hitting its head against

759
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:05,640
the side of the cage. So it has central features that look like autism, and it has a GI tract which

760
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:16,680
is abnormal. Abdomenolity is seen in about 2% of patients with ASD. So it was the human abnormality

761
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:27,720
put into mouse. Now it's not the cause of autism, but it's a sort of test case. It's one of the many

762
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:36,440
genes that can give rise to autism. Put into a mouse shows autism and also defect in the gut.

763
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:44,360
The defect in the gut has to do with serotonin and the ability of serotonin to act as a growth

764
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:52,200
factor. So there's a deficiency in terms of numbers of nerve cells in the bowel. In a patient

765
01:29:52,200 --> 01:30:00,360
with autism spectrum disorder, similar kinds of things happen. This, by the way, is exactly the

766
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:11,480
opposite effect of giving a mouse during development an SSRI. So if you give a mother SSRI, they get

767
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:17,640
too many nerve cells growing in the gut. If you knock out the transporter, you have too many nerve

768
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:24,760
cells in the gut. And if you make the transporter more active, you have too few. And remind me again

769
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:32,520
the phenotype of the former, and you have in utero exposure to an SSRI. You have too many nerve cells

770
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:41,240
in the gut, and so gut motility becomes defective. I want to talk about bacteria now. We very briefly

771
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:45,640
touched on it earlier, and I knew if I started, I wouldn't stop. And the first time it came up was

772
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:50,520
when we talked about the difference between the colon and the small intestine. And one of the many

773
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:56,920
differences between them, of course, is the flora. Can you give people a sense of how many bacteria

774
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:02,760
exist in the small intestine? And let's start maybe even divide them into three. Let's talk

775
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:08,680
about the proximal small intestine, so the jejunum, the late small intestine, you know, the ilium before

776
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:14,280
it gets to the cecum, and then the colon. What's the relative difference in bacterial colony?

777
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:23,800
The numbers of organisms descend, that is, were assent as you go down the gut, so that you have

778
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:31,640
more of them close to the colon. And it's thought in a large way that stomach acid

779
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:40,120
sterilizes, to a large extent, the food that you eat. Although there are bacteria that can be found,

780
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:44,280
even in the stomach, in the presence of one normal hydrochloric acid,

781
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:53,480
helicobacter pylori, being the prime example of an organism that can survive. But the small intestine

782
01:31:53,480 --> 01:32:01,320
then neutralizes stomach acid, but benefits from that acid because very few organisms are dumped

783
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:10,440
into it. The motility of the small intestine and the fact that the smaller numbers of organs come in

784
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:18,120
contribute to keeping the number down as the gut pumps its way on down. In addition, there are

785
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:27,480
cells like paneth cells, which make antibacterial proteins, which are called defensins, which help to

786
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:36,120
keep the lumen of the gut, not sterile, but close to it. As you get closer and closer to the colon,

787
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:43,640
the mechanisms, the numbers of paneth cells decline, gut slows down, and you're getting

788
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:51,000
close to a large number of organisms which live in the colon. And they're separated by the ileocecal

789
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:59,960
sphincter from the colon. When bolus of food gets into the colon, or not just food, it's by then

790
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:06,440
kind, it's been digested. When that material is delivered to the colon, it goes into a region

791
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:13,480
where it will spend some time. And in the colon, there are huge numbers of organisms.

792
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:19,480
Now, the numbers of organisms are about equal in number to the number of cells of the body.

793
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:27,400
We're talking trillions. And you have perhaps tenfold more bacterial genes than you do

794
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:33,880
your own genes in your body. And what are the classes of bacteria? Are these all gram negative?

795
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:43,320
No. A lot of them are gram negative. What they do have in common is that they are almost all anaerobes.

796
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:50,280
That is, they live in the absence of oxygen. And most of them are very hard to culture.

797
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:59,480
And so until relatively recently, we had no idea what a teeming mass of organisms were in there.

798
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:06,040
I mean, people all knew for a long time that the colon still wasn't sterile. And they, people,

799
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:13,240
culture still. But most of the organisms are highly resistant to culture and have been detected

800
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:17,000
through molecular biology. You look for the genes.

801
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:22,920
So now that that's been done, I assume we've done the equivalent of the human genome project

802
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:26,920
for the human colon, there tend to be a few classes of these things, right? I mean,

803
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,640
bacteroides is pretty common. Actinobacteria, proteobacteria, I mean,

804
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,480
what are the broad categories of these facultative anaerobes and such?

805
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:42,120
Well, there are about 16 different classes, and I can't remember them all. One of the

806
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:49,640
largest of them is the firmicutes. But bifidobacteria and lactobacteria, those tend to be

807
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:59,080
bacteria that we think of as good. Clostridia tend to be organisms that mostly are bad,

808
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:08,200
but not entirely. Some of those bacteria are related to causing cancer. Some of those bacteria

809
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:15,960
are highly protective. And they do stuff for us. For example, one of the things we eat a lot of

810
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:25,800
is fiber, celery, for example, celery or lettuce. We don't digest that. We have no enzymes that can

811
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:34,280
digest that. But we have bacteria in our gut that live on that, and they digest that. And they make

812
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:41,720
short-chain fatty acids from that. And those short-chain fatty acids are solved by the lining

813
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:49,800
of the colon. And our colonic epithelia are dependent on the bacteria to keep going,

814
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:55,800
and they get the bulk of their energy from the bacteria in the gut. The bacteria also make

815
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:02,680
certain vitamins that we can't live without, vitamin K being the most famous of them.

816
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:13,400
So clotting of blood depends on the bacteria. And as you probably know, they also seem to regulate

817
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:23,080
things like mood and obesity. It just strikes me as one of the most poorly understood connections

818
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:30,440
for something that has such a high impact on human health at this point still. Obviously,

819
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:35,400
we know more today than we did 20 years ago, but in many ways, it still feels like this is a bit of

820
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:42,200
a black box. Is that just my ignorance? No, it's our ignorance. So why are we ignorant, you might ask.

821
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:48,760
And the answer is, I've just told you, we can't culture most of those organisms.

822
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:55,880
They are extremely difficult to study. And Mike, pardon my ignorance, I'm not a cell biologist.

823
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:01,240
How much of that difficulty is because they're anaerobic and just logistically,

824
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:06,280
it's more complicated to culture organisms in the absence of oxygen? Or is there something

825
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,840
that even goes beyond that? Oh, it goes well beyond that. We don't know the nutrient,

826
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:16,520
not broths and things to which they can live. It's easy enough to make an atmosphere that has

827
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:23,640
no oxygen in it. But it's not so easy to figure out what they need to live. Colon produces a great

828
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:31,160
environment and how to match it is not so easy to figure. This is a very remarkable evolutionary

829
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:37,800
tale and also perhaps the most interesting symbiosis we experience. This strikes me as a

830
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:44,840
more interesting symbiosis than the one we share with bacteria on our skin. Is that a fair statement?

831
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:52,440
I think so because the bacteria are able to get involved with the nervous system

832
01:37:53,160 --> 01:38:03,160
in a way that bacteria, the skin, pretty much do not. So for example, the bacteria that are in the gut

833
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:10,680
can activate lining of the epithelial cell for enteroendocrine cells to release serotonin

834
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:18,680
or other chemicals from them. And that can signal by way of the vagus nerves to the brain.

835
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:28,040
Or chemical products that the bacteria make can also trigger nerve signals that send signals back

836
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:34,840
to the brain or even go through the blood-brain barrier to affect the brain. So that experiments

837
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:40,680
can be done for example with mice in which one can breed germ-free mice.

838
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:49,080
Germ-free notobiotic is the term for that. Germ-free animals grow up without any contact or organisms

839
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:52,600
in them. I'm not trying to understand how that's possible Mike. I mean I've heard about it but I've

840
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:58,440
never really understood it. How do you have a germ-free animal? How do you feed it? You're feeding

841
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:04,600
it sterile food into a... and they had to have been born because this would have begun gestationally.

842
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:11,480
That's right. So they're all born by caesarean section. They're fed sterile food and they live

843
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:18,600
in incubators and people handle them with gloves. What's the phenotype of that animal after two

844
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:24,840
years relative to an otherwise identical animal that's born normally and fed normally? Let's go

845
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:33,880
one year. Okay and that tells me something really changes. Yes. So for one thing, the numbers of nerve

846
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:40,600
cells in their gut, their motility, the lining of the gut, they're all different. They're very much

847
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:48,680
more primitive. They have almost no spleen. They have none of the pyre's patches that we, you know,

848
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:54,760
talking to the immune cells. So their immune system must be horrible? Yes. They have no immune system

849
01:39:55,480 --> 01:40:02,600
but they have a thymus and so they can develop an immune system in a big hurry if they survive.

850
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:09,160
You take them out and expose them to bacteria. But what you can do with the organisms with the gut

851
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:17,800
is use them as vessels and recolonize the gut with organisms. So for example, if you take those

852
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:24,840
animals and colonize them with bacteria derived from a strain of mice that tend to be lean,

853
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:33,720
you get lean mice derived from those animals. If you colonize them with from a strain of

854
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:41,240
mouse that tends to be fat, those animals grow up to be fat and you can cross strains.

855
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:51,400
So that that seems to indicate that bacteria can determine obesity or lack thereof. Yeah. How do we

856
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:57,080
think this plays out in humans where it's not as extreme? We don't have Darryl humans. But your

857
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:01,160
point is, and I believe there have been some experiments done. You'll have to correct me

858
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:06,280
because I don't follow this literature, but haven't they done some fecal transplants from

859
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:14,280
lean to obese that have at least partially addressed the phenotype? Correct. And also

860
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:23,320
anxiety seems to work in its very similar fashion. But what you have to take with the human is always

861
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:28,440
everything with a grain of salt because the experiments are very difficult to do.

862
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:36,040
And they're all flawed because you can't deal with pure organisms, pure humans,

863
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:40,680
what they're retaining. Do you have any idea how many such transplants have been done

864
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:46,120
where they've done a fecal transplant from a lean to an obese individual? How many times has that

865
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:51,400
been done? Not under a controlled setting. Why do you think that type of research, while admittedly

866
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:58,600
complicated, is technically feasible and has a potential for enormous fecal transplantation

867
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:05,080
in humans? It's not without danger. For sure. Tell people how the procedure works and obviously what

868
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:11,720
the risks are because I believe the only approved use of the therapy is for C. difficile. So you've

869
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:18,600
already alluded to Clostridia before. Yeah, let me just say Clostridium difficile is a normal

870
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:25,800
component of the GI tract. Many, many people have it and it sits there. And with your organisms,

871
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:32,520
one of the major ways that you control the various bacteria is to have other bacteria.

872
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:41,960
And so the bacteria control themselves. There's a competition for how much nutrient is there when

873
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:49,720
they make toxins that affect one another. But people then take antibiotics and the major effect

874
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:58,840
on the human microbiome is an antibiotic. For the most part, we like to think antibiotics are used

875
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:06,040
effectively and appropriately when you have an infection and they're given to you to fix that.

876
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:14,200
Unfortunately, that happens not to be the case. A lot of people are exposed to antibiotics because

877
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:22,920
they're used in agriculture and they're used in agriculture because it was found probably 60 years

878
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:33,800
ago that giving antibiotics will cause animals to grow faster and get bigger faster. And so you can

879
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:42,760
give antibiotics for that reason. You can also keep pigs more safely in small quarters by giving

880
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:52,040
them antibiotics because infections are not wiping them out so badly. This profligate, if I might use

881
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:59,240
the term, use of antibiotics in agriculture, exposes the human population to antibiotics

882
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:07,240
and changes our bacteria in ways that we would never have appreciated. Just to give you an

883
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:16,920
illustration, my son who has now just turned 60 but was young once when he was a child, he got

884
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:27,080
pneumonia. Kids do. And so culture was taken, was found that it was pneumococcal pneumonia. He was

885
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:35,160
too. So he was given penicillin to treat pneumococcal pneumonia. He got an exudative

886
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:42,840
enduropathy for it, his skin peeled off, his teeth came in mottled, his hair changed, his fingernails

887
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:52,200
changed, he was taking baths in oatmeal. We nearly lost him. So he is deathly allergic to penicillin.

888
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:59,400
How the hell did he get to be allergic to penicillin at age two when he never had it?

889
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:09,160
Well, part of the answer was that my wife had a very bad infection and so he had to be bottle fed

890
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:16,600
after the first month of life. And so he had cow's milk for a long time. Nothing

891
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:24,600
wrong with that. Kids always drink cow's milk. But cow's milk is coming now with penicillin in it

892
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:30,280
because the agricultural industry treats penicillin. So he developed an allergy to penicillin.

893
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:37,160
He then got treated with it. So now he doesn't take penicillin anymore. As it turns out,

894
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:44,120
I discovered many years later, I too am allergic to penicillin. That's where he got it from. I

895
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:50,040
apologize to him, but it's a gene. But do you think he would have been less allergic to it

896
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:55,640
despite his susceptibility genetically if he had been breastfed normally? Well, if he'd been

897
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:01,240
breastfed normally, the first time he got penicillin, he would have been sensitized,

898
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:07,480
but he wouldn't already have had the allergy. He behaved as if he was exposed to penicillin

899
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:15,080
because he had been. But in a way we never knew. And lots of kids are getting it. But the major

900
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:20,920
effect of it is that it's affecting a microbiome. But let's go back and explain how a stool

901
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:26,520
transplant works for C. diff. You were also explaining how it's not a zero risk procedure,

902
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:31,880
even though in the case of C. diff, it's life-saving. What happens in C. diff is that

903
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:40,840
patients get antibiotics. It knocks out the bulk of the bacteria. C. diff is resistant,

904
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:48,360
and it emerges as dominant. It produces a toxin. The toxin causes massive diarrhea,

905
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:55,800
and that can wipe you out. Very similar to the way cholera toxin does. It works in a different way.

906
01:46:55,800 --> 01:47:03,320
It works on the nervous system, but it's a bad toxin. So to cure C. diff, one takes oral

907
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:10,360
vancomycin is the first step. Vancomycin is an antibiotic to which C. diff is usually sensitive.

908
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:15,720
It hasn't become all that resistant because vancomycin isn't used that much,

909
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:24,600
and it's not absorbed. So it just goes down the gut. But if 25% of patients

910
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:30,440
don't respond to oral vancomycin or C. diff recurs after they take it,

911
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:37,960
and they can't get rid of it, in that case, the only thing that can be done is a fecal transplant.

912
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:43,160
That can be done as an enema, or it can be done as an interacoded capsule now,

913
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:51,080
so that the capsule goes down, bacteria recolonize the antibiotic, wiped out gut.

914
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:59,240
It then suppresses the C. diff. That's life-saving use, and it's approved. Now,

915
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:06,760
what's the difficulty? So you get stool for C. diff treatment that has been very carefully

916
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:14,280
looked at, and one knows that there are no organisms in it that are potentially dangerous.

917
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:22,680
You have perhaps 500 species of organism in your gut that are potentially lethal.

918
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:29,400
So one has to be careful. There used to be people were giving it husband to wife,

919
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:37,720
and people doing this kind of home bruise. We've lost a few patients that way. Not a good thing to

920
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:45,240
do. One has to be very careful when you're doing fecal transplantation. Mike, is there any potential

921
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:51,640
for using synthetic biology to create the microorganisms so that you could control exactly

922
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:58,920
what you're giving people so you could effectively capsulize the exact organisms

923
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:05,160
that people are deficient in and replace those without the risk of providing anything you don't

924
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:10,680
want to be part of the recolonization? I've already told you why that cannot be done,

925
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:16,440
because for the most part, we can't grow these organisms. If you can't grow them,

926
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:22,760
you can't produce them in such a way as to synthesize them. Knowing their genetic sequence,

927
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:29,080
you can't synthesize them if you don't have the media in which to keep them alive once you've

928
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:33,880
synthesized them. That's correct. You have to be able to not only make their DNA, but

929
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:39,320
make their food. Yeah, keep them going. How many people are working on this, Mike? This seems like

930
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:46,120
a really enormous opportunity if the code could be cracked, right? If you could figure out how to

931
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:52,440
support these bacteria in vitro, it does open the door to synthetic biology. It does open the door

932
01:49:52,440 --> 01:50:00,760
to basically medicines that are bacteria, right? Well, medicines that either are bacteria or are

933
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:07,720
derived from them. So knowing what the bacteria produce and knowing how they produce it

934
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:17,320
are just as good. So there is a huge amount of modern GI biology going into study of the GI

935
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:24,520
microbiome. Over the past 10 years, it's been the growth industry of the field. One of the things

936
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:31,480
that's very common today is commercial home kits that they're going to tell you what your sequence

937
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:38,520
looks like. This seems to be a field that's really full of a lot of nonsense. So there's been outright

938
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:43,480
frauds, right? There was that company out of UCSF called UBIOM that turned out to be kind of like

939
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:49,160
the Theranos of this space. There seem to be a lot of companies that if you give them a small

940
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:53,960
stool sample, they're going to send you a lengthy report of what your gut biome is. And let's assume

941
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:58,280
that they're even able to do that accurately. Is that a fair assumption? Are they able to provide

942
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:03,400
this information? Are they able to do the sequence and tell you what makes up your gut bacteria?

943
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:10,520
What they give you is the classes of organisms and the percentage of the total bacteria each of the

944
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:19,720
classes represent. And that turns out to be remarkably unuseful. Say more. Well, you need to

945
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:29,320
know species by species at a very, very fine level before you get to be able to really do something

946
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:37,720
with it. To get this class of bacteria in proportion of it's too high in the genome, too high in the...

947
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:41,960
So far too little resolution is being provided by these tests.

948
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:50,920
Correct. You can say you can change anxiety, you can change body form with the microbiome,

949
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:58,520
but to say that you can go look at the microbiome and then determine what that is, is not yet there.

950
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:05,480
You can't just go look at somebody's stool and say what they're consistent. The best of the kits

951
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:12,120
that I know of that do this are the ones that look for cancer. So like cologuard and things like that?

952
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:19,480
Yes. Those are excellent, but even those kits... Let's remind people exactly what cologuard is

953
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:28,760
looking for. As the cells age and undergo apoptosis, this left off into the lumen. And so human DNA

954
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:38,520
is in the lumen of the gut as well as bacterial DNA. And what cologuard does is looks at stool

955
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:46,040
and you can look at the DNA in the stool and look for the genetic signatures of a number of GI

956
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:56,120
cancers. And so about 90% of GI cancer can be picked up effectively by cologuard, which means

957
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:03,480
it's wonderful and it's a great advance, but it doesn't mean you don't have to go also do

958
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:09,000
colonoscopy. Yeah, the goal of colonoscopy is to find it before it's cancer. It's to find the

959
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,800
polyp that's going to become cancer, not wait until you have cancer. That's a major point.

960
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:21,800
But if you do have cancer and you find it early in a colonoscopy, that's great. And the problem

961
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:27,400
with cologuard is if you're missing 10% of cancer, you don't want that to happen.

962
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:34,200
It seems to me that cologuard is really a great tool in areas where access is limited,

963
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:38,120
where there might be hesitancy for colonoscopy and things like that. But I agree with you,

964
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:43,080
it's not a substitute for a colonoscopy. So this is an interesting point, Mike, which is basically

965
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:50,760
all of these commercial tests out there that are giving you information about your gut microbiome

966
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:55,000
are not doing it yet at a resolution that's actionable. Is that kind of a fair

967
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,880
synthesis of what you've said? Right. And my particular quarrel with them is that because

968
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:07,640
they're not doing it at a level that is sufficiently documented and sufficiently

969
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:15,960
informative for you to be actionable on that information, they cost money abnormally and they

970
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:22,840
change what you do for reasons that are not well documented and you shouldn't be following them yet.

971
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:31,640
Yeah. And a lot of them basically are paired with supplements or probiotics or prebiotics

972
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:37,480
that are supposed to quote unquote fix the defects that are found in the test. Right. Isn't that the

973
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:43,640
RXDX model? That's what they're doing. But what they're really doing is making money.

974
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:50,920
I think they're a con. I don't know enough to draw a strong enough conclusion. I can just say,

975
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:57,640
based on a decade of looking at them in many, many patients who have been adamant about having these

976
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:04,760
tests done, I'm still looking for a great example of where it mattered. I worry also that there is

977
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:10,520
a lot of noise created without a signal. One of the most important things nutritionally that people

978
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:19,800
can do to make sure that they have the optimal flora for their gut. I want to break this into

979
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:27,080
two categories, Mike. The first is just as general health maintenance and the second is after taking

980
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:32,840
antibiotics. So like it or not, we're going to take antibiotics and they're going to save our

981
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:38,920
lives from time to time. I have found myself to be more and more reluctant to take them and I

982
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,600
generally tend to resist as long as possible until I have no choice. But I'm going to hold

983
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:49,720
out a long time before I take a Z-pack. If I'm sick, I'm going to really try to make it go. But

984
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:53,880
I think the last time I took antibiotics was for a dental issue where it just required something

985
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:59,240
more significant. So let's start with the general maintenance principle. You're not someone who's

986
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:04,600
taking a lot of antibiotics, but you want to do what's best for your gut. And I assume that

987
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:10,520
nutrition is one of the most important levers we have. To my way of thinking, the best kind of

988
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:18,120
diet is a balanced diet, not one that tries to be like the South Beach or one of those diets

989
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:27,080
whose way. Having a balanced diet with appropriate nutrients, including vitamin C, but not in excess,

990
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:32,040
although won't hurt you to have any excess of vitamin C, but there's no reason to do it.

991
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:41,000
And particularly fiber included is good for your body. So I would be opposed to having particular

992
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:49,160
diets. For example, a cleanse. I like to point out to people that they should consider that the

993
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:55,800
microbiome is something they live with and has evolved with human beings as long as there have

994
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:01,480
been human beings. And cleansing the inside of the gut is not a good thing to be doing.

995
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:04,840
I'm not even sure I really understand what a cleanse is. I've heard so many different variants

996
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:10,360
of it, but certainly one method in which we do some form of a cleanse is a prep for a colonoscopy.

997
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:16,760
How much does that alter the flora of the gut, even though its purpose is really to just mechanically

998
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:22,200
get rid of all stool matter so that the endoscopy can be performed with better visibility? Does that

999
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:28,520
alter the gut flora in a way that doesn't return to normal quickly? No, remarkably little. That

1000
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:35,080
doesn't kill organisms or change the balance between them. What it does is just moves the

1001
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:41,320
mechanical stool out. And so the gastroenterologist is doing a colonoscopy and have a clear view of

1002
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:46,680
what's in you. When people do these dietary cleanses, they're usually drinking a lot of

1003
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:54,200
water with pepper and presumably some nutrients, but they're kind of doing a bowel prep, aren't they?

1004
01:57:54,200 --> 01:58:00,600
Some of them are also supplementing it with enemas. And I worry about those people getting

1005
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:07,000
into electrolyte imbalance. I see, but they shouldn't be killing the bacteria. No, they're

1006
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:14,280
not killing the bacteria. But on the other hand, they're not doing their body a favor by eating

1007
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:20,840
strange foods and that kind of thing. You alluded to soluble, pardon me, insoluble fiber earlier,

1008
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:24,680
the things that we can't digest at all in lettuce and celery and things of that nature.

1009
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:29,320
Tell me the importance again of that in the human diet, because there presumably are people who

1010
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:35,160
don't eat much or any insoluble fiber and that's going to clearly change their gut bacteria.

1011
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:38,280
Is there evidence that that is impacting their health negatively?

1012
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:45,720
Not that much has been done on low fiber for negative impact as so much as to show that there

1013
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:53,080
are health benefits of fiber. One of the benefits is that fiber can absorb toxins so that it can

1014
01:58:53,720 --> 01:59:03,080
decrease its thought carcinogen effects long-term. It also provides the colon something to chew down

1015
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:12,360
on and is good for motility, keeping the bowel going and in shape. And it also provides

1016
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:20,920
a substrate for the bacteria of the colon for them to chow down on and produce short chain fatty

1017
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:28,680
acids, which are good for the lining of the gut and provide it with its energy metabolism.

1018
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:34,760
By the way, do any of those short chain fatty acids, Mike, make their way into the person to

1019
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:38,920
provide ATP or energy there beyond just the epithelial cells?

1020
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:47,480
Less so, but the answer is yes. They are absorbed. And so to some extent, they can get into the body.

1021
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:50,600
Directly through chylomicrons as regular fatty acids would?

1022
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:57,800
No, no, no, they're very short and they're soluble and they tend, like acetic acid is a

1023
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:00,920
short chain fatty acid. That would be a one carbon.

1024
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:08,360
So fiber sounds like it's going to be the most important nutrient in terms of fueling the bacteria

1025
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:14,840
of the gut, which in turn pay service back to providing energy for the epithelial cells, correct?

1026
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:23,560
Not just fiber. Polysaccharides do as well. They can digest those. Everything that gets down there,

1027
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:30,360
they can live on. It's just that very little of the protein that you eat will get down to the colon.

1028
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:37,960
Then tell me about things like artificial sweeteners or non-nutritive additives to food.

1029
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:43,960
There's been a lot of discussion that, for example, aspartame or other sweeteners that

1030
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:51,640
aren't caloric may still provide some impact on the micro bacteria of the colon.

1031
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:53,400
How well is that understood?

1032
02:00:54,520 --> 02:01:01,000
There are bacteria that can metabolize them. And so there are effects on the bacteria.

1033
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:07,240
The net effect of that is I really can't speak to because that's a literature that I find

1034
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:14,600
to be self-contradictory. Some people think they do things. Some people think the effect is negligible.

1035
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:20,120
I haven't spent much time in that literature, but the little time I've spent in it, I've come away

1036
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:26,040
without much of an understanding of how these things are potentially creating an impact.

1037
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:31,160
You mentioned protein already. What do we know about the role of fatty acids in the colon? How

1038
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:37,400
many of them are making their way there? Well, most of the fatty acids that get to the colon

1039
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:41,880
are derived from fiber. In other words, they're not exogenous.

1040
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:48,200
That's true normally, but not always. So, for example, under abnormal conditions

1041
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:58,360
in which bile salts or pancreatic enzymes are deficient, then those fat can get into the colon

1042
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:06,040
and one gets fatty stool. Bacteria can metabolize that. And so in celiac disease,

1043
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:14,040
for example, there's a lot of fat in the stool or in biliary tract disease, there's often a lot of

1044
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:22,040
fat in the stool. The stool is described as greasy and foul smelling because the bacteria do

1045
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:28,440
metabolize it. What about the scenario where a person has taken antibiotics potentially for

1046
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:33,560
a protected course? What can they do to appropriately repopulate their gut?

1047
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:41,400
What a good question. Probably taking appropriate probiotics at the same time they're taking those

1048
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:47,480
antibiotics or afterward is helpful. And what constitutes appropriate probiotics? This is a

1049
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:55,480
world I know very little about. It varies. Some people think that yeast-derived saccharomyces is

1050
02:02:55,480 --> 02:03:04,920
good. Some people swear by lactobacilli or bifidobacteria. There is evidence that when you're

1051
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:11,240
taking antibiotics, saccharomyces at the same time, trying to think of the name of the pill

1052
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:16,760
that they sell, it's over the counter. And sorry, just for semantics, what's the difference between

1053
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:24,200
a pro and a prebiotic? Probiotic is defined as an organism that has beneficial effects,

1054
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:34,520
and a prebiotic is defined as a material that will enable the body to grow organisms that have

1055
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:41,480
beneficial effect. So the difference between them is that prebiotic enables you to make your own

1056
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:50,280
healthy organisms, probiotic as you eat them. So for example, I eat activity every day. Now that I've

1057
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:59,560
aged, it fights the problems of aging. So fermented foods are obviously valuable probiotics.

1058
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:07,080
An important point to bear in mind is not just that it's fermented. I mean, all yogurt is fermented,

1059
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:15,000
but that something like activity has bifidobacter animalis in it, which actually gets through,

1060
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:21,160
survives the stomach acid, goes down the GI tract, and comes out in the stool.

1061
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:24,520
And just to be clear, that's anaerobic bacteria or aerobic?

1062
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:29,560
It's an anaerob, but it can get down the gut and survive in the stool.

1063
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:35,000
It's so interesting that we can be eating something anaerobic that it can be in our food, right?

1064
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,840
It's added. I guess it's aerobic. It has to be aerobic.

1065
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:42,120
Kind of gets to the challenge of this whole anaerobic problem, right?

1066
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:48,840
Yes, but the organism that's put in, it actually goes through the GI tract and survives.

1067
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:57,240
So the importance of a probiotic is not only that it be there, but that it survive and do something

1068
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:02,040
in the GI tract. How can people navigate this world, Mike? Because this is another one of those

1069
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:08,840
places where there's a lot of opportunity for charlatans to sell you things that, A, don't even

1070
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:14,840
have the colonies that they claim they do, or if they're there, they're dead on arrival, and if

1071
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:20,840
they're not, they don't survive the transit from mouth to colon. I mean, how does one kick the

1072
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:31,800
tires on these things? Well, for one thing is you can trust the FTC and the FDA. So claims cannot be

1073
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:41,960
made for food stuff like a probiotic that are medical unless it has been subjected to actual

1074
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:52,280
tests and pass FDA muster to show efficacy and safety. Most of what they call probiotic, prebiotic,

1075
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:59,880
has not done that. Food stuff then is regulated through the advertising by the FTC.

1076
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:09,320
So I was interestingly called upon to testify at a hearing for a game. I consult for Danin,

1077
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:17,240
and so when I mentioned activity that I take, that doesn't mean that I want to tell everybody

1078
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:23,560
out there that this is better than any other. It's just one I know about. So in any case,

1079
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:33,080
the FTC looked very carefully at the claims made for that product and wanted to see and carefully

1080
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:40,920
evaluated all of the evidence. And in order to make the claims that Danin makes for that product,

1081
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:48,680
they actually have to demonstrate to the FTC that they have the evidence that it does what they say

1082
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:56,200
it does. So they say that if you eat as much as two cups a day of activity, it will cause the GI

1083
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:03,880
tract to speed up. And the answer is it will. And how many colony forming units are provided

1084
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:11,160
in that? I honestly don't know. I can't answer that question. But there are, I think, something

1085
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:17,160
in the order of 10 to the 11th going in. And I'm trying to think of what comes out the other end,

1086
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:23,400
but it's much less. But they do have evidence, at least for that product, that it survives and goes

1087
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:28,920
through. When it comes to getting your GI system back and tracked after a course of antibiotics,

1088
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:34,360
what are the most important elements to look for in the probiotic? Is it lactobacilli then?

1089
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:42,040
Not a specific lactobacillus, just the ability to colonize the GI tract. So saccharomyces

1090
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:48,360
works very well in that case. That's the one I'm trying to think of the trade name for.

1091
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,840
We'll figure that out and link to it in our show notes.

1092
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:53,880
It's well known and it's a yeast derived product.

1093
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:55,640
And it's over the counter, not?

1094
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:57,000
Yes, it's over the counter.

1095
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:01,320
Now, by definition, does a probiotic need to be refrigerated?

1096
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:06,200
It just needs to be able to survive. You can take it as a pill.

1097
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:09,800
But even pills don't need to be stored in the refrigerator.

1098
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:16,760
No, they don't. Not necessarily. It depends on which one. So, for example, bifidobacteria

1099
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:23,560
animalus, which is in activity, has to be refrigerated. But so does the activity because

1100
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:24,680
it's yogurt based.

1101
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:29,000
Again, it just seems to me that the big opportunity here is going to come

1102
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:36,360
with kind of the bioengineering that's necessary to grow these bacteria in culture. That seems to

1103
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:41,240
be just an enormous blind spot we still have in this space, both from a diagnostic standpoint,

1104
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:42,920
but also from a therapeutic standpoint.

1105
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:52,440
Absolutely right. And from a point of view of really having what is sort of a fringe popular

1106
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:01,800
economy to a really effective major product so that if you could make an organism and

1107
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:09,880
know exactly what it does and you can make it in scale and give it to people to take it safely,

1108
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:11,960
big time bucks.

1109
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:20,280
Well, Mike, thank you very much for this tour of one of the most probably underappreciated systems

1110
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:26,120
in the human body. We've talked a lot about its unique embryology, very unique innervation.

1111
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:34,360
And of course, perhaps most importantly, its cohabitation with bacteria that basically

1112
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:38,520
outnumber us. As we said, I think at the outset, I can't remember if we talked about this before

1113
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:43,880
we were recording or not, but this really feels like a bit of a black box. And I guess that speaks

1114
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:47,720
to why 60 years later, you're still working just as hard.

1115
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:53,080
That's right. Or as you said, as you get further away from shore, the water gets deeper.

1116
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:57,320
Yeah. Well, the water feels awfully deep right now, Mike. Thank you very much

1117
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:59,320
for your time and your expertise today.

1118
02:09:59,320 --> 02:09:59,720
