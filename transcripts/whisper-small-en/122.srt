Hey everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
head over to PeterAttiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. Now, without further delay, here's

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,320
today's episode. My guest this week is Lori Gottlieb. Lori is a psychotherapist and author

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,120
of the New York Times bestselling book, Maybe You Should Talk To Someone, a book that I've read

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,600
twice. And basically the second time I read it was right after the first time I read it,

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,760
but more on that in a moment. She also writes a weekly column in the Atlantic titled Dear

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,560
Therapist. Lori also has a new podcast, Dear Therapists. That's plural hosted by Lori and

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,600
her friend Guy Winch. Their podcast allows you to sit in on some of the intimate, raw,

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,840
and transformative sessions as they guide patients through the everyday challenges of daily life

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,960
while offering the kind of behind the scenes insights into what makes us all humans. Dear

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,000
Therapists is out right now and you can find it on iHeartRadio, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,560
your podcasts. And I can tell you right now, I am absolutely jazzed to be listening to this

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,920
because my discussion with Lori was riveting. And as I mentioned earlier, her book is really

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,640
what kind of got its hook into me. So the second I finished reading Lori's book, which I basically

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,400
read in a matter of days, I went back to rereading it. And then I reached out to Lori and said,

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,400
hey, sorry, you don't know me from Adam, but I'd really love to sit down and have this interview

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,840
with you. Now in this episode, we talk about her journey in terms of how she became a psychotherapist.

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,400
And also we go through a lot of the stories in her book. Now, I think we together make a very good

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,120
effort not to spoil anything because my intention is that those of you that have not read this book

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,920
will actually go out and get it. I think it is on the short list of books that one should read this

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,680
year, regardless of your interest in mental health, emotional health. If you have any interest in

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,000
living a better life, I think this is a book for you. In this discussion, we pull out some of the

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,960
backstories and we dig into some of the nuance a little bit more. And I think honestly, those of

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,120
you that have read the book are going to get a lot out of it. And again, those that haven't certainly

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,000
will, and I hope it encourages those of you that haven't to go out and read it. This is an episode

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,560
for anyone who cares about what it means to live a better life, to live a more fulfilling life,

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,560
to live a happier life, to suffer less, and to kind of understand the nature of the human condition.

34
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,280
I think Lori is a fantastic writer and I think she's also a great speaker and I think you're

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,160
going to enjoy this episode a lot. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:16,920
Lori Gottlieb. Lori, thank you so much for making time to chat today. I know how busy

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,600
you are both clinically and in terms of your outside of clinical activities. So it means a lot.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,480
Well, thank you for having me. I'm really glad to have this conversation.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,920
I have wanted to sit down with you and I was hoping it could have been done in person,

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,400
but obviously given the circumstances it can't, from the moment I finished reading your book the

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,840
first time, which is to say I've read it more than once, which I think speaks to how much it impacted

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,240
me. And it's my hope that either people listening to this podcast who haven't read it will certainly

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,480
go out and read it. And even people who have read it might go back and reread it with sort of a

44
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,200
keener eye to I think the beauty of the book. So maybe for folks who haven't read it, let's just

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,520
start with kind of an explanation of this beautiful narrative that you managed to do

46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:05,000
so poetically where you kind of weave your story in that with a group of patients. But tell folks

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,400
a little bit about who you are and what you do for a living and what it means for you to be both

48
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,640
a patient and a therapist. Sure. So I guess starting with maybe you should talk to someone with the

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:23,560
book. In the book, I follow four very seemingly different patients as they go through their

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,520
struggles. And then there's a fifth patient in the book who is me as I go through my own struggle

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,760
and go to see my own therapist. And really it's when I say seemingly different people,

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,640
what I mean is that on the surface, I think the people may not look like the reader, but by the

53
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,400
end of the book, I think everybody says, I saw myself in every single one of these patients and

54
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,960
I include myself as one of the patients. And I think that really it's a book about the human

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,240
condition. And it's a book about how we're all more the same than we are different and how we grow

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,200
in connection with others. And I think that that is really what I'm trying to do in all of the work

57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:13,160
that I do is try to really help people to see that. So you asked about what I do more generally.

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,840
So I'm a psychotherapist. I have a practice in Los Angeles. I see individuals, I see couples.

59
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:26,920
I think what I do is an incredible privilege to be able to sit with people as they go through their

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:34,040
lives and try to transform and grow as people. And I write the weekly Dear Therapist column for

61
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,880
The Atlantic. And starting in the end of July, I have a new podcast coming out that actually

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,920
Katie Kirk is producing for iHeart. And it again is about people and their struggles and how we can

63
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,200
sort of help them. So I think in all of the work that I do, whether it's I did a TED talk recently

64
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,280
about how changing our stories can help us change our lives. And I think that what I really love

65
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,520
about what I do is that no matter what lens through which I'm doing it, whether it's a column

66
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,040
or a podcast or a TED talk or a book or my practice, I'm really dealing with, I think,

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,400
what makes us most human at our core. And we'll make sure to link to obviously the TED talk. And

68
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,440
once your podcast is out, what's the title of it, by the way? Dear Therapists, plural. My Atlantic

69
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,240
column is Dear Therapists, singular. There are two of us, Guy Winch, who you may also know from his

70
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,960
TED talks. He is my co-host on the podcast. Awesome. Okay. Well, we'll make sure we point

71
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,960
people in that direction. Let's talk a little bit about how you got here. You and I do share one odd

72
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,960
thing in common, which is we at least spent time at the same medical school, though I don't think

73
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,400
we overlapped. So you have kind of an interesting circuitous route to where you got having started

74
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,360
off making television, winding your way through an experience you had there in the ER to medical

75
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,240
school. Give folks a bit of a sense of that journey. Yeah. So I took a really nonlinear path

76
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,040
to becoming a therapist. And in retrospect, I think it actually seems quite linear. But when

77
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,840
you look at it from the perspective of not having lived it yet, people, I always said at the time,

78
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,240
either very versatile or very confused, which was my way of saying, I know it sounds crazy what I'm

79
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,760
doing. After college, I started working in the entertainment business. First, I was working in

80
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,280
film development. And then I moved over to network television. And I started working at NBC.

81
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,240
When I got to NBC, it happened to be the year that two, what were to become very successful

82
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,320
shows were about to premiere. One was called ER, and the other was called Friends. And I really

83
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,760
loved both of those shows, because even a sitcom, I think, really said a lot. I think it's like

84
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,840
reading a good novel where there are deep psychological truths kind of hidden behind the

85
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,280
sort of entertaining part of the book. And I think the same thing was true with ER and Friends.

86
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,240
They were so successful because they really did strike a chord emotionally with people.

87
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,640
And what was really interesting about ER was we had a consultant who was an ER physician. And he

88
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,640
was making sure that everything was accurate on the show. And I spent some time in the ER with him.

89
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,880
And the more time I would spend there, he would say, I think you like it better here than you

90
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,840
like your day job. You should go to medical school. And I thought he was nuts, because first

91
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,680
of all, I was a French major as an undergrad. But I was also very kind of math-y and science-y,

92
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,520
but that wasn't where I focused my academic career. And the other part of it was that there

93
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,040
was something that really resonated with me about being in the real ER, which was, I think that we

94
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:48,360
were telling these very rich human stories on the show ER. But it's another thing when someone,

95
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,480
like a real person, walks in and nobody comes to an ER because they expected something to happen.

96
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,680
It's always an inflection point in some way in someone's life. And so what happens when someone

97
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,680
comes in and they say, oh, you know, I have headaches. And then you do a scan and you're

98
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,920
like, oh, you have a brain tumor. That's crazy. Like how quickly your life can change. And so I

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,640
was really interested in those inflection points in people's lives. And so that's why he kept saying

100
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,280
to me, I think you really want to go to medical school. And so I did, I went up to Stanford. I had

101
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,680
to take all the classes, do all the prerequisites, take the MCAT, do all of that. And when I got

102
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:32,120
there, it was up in Palo Alto. It was Silicon Valley right before it was the first big boom

103
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,960
before the first bust. And a lot of my professors were saying, there's this new thing called managed

104
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,920
care. And I was very clear from the very beginning that I really wanted to kind of guide

105
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,560
people through their lives. I wanted to have those relationships, those long-term relationships with

106
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,240
my patients over time. And it seemed like the new medical model was not going to be conducive to

107
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,560
that. I wasn't interested in research. I really liked the clinical side. A lot of people were

108
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,360
like leaving to do dot com types of things. And so a lot of people were saying, you know, why are

109
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,400
you doing this? And I started writing when I was up there at medical school and I was writing about

110
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,280
my experiences. And I actually left medical school to become a journalist because I felt like

111
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,720
I could really delve into people's stories and help them to tell their stories through writing.

112
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,120
And so I did that and I still do that. I'm still a journalist when I still write, but I did that

113
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,640
exclusively for about 10 years. And then I had my baby. And it was really interesting because I

114
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,480
loved what I did as a journalist, but it's not the kind of thing where you have a lot of social

115
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,200
interaction. You're doing a lot of writing and doing a lot of phone interviews and things like

116
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,520
that. And so I really wanted adult conversation during the day. And so the UPS delivery person

117
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,320
would come. I had a million deliveries with a new baby and I would detain him and I would try to

118
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,240
have conversations with him. And he hated that. And he would like back away to his big brown truck

119
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,800
to get away from me. Eventually started tiptoeing to my door and putting the packages down very

120
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,080
gently. So I would not even open the door. And so I knew I needed to do something. So I called up

121
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,240
the Dean at Stanford Medical School. I used to run her mother daughter book groups. And so I knew

122
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,520
her pretty well. And I said, maybe I should come back and do psychiatry. And she knew me well from

123
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,280
our relationship there. And she said, you are welcome to come back, but do you really want to

124
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,000
go through internship and residency and all of that with a baby, with a toddler to do psychiatry

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
where most people do medication management and they see patients in these 15 minute intervals

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,480
and they're prescribing antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. She said, maybe you

127
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,840
should get a graduate doing clinical psychology and do the kind of deeper, more intensive work

128
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,640
that you are interested in. And it sounds very obvious in retrospect, but at the time it was

129
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,080
like this aha moment of, oh, wow, that was brilliant. And so that's exactly what I did.

130
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,120
And so that's how I have this hybrid career where I feel like I went from telling people's stories

131
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,600
as a journalist to helping people to change their stories as a therapist. And I feel like a lot of

132
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,120
what I do in the therapy room when I'm sitting in that chair is I feel like I'm as much an editor

133
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,360
as I am a therapist, because I really feel like what I'm doing is people are coming in. They're

134
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,520
telling me we're all unreliable narrators. They're telling me a faulty narrative. They're telling me

135
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,440
a narrative that is keeping them stuck. And I'm there to help them edit this story. So I feel like

136
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,520
the path might seem a little bit circuitous, but I feel like the whole time I was always

137
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,280
interested in story and the human condition. I just looked at it through in different ways.

138
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,480
So interesting. When you were in medical school, were they still doing anatomy in the trailers?

139
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,840
Yeah, actually. When were you there?

140
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,720
Yeah. So I, my anatomy, I was a freshman in 97 or freshman med student in 97. So we must have been

141
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,800
only off by a year or two, right? I came in 99. Yeah. Yeah. So you were only two years after me.

142
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,360
They were still in the trailers. So it's funny when I was reading your book and you were

143
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,200
describing that, because that's a really intense experience for anybody coming into medical school.

144
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,720
I was also not a pre-med, but whether you were pre-med or not coming in the first quarter,

145
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,960
you dive right into that ocean of dissecting that cadaver. That cadaver becomes your best

146
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,080
friend with your partner. It's you and one other person that are paired at the hip and you're going

147
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,040
through everything. And I don't know if you felt this experience, but there were certain parts of

148
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:30,280
dissections that I found staggeringly tough and the hand was one of them. I think looking at

149
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,920
people's fingers was really hard. And it's also where I saw the most heterogeneity across the

150
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,280
cadavers. When you were dissecting a heart, you could show your heart to your neighbor's heart.

151
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,640
You could see there was different pathology, but a heart's a heart, but a hand,

152
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,800
boy, you could tell a lot about a person by their hands. I agree. I would think that the hand is so

153
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,440
revealing. And you think about what we use our hands for. When I was dissecting the hands,

154
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,800
I remember thinking, whose hands did this person hold? Who did this person hug? What did the person

155
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,160
do with their hands? And you could see on certain cadavers, there would be like nail polish still

156
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,920
on there. And so you got a sense of someone's personality by what they chose. They wore rings

157
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,080
on their fingers and you could see like a suntan line of where they had worn their rings. It was,

158
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,200
yeah, I think the hand is very human. There were other parts too, though, I think.

159
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,560
Do you remember when we were dissecting? We did the head near the end and that was the hardest

160
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,200
part, I think. The lids were closed and then they had something over them. Do you remember? They had

161
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,560
a little shield over them. And that was to get us used to the idea of opening up this person,

162
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,720
who is a person, and remembering that they are a person. It's like this balance between

163
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,640
remembering that they're a person and then also being able to separate yourself enough to be able

164
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,160
to do the work. Because if all you thought about was they're a person, it would be extremely

165
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,240
difficult to cut them open in the ways that we had to and kind of almost dehumanize them.

166
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,680
And so I remember doing the head, doing the face. The face was so hard.

167
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,600
Yeah, and I remember Mike Cadaver was a male and I remember really being observant of the length of

168
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,760
his stubble and realizing what it implied about the timing of his last shave and things like that.

169
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,160
I just agree. I thought it was a very emotional experience that at times you had the privilege of

170
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,360
just being so far into the pancreas that you could forget for a moment what you were doing,

171
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:39,000
but then you had so many moments where you were pulled back into that human element. And I can

172
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,280
honestly say, and I don't know if you can say this, but in my class, I don't recall one instance of

173
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,760
any of my classmates doing anything that felt disrespectful. I really felt like there was a

174
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,280
remarkable, both camaraderie amongst us as classmates, but also just camaraderie with

175
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:01,880
the Cadavers. I think the families of those people would be proud of what their family members did in

176
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:08,040
terms of the donation and how we as students learned from it. Oh, absolutely. And I think

177
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,440
that at Stanford, they did a beautiful job of making sure. And I think there was a reason that

178
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,920
that was one of the first classes that we had to take because you from the get-go developed this,

179
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:25,720
they really made clear to you that when you see people that you have the utmost respect for them,

180
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,640
that you treat them in the most human way possible. And that started with these Cadavers. Remember

181
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,320
that we had that ceremony? Did you guys have that? At the end where we wrote notes and we thanked

182
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,920
them. And it was like this very spiritual moment of really sharing our gratitude for them having

183
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,600
donated their bodies and let us learn so that we can help people through what we've learned by

184
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,120
opening them up and seeing inside. And so it was really such an act of generosity for them and their

185
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:03,560
families to say, yes, we trust you young medical students to treat my loved one with the utmost

186
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,400
respect as you learn and do this. You've told the story in one way, but there's another dimension

187
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm just curious about, which is the courage it took to leave, which is you glossed over what it

188
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,600
took to get into medical school. But I think let's be honest for a French major to then take the

189
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,640
necessary courses to then take the MCAT and not just take it, but ace it and then get into one of

190
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,040
the hardest medical schools to get into in the country and get through it. You get through this

191
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,240
first quarter of semester and you're doing well, but then to be at this crossroads and say, wait a

192
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,200
minute, is this the path that's going to take me to where I want to go? And then to kind of have the

193
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,000
courage to stop and say, I don't think it is, I'm going to walk away. How did you handle that?

194
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,640
It's interesting because I think that at that point in my life, I was less risk averse than maybe I've

195
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,360
become. And so I think as a parent, it's a different equation that you're looking at. What's so strange

196
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,200
to me is I don't know why this was, but in my book I write about, I'm seeing this young woman who

197
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,480
goes on her honeymoon and she comes back and she's diagnosed with cancer. And it's about sort of our

198
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,680
relationship as she goes through this. And she said to me at one point, and I write about this

199
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,080
in the book where she says, why do people need a terminal diagnosis to really pay attention to what

200
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,480
they want to do in their lives? We shouldn't need that. And it occurred to me that we all have a

201
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,800
terminal diagnosis. Life has a hundred percent mortality rate and that's not just for other

202
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,400
people. And so I think we don't know how or when we're going to die. None of us really does unless

203
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,160
we actually have some kind of terminal diagnosis right now. And so I feel like I had some sense of

204
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,720
that at a young age. I don't know why I didn't have, I wouldn't have early exposure to death.

205
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,240
There was just this sense of I only get to live once. This is the time before I have a family when

206
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,280
I'm free to make the choices that I want to make and they won't impact other people. And so I just

207
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:05,160
did, I sort of went into that place of knowing inside that I think we all have that is very quiet

208
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,480
in most of us. We don't listen to it. All that noise outside about what we should do or what's

209
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,200
the practical thing that usually drowns out that voice inside that takes us to that place of knowing.

210
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,680
And I'm not trying to get all woo woo. I feel like we all have this place where we trust ourselves,

211
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,600
where we know something, we have information. So many times people come to therapy and they're

212
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,880
like, tell me what to do. And what I want to help them do is find the answer inside because it's

213
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,240
there. They just can't hear it yet. And they have a better answer than I do for them. And so I think

214
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,160
back then when I was thinking about leaving medical school, I mean, even thinking about like,

215
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,880
who would leave that job at NBC? Who's going to leave that job with friends in the yard? Who's

216
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,920
going to leave medical school to become a freelance journalist? That's not the path. And

217
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,960
then to have a really successful career as a freelance journalist and really be thriving.

218
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,840
And then to say, you know what, I'm going to go and start over and go to grad school with an infant

219
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,800
and then go become a therapist. I think there was always just this sense of,

220
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm drawn to this, and I'm not going to hold myself back from it. They weren't impulsive decisions,

221
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,040
by the way. It wasn't like I woke up one day and I decided this. It was, I thought about them for

222
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,800
a while before I actually made those moves. So when I was in medical school, it wasn't like I woke

223
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,800
up one day and said, you know what, I think I'm doing this writing. I'm really liking this writing.

224
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm really liking the relationships and telling these stories. I'm going to do that. It was over

225
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,560
a course of two years when I was thinking about maybe I should go do this other thing.

226
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,840
I mean, I ask in part because I wanted to contrast it with the experience I had, which was

227
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,120
ultimately leaving medicine altogether in I think 2006. And it had the same sorts of elements in

228
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,840
that there was a group of people around who understandably, I think, succumbed to a bit of

229
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,000
the narrative as sunk cost, which is between medical school and residency, you've now put

230
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,120
10 years into this endeavor. It's crazy for you to walk away before you actually start your career

231
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,680
and all the other arguments that come with it. But I'll never forget one of the people who really

232
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,760
was the most encouraging was an attending at Hopkins. His name was Peter Pronovost,

233
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,200
who's gone on to do some really amazing things within ICU safety. And he handed me a copy of

234
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,000
a Joseph Campbell book. There was the line in there about a hero being the one who had the

235
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
courage to pursue his own bliss. That's the thing that really stuck with me. And I think you're

236
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,120
right. It's like in the end, it took me four months to make that decision to leave. It wasn't

237
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,120
an impulse, but in the end, as silly and as unreasonable as it appeared to everybody else,

238
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,600
I had no qualms about it and I never looked back. And ultimately I did come back to medicine,

239
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,560
albeit in a completely different capacity. But it's interesting to hear that the part you said

240
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,880
that resonates the most with me are two things. One, the answer is usually inside of us. It just

241
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,360
takes us a while to figure it out. Sometimes you as a great therapist, I think can help the prodding.

242
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,640
The second thing that really resonates with me is what you said about Julie. Well, you didn't

243
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,840
describe her by name, Julie, but we'll get to Julie's story, which is when people would argue

244
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,960
to me this sunk cost, which is you've already put 10 years into this. At the time I was 33.

245
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,440
I said, well, I think that's the faulty logic. I mean, the reality of it is I'm 33 right now.

246
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,360
I'm going to work for another 40 years. So shouldn't I just work on what I want to do for

247
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,560
the next 40 years as opposed to what I'm destined to do based on the last 10 years? Like it just

248
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,400
struck me as the wrong argument. Now, whether I had 40 more years to work or not is irrelevant.

249
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,560
And Julie's story will teach us that you don't know if you're going to have 40 years left,

250
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,320
you might have one year left. You should be doing exactly what you want to be doing.

251
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,960
But I guess maybe with that, I want to talk a little bit about Julie. Can you tell folks

252
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,120
a little bit about how this woman came into your life? And I guess we should caveat this for people

253
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,440
understand. I'm going to be using the names that you use in the book, which are not their real

254
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,840
names. We'll talk about this the way you've written about them, which have enough of the

255
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,440
details stripped out. So I don't want people thinking we are having discussions about patients

256
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,680
that are violating their confidentiality. But if it's okay with you, I'd like to just talk about

257
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,600
them as the way they're written about. Yeah, absolutely. I just wanted to also just say

258
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,600
something about what you just so beautifully said about this idea of sunk costs that I remember

259
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,160
that at a certain point when I was going back, so I was in my late thirties when I was going back

260
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,920
to grad school to become a therapist. And I remember a lot of people saying, you're going

261
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,760
to be 40. And I said, but I'm going to be 40 anyway, whether I'm doing what I want or something

262
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,280
that I'm not interested in doing, I'm going to become 40 and turn 40. So shouldn't I turn 40

263
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,000
and be doing something that I want to do as opposed to I'm turning 40 and I'm doing the thing

264
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,440
that I'm really successful at, but I feel like it's not enough. So I think that that logic is

265
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,760
very faulty when people say, but you've put so much into this. It's like, that's right. And I

266
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,600
don't want to waste a lot of years looking back and saying, wow, I could have done that thing when

267
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,160
I was 37, but I waited until I was 50 and now I'm really sad that I didn't do it. So let me talk a

268
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,040
little bit about Julie. Yeah, let's introduce people to Julie. How did this really wonderful

269
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:19,000
woman come into your life? So Julie came to me because she was this young woman who had just

270
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,400
gotten married to the love of her life. And she had a career that she loved and she had

271
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,640
wonderful family and friends. She had a really good life. And she went on her honeymoon. She and

272
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,640
her new husband had been together for a while and they decided that they would want to start a family

273
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,040
right away. And so she came back and she felt like something funky in her breast and she thought,

274
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,920
well, maybe I'm pregnant. That's what they were hoping. And it turned out she wasn't pregnant,

275
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,040
that she had breast cancer, but it was a very treatable form of breast cancer. And all of her

276
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,880
doctors reassured her, you're going to be fine. You'll go through this treatment. The treatment

277
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,680
will be unpleasant, but you will be fine and you will move on and you will live your normal life

278
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,040
after this. And so she came to me not because she was dying, but because she just wanted to get some

279
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,120
support as a newlywed going through cancer. And she was very funny. She'd say things like,

280
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,960
what should I say in my thank you cards? Like thank you for the bowl. I use it to throw up in

281
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,840
after chemo. You know, like she had that very sort of wry sense of humor, but she was just this very

282
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,920
warm, lovely person and very real. She wasn't the cancer patient who's the saint. She really didn't

283
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,960
want to go through this. She wasn't the pink ribbons and the optimism. That was not the approach that

284
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,520
would work for her. So she specifically came to me because I had zero experience with this.

285
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,720
And so she said to her doctor, I want to go to somebody who's not on the quote unquote cancer

286
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,840
team. I don't want to be part of the cancer world, especially since my prognosis is so positive. I

287
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,760
just want some support as a newlywed going through an illness. There's a funny story you tell about

288
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,720
how she's totally put off by the yoga instructor who's explaining to her that her entire prognosis

289
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,200
is a function of how compliant she is with the yoga routine. Yes. Yeah. She hated that whole idea.

290
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:13,000
It's your attitude. It's doing the yoga. It's all in your mind. And so we went through that time

291
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,400
together and then she went back to her life and we said goodbye. And it's always interesting as a

292
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,760
therapist to say goodbye to people because that's our goal. Our goal is to have people leave us.

293
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,520
It's a terrible business model, but it's very rewarding emotionally. And she left and that was

294
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,200
that. And you know, occasionally I would think about her and wondering if they'd gotten pregnant

295
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,960
and those kinds of things. And six months after she left, I got a voicemail from her. She had had

296
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,760
her sign off scan, which was going to clear her to go ahead and get pregnant. And instead they found

297
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,520
another form of cancer. It was unrelated, they believe to the breast cancer. And it was a very

298
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,960
rare aggressive form of cancer in a different part of her body. And they said there was no cure.

299
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,280
And that she had somewhere between one and 10 years to live, which of course the difference

300
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,720
between one and 10 years is enormous. She was in early thirties. She came into my office and

301
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,800
told me this. And she said to me, will you stay with me until I die? I would like to say that the

302
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,240
reaction was that I hunt her and we cried together. And I said, of course I will, but that is not what

303
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,280
happened. I actually hesitated because I had no experience doing that with someone her age going

304
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,720
through this. And I wanted her to have the experience of doing it in a way that whatever

305
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,480
right meant for her, I wanted it to be done right. And I didn't want to screw it up for her. Because

306
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,000
she was only going to get one shot at this. And she said, no, specifically the same reason that

307
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,240
she came to me earlier was she said, I really want to do this with you. I really want to do

308
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,680
this separate from all of the sort of cancer world, which I'm already going to be very ensconced

309
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,840
in. And so I said I would. And I kept that promise to her. And she included in that, by the way,

310
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,480
was that I had to go to her funeral. That was part of the deal that I made with her, that she

311
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,080
insisted that I make with her, that I agreed to. And it was this very transformative experience,

312
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,600
because again, I think I always kind of had death sitting on one shoulder when I was younger and not

313
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,760
in a morbid way, but actually in a really inspiring way, which is be aware, be aware of

314
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,320
the gift of your life today. When you wake up, be intentional about how you want to live your life.

315
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,400
What are your priorities and are you living those? But I think it was another thing to go through

316
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,600
this with someone and to get really attached to them, as I did to Julie, and then to watch her

317
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,000
and be inspired by her again, not because she was a saint, because what I loved about her was she was

318
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,360
so real and raw and honest about what this experience was like. But because she made choices

319
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,560
that everybody thought were crazy. And she said, no, this is what I want to do. She was this person

320
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,960
who had always ticked off all the boxes. She did everything by the book, and she did it all right.

321
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,360
And she did it all well. And her life was humming along smoothly. And then this hit, and she was

322
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,960
like, here are some things I want to do. I know it sounds crazy, but this is what I want to do.

323
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,400
And we all thought she was crazy. And what was interesting was one of the things she wanted to do

324
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,400
was she was a professional and a very successful one. And she said, she was in Trader Joe's one day,

325
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:22,440
and she said, I love the way the cashiers interact with the people in the store, and that they have

326
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,440
these moments of connection that they just give them balloons, and they ring the bell, and there's

327
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,520
energy in the place. And for that moment, you're doing something tangible. You're tangibly making

328
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,600
someone's day better, even if it's for a minute. And she said, that's what I want to do. And her

329
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,080
husband said, wait a minute, you're dying. You have a terminal illness. And that's how you want to

330
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,320
spend your time. He thought she was crazy. I thought she was crazy. But I also wondered,

331
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,280
are we saying this because we think she's making a bad choice? Or are we saying this because we're

332
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,600
jealous? Are we saying this because we're actually we envy the fact that she is not chicken shit,

333
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,840
like the rest of us, to do something so bold that everybody else thinks is crazy? And so I think in

334
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,120
some ways, there was this lesson of maybe she's doing something that the rest of us, because we

335
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,160
don't have that gun to our heads. We do, but we don't realize it that she's doing something that

336
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,880
we wish we had the courage to do. It's funny, I remember that part so well for a couple of

337
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,200
reasons. One, the first time I ever went to Trader Joe's, because I grew up in Canada, was when I

338
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,200
actually went to medical school. And then I discovered this place and I'm like, I'm obsessed

339
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,800
with Trader Joe's. And I could sort of understand exactly why that's the place Julie would want to

340
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,600
go and work. It is such an amazing environment. And then the other thing that kind of resonated

341
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,960
with me when I read the story was, I remember thinking, even in medical school and into

342
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,600
residency, I wish I could just have half a day a week to squeegee windshields at a gas station.

343
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,880
It gives me so much pleasure. And I have this whole technique on how I squeegee. I'm actually

344
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,360
very good at it. If I'm going to allow myself to be a little bit immodest, there's a real technique

345
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,560
to it. It's so satisfying to clean a windshield. And I was like, how can I figure out a way to

346
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,960
integrate my medical career with at least some squeegee time per week? And having done it? No,

347
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,840
because I remember even bringing this up to my friends and family at my medical school graduation

348
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,800
party. And everybody looked at me like I had seven heads. Can you just shut up? Like, what are

349
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,720
you to stop talking about squeegeeing? But I was like, look, I'm not saying I'm going to be a full

350
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,200
time squeegee guy, but I want to at least do some squeegeeing because it is so satisfying. And to

351
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,840
your point, it's very tangible. It's a very brief interaction with a person who comes in and their

352
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,520
windshield, they can barely see out of it. And five minutes later, it's like, perfect. So I think

353
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,160
Julie's story just resonates so much on so many levels about living, right? It's what you said.

354
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,880
It's a story about early death, but it's actually a story about life. Well, that's the thing I think

355
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,920
people would say, isn't it depressing treating someone like that? Isn't it hard? And of course,

356
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:05,000
it was hard, but you know what? I looked forward to her sessions more so than maybe some others,

357
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,760
because there was so much vitality in those sessions, because she was bringing so much energy

358
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,440
into those sessions. I don't mean like sometimes she was exhausted and she would sleep. But even

359
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,680
then, there was so much about taking off the mask, about stripping down to the essentials that feels

360
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:29,240
invigorating. And just getting rid of the performative aspects of lives, the pretense, all of that,

361
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,160
and just saying, this is who I am. Can you hear me? Can you understand me? And this is how I want

362
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,360
to manifest myself in the world. I think there was something about those sessions that just felt so

363
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:47,480
much more real than I think what some of us deal with on a daily basis. I'm not minimizing what

364
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,520
other people were dealing with. I'm saying that I don't think that the rest of us really let go in

365
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,920
the way that Julie let go. And I think there's a lot that we can learn from Julie's story in the book.

366
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:05,240
Well, if Julie's story in some ways is the one where life is taken too quickly, the two stories

367
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:12,200
that resonated with me the most were John and Rita. Because in them, I both saw such a cycle

368
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:20,280
of shame for different reasons, but just an unbelievable cycle of punishment, self-punishment,

369
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,440
and this shame cycle. I'd like to maybe start with John and just, I think you actually open your book

370
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,920
with, I think John, it shows up in the very first chapter. He's a guy that I think on the surface,

371
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:41,720
most people would not like. I think that's a safe statement, correct? Yeah, he is very abrasive,

372
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,640
very unlikable. He is very insulting to me in the very first session. He is already insulting me,

373
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,480
but he doesn't realize he's insulting me. Although I should say on some level he must,

374
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,520
but he jokes around and his jokes are very insulting. I guess that's the best word to describe it.

375
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,040
Look, he refers to you as his mistress. He's totally derogatory in every way imaginable.

376
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,680
Yeah, he's always putting me down. Right, right, right. The only thing he gives you is he doesn't

377
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,320
refer to you as a complete idiot, which is what he refers to everybody else as. That's the only

378
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,840
quarter you have, is you're not a full idiot. Yeah, but the jury was out. He wasn't sure yet.

379
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,280
I think the thing is though, people say, well, why would you even treat him given how he treated

380
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,200
you in that first session? Why would you take him on as a patient? What I always say to people is

381
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,560
that these are the people that I think are the people who grow the most in therapy because

382
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:46,120
what they're doing is we use our behaviors to speak something, to communicate something that we

383
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,440
can't do with words. So we take the unspeakable and we convert it into a behavior to communicate

384
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,280
something. And what he was communicating was I'm going to keep everybody at a distance. I'm going

385
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,480
to be so obnoxious. And he had what we might call narcissistic traits. So he thought very highly of

386
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:09,160
himself and not so highly of other people, which was really a defense. And he was somebody who was

387
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,320
saying, I have this unspeakable pain and I'm going to keep everybody at a distance so that they don't

388
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,320
get near my pain because if they get near my pain, I might have to look at it. So those aren't the

389
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,640
words he used, but that's what his behavior was doing. So I knew that there was going to be

390
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,360
something there that we were going to uncover together and that he was going to eventually

391
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,880
start to talk about and that that would give him freedom. That would liberate him from the shackles,

392
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,640
the emotional shackles that were constraining him. But I had no idea what it was. And as you can see,

393
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,360
the way I write it in the book is exactly how it happened in life in terms of when that revelation

394
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:49,800
came to me and how it came to me. And I was so just gobsmacked by that. And I think the reader

395
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,960
is too. And I think that he becomes, I think people talk about the people. I think that people find

396
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,280
themselves in every single person in the book. They see themselves in every single person.

397
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,760
But I also think that there's something about John and how it makes them think about the ways that we

398
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,040
make judgments about people when we first meet them and then how much we could come to love them

399
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,320
if we really knew who they were. And I think that's what happens with John. People love him

400
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,520
by the end of the book. Everybody just, how's John? How's he doing? Everybody cares about him.

401
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,360
At the outset, you referred to therapy. In the book, you actually have an entire short chapter

402
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,320
dedicated to the differentiation between counseling and therapy. Give folks a bit of a

403
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,720
sense of what that is because I think what we're really talking about here is the deep therapy.

404
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,760
Yeah. So I think that a lot of people, especially today where we have instant gratificationitis,

405
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,040
we don't have a lot of patients. And so I think that a lot of people, I don't wrote a piece for

406
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,080
the New York Times Magazine about this. It was called What Brand is Your Therapist? And it was

407
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,000
about how people are sort of branding themselves as these people for sessions and you'll have an

408
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,280
answer or whatever it is. That's not what we do. And by the way, the other thing that we don't do

409
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,080
is we're not there to keep you there for life. We are very much about you're coming in. We want to

410
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,480
be very aware of the purpose of what you're doing here and make sure that you're getting what you

411
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,160
need to leave. But it's also not, I remember I had this guy call me before the holidays once

412
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,480
and he said, I need to know by Valentine's Day whether or not to propose to my girlfriend

413
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,840
because she'll leave me if I don't propose by Valentine's Day. And so it was like December.

414
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,120
So we'd have like six weeks or something. And he said, so I need to know that I'll have an answer

415
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,280
by then. And I said, listen, I can help you get clarity, but I don't know anything about you yet.

416
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,440
I don't know what your history is. They don't know what the issue is. I don't know that you will have

417
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,880
clarity in six weeks. So I can't guarantee that. And so he made an appointment, but then he called

418
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,480
me back later and canceled it and said, I found somebody who could guarantee that for me,

419
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,360
which is just insane. I think he wants to make an informed decision, not just a decision,

420
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,720
but I really feel like people want instant gratification. They want me to have answers

421
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,920
for them. And I have this word taped up in my office, ultra-preparadarianism, which means the

422
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,800
habit of giving advice or opinions outside of one's knowledge or confidence. And it reminds me

423
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,920
that people are always saying, what should I do? And I don't know what they should do. I know what

424
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,400
I would do in that situation, but just because I would do a certain thing, I'm not living their

425
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,120
life for them. So I don't know what they should do. They have to, again, access that place of knowing.

426
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,680
And that's what I can help them do. So it's very tempting as a therapist when someone keeps sort of

427
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,400
like going in circles and ending up in the same place to kind of just be like, just do this.

428
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,800
You feel like, oh, I just want to tell them, but I actually need them to come to their own

429
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,080
conclusion about what they should do. So going back to John, I was thinking about this as you

430
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,400
were talking a moment ago. I think for the purpose of the people who haven't read the book, maybe we

431
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,800
won't get into the details. My hope is that everybody who is listening to this, who has not

432
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,080
read the book is going to order it ASAP and do what I did, which is the first reading of this is

433
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,640
you're not putting it down and you're in tears at the end of it. But let's go back to some of the

434
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,880
stuff that I think we can get into without the spoiler alerts. First off, what gave you, I don't

435
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,600
want to say the confidence, but for lack of a better word, Laurie, what gave you the confidence to say,

436
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,600
A, I don't know how long this guy is going to be an abusive jerk, but I can weather this out and I

437
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:28,760
can eventually get him to break open. And two, what gave you sort of in your own experience? I don't see

438
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,320
one thing that is lost on me a little bit as a reader is where were you in your experience level?

439
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,640
Was John like the 10th guy that showed up like this that you'd taken care of or was this the hardest

440
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,600
case you'd ever seen as case one? Definitely not the hardest case. I mean, I think that when people

441
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,960
present for therapy, they're not at their best. That's why they came. So they're not doing as

442
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,160
well as maybe they normally do. For John, it was clear that there was this characterological piece

443
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,280
where this is how he interacted in the world in all spheres, professional, personal, his marriage,

444
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:11,080
his kids at work. However, I think the thing about John was I don't know that I had confidence.

445
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,160
I felt like I knew how to work with him, but you never know what's going to happen with people.

446
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,920
And that's what's so surprising about my job is that going back to medical school, it's like,

447
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,400
you know that if you do this surgery, there's a this percent chance if you do it well,

448
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:30,840
that it's going to be successful. Therapy is very different. It depends so much on the people

449
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,120
and what's going on and mostly the relationship that's going on. All these studies will tell you

450
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,440
if you look them up, that the most important factor in the success of someone's therapy

451
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,880
is the relationship that you have with your therapist. It matters more than the training

452
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,040
the therapist has than the modality that they're using, than the number of years of experience.

453
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,120
Not that those things don't matter, they absolutely do. But the thing that matters the

454
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:00,360
most is that relationship. So my goal was to, and what we do in therapy is that the relationship

455
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,880
in the room is a microcosm for the relationships that they will have outside. So I wanted to create

456
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,240
that environment in the room. You see in the book, I work very much in the here and now with him of

457
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,240
what's going on between us. And he fights that tooth and nail. He hates that. He does not want

458
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,520
anyone to get close with him. In fact, one of our first sessions wasn't, I think the very first one,

459
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,080
I can't remember, but we're sitting there and we're doing therapy and he's always getting his

460
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,400
texts and he's doing his texts. And then like the light goes on, which shows another patient is

461
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,720
there and he looks over it and he says, oh, it was his lunch. He had ordered lunch to come into our

462
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,720
therapy session without asking just here's my lunch. What I did was we ended up having these

463
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,480
Chinese chicken salads, which is what he liked the lunch and we would have them together. I wasn't

464
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,480
hungry at all. Like at the time of his appointment, I had already eaten lunch, all of that, but, but I

465
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,040
would just like have a few bites. It was this glue for us. It was a way of just connecting with him.

466
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,600
I would say another thing about treating John is that, and this is going to be a gross generalization,

467
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,880
but I've noticed these differences between men and women and how they interact in therapy.

468
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,360
And I would say that I have so much compassion for men because I think that when somebody first

469
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,920
presents for therapy, I'm looking at not only what's not working in their lives, which is what

470
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,880
they're telling me about, but I'm also scanning for strengths. And one strength that everybody has

471
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,000
is they made the call. They decided to come in. So I'm not just asking why are you here, but I want

472
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,960
to know why now. Why this day, this week, this month, are you here when maybe this has been going

473
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,160
on for a long time? What made you call? That's a strength. So there's something in them that says

474
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,640
change has to happen. Often what happens is they say, I want something to change, but what they

475
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,400
mean is I want someone else or something else to change. They don't realize that they are going to

476
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,560
need to change, but that's okay. Let me ask you about that, Laurie. How often do you find that

477
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:54,440
people come to you because they have hit a relative rock bottom and they acknowledge that? Meaning

478
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
there is a pain that is so great, it is clear to them that they play some role in that versus

479
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,880
they're coming to you thinking everybody around me is acting badly or crazy and I just need help

480
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,040
to cope with their pathology. What's the relative balance of those? It's very mixed. I would say you

481
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:22,040
get both. Maybe you get more of the, I'm having trouble in my life because of my partner, my boss,

482
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:29,000
my parents, my sibling, my whomever. More than, hey, I know that I have a problem and I want to

483
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,400
change, but you do get that too. I think that it's revealed over time and as that relationship

484
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,240
between the therapist and the patient really develops and there's a trust there. I think

485
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,440
that's what happens with, there's this saying, I remember one of my colleagues had said,

486
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,520
before diagnosing someone with depression, make sure they aren't surrounded by assholes.

487
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,120
So it's like there are difficult people in the world and I acknowledge that. Obviously,

488
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,880
people are dealing with difficult people, but what is their role? What is their response to

489
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,040
those difficult people? Do you need to be in that relationship? If so, and you want to be in that

490
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,480
relationship, what is your role in exacerbating the difficulty in that relationship? But I was

491
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,800
going to say about men and women, which I think is important in John's case is that the fact that men

492
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,360
land in therapy and the fact that they're willing to talk to you, especially a female therapist,

493
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,680
and John, by the way, came to me because he said I was a nobody and he didn't want to run into any

494
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,520
of his Hollywood industry colleagues in the waiting room. So it was not a positive reason that he came

495
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,080
to me. But what was interesting was that I think, you know, and I also see a lot of couples and if

496
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,400
I'm seeing a heterosexual couple and usually the woman will say something to the man like,

497
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,520
I really want to get to know you, I want you to share your inner life with me. I feel like we're

498
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,960
not connected. I can't reach you. And then he like really opens up to her and maybe he starts crying,

499
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,080
maybe starts crying a lot. And she looks at me like a deer in headlights. Like on the one hand,

500
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,240
I didn't feel safe when you weren't sharing with me, but I don't feel safe when you're crying either.

501
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,960
So there's this mixed message that men get. In John's case, he really felt like he had to be

502
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,400
the rock in his family. And I won't sort of get into the details because the reveals in the book,

503
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,360
but he really felt like if he became vulnerable, he showed his pain that the whole house of cards

504
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,320
would fall down. The whole family would collapse because he had to be the strong one. And a lot of

505
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,720
men feel that. And so men will come into therapy and they'll say something to me eventually like,

506
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,160
I've never told anyone this before. And then I sit back and I wait. And what they tell me

507
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,000
feels so mild. And even if they have a good marriage and they have good friends,

508
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,200
they felt like they couldn't tell anyone this. They couldn't be vulnerable with anyone. They

509
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,160
have so much compassion for that. Women will come in and eventually they'll get to that point where

510
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,280
they'll say, never told anyone this before, except for my mother, my sister and my best friend.

511
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,880
So they've told one to three people already, but they feel like they haven't told anyone. And then

512
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,880
the thing that they haven't told anyone, there is something about it that feels like I can see why

513
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,840
they may be, we're a little reluctant to share that feels very, very private. And so I think it's

514
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,400
really hard for men that on the one hand we're, and I'm raising a boy, right? So I think that on

515
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:10,360
the one hand we tell boys at a certain point and we tell men, we want you to be really emotionally

516
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,320
available. We want you to feel your feelings. We want you to have the freedom to feel the way that

517
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:21,480
women do, to feel whatever you feel and for that to be okay. And on the other hand, we don't really,

518
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,880
because we don't really create the space for them. There's a lot of shame around that and we do shame

519
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,360
that. And even in ways like in that couple situation where somebody says, I want you to do

520
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,040
this and then you do it. And then she's like scared because you're crying. Yeah. And I think

521
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,040
the other kind of shame in John's life is the circumstances that get him into your office.

522
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,120
Obviously are not the presenting circumstances. He presents with something quite benign. If I

523
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,160
recall, it was basically sleep disturbance. Yeah. He says he has insomnia and it's because of all the

524
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,440
quote, idiots that are making his life very difficult. But you're absolutely right. I don't

525
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,800
think you get through the end of John's story and it actually happens quite abruptly. So it's sort

526
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:09,560
of two thirds of the book. We're going along with John. I think as readers, assuming there is

527
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:16,520
something lurking beneath the surface that explains this, there's one moment when as you put it,

528
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:23,480
it's breaking down versus breaking open and he fully breaks open in the most unexpected way.

529
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,160
How were you able to control your own emotions there? I don't know how long you'd been seeing

530
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,280
John at that point. I don't think that is clear in the book in terms of real time, but obviously

531
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:42,600
you had just an interpersonal affection for him. How is it for you to see somebody who has had such

532
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:50,360
a shield, has had so much armor, and you are the only person that is now witnessing the complete

533
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:57,800
destruction of that armor such that the real John can come out? Yeah. Well, there were a bunch of

534
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:03,480
misdirects that I think sort of prepared me not for what ultimately comes out, but just felt a lot

535
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,280
of empathy for him. It's revealed very early in the book, so this does not spoil anything, that

536
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,560
his mother had died when he was young. She had been hit by a car and she was a teacher and she

537
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:19,240
was trying to save a student from getting hit by a car and he was six years old and him feeling

538
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,440
like it was sort of his fault because he wanted her to rush home and he missed her and him kind

539
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,480
of carrying the burden of that and not really being able to talk to anybody about that and his

540
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,880
family dealing with the death by like, let's move on, let's move on. And so I felt like I could see

541
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,520
glimpses of him and who he really was and the younger him and the more tender parts of him.

542
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,840
And so when this happened though, I was really blindsided when I found out what was the other

543
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:50,840
piece of it. And I did tear up and he calls me on it. He's like, oh my God, he goes back into his

544
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,560
kind of defended place and makes some kind of sarcastic remark about the fact that I was

545
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:02,200
tearing up because you have very human reactions as a therapist and it was an incredibly sad,

546
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:09,320
tragic, moving story. And I don't think anybody could sit in that room with him and not cry.

547
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,160
I don't know how someone would, you'd have to be a robot and we're not robots.

548
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:20,760
And there's really two pieces to it, Laurie. There's the story, which is sad, but then there's

549
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,520
him. And I actually think of these as two slightly different pieces. I actually find the

550
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:33,240
latter slightly more painful as the reader. And I would guess that as a therapist, you're even more

551
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:39,880
attached to the latter, which is the journey of this guy who has carried the weight of the world

552
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:47,080
on his shoulders, which is his family, his work, his career, his, again, this armor that he's had to

553
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:54,440
wear. And there's now this one moment where it all comes crumbling down and you kind of realize,

554
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,080
well, look, there's some good to this, which is when something breaks so completely,

555
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:04,200
there's actually an opportunity to put it together in a different form, but it's also really messy.

556
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,440
It is. And I think that's going back to what we were talking about at the beginning, the story

557
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:14,040
part of sort of rewriting the story. So he had the story in his head of this is the story and this

558
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,040
is the story that I've been telling myself. And this is why he really can't sleep and what he

559
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:24,920
dreams about and what keeps him up at night. And it's that story that needs some nuance to it.

560
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:32,760
It needs to have another perspective to it. So I think sometimes we get so ossified in the story,

561
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,240
our story becomes so ossified that there's no room for sort of any other interpretation

562
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:45,720
of events. And all roads in his story led to he's a horrible person. And that just wasn't the

563
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:53,400
case. So it was really about how do you manage your remorse? How do you manage regret? And then

564
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,320
how do you also forgive yourself? Which I think is really hard. How do we forgive ourselves? What does

565
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,720
that look like? So much of the time, like in Rita's story, which we can maybe talk about later, but

566
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,920
she has these adult children who are estranged from her, and she really wants their forgiveness.

567
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,880
And they don't want to have anything to do with her. And what I said to her is you need to be the

568
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,640
mother to them now that they need, and not try to get a redo from them and not try to get a pardon

569
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,800
from them. And the person that you need the forgiveness from is yourself, you need to come

570
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,160
to terms with what you did, in order to be the kind of mother that they need now. And I think the same

571
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,040
thing with John, where it's about how do you forgive yourself for being human? What do we do

572
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,000
with that? What is the sentence for this crime? Is it life in prison? Is it the death sentence?

573
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,840
Because basically, a lot of people will give themselves the death sentence, which is basically

574
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,200
they're alive, but they're not living, because they don't feel like they deserve to have any

575
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,760
pleasure, any joy in life. And so they sabotage any joy that might come their way, because

576
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,680
unconsciously, they don't realize that, I mean, subconsciously, they don't realize that what

577
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,880
they're doing is they're making sure that they are punishing themselves, that they are giving

578
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,680
themselves that jail sentence or that death penalty. You actually ask Rita that question

579
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,400
point blank. And I do want to come to Rita. I want to spend a lot of time on her because I think,

580
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,480
again, both her story and John's story, at least through the lens that I look at things,

581
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,520
are so similar. I mean, the extent of self loathing, just the complete and utter lack

582
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,240
of self compassion. I can very much relate to this, by the way, so it's probably not an accident

583
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,960
that those resonate. So let's kind of go back to John a little bit to the notion of,

584
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,160
what does the recovery look like? I mean, I think John's story is also one of the most hopeful

585
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:40,920
stories to me, because he's almost a caricature of a phenotype of a person that you just think

586
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:47,320
is beyond hope, like the narcissistic. Well, I didn't think that. I can see why the reader

587
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,880
would think that. Yeah, absolutely. Right. Like in general, but to your point of how readers

588
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,560
will have in some ways the biggest emotional response to that, because we know how much we

589
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:05,480
judge that phenotype. We know that the sarcastic, snappy, jerk, condescending,

590
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,680
condescending a narcissistic, like that's just not a phenotype that generates much affection.

591
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,680
Right. No, and everyone knows a John. Everyone knows someone. Everybody knows a John.

592
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,440
And not a lot of us walk around. There's not a lot of love loss for the John's.

593
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:24,520
Your story suggests, no, actually, this is not a terminal condition.

594
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,720
Well, right. I mean, I think that people, there's so much room for people to grow and change and

595
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:35,560
transform. And even with Rita, who's about to turn 70, people always say, is it too late when

596
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,120
you live so much of your life this way? It's really never too late. And I think, again,

597
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:45,160
that's what's so hopeful about when people land in my office is that's a triumphant moment that

598
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,720
they got there, they came and they said, I'm ready. They don't know what they're ready for yet,

599
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,240
but they're ready. And when you describe it this way, Lori, coupled with what you said a few

600
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:02,840
minutes ago, it probably does speak to the fact that you, through some connection, were able to

601
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:08,040
get John to keep coming back. And whether it's the fact that you humored his obnoxious behavior with

602
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,280
a cell phone, that you let him order lunch every time he showed up and just act in a certain goofy

603
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:21,400
way was enough to keep him coming back. It's so funny. When I reread your book the second time,

604
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,320
I'm doing it with the highlighter and the post-it notes and stuff. And there's a line that I'm not

605
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,240
going to quote directly because I can't remember it at the second, but it to me is one of the most

606
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,200
profound at the very end of your book, which is, look, change happens very slowly. And then it

607
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,640
happens very quickly. There's something to that effect. Change happens gradually, then suddenly.

608
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:43,720
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. You say it much better than I do. Well, I don't think any story in the book

609
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,000
illustrates that probably more than John's, though I think I can't remember if you were

610
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,840
writing about it yourself or about John. I can't actually recall now that I think about it,

611
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,960
which patient you were more referring to. I mean, I think it refers to all of them because I think

612
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,800
with all of them, I think there's this look at New Year's resolutions or Nike's just do it.

613
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,520
When we say, okay, we're going to just change, sometimes that works in the short term. But if

614
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:09,320
you really want lasting change, there's a chapter in the book called How Humans Change. And it

615
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,280
outlines all the steps that we go through that we're not even aware of in preparation for the

616
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:20,680
change. And so it's a process. The most important step in change is actually not making the change,

617
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,640
but the last step, which is called maintenance. And it's how do you maintain the change? So once

618
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,120
you make the change and you've done like five steps to get to that place of even taking action,

619
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:36,760
the action stuff, and then it's how do you maintain it? And people really misunderstand that step

620
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:43,240
because they think, well, if I go back to my old ways, even once, it's like look at people on diets,

621
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:49,640
they go on a diet and they're like, oh, I ate the cake. So the diet's over. No, it's just that's

622
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,040
part of that stage as maintenance, you're going to go back. It's not going to be linear in that way.

623
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,440
And so people need to know that so that they realize this is just part of the process of change.

624
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,000
And then you could just go back to the change. And yes, you'll screw up again. And that's okay.

625
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:09,560
But I think there's something about getting to that. Like the way I pictured it in these

626
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,160
breakthroughs, especially with Rita and John was the way I would imagine a stone mason working with

627
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,240
a piece of stone, which is you're hitting, you're hitting, you're hitting, you're hitting, you're

628
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:26,360
hitting. There's a thousand strikes and nothing happens. And on the 1000th and first strike,

629
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:31,480
the stone breaks. But the reality of it is it's all the strikes that came before,

630
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,000
but the stone had comes back to, I think what you're saying, which is just getting John and

631
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,120
Rita to show up and having that relationship, even if it felt like in the moment, my God,

632
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:47,640
we're making no progress. This guy is still just as much of a jerk today as he was six months ago.

633
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,360
He's still ordering the salads. He's still making fun of the shoes I'm wearing. He's still doing

634
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,720
all of these things. He's still on the surface. I thought we were making progress. So it's kind

635
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:03,640
of like most big transformations come about from the dozens or even hundreds of tiny,

636
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,680
almost imperceptible steps that we take along the way. So when I would have those, I would have a

637
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:13,880
moment of connection. My goal in every session with John was to have a moment of connection with

638
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:19,560
him every session. And that was going to be laying the groundwork for what these changes were. And

639
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:24,360
if he could connect with me even for a moment and you see it, it's like one little piece of the

640
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:29,080
session where we have a moment of connection, then he immediately gets rid of me every time.

641
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:34,680
He can't tolerate it. That's okay. But we have that moment of connection. And so I know that

642
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:39,160
our relationship is developing. And that's why in that moment when he leaves and doesn't come back,

643
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:44,520
when there's that rupture, I really thought he was not going to come back. I didn't know.

644
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,680
And then the way that played out was kind of interesting. You can see that that was all about

645
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:55,320
the relationship and how I tried to use the glue of the relationship to give him enough space so

646
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:01,240
he wouldn't feel pressured to come back, but to also give him enough of a taste of what we had,

647
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,280
because I know he craved it. He was so incredibly lonely, even though he was surrounded by people

648
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:11,960
and people admired him in his work. He was very well known. He had this family, had these kids.

649
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:19,560
He was the loneliest person because he was just living in his own world and putting this person

650
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:25,160
out there, this false self to kind of maintain things. So he only could really be him in our

651
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:30,520
therapy sessions and he could only do it for maybe two minutes tops. But that's okay. That was enough

652
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,880
to kind of get him to see how liberating that is. I think that's an interesting and important

653
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:41,880
distinction you make that I think I've probably failed to fully appreciate, which is it's that

654
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,080
you had months and months or years and years of two minutes of connection every week.

655
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:53,400
That was actually a linear glue that held, I mean, his respect for you was growing as those

656
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:00,360
connections I suspect were happening. And I mean, there's no way he could have finally got to where

657
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:06,360
he got with you without all of that. And of course, it begs the question, you talk about your therapist,

658
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:11,080
because again, you're one of the patients in here, your therapist, Wendell, who also comes across as

659
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:18,040
the wisest human ever. Never a wasted word comes out of Wendell's mouth, right? It's like,

660
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:23,640
he's so brilliant, he's so wise. But we have no idea if the John Wendell thing would have ever

661
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,440
worked out, right? I mean, did you find yourself thinking those things? Because I know you talk a

662
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,640
lot about how when you're on Wendell's couch, you can't help but think, okay, what would I be doing

663
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,520
here? Were you ever doing the reverse? What would Wendell be doing with John in this situation or

664
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:43,480
with Rita in that situation? Oh, absolutely. The thing about Wendell was that when I came to him,

665
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,360
so I was a relatively new therapist, and he had been doing this for a much longer time. And I was

666
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,360
relatively new because I had had all these other careers. So we weren't that far apart in age,

667
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:58,280
but we were very far apart in experience. And so I learned so much from him, and I would just

668
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,040
steal things from him. I would take his metaphors, I would use them. There was this one that I used,

669
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,280
I still use to this day all the time. I think so many times people come to therapy and they

670
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,640
feel trapped by their circumstances or they say, this person is making it so I can't do this,

671
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,360
or this circumstance makes it so I can't do this. And at one point I was doing that. And he said to

672
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:24,120
me, you remind me of this cartoon, and it's of a prisoner shaking the bars desperately trying to

673
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:30,040
get out. But on the right and the left, it's open, no bars. And so why don't we just walk around the

674
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:35,240
bars? Why is it preferable to us to shake the bars and say, I'm a victim, I can't do this,

675
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:40,840
this isn't available to me. And it's because if we walk around the bars, we're free, but then we

676
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:46,200
have to take responsibility for our own lives. And a lot of us would rather blame other people or

677
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,720
other circumstances for why we can't have happiness or joy or meaning or whatever it is in our lives

678
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,400
than to say, oh, now I'm responsible for that. And if it doesn't work out, that's on me.

679
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,040
You even bring that image into your TED talk. It's one of the images you integrate very

680
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,840
beautifully into that talk. Yeah, yeah, I think it just resonates with people because I think when

681
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,520
you realize, wait a minute, the bars are open, people get, they're both elated and frightened

682
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:18,840
at the same time. Yeah. I want to talk a little bit about suicide as an introduction to Rita.

683
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,120
You write something very interesting in the one of the latter chapters, you write about these two

684
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:31,560
types of suicide. There's the group of people that are depressed because they're thinking is,

685
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:36,040
hey, I once had a really nice life, but then something has gone wrong. Something has gotten

686
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:41,080
in the way of that. It could be the death of a loved one. It could be some horrible circumstance

687
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,400
and there's nothing they have to look forward to. And then the other type is the person who just

688
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,400
feels life is barren. There's nothing to look forward to. And you talk about Rita falling into

689
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:55,640
the second category. How often do you see patients who at one point or another in your relationship

690
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:03,400
with are truly contemplating ending their life? I would say it's not terribly common that it

691
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:09,800
happens, but percentage wise, I would say people can be very depressed. But in terms of really,

692
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,280
so you have to assess for suicide whenever somebody is depressed or whenever somebody brings

693
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,520
it up or you bring it up, right? And you have to bring it up. That's the thing. I think a lot of

694
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:23,240
people feel like I don't want to bring up suicide because that will plant the idea in their head.

695
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:29,160
No, that is so wrong. You see this with teenagers a lot. The parents are so afraid. I don't know. I

696
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,760
don't want to mention anything to my kid. My kid seems really depressed, but I don't want to ask

697
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:39,000
about suicide. Ask about suicide because a lot of times people feel like they can't talk about it

698
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,360
or to relief for them, for someone to give voice to those feelings that they might be having that

699
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:49,000
they feel like they can't share with anyone. So a lot of one of the biggest risk factors,

700
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,320
of course, for suicide is feeling of isolation, this feeling of being completely alone in the

701
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:58,200
world. And if you can't share that, you're really alone in the world. If you're under experiencing

702
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,480
such pain and you can't share it. I think a lot of people that I see, obviously there will be,

703
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,200
sometimes people are very depressed. What I see most of in my practice are sort of like relational

704
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:12,200
issues. And by that, I don't just mean romantic relational issues. I mean, there's something

705
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,640
going on at work or there's something going on with a parent or there's something going on with

706
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:20,760
an adult child or there is something going on with a sibling or their romantic relationship

707
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,720
or the relationship mostly to themselves. So there's usually like the relationship to self,

708
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,680
their life is not going the way that they had expected it to go or something is not working

709
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:36,120
and they don't know what. And I feel like in that sense, therapy is like getting a really good second

710
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:42,120
opinion on your life from somebody who is not in your life. So I think that the value of therapy

711
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:47,000
is that the people in your life, they're too close to the situation. And so if you really want

712
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,440
a good second opinion on your life, go to a therapist who can look at you from the perspective

713
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,840
of not having all that other information yet and being able to see, well, what is going on right

714
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,480
here right now? It's a very different kind of assessment. And I should say, by the way, as we

715
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,240
talk about John's story and read a story and all of this, I should say the book is actually very

716
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:10,680
funny and a lot of people find it and not funny at the expense of patients, but funny in the sense

717
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:16,760
that humans are ridiculous. And I mean that in the most compassionate way, that I think that we

718
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:23,000
as humans, we say one thing and we do another all the time. And I think that's funny, the ways that

719
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,280
we act, the ways that we try to protect ourselves, which actually don't protect us, they make things

720
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:34,280
less safe. The ways that we try to be heard or seen often backfire because we're doing it in a

721
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:39,160
way that ensures that we're not going to be heard or seen, the way that we kind of chase after some

722
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:44,840
kind of meaning or joy is often we're doing the exact thing that will basically guarantee our own

723
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,440
unhappiness, but we don't realize that. And so I think there's something very humorous because

724
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:54,360
it's so relatable that often we self-sabotage in ways that we aren't even aware of and that are so

725
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:01,400
common. So yes, there obviously there are some, I would say, very sad moments in the book, but I

726
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:07,480
think ultimately it's a very sort of inspiring book. And I think that watching these people go

727
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:13,640
through this, I think gives people an idea that maybe they can do that too. Well, I would agree,

728
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:18,760
there are definitely moments in there where you're howling. And a lot of it is, at least for me,

729
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,840
the recognition that I would do that or say that or have done that or said that. And of course,

730
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:29,560
you do something very elegant, which is by bringing yourself in as a peer, not as a superior,

731
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:34,600
like you're very self-deprecating in the right kind of way, I think, which is even just

732
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:41,960
acknowledging your own foibles and just your own. Again, I don't want to give away too much of the

733
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:48,040
book, but just it all starts with a pretty simple premise, right? You and your boyfriend break up.

734
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,040
You just need a couple sessions to get through it, right? I mean, like, what could possibly be going

735
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:56,520
on? You just probably you need like four sessions to get through it, right? That was the thinking.

736
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:02,840
Yeah. When you look back at that, have you ever played the game of what if you and boyfriend

737
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:08,520
didn't break up? What if you and boyfriend are still limping along? You've never met Wendell,

738
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:14,120
you've never gone through this journey. Who is Laurie today? I think a very different person.

739
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:19,160
I think that those moments in life when you feel like, wow, you really didn't want something to

740
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:24,120
happen are often the moments when something really transformative is about to happen.

741
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,800
And so many times I think that that's where we stay with like the safe thing. That's why going

742
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:35,080
back to change, why change is so hard is because we cling to the familiar. We cling to what we know.

743
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:41,480
And so even if you're making a really positive change, sometimes we fight that because we don't

744
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:46,200
like uncertainty. Humans don't like uncertainty. And so we go into this place of I know what I

745
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:51,800
have now. It may not be very good, but at least I know it. And if I do this other thing, I go into

746
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,640
this place where it's like going to a country where you don't speak the language, you don't

747
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:00,360
know a person there, you don't know the customs of the mores and you kind of feel a little bit

748
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:05,240
lost. So at least you'll stay in your country where it's safe, but maybe not what's best for you.

749
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:12,200
Now, going back to Rita, who's I think her story is, as I said now a couple of times, I guess,

750
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,480
probably the one that touched me the most along with John's. You already alluded to this. She

751
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,680
shows up, she's I think just shy of her 70th birthday and she's kind of given you an ultimatum.

752
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,280
What's that ultimatum? And that's a pretty unusual ask of a therapist.

753
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:34,920
Yeah. So Rita is somebody who she's one of the most isolated people that I had ever seen.

754
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:41,400
She has adult children who are estranged from her, who don't talk to her. She has some marriages

755
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,080
that didn't work out. She lives alone in this little apartment. She never really leaves or does

756
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:53,240
anything. She goes and gets pedicures. She tells me only because not that anyone will ever see

757
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:58,600
them, but because that's the only time that someone will touch her. We talk about skin hunger and how

758
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:03,400
important that is, that we need physical touch. And just in the course of a day, I'm not even

759
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,800
talking about romantic touch, but in the course of a day, think about how many times we are touched

760
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:13,000
normally. You hug your friend, hello, you kiss somebody on the cheek, you shake hands with

761
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,600
somebody, you high five them. The barista at Starbucks hands you your latte and you touch hands.

762
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,240
We just are routinely touched during the day in little ways. She was just not touched at all. And

763
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,040
so she would just go get these pedicures. That was the only time she would be touched. She lived with

764
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:35,880
this incredible sense of regret because she did make significant mistakes as a parent, which is

765
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:42,680
why her children were not talking to her. And she also made mistakes in her relationships. And she

766
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,040
felt like she had nothing to live for. And she said, if things don't get better by my 70th

767
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:51,480
birthday, she was 69. She said, then I don't want to live anymore. I wasn't too alarmed by that

768
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,880
because I felt that first of all, she's very clear that she's not going to do that. She wants

769
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,880
something to change. That's why she's here. If she wanted to kill herself, she just would have. And I

770
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,200
did assess for that. But she was very clear that I'm going to give this a year and then we'll see

771
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:09,640
what happens. So I felt like I have some time to kind of see what we can do here. And my main

772
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:15,320
goal with her was to have her join the human race again, was to get her connected somehow in the

773
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:20,520
world. And she did not want to do that in any of the ways that I suggested. It was sort of like

774
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,480
Goldilocks. This idea is to this. This idea is not enough. This one's not, you know, there was

775
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:31,080
nothing that would work. And then through the work that we did together, I think she started to see

776
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:36,920
possibility, even though she wasn't ready to admit it. And when it did happen that things started to

777
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,360
change for her a little bit or could have changed for her. Of course, she sabotaged that right away.

778
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:46,520
She had what we call Cheraphobia, which is Cherro is the Greek word for joy. And phobia,

779
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,400
of course, is fear. And so she had a fear of joy. And a lot of people who grow up in situations

780
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:57,000
where they felt like they were robbed of their joy, a very suspicious joy. They don't trust it.

781
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,960
It's almost like any time her mother who was very kind of distant, any time her mother would

782
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,560
approach her and be sort of like a normal mother, she would get very excited about when she was

783
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,000
young and then the mother would go back to being distant. So her joy would always get taken away.

784
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,680
The other shoe would always drop. So she never trusted joy, connection, those kinds of things.

785
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:20,600
So when that did present to her in her adult life, she did everything she could to ruin it.

786
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:27,160
Which is heartbreaking to watch. It's so painful to watch. It is the slowest,

787
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:32,360
most upsetting train wreck imaginable. And it's a very different experience from the

788
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:40,440
frenetic pace of John's destruction. These are totally different paces of pain.

789
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,960
Well, right. So John would actively

790
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,640
distract and Rita would do it in a very passive way.

791
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:56,440
So this gentleman comes along, Myron, who really seems like a wonderful opportunity for Rita to

792
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,480
enter the final 20 or 30 years of her life, depending on how long she's going to live.

793
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:08,680
He would check all the boxes by any metric. And as you describe it, the extent to which she

794
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:15,960
self-sabotages is something you could only see in a movie. You couldn't imagine a person in real life

795
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:22,120
could go to the lengths to sabotage the way she does. But then there's something that you give

796
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:29,400
us an insight into through Rita. I actually, I would say was one of the two most moving parts

797
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,880
of the book, which is the letter she wrote to Myron, because that's when her shame really comes

798
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:42,360
out. And that's when you understand what maybe even you as the therapist or me as the reader

799
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:51,080
can't fully appreciate is just how she feels about herself. Because she feels that way about herself,

800
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,880
how could she tolerate anybody loving her? Well, how could anyone love her?

801
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:01,400
She basically, it was like warnings on a drug. If you take this drug, here's what you might

802
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:08,360
encounter. She was basically saying, full disclosure, you should know who I am, because

803
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:13,800
you don't know what you're getting into. You don't know the monster that I was. You don't know who I

804
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,880
was. And you're going to find out you're going to learn this. And that's going to be so painful,

805
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,480
because you will leave, you will not want to be with me when you learn this. So I'm going to tell

806
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:26,920
you now so you understand why we can't be together. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'd love

807
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:32,680
for you, if you feel it's reasonable to read part of that letter, because I find it so powerful. But

808
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,440
at the same time, I was like, maybe we should just let the reader read that letter. I'd give this

809
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,920
your call, Lori. What do you think? Sure. I mean, I can read part of it. I think it's pretty long,

810
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:47,480
but do you remember where it is? It's on page 359. Okay. And I'll let you read from it whatever

811
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:53,640
you think conveys the point. But it's a beautiful letter in the sense that she's just so open. And

812
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,280
you can tell like it's sort of her life story. And again, I think it's the fact that she comes

813
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:04,840
into your office and reads this to you. She is opening up to you and reading this letter to you

814
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:10,120
and seeking your advice of, on the one hand, she's basically saying, look, this is a letter I've

815
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:16,120
written to give Myron. But she's also, I think, being more transparent and direct with you

816
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:20,600
through this letter than she'd ever been before. Yeah. I think what she's saying is,

817
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:28,760
can you tolerate me to me? Do you think I'm a monster? So painful to see her do that. And what

818
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,760
I really like about the work that I do, and I think that the reason that readers are responding

819
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:39,640
to these stories in the book is because they're so nuanced like life, they are life. And there's

820
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:46,040
no easy answer. So on the one hand, what she did is reprehensible. And on the other hand,

821
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:51,560
there's so many understandable reasons, even if they're not excusable reasons,

822
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,760
but they're understandable for why she did what she did. And so there are both sides of that. And

823
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:03,640
how do you sort of ethically morally deal with these kinds of issues where you have lots of

824
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,080
feelings about it yourself. And as a parent, I had a lot of feelings about it. You know,

825
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:11,880
I couldn't help but think, wow, what if someone had done that to my child? What would I have done

826
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,520
in that situation? Like you always think like I would get out of there, I would protect my child.

827
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:22,120
Her first husband started drinking and then became an alcoholic and became a very abusive alcoholic

828
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:27,880
to her and to the children. And she did not leave for a lot of reasons that make sense in the context

829
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:33,240
of who she was in her twenties and what her life was like, and in her thirties. But there's both

830
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,880
sides of that. And yet I don't think she's a monster at all, but I can understand why her kids

831
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:44,200
do. So there was both sides of that. I'll come sort of midway into the letter. So she says, what

832
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,600
you don't know, Myron, what even my second and third husbands didn't fully know is that their

833
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:54,200
father, my first husband, Richard, drank. And when he drank, he heard our children, my children,

834
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:59,160
sometimes with words, sometimes with his hands. He would hurt them in ways I can't get myself to

835
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:04,840
write here. Back then I would scream at him to stop pleading and he would yell back at me. And if

836
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:09,000
he was very drunk, he'd hurt me too. And I didn't want the children to see that. So I would stop.

837
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:15,880
You know what I did instead? I would go into the other room. Did you read that Myron? My husband

838
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:21,160
would be hurting my children and I would go in the other room. And I would think about my husband,

839
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:26,040
you are ruining them forever, hurting them beyond repair. And I would know that I was ruining them

840
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:33,000
too. And I would cry and do nothing. So that's part of what she reveals to him. And yet, when

841
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,440
you meet her in the book, and as I met her, she's such a lovely person. And so how do you reconcile

842
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:46,680
that person with the person she is at her core, the person before she became so damaged by her

843
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:51,480
own experiences that she damaged other people because of it. And I think those are the complicated

844
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,400
questions that we ask in life. And maybe they're not as heightened as this situation. But I think

845
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,760
there are ways in which it relates to our lives nonetheless.

846
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:04,360
How many of the patients that you've written about in this book are you still in contact with

847
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,320
through a therapeutic relationship? Right. So one of the things that was really important to me was

848
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,720
when I was choosing the stories for the book that I did not choose anybody that I was currently

849
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,600
seeing. Because even though I was writing about events that maybe took place five years earlier,

850
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,840
I didn't feel like I could see someone and do the work with them and then leave and then write about

851
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:28,360
something that had happened between us. So I did made sure of that. And I also made sure that

852
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:33,320
when I was thinking about who to ask for permission, because I asked everybody for permission,

853
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:38,120
obviously, there were certain stories that I felt I really wanted to tell, but I didn't even ask or

854
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:44,200
include them. Because I felt like in one case, the person always kind of wanted to be my star patient.

855
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,400
Like, do you like me the best kind of like sibling rivalry, which a lot of us feel with our therapist,

856
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,400
I felt that with my therapist to walk through the waiting room on the way out. And I think,

857
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:59,160
oh, he probably likes her better than me. I'm so not a fun session. And she looked like so nice and

858
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:05,000
put together. And so this one patient I felt, by virtue of my asking if I could include the story

859
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,080
in the book that would reinforce that notion, which I didn't think would be really clinically

860
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:14,600
useful for that person. And in another case, there was a person who often would try to please other

861
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,720
people. And I felt like if I asked that person if I could use her story, she would say yes, even if

862
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:25,320
she was not really sure she wanted to say yes. And so I didn't want to put her in that position. So

863
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:30,360
I did not include her story or asked for permission. And so it's interesting, the reaction to the

864
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:35,160
people whose stories I included, because I did not show them the manuscript beforehand, I just got

865
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:40,840
their permissions. And afterward, what they all said to me in different words, was something that

866
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:47,720
moved me so much, which was, I knew that you cared about me when we were doing our work together.

867
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:54,760
But I didn't realize the depth of it, that I would think about them between sessions, I would wonder

868
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:59,800
if I should say this instead of that, when they didn't show up, I thought this, or I worried about

869
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:08,600
this. And it's sort of like, just how much on a human level, they infuse themselves into my life.

870
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,680
And I don't mean that I carry my patients around with me and I don't have a life of my own. But

871
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:18,040
what I mean is that you can't help but be affected by the people that you see. And so I think that

872
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:24,760
they were very, very moved by how strongly I felt about them and how much I thought about them in

873
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:29,960
the context of what was going on between us. Do you have a sense, you talked about this a couple

874
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,880
of times, that obviously your goal is to help people, to get people out the door or leave the

875
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,520
nest in a way. Do you have a sense when someone is at that point and they're leaving your

876
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:43,480
care, at least in that sort of more structured way, what the predictors are of the people who

877
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:48,520
are going to enter that maintenance phase, that fifth and final change of behavior, and be

878
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:54,440
successful, do the work versus people who are going to struggle without the regular support.

879
01:18:54,440 --> 01:19:00,040
I'll be honest with you, I asked this partially through a selfish lens as I sort of try to imagine

880
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:05,240
where, what my therapeutic tale looks like in the relationships I have with my therapists, right?

881
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:10,120
Which is like, when do the crutches come off? When do the training wheels come off? What does the

882
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,360
long tail of this look like in terms of how much support I'll need the rest of my life? Because I

883
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:19,000
do, I probably should have said this at the outset, Laurie, but I think the work that you're doing and

884
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,880
I think the work that anybody who's really involved in the care of emotional health and mental health,

885
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:29,160
I just don't think there's enough of an appreciation in the medical community of how important this is.

886
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:35,000
And I think it's very easy for people to say that trauma surgeons saved my life, because it's very

887
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,520
tangible. You got hit by a car or hit by something and in that moment your life was saved and it's,

888
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,200
you have that tumor and it got cut out and it's the difference between life and death and it's

889
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:49,560
very easy to say that doctor saved my life. But I think when the story of my life is going to be

890
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:55,160
told, the people who are going to have literally saved my life are going to be the people who

891
01:19:55,160 --> 01:20:01,320
helped me with my mental health. And I just, I don't think that can be overstated and I think

892
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,840
that that represents the greatest single opportunity to reduce suffering on this planet,

893
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:12,280
is through this. Absolutely. It's so interesting when you were just making the comparison with

894
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:17,480
physical health and surgery and we both did medical school. And so I think it's interesting that when

895
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,280
you look at the way our culture looks at physical health versus emotional health, first of all,

896
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:26,440
they separate them as if they're not intertwined in some way, which of course they are. But then

897
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:30,840
the other part of it is that if something feels off in your body, something feels not right,

898
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,880
you're having some discomfort. Let's say you're having some discomfort in your chest.

899
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,640
You're probably going to go to a cardiologist before you have a massive heart attack. You're

900
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,480
going to get it checked out. What is this discomfort? I need to get it checked out.

901
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:47,400
If people are having some kind of emotional discomfort, they often will say, well, I have

902
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:52,280
a roof over my head and food on the table and I'm just sort of plugging along and the sadness or

903
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:57,160
this anxiety or these relational difficulties or whatever, this feeling of offness, whatever it is,

904
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:02,040
this feeling of discomfort, it's not that bad. They minimize it. It's like I talk in the book

905
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:06,600
about the hierarchy of pain that we feel like there's this hierarchy of pain and that you

906
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:10,920
compare your pain, like it's like the pain Olympics. And if you don't have like a nine or a 10,

907
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,440
it doesn't matter, but it does. So what happens is people don't go to get it checked out

908
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,840
until it gets really bad. They're having the equivalent of an emotional heart attack.

909
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:26,280
And now they land in my office. And so the problem with that is that first of all,

910
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,320
you've suffered unnecessarily for all of that time that you were feeling the discomfort and you

911
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:37,160
didn't need to. And secondly, it's harder to treat right now because now you're in this crisis phase.

912
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:41,720
And if you would come earlier, we could have dealt with it in a different way and you could have

913
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:46,280
avoided a lot of the suffering. The change would have happened much more easily. Now we're sort of

914
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,360
like digging out of the hole. And there's a third thing I would add to that, Laurie, which is the

915
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:57,160
collateral damage is also worse. So if you're sitting there with a bum knee that you kind of

916
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:03,240
ignore for 10 years too long, it's a tragedy for all the reasons you've described, but it probably

917
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:11,720
hasn't hurt other people as much as if you spend 10 years in depression. So if you spend 10 years

918
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:17,160
as Rita or 10 years, especially as John, it's almost like the more people you're around,

919
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:22,440
the more potential you have for collateral damage as you wait to get to that emotional heart attack.

920
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:28,600
Yes. Yes. Even Charlotte in the book, who is this young woman in her twenties who keeps kind of

921
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,960
hooking up with the wrong guys, including eventually someone from the waiting room,

922
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:35,880
which is very ill-advised. I don't mean they're hooking up in the waiting room, by the way,

923
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,560
we don't have like that kind of exciting office, but they meet in the waiting room,

924
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,640
the collateral damage of all of the sort of destruction around relationships that happens

925
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,800
until she really kind of sees what's going on. And she also has some other issues that she

926
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:52,280
is working out. And so, yeah, I mean, I think that's what happens. And so when you look at

927
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:59,000
how we sort of place value on taking care of our physical health, and then we devalue

928
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,680
our emotional health, we feel like it's like going to yoga. It's like, yeah, maybe I'll go to the gym

929
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,680
or maybe I'll go to yoga or maybe I'll eat. Right. Those are important things, right? They're

930
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:12,680
important. But we don't realize, wait a minute, if you aren't emotionally healthy, you need to

931
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:16,360
actually get help for it. You need to get it checked out. You need the support. So when you

932
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,240
talk about what these endings look like, first of all, it's getting people there is number one,

933
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:26,760
and realizing, no, it's not just like a navel gazing activity for people who have nothing better to do.

934
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:33,000
Our emotional health matters. The other piece of it is that when you're there, I think what I wanted

935
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,040
to really do in the book was to really look at these misconceptions around what therapy is.

936
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:42,920
Because I think a lot of people don't come to therapy because they have a lot of ideas about

937
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:47,240
therapy that just aren't accurate. So one idea that they have is that you go to therapy and you

938
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:51,720
talk about your childhood ad nauseam and you never leave that model of therapy. That's just not what

939
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:57,400
therapy is. It's very much focused in the present. And yes, we will look at maybe how a story from

940
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:04,360
your past is living inside of you and is getting in your way and also what are your blind spots and

941
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,960
those kinds of things. But we really want to see what are you doing in the present so that you can

942
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,800
have a better future. That's how therapy is oriented. And I think the other thing, the other

943
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,480
misconception is that you're going to come to therapy, you're going to download the problem of

944
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,360
the week, you're going to leave, you're going to come back, you're going to download the problem of

945
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:23,320
the week. That's not therapy. We like to say that insight is the booby prize of therapy,

946
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:27,320
meaning you can have all the insight in the world. But if you don't make changes out in the world,

947
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,080
the insight is useless. So if someone comes in and they're like, I got into this argument with

948
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:35,160
my partner and here's what happened and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah about that, right? And then

949
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,760
maybe they have some insight about it, but they leave and they come back the next week and they

950
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:43,880
say, now I understand why I got into that argument with my partner. And I'll say, great, did you do

951
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:49,560
something different? Well, no, but now it's like, well, okay, that's a good first step. But then

952
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:53,560
what are you going to do differently? It's like going to physical therapy. If you go to physical

953
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,520
therapy and you just go and you don't do the exercises at home that you need to do in between,

954
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:03,640
you're not going to improve. Nothing's going to change. It's not going to feel better ultimately.

955
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:08,120
I would even take it one step further, which is the exercises you do in physical therapy or in

956
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:12,920
the gym, even if you're doing them at home are not for the sake of the exercise. It's for the

957
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:19,160
activity of life. So it's like you don't sit there and do the leg extension for the sake of the leg

958
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:23,000
extension. You're doing it so that when you walk up the stairs or down the stairs, you can actually

959
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,360
do that. And I think that's really the point of the therapy, as you said, is it's great to have

960
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:35,000
those insights because I think being able to observe and pause is a great first step. But yeah,

961
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,720
none of it matters if it doesn't translate to the ultimate metric, which is improving the quality of

962
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:46,520
a person's life. And in that sense, like I said, I don't think there is a greater ROI that a person

963
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:52,520
can make than investing in their emotional health because without it, all of the other things don't

964
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:57,480
matter. The good news is these are not mutually exclusive. We should be pursuing them all. But I

965
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:03,880
think a book like yours has done, I think just a great service along with many other wonderful

966
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,880
books that I've talked about over the years in terms of really getting people to think about this

967
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:13,560
through the lens of something that every person would probably benefit from on some level,

968
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:18,840
some more than others. And I know I'm staring at the clock closely because I know we are literally

969
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,280
one minute away from you having to go. And I want to honor that promise to keep you to exactly that

970
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:28,920
time. So I can't thank you enough both for making the time today, Lori, but more importantly, much

971
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,640
more importantly for writing this book. Oh, thank you so much for the conversation. I so enjoyed

972
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:39,240
every minute of it. Lori, again, we'll make sure we link to the TED Talk for folks. Anybody who has

973
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,880
not read the book will obviously link to it all over the place. But in case you missed it, the

974
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:49,400
title is Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. Your podcast, by the time this podcast comes out,

975
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:54,680
people will be able to find your podcast. And remind me, it's Dear Therapists, plural, correct?

976
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:00,280
Yes. Yes. And your column, Dear Therapist, singular, is where you've been writing for

977
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:03,480
some time. Is that at The Atlantic? That's every Monday at The Atlantic, yeah.

978
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:08,920
Great. I think that's a pretty good list of where people can find you and hopefully

979
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:13,720
they're going to become lifelong fans. Well, I welcome the connection with all of the people

980
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:19,160
who connect, however they connect. That's the point of all the work that I do. Thanks so much, Lori.

981
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:24,520
Thank you so much. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're

982
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:29,240
interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that

983
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:34,360
allows us to bring you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our

984
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:39,400
goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of this subscription. Now to that end,

985
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:44,360
membership benefits include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast

986
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,320
show notes that detail every topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode.

987
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:55,160
The word on the street is nobody's show notes rivalties. Monthly AMA episodes or Ask Me

988
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:59,880
Anything episodes, hearing these episodes completely. Access to our private podcast

989
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:04,920
feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiel's like this. The

990
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:09,880
Qualies, which are a super short podcast, typically less than five minutes that we release every

991
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:14,040
Tuesday through Friday, highlighting the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

992
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:19,080
previous episodes of The Drive. This is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without

993
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:24,360
having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone. Steep discounts on products that I

994
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:28,920
believe in, but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse, and a whole bunch of other benefits that

995
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:33,640
we continue to trickle in as time goes on. If you want to learn more and access these member-only
